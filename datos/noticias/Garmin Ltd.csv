This fact should have me running for the hills — pun intended — ahead of my first Fit Hacks outing with a banker.I am the sort of person who delays walking downstairs with a load of laundry until my Fitbit is charged and ready to record. I like to run with kindred, measurement-obsessed spirits, not devil-may-care, laid-back folk like Ms Blessing.This former Goldman Sachs partner is unnervingly nice for a woman described as “banking’s iron lady” by Handelsblatt, the German newspaper. She offers me water and encouragement in equal measure at the startline of the Frankfurt leg of the JPMorgan Corporate Challenge.She is also much, much faster than me. About 100m or so into the 5.6K run, she leaves me in a trail of dust, her blonde ponytail swallowed up at the very front of the 60,000-plus posse dashing through the city centre.After the race, she claims to have no idea of her time or whether she was faster than last year. Hers does not appear among the official race results. “It [the time] is actually not important,” she says. “I love to run.”On Corporate Challenge night, Ms Blessing says, “It’s about the feeling, running through the city with so many people” and the €250,000 raised for a charity that supports sport for young people with disabilities.It is very odd to look down at your wrist for reassurance and find there is nothing thereOn weekend runs in the forest, she says: “I find that I can get my head free, get fresh air . . . And I also think that once in a while challenging yourself physically is good.”Bankers are an ambitious bunch, especially those of Ms Blessing’s rank. I have seen many start out with 5km and progress to ludicrous ultra-marathons in their quest for constant improvement (and bragging rights).Not Blessing. “For me running is just for fun and to relax,” she says.I could say the same, but it would be a lie. Following the race, sitting in Frankfurt’s opera house where the bank’s hospitality was, I attempted to work out how much training I would have to do to come back next year and beat her. I did the run in around 29 minutes. Given how much faster she took off, I am guessing the clock showed well under 25 when she came in.The eagle-eyed among you may have noticed the vagueness of my “around 29 minutes”. In the spirit of learning from Ms Blessing, I decided to run technology-free with no Garmin smartwatch to monitor my heart rate, pace and distance and no iPhone to provide a soundtrack.It is very odd to look down at your wrist for reassurance and find there is nothing there. Odder still to do it five times in the space of a few minutes and be equally surprised each time.Without technology to tell me I was on track, I had to outrun the constant fear of going too slowly. Even though I had lost Ms Blessing early on, and had no hope of catching her, I still had something to play for and a reason to want to finish strong.Unknown to Ms Blessing, this was no ordinary run for me. It was at this race the previous year that I thought I had come to the end of my running adventures. Maybe even the end of my running altogether.I had been struggling with fitness for months, but I thought a race would snap me out of it. Instead, despite setting out at a sedate pace, I could not get through 5.6km without stopping repeatedly.My legs burnt. My breath came in gasps. My heart raced. I was overtaken by people of all shapes and sizes. By the time I crossed the line, at 40 minutes, I was convinced that I just could not run any more, and that even 5K fun runs were out of reach.I laughed it off with colleagues afterwards and vowed to train harder, but I felt like I lost something on those Frankfurt streets.It would take me another few months to work out that going from being marathon fit to barely being able to climb a few flights of stairs is a symptom of more than just laziness. I was severely anaemic.Once I began to right that, joyful running soon followed, but I still felt like I had something to prove in Frankfurt that night last week.I have not totally made peace with not knowing my precise time, but on some level I believe that if I had tracked myself the whole way around I would have been slower. Not knowing how well or how badly I was doing was a powerful motivator to do better.I am still probably going to buy a next generation Apple Watch, and I am seriously tempted by a digital skipping rope, profiled in How to Spend It a few weeks ago.However much I redeemed myself, Patrick still finished the Corporate Challenge a good four minutes ahead of me, even though he started in a crush of thousands and I started at the front. I will take all the help — technological or otherwise — I can get.Our first Runbet challenge ended on Sunday. Since then I have completed a grand total of zero runs, further confirming that without accountability and the prospect of public shaming, I am by nature a lazy person.One hundred and thirty-nine readers pledged $40 and committed to run four times a week — or risk losing your cash. The 99 winners took back their money back, plus a cool $7.74 to spend on whatever your heart desires. If you missed out, or signed up but donated your cash to us, fear not: we plan to launch another challenge in early July.In the meantime, I need to find a way to get my cross-training up to speed. Any runner knows that having a race deadline is a great motivator, but what’s the equivalent for skip rope and push-ups?Some years ago, signing up for a White Collar boxing fight proved to be a huge training catalyst. The prospect of being knocked out in front of 700 people was enough reason stay on schedule. I might have to do this again. So, if you know anyone in the Frankfurt area that wants to punch me in the face, please be in touch.
1;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2018-05-02T14:22:17Z;Garmin shares trot higher on upbeat sales;;Garmin shares jogged higher on Wednesday after the Swiss maker of fitness and personal navigation devices posted upbeat quarterly results that left the company tracking its best one-day gain since November.Shares in the company rose more than 3 per cent to $60.95 after it reported revenue growth of 11 per cent from a year ago to $711m, eclipsing analyst expectations for $669m, according to a Thomson Reuters poll.Auto was the only segment of the business to register a decline, falling 12 per cent year-on-year, while its outdoor products notched the biggest gain up 24 per cent. Meanwhile its fitness segment, which accounts for the largest share of its revenue pie, saw sales grow 20 per cent year-on-year to $166m.“Both the outdoor and fitness segments delivered solid, double digit revenue growth, and we remain confident in our wearable product offerings,” said chief executive Cliff Pemble.Net income fell by nearly half to $129.4m or 68 cents a share, compared with $238.4m or $1.26 a share a year ago. That handily topped analyst expectations for earnings of 56 cents. Moreover, profits in the year ago quarter were boosted by a revaluation of certain Switzerland deferred tax assets.Garmin also said its total operating expenses rose 11 per cent from a year ago but gross margin improved to 60 per cent from 58.1 per cent.The rise of smartphones that use Google Maps and other navigation devices disrupted the company’s traditional navigation business, and fitness trackers like Fitbit and Apple Watch had drummed up competition in the wearable fitness tracker market for Garmin, which had been making the devices since 2003.While Garmin has struck partnerships with BMW to supply infotainment hardware for some of its vehicles, the decline in navigation has seen the company make a deeper push into the high-end wearables market.More recently however, Fitbit sales have sagged, and the company has launched fitness trackers aimed at children and a new smartwatch for women and has launched a new alliance with Google, collaborating on both wearable devices and data for healthcare systems.At the end of last year, Garmin accounted for 5.4 per cent of the wearables market, behind Fitbit, Xiaomi and Apple, which led the market with a 15.3 per cent share, according to research firm International Data Corp.Looking ahead Garmin said it expects full-year earnings of between $3.05 to $3.08 a share, with the top end of its guidance shy of analysts estimates for earnings of as much as $3.22.Garmin shares are up 2 per cent year-to-date.
2;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2017-09-13T00:29:37Z;Apple: wrist taker;The iPhone will account for a greater share of revenues but rivals should beware the Watch;Apple is an $800bn company perched precariously on the fortunes of a single product.So its shares rose on the unveiling of the new iPhone X, with whizzy features such as facial recognition, and then fell when Apple said it would not start to ship until November, limiting sales volumes for the crucial holiday season. Even with that headwind, revenues will benefit from a higher average selling price thanks to Apple pricing its top model at $1,000 and up.The iPhone should rise to about 75 per cent of Apple’s overall revenues in the final quarter of the year, up from 54 per cent in the most recent quarter. The dependence only seems to get greater.And yet companies that compete with Apple in other areas should beware complacency.Apple’s TV streaming box has been a relative flop since it was first released a decade ago and trails rival products from Roku, Google and Amazon, according to data from eMarketer. Still, the possibility that the new box is more compelling could cloud the initial public offering for Roku, due within weeks.More likely is gradual grief for Garmin and Fitbit from the new version of the Apple Watch. Shares in both companies had only modest reactions to the release: Garmin fell 0.3 per cent and Fitbit ended flat on Tuesday.Again, like the TV, the Watch has not yet set the world alight but it is only two years old and each new model, including this one, has obvious improvements.Garmin has performed well in the past few years but its revenues remain below their 2008 peak when drivers were snapping up satellite navigation devices.At that point, iPhones were already being sold but it was not yet clear that smartphones would make Garmin’s signature gadget redundant, as they did.The Watch is on the verge of genuine health monitoring — alerting wearers to irregular heartbeats, for example — and will now enable phone calls, providing a fiercer challenge.Garmin’s watches will be hit as a result, though its diversification into avionics and shipping computers offers some protection. Fitbit lacks those nooks and will suffer more.As for Apple, it claimed that its watch was now the world’s best-selling, surpassing Rolex, with August sales up 50 per cent year on year.If it really wants to instil confidence, it should start to disclose units and revenues, currently buried within an “other products” line. Some estimates put it at about $5.5bn of annual sales, or 2 per cent of overall revenues.By the time of the next iPhone launch, the Watch should be helping the iPhone with the heavy lifting needed to support the world’s most valuable company.

3;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2017-02-22T16:19:08Z;Garmin shares tick higher as earnings top expectations;;Consumer-tech maker Garmin led the S&P 500 on Wednesday after its quarterly results solidly beat Wall Street’s expectations, sending its shares soaring as much as 10 per cent.The Swiss-based company, which makes devices such as fitness trackers and car navigation systems, said that revenue grew 10 per cent during the three-month period ending in December to hit $861m compared to a year earlier, a solid beat over the $109.5m expected by Wall Street analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.For the quarter, net income clocked in at $136.6m, compared to estimates of $109.6m, translating to diluted earnings per share of 72 cents versus expectations of 57 cents.Garmin said it benefitted from a collective 25 per cent gain in four of its five key divisions – outdoor, fitness, marine and aviation products – compared to a year earlier, with those divisions contributing to 74 per cent of its overall quarterly revenue.That helped to offset a 17 per cent decline in revenue from its auto segment during the quarter, which the company attributed to an overall decrease in the market for personal navigation devices. Even as the auto division slumps, Garmin on Wednesday unveiled that it had been selected by carmaker BMW to supply infotainment hardware for some of its vehicles.But a potential boost from the BMW deal may not be enough to boost Garmin’s performance considerably in the coming fiscal year as Garmin said it expects revenue to be flat at $3.02bn in fiscal 2017. The company said that it expected the current growth in the outdoor, fitness, marine and aviation divisions to be offset by “ongoing declines” for personal navigation devices. It also guided for pro forma earnings per share of about $2.65.Garmin chief executive Cliff Pemble described 2016 as a “remarkable year of growth.”“Entering 2017, we see additional growth opportunities ahead, and we are well-positioned to seize those opportunities with a strong lineup of great products,” he added.Garmin shares have risen 34 per cent over the past 12 months as it pushes further into the US wearables market, where it competes with companies like FitBit and Apple. After rising 10 per cent in the wake of its earnings announcement, Garmin pared those gains slightly to trade up about 8.5 per cent at pixel time, still strong enough to make it the S&P 500′s biggest gainer thus far on the day.
4;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2016-09-07T17:49:07Z;Apple unveils new Watch;;The first hardware announcement of Wednesday’s Apple event is a new version of its Watch. “Series 2″ of the Apple Watch has been “completely reengineered”, operating chief Jeff Williams said on stage in San Francisco.The headline feature is that the new version is swim-proof, making it water resistant to depths of 50m. For route tracking of runs, hikes and bike rides without an iPhone, there is also built-in GPS, bringing its features closer to traditional running watches by the likes of Garmin, writes Tim Bradshaw in San Francisco.A new dual-core processor is up to 50 per cent faster, attempting to address the slow performance that was one of most existing Watch owners’ biggest complaints.A new graphic processor is twice as powerful, powering a new brighter display that is easier to read in bright sunlight.The original Apple Watch was unveiled two years ago before going on sale in April last year. The device has met with mixed reviews, and some analysts say that sales fell earlier this year as customers waited for the new model.Apple also announced that the popular Pokemon Go app, which has been downloaded 500m times since its launch earlier this summer, is now coming to Apple Watch.
5;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2016-07-27T21:45:35Z;Garmin jumps after wearables advance;US stocks fluctuate between losses and gains;Garmin was the biggest gainer on the S&P 500 after the company known for its fitness trackers and GPS devices lifted its full-year outlook and reported upbeat second-quarter results, driven by strong demand for its fitness products.Garmin shares listed in New York advanced 11.6 per cent to $51.79 on Wednesday, taking its year-to-date gains to nearly 40 per cent, after the company said it now expects full-year sales of $2.9bn, up from its previous forecast for $2.82bn. That topped analysts’ estimates for $2.84bn.The Swiss company also lifted its earnings outlook for the fiscal year to $2.50 a share, up from its previous outlook for $2.25. That eclipsed expectations for $2.30 a share.The news accompanied better than expected quarterly results. Profits rose to $161m or 85 cents a share, compared with $137.8m or 72 cents a share in the year-ago period. Sales rose 5 per cent to $811.6m.Analysts on Wall Street were looking for earnings of 67 cents a share, on sales of $760.8m.Garmin said its “strengthening position in the wearables market”, where it competes with FitBit and Apple’s smartwatches, helped drive a 34 per cent increase in sales of its fitness devices to $212.9m.The rally in Garmin shares came as US stocks fluctuated between losses and gains.The S&P 500 slid 0.1 per cent to 2,167.04, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was almost flat at 18,475.39 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.5 per cent to 5,141.13.Elsewhere, shares in Akamai Technologies tumbled after the technology company revealed its slowest sales growth since 2009.Akamai said its sales rose 5.8 per cent on a year-on-year basis to $572.1m in the second quarter, missing Wall Street expectations of $575m.That represented a slowdown in sales growth from the 7.8 per cent pace in the first quarter and 13.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015.Net income rose to $73.6m, compared with $67.2m in the same three-month period in 2015. Adjusted earnings per share, which exclude certain items, of 64 cents a share, matched expectations.The cooling in Akamai’s sales growth prompted concerns among some analysts that the company’s largest customers may be accelerating a move to distributing more online media, such as websites, using in-house solutions rather than Akamai’s services.The so-called “do it yourself” trend is “having an accelerated negative impact on Akamai’s top line”, said David Dixon, an analyst at FBR.Mr Dixon added that “management is not pivoting fast enough” towards the information security business that is growing at a much quicker clip.Indeed, the performance and security business logged year-on-year sales growth of 16 per cent in the second quarter compared with a 9 per cent decline in the media delivery unit.Akamai shares tumbled 13 per cent to $50.51, extending the 12-month loss to almost a third.Also in the technology sector, Apple shares jumped 6.5 per cent to $102.95, adding some $33.9bn to the group’s market value, after its chief executive hinted that the company was working to develop new products as iPhone sales slowed.“There is quite a bit that we are doing beyond our current products,” Tim Cook said late on Tuesday as the group unveiled quarterly earnings that narrowly topped estimates.Twitter, meanwhile, plummeted 14.5 per cent to $15.77 after the social media company said it expected sales in the range of $590m to $610m in the current quarter, below estimates for $681.4m.
6;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2016-02-17T21:31:03Z;Kinder Morgan jumps after Buffett boost;S&P 500 energy sector leads the way higher;Kinder Morgan received a boost on Wednesday after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a new stake in the company.Shares in the pipeline operator advanced 10 per cent to $17.18 after Berkshire disclosed a 1.2 per cent stake.Rich Kinder, chairman, is the majority shareholder with an 11 per cent stake.Berkshire owned 26.5m shares worth about $395.9m at the end of December, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.News that Berkshire had taken a stake could boost shares in a company given Mr Buffett’s record for stockpicking.David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management bought 9.4m shares in Kinder, valued at $140.9m in the fourth quarter, a filing last week showed.The company, whose profits fell nearly 70 per cent year-on-year in 2015, announced it had cut its quarterly dividend in December in an effort to conserve cash and maintain its investment-grade rating.Kinder shares have declined nearly 60 per cent since the start of last year.Priceline jumped 11.2 per cent to $1,235.56 after it reported better fourth-quarter profits than expected as gross bookings climbed 13 per cent.The travel booking site, based in Connecticut, said profits had risen to $504m, or $10 a share, in the three months to the end of December, compared with $451m, or $8.56, in the period a year ago, exceeding analysts’ estimates. Sales grew 8.6 per cent to $2bn.“Lower oil prices have contributed to significantly lower airline ticket prices and leave consumers with more discretionary funds,” said Daniel Finnegan, chief financial officer.Fossil shares jumped 28.6 per cent to $44.30 after the US watchmaker said an important measure of sales showed a surprise rise, and that a decline in profit proved shallower than feared.Same-store sales climbed just 1 per cent, easily exceeding the forecast of a 2.4 per cent decline for a company that has been battling competition from the likes of Apple and Fitbit.Fossil, based in Texas, said profits had fallen to $70.4m, or $1.46 a share, from $154.1m, or $3, in the period a year ago.Revenues declined almost 7 per cent to $992.5m. Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of $1.30 a share, on sales of $928m.Garmin climbed 16.6 per cent to $41.06 after reporting stronger profits than expected in the fourth quarter and providing upbeat sales guidance.The Swiss company, which came to fame selling GPS devices but has joined the craze for fitness trackers, said profits had fallen 37 per cent to $132m, or 70 cents a share, ahead of analysts’ forecasts for 48 cents. Sales slid 2.7 per cent to $781m but exceeded estimates.For the full-year, Garmin forecast sales of $2.82bn, ahead of expectations for $2.77bn.US stocks climbed as oil rallied, leaving the S&P 500 energy sector the biggest gainer on the benchmark index with a 2.9 per cent rise.At the close the S&P 500 was 1.7 per cent higher at 1,926.82, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.6 per cent to 16,453.83 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.2 per cent to 4,534.07.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
7;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2016-01-17T17:01:27Z;It’s 9am and your heart rate is 65 bpm;Smartwatches may help to monitor or control lifestyle diseases;The global market for wearable medical devices is growing rapidly. Armed with sensors, devices that capture and transmit physiological data can be embedded in anything from clothing to skin patches. But a more traditional wearable could also play a prominent role in this expanding section of the healthcare market — the wristwatch.When it comes to athletics and fitness training, the sports watch market is well established, with brands such as Garmin, TomTom, Polar and Suunto offering products to help individuals monitor their performance.However, there is also an appetite for wristbands that monitor daily fitness by tracking physical activity, calories burnt and sleep patterns, helping to motivate people to lose weight and improve their health.Seeing the potential, companies are starting to develop timepieces with capabilities similar to those on fitness wristbands. Many entrants to this market are technology companies, rather than watchmakers.The Apple Watch, for example, can monitor activity throughout the day, whether the wearer is in the gym or simply walking upstairs. And, looking more like a traditional digital watch, the Samsung Gear 2 uses an optical heart rate sensor to track the wearer’s physical activity.Luxury watchmakers are eyeing the opportunities. However, many are testing the waters rather than rushing in with fully featured products.Simon Hall at PA Consulting Group cites the TAG Heuer Connected, which is equipped with fitness apps such as RaceChrono Pro and Google Fit. “It’s a very light product and it’s handsome in that it looks more like a traditional watch,” he says.“But it doesn’t do that much. Functionality-wise there’s a big step change between TAG’s Connected and Apple Watch.”Some luxury watchmakers are combining conservatism with innovation by leaving the watch alone and equipping the strap with fitness tracking and other capabilities.“They’re obviously not going to want to build obsolescence into their beautiful handcrafted watches,” says Ben Wood, head of research at analysts CCS Insight. “So you’re going to see the rise of the smart strap.”One example is from Montblanc, known for its handcrafted fountain pens, watches and other luxury goods. Its e-Strap is an interchangeable watch strap that can connect to some smartphones and whose features include a physical activity tracker.This approach means watchmakers can offer traditional consumers the same products while accommodating those looking for digital capabilities — and hedging their bets against a fall in demand for fitness trackers.While the focus on personal fitness is driving change in the watch industry, these devices could play another role — in helping to manage illness. The increase in conditions such as diabetes and congestive heart disease — as well as evidence that remote monitoring can help manage these illnesses — is creating a market for wearable monitoring devices.Much of the innovation is coming from companies that are not in the business of making timepieces. For example, Philips, the lighting, consumer lifestyle and healthcare company, is developing the Philips Health Watch, which measures health biometrics such as heart rate, physical activity and sleep patterns. It says the watch is designed as a medical device to help prevent or control lifestyle diseases.“It’s about making remote monitoring easy,” says Unity Stoakes, president and co-founder of Startup Health, an accelerator and venture capital fund with a global portfolio of early-stage digital health and wellbeing companies.Watches that can track and transmit health indicators could also become powerful tools for running large-scale clinical trials and generating the data needed for policymakers to be able to make informed decisions on public health strategies.However, in contrast to companies such as Philips, which has a large healthcare division, watchmakers have little experience of working in the highly regulated health sector. This will make developing medical-grade devices to be used in clinical trials more difficult.Currently few watchmakers are entering this segment of the health market. However, Mr Hall predicts that regulators may allow some consumer devices to be validated, despite the fact that they are not medical grade.“But instead of trying to validate the whole device, a set of components [related to health] could be validated,” he says.If more non-traditional companies can participate in healthcare markets, watchmakers could start to carve out a bigger share of the market for personal fitness and medical devices — since watches may be more acceptable to consumers.“People don’t want to wear a medical device,” says Mr Stoakes. “It’s about doing something that devices haven’t done in the past — focusing on beautiful design and the consumer experience.”“You’re not always a patient,” says Mr Wood. “You’re first and foremost a person — and lifestyle matters.”
8;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2015-09-21T14:04:08Z;Three smartwatches that perform for the serious athlete;Complex fitness trackers that measure effects of exercise on foot, bike and in the pool;For athletic workouts to be of practical use, you have to know that your fitness level is improving over time. And the only way to know that is to track the improvement.I wrote in a recent column why I thought that the Apple Watch, although a fantastic adjunct to my iPhone, is not yet optimal as a serious fitness watch. It is not waterproof, for starters. It also suffers from the same limitations of all wrist-worn fitness trackers, such as the Fitbit, which use light shone on your veins to measure heart rate: they are wildly inaccurate when you swing your arms during a hard run.For the past couple of months, I have been testing three smartwatches designed specifically for the serious athlete. They use a traditional chest strap heart rate monitor and are not only waterproof, but can measure swimming performance, which is an important requirement for triathletes.The watches I tested were the Garmin Forerunner 920XT, the Polar V800, and the Suunto Sport Ambit 3. All three share several similarities as well as having a few individual quirks.For one thing, they all have GPS chips in the watch, so you don’t need to exercise with a phone strapped to your arm to track your workout in terms of distance and speed.With the Garmin and Suunto watches, that means they feel fairly big, especially if you have slender wrists. The Polar is remarkably compact and made of stainless steel, so it looks more like a standard wristwatch than the other two, which have brightly coloured plastic bodies.All three offer various pods — at extra cost — that you can attach to your trainers or bike’s pedals, to take measurements such as cadence when running on an indoor treadmill, or your pedalling cadence or speed when on the bike.They also have customisable faces, so you can display the particular data you need. For example, I frequently undertake high-intensity interval training, as recommended by the Cardiac Exercise Research Group in Trondheim, Norway, so I like to keep close tabs on my heart rate percentage, time and distance on one screen.These watches can handle some complicated tasks. For example, they can all determine your VO2 maximum (rate of oxygen consumption), which is the gold standard for measuring aerobic fitness.They also have a way of figuring out whether you are fully rested after your most recent workouts or should rest for a day, a topic I plan to return to in my next column.Each watch has an elaborate website where you can see data for your exercise, including heart rate, pace and cadence information. They link with popular web services such as Strava and MapMyRun if you want to share your results.The biggest differences are in measuring swims, and your choice of watch might depend on your aquatic preferences. The Polar is one of only a few watches that can accurately display your heart rate while swimming, and the other two are reasonably good at tracking pool workouts, such as counting laps (I always lose count). The Garmin can measure heart rate, but does not display it until after your swim.Each of the three watches was a fantastic companion on workouts for running, cycling and in the pool. Your own choice would probably depend on whether you use the device for swimming and your tolerance for weight on your wrist.fitexecutive@ft.com
9;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
10;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2015-07-16T16:58:31Z;Garmin runs out of steam amid currency and competitive pressures;US stocks buoyed after Greek government passed austerity measures in bailout progress;Investors soured on GPS and fitness device maker Garmin after the company lowered its full-year earnings guidance, citing currency and competitive pressures in the fitness market.Garmin lowered its full-year earnings guidance to $2.65 a share, from its previous forecast for $3.10 a share. This was below expectations for earnings of $3.06 a share. Garmin maintained its revenue forecast for $2.9bn.The news came alongside preliminary earnings in the range of 70-72 cents a share in the three months to June 27, below analysts’ consensus forecasts for 90 cents a share. Sales in the range of $770m-$775m compared with forecasts for $770.7m.Results were pressured in a “difficult currency environment”, said Cliff Pemble, chief executive. “Additionally, the current competitive environment in the fitness market necessitates more aggressive pricing with higher advertising expenses,” he said.Garmin has come under pressure in recent years with competition from fitness trackers and smartphones that use Google Maps and other navigation applications, prompting it to focus on high-end devices.The company maintained its guidance for 25 per cent growth in its fitness segment for the year.“However, we expect a high degree of scepticism around any type of significant re-acceleration given the level of market competition, in particular from Fitbit and the Apple Watch,” said Simona Jankowski, an analyst at Goldman Sachs.Garmin shares, which are down more than 25 per cent in the past year, fell 7.1 per cent on Thursday to $43.08.Netflix was the best performing stock on the benchmark S&P 500 after the company added 3.28m new subscribers worldwide in the second quarter, to bring its total subscription base to more than 65m.The streaming company behind hit shows such as Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Orange is the New Black added 900,000 US subscribers above forecasts for 600,000. Meanwhile, its overseas members increased by 2.37m, topping estimates for 1.9m new members.The company said profits slid to $26m, or 6 cents a share, but topped Wall Street estimates for 4 cents a share. Meanwhile, sales of $1.64bn were largely in line with forecasts.Netflix shares gained 18 per cent to $115.80.Shares of US paint manufacturer Sherwin-Williams fell 7.4 per cent to $261.23 after the company lowered its full-year guidance and attributed its disappointing second-quarter results to a strong dollar.The Ohio-based company reported second-quarter profits of $350m or $3.70 a share on sales of $3.1bn. This missed expectations for earnings of $3.82 a share on sales of $3.3bn.Full-year earnings were lowered to a range of $10.60-$11 per share and missed forecasts for $11.26.Citigroup shares rose 3.7 per cent to $58.59, after the US’s fourth-largest bank by market value reported second-quarter profits that topped Wall Street estimates.US stocks were buoyed after the Greek parliament passed austerity measures agreed with its international creditors that cleared the way for bailout talks.The S&P 500 climbed 0.8 per cent to 2,124.29, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 18,120.25 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.3 per cent to 5,163.18.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
11;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2015-06-18T16:48:42Z;Fitbit: wearing it well, for now;Tech company offers impressive growth but the rating is stretched;"It is a great time to be a hardware company, especially where buzzwords such as “wearables” are involved. Shares in Fitbit, a maker of wearable fitness devices, leapt 50 per cent on its New York Stock Exchange debut, pushing its market value to more than $6bn. At more than six times sales, its valuation is richer than that of GoPro, the wearable camera maker. Bankers will have the champagne ready.Fitbit’s premium rating might seem justified. It is more profitable; its net income margin (18 per cent) is more than twice GoPro’s. Fitbit is also growing faster. Sales are expected roughly to double this year, according to S&P Capital IQ, while GoPro’s are forecast to rise by a third.But considering the rest of the sector, and the fates of other hardware companies, Fitbit’s value looks inflated. A useful comparator is Garmin, which makes GPS devices including fitness trackers. Founded more than 20 years ago, Garmin occupies a high-end niche among cycling enthusiasts, as well as selling GPS units for boats and cars. But its investors have less to be enthusiastic about; its share price has fallen by 25 per cent in the past year. Garmin will be lucky to grow sales this year, because of falling auto sales. Although fitness device sales are growing, its shares trade at 2.5 times last year’s revenues.Garmin faces some similar challenges to Fitbit. First, the software that came with Garmin’s devices was never as sleek as its hardware. Fitbit has also been working to expand its software offerings. Two-thirds of Fitbit employees are software engineers. Succeeding in this area will be key if Fitbit is to keep growing market share. Second, Garmin’s market has been undercut by cheaper devices (including some from Fitbit) and by smartphones, which are perfectly adequate for tracking runs and bike rides. Both companies face competition from cheaper devices, including a $15 tracker from Xiaomi, as well as from smartphones. The champagne may be flowing now but the fizz will subside.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
12;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2015-04-06T16:14:54Z;US stock rise defies disappointing jobs data;Shares in energy companies follow oil prices higher;US stocks confounded expectations to push higher on Monday in their first trading session following last week’s surprisingly weak jobs data.The report, which was released on Good Friday when US markets were closed, showed the US economy created only 126,000 jobs last month, compared with the median forecast for a 245,000 reading. That is the biggest miss since December 2009.The soft data, coupled with the lofty valuations of many US stocks, had prompted many to brace for a broad sell-off when Wall Street reopened on Monday.Instead the main indices held their grounds. The S&P 500 rose 0.7 per cent to 2,080.62 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.7 per cent to 17,880.85. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite also rose 0.6 per cent to 4,917.32.Among the movers, Garmin fell as much as 4 per cent before paring back losses after analysts at Citi downgraded the stock to “sell” from “buy” and slashed its price target from $68 to $42. The investment bank said the Swiss company, whose portable fitness tracker business has been helping to offset the decline in its traditional GPS device business, would probably miss earnings and sales expectations in its first quarter, as competitors such as Apple and Fitbit muscle in on the fitness space with new offerings.“We now believe competitive pressures are likely to start eroding Garmin’s stronghold in the GPS fitness watch business which generated around 60 per cent of Garmin’s fitness sales last year,” Citi said. By the close of trading on Monday, shares were little changed at $46.71.Shares in uniQure surged more than 47 per cent to $33.61 after the biomedical company struck a deal with pharma heavyweight Bristol-Myers Squibb that values it at nearly $600m. Under the terms of the agreement, Bristol-Myers will, among other things, acquire an initial stake of 4.9 per cent in the company at $33.84 a share in exchange for exclusive access to uniQure’s gene therapy technology.Tesla Motors, whose shares have fallen almost 30 per cent since hitting a high of 286.04 last September, rallied 6 per cent to $203.10 after it reported on Friday a 55 per cent increase in deliveries in the first quarter of this year.Ventas gained 5 per cent to $76.90 after it agreed to buy hospital operator Ardent Medical Services for $1.75bn in cash. Ventas said the deal would bring 14 hospitals into its portfolio, which it believes will increase its normalised funds from operations by 8 to 10 cents a share in the first year after the purchase closes.Shares in energy companies followed oil prices higher. Both Brent and WTI were up more than 5 per cent on Monday after Saudi Arabia increased prices on the oil it sells in Asia, a decision that signals rising demand in the region. Transocean led the gains, advancing 10 per cent to $16.51. It was followed by Halliburton, which rose 4 per cent to $45.88 and ConocoPhillips, up 4 per cent at $65.39. The S&P 500 energy index gained 2 per cent.
13;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2015-04-01T23:09:44Z;Tech boom makes April Fools of us all;;April Fools’ Day has become a grand tradition in the tech world, with Google in particular pulling out all the stops to show how they don’t take themselves too seriously, no really haha.But this is 2015, a time of self-driving cars, kickable robots, interplanetary internets and a Cambrian explosion of connected devices. It’s getting tricky for us poor journalists to separate reality from science fiction at the best of times.So forgive us if some of us were left a little confused when some of this year’s April Fools were just too close to call.When Amazon announced its Dash Button on March 31 – a small, stick-anywhere button which allows Prime customers to order a refill of daily consumables such as toilet roll, washing powder or moisturiser – several outlets had to reassure readers that it wasn’t an early April Fool. But the internet-of-things idea is real (or at least, as real as any of Amazon’s experimental “invite only” products are).Nokia emailed reporters a well-flagged press release about “HERE Kitty”, its mapping and location division’s “wearable to track the location of your pet”, complete with quote from an analyst attesting to its “‘feline-first’ strategy which is building on this hot market and target segment”.This sounds like a joke, except that there are already several GPS-enabled pet collars on the market, including products costing $100 or more from established companies such as Garmin and start-up Whistle (which styles itself as “Fitbit for dogs”).Tesla took a swipe at impending competition from Apple with its “announcement” of the “Model W”:“As many in the media predicted, it’s a watch. That’s what the “W” stands for. … Studies have shown the Model W will dramatically improve your health. If you work out. … This is in no way a competitive response to what some other company is doing.”Some doubters still maintain that reports in the FT and elsewhere that Apple is working on an electric car – resembling a minivan, no less – are a joke (really, it isn’t). But alas some traders, perhaps of the algorithmic variety, thought that Tesla’s Model W was real: its share price jumped in a late-afternoon spike in trading volume, just as its parody blog posted.Tesla's April fool actually moved its stock a bit, see late spike in volume https://t.co/9ko5s8P1W1 h/t @zzbar $TSLA pic.twitter.com/MrD4RfGZGhTweets from Tesla chief Elon Musk habitually move the market anyway. His promise on Monday of a “major new product line”, which briefly added hundreds of millions of dollars to Tesla’s market capitalisation, may have made traders particularly trigger happy.Facebook, however, wins April Fools’ Day 2015 with the launch of Riff, “a creative tool to make videos with friends”. At first glance, it looks a lot like yet another attempt to compete with Snapchat, whose “Shared Stories” also involve combining short videos from a group of people at the same event.The blogpost even referenced “#AprilFools” (a suggested topic for a shared video) and its creator, Josh Miller teased of his team’s “after-hours” project:Finally, there isn't a grand vision or jaw dropping product thesis here. Really just wanted to make something that makes people laugh.What could be more tragicomic than Facebook first trying and failing to beat Snapchat with the now-retired Poke, then trying and failing to buy the company for $3bn, then trying and failing to beat it again with Slingshot (now plummeting out of sight down the app store charts) and then trying again with Riff?Nonetheless, a Facebook spokesperson confirms that Riff is not an April Fool and is, indeed, real.As usual, Taylor Swift had the right idea:For the next 24 hours, TRUST NO ONE. *locks self in kitchen cabinet*
14;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2014-08-25T14:58:09Z;Two wheels and lots of tech;Cyclists are among the most fervent users of devices and apps to track their performance;Many weekend athletes have taken advantage of the latest advances in technology to transform themselves into what has become known as “the quantified self”.Some people dispute whether recording reams of data about your levels of activity really is beneficial to your health or sport. But you’ll get no argument from cyclists, who are among the most fervent users of technology in tracking their rides.As I am still a novice cyclist, I turned for advice to Kirschen Seah, an ebullient Singaporean native who now lives in Chicago. Not only is Ms Seah a cycling enthusiast (she has five bicycles), but she makes her living writing software, so she knows tech inside out.For cycling races, Ms Seah rides a Cannondale Synapse, a very lightweight bike made of carbon material. It is in competitions that she has the greatest need to keep track of all her data.Ms Seah uses a Garmin Edge 500 cycling computer mounted on the handlebars of her racing bike. This $200 gadget records such things as your bike speed, pedalling RPM, distance, time, calories burnt and altitude, as well as wirelessly keeping track of your heart rate if you also use a chest strap. It has a barometric altimeter to record changes in your elevation – all-important for those long hill climbs.The computer works by installing magnets on your pedals and front wheel. When you program in the size of your tyre, the computer is able to figure out how fast you are pedalling and how fast the bike is going.If you can afford it, Ms Seah also recommends a power meter such as the $600 Powertap G3. This is a small computer contained in the rear hub of your bike, giving you an accurate reading of your output in watts.Ms Seah says this really helps you know how hard to train by telling you essentially how much muscle strength you have used and how much more you need to climb that hill or sprint along that straight.If you do not want to spend all that money, Ms Seah recommends an iPhone app called Cyclemeter. This provides the same basic information as the Garmin bike computer, but instead sends it to your iPhone, which has to be mounted on your handlebars.The app tracks 25 different riding statistics and has dramatic graphs and maps you can transfer from your phone to your iPad. One drawback of using the phone, she says, is that GPS tracking really eats up battery life.One way to conserve power is to use a device called a Wahoo Rflkt, a $130 small bike display that you can mount on your handlebars. It will show you basic data like speed while allowing you to put your phone in a backpack, running Cyclemeter in the background and thereby using less power.Ms Seah also recommends MapMyRide, an app and website that allows you to find routes where other cyclists have tended to ride in the past, which can be great when you are in an unfamiliar locale.Another must-have app is Bike Repair, which for $3.99 contains step-by-step directions for tweaking the gear shift mechanism if you have a breakdown on the road and happen to carry a small tool kit. It lists many types of brakes and can get you back on the bike in a short time.Although not limited to cyclists, Ms Seah also praises an app called Lose It! – which helps you to track meal consumption and exercise and then figure out how many calories you have eaten during the day.“It tells me, OK, I have to earn so many calories riding to be able to eat that cup of ice cream,” she says.
15;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2014-07-09T16:40:57Z;Chipotle extends hot streak;;Chipotle Mexican Grill, the restaurant chain that has developed a fervent following across the US, climbed on Wednesday after brokerage Wunderlich Securities said recent price hikes by the chain have not blunted sales.Wunderlich analyst Robert Derrington said traffic trends were little changed by an average 5.5 per cent increase to prices, sending shares 3 per cent higher to $604.11.Mr Derrington now expects the company to report same-store sales growth of 11 per cent in the second quarter, compared to an earlier 8 per cent forecast.“Operators in various geographies we recently spoke with mentioned little if any pushback from customers, perhaps aided by the fact that the company hadn’t raised prices in almost three years,” Mr Derrington said.The restaurant chain, which began increasing prices in April, has likely completed the roll out across its 1,600 locations, he added.Chipotle executives blamed rising food inflation for the need to increase prices, including a 25 per cent jump in beef costs in April from the end of 2013.Wunderlich lifted its price target on Chipotle to $560 from $542 and reiterated its hold rating.The company’s shares, which have advanced 12 per cent since the year’s start, have outperformed much of the fast food sector, including those of McDonald’s, Yum Brands and Domino’s Pizza. Chipotle has mapped out an aggressive expansion over the current year, expecting to open as many as 195 new restaurants.Since the year’s start, the Russell 3000 restaurant index – which includes the largest US restaurants and holds a market capitalisation totalling $286bn – has risen 3 per cent.Garmin shares led the declines on the benchmark S&P 500 after Pacific Crest Securities lowered its rating to underperform from sector perform as inventory of its new vivofit fitness band accumulates.Analysts with Pacific Crest said Wall Street sales expectations for the fitness band were overestimated and a new, larger iPhone could weigh on sales of Garmin’s personal navigation devices.“We have concerns about the underlying strength of the outdoor and fitness businesses, which contribute over half of the company’s operating profit and are critical, in our view,” analyst Brad Erickson said.Garmin shares fell 5 per cent to $57.23 while Telenav slid 2 per cent to $5.47.Shares of Alcoa jumped 6 per cent to $15.67 after the metal mining company turned a profit following two straight quarters of losses.Profits in the quarter to June 30 were $138m, or 12 cents a share, compared with a loss of $119m a year earlier. Sales were little changed from a year earlier at $5.8bn.Alcoa’s results come two weeks after it agreed to buy UK-based Firth Rixson, a maker of aeroplane engine and landing gear components, as the US company seeks to expand its divisions behind everything from aerofoils used in jet engines and sheets used in the auto industry.American Airlines, the world’s largest airline, was buoyed on Wednesday after the company said it expected second quarter passenger revenue per available seat mile, a key industry metric, to rise between 5.5 per cent and 6.5 per cent from a year earlier.The forecast followed a profit warning on Tuesday from Air France-KLM, which weighed on the airline sector.Shares of American Airlines advanced 4 per cent to $41.96 while rival Delta inched 1 per cent higher to $36.94.Container Store shares slid 9 per cent to $24.72, touching the lowest level since they began trading last November, after the retailer said sales in the three months to May 31 missed Wall Street forecasts.“Consistent with so many of our fellow retailers, we are experiencing a retail ‘funk’,” chief executive Kip Tindell said, referring to a 0.8 per cent decline in same-store sales.Overall, US equities snapped a two day losing streak ahead of and following the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s June policy meeting.The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent to 1,972.83 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.5 per cent to 16,985.61.

16;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2014-03-26T21:04:20Z;Calvin Klein owner zips higher on forecast;Few risers as US equity investors seek inspiration;PVH had its biggest surge in nearly six months on Wednesday as executives of the American clothing company forecast improved earnings in the second half of the year as it reinvests in its recently acquired Calvin Klein jeans brand.PVH climbed 6 per cent to $124.50 after the company, which also owns the Tommy Hilfiger, Van Heusen and Warner’s brands, said it was increasing spending by $25m in the first half of 2014 to improve sourcing and design of its jeans business, which would begin to show dividends later in the year and into 2015. The shares closed at $121.43, up 3.6 per cent.Executives said the results were expected to lift earnings by 15 per cent next year, as well as boost Calvin Klein sales by 6 to 8 per cent.For the fourth quarter, the company swung to a net loss of $37.5m, or 46 cents per diluted share, compared to a profit of $80.7m a year earlier.The period included $99m in restructuring costs tied to its Warnaco acquisition, which was completed in 2013, and brought the Calvin Klein jeans and underwear business into the apparel maker’s portfolio.Sales rose 25 per cent to $2.1bn, roughly in line with Wall Street expectations.“Fourth-quarter results were better than feared, and while the first quarter is likely to be difficult, the business is hanging in better than we would have expected,” Goldman Sachs analyst Lindsay Drucker Mann said. “More importantly, PVH’s commentary on the forward order book was very positive.”Garmin shares rose to their highest level in nearly six years, climbing 1.65 per cent to $55.36, on a broker upgrade.Analysts at Citigroup lifted their rating on the company to buy from neutral on the view sales of its vívofit fitness wristbands could double in 2015 to $220m.“We believe Garmin can become a top two player in the activity monitor market over the next six months – vívofit is the only wrist-based activity monitor with a 1+ year battery life, and it is reasonably priced,” Citi’s Jeremy David said.Five Below, the US teen retailer, climbed at its fastest pace since last September after forecasting stronger than anticipated full-year profits as it aggressively opens new stores.The retailer, which will expand its store base by 20 per cent this year, said full-year earnings would range between 85 cents and 88 cents a share, ahead of Wall Street forecasts for 66 cents.Sales in the fourth quarter rose 22 per cent to $212m, while profits advanced 29 per cent to $25m, or 45 cents per diluted share.Shares in Five Below rose 11.4 per cent to $42.34.International Game Technology slid 8 per cent to $13.42, its lowest level in more than a year, after the company lowered its earnings forecasts and said it would lay off staff in an effort to lift profits. The shares closed at $13.62.The slot machine maker will reduce its workforce by 7 per cent to boost earnings by $30m this year.International Game Technology said full-year earnings would be in a range of $1.00 to $1.10 per share, as much as 28 per cent below earlier guidance.“We did not expect such a sharp decline in North American gross gaming revenues, or further degradation in the international currency, compliance, and importation environment,” chief executive Patti Hart said.Panera shares fell 8.5 per cent to $170.05 after the company’s management declined to give 2015 earnings guidance at the company’s investor day, citing “choppy earnings growth in the near and medium term”.The US restaurant chain blamed recent investment initiatives, including the launch of smaller cafés in malls, universities and urban markets, for its decision.Overall, US equity markets drifted for the sixth consecutive day, as separate reports showed rising orders for durable goods as well as improvements in the country’s service sector.The S&P 500 fell 0.7 per cent to 1,852.56 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.6 per cent to 16,268.99. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 1.43 per cent to 4,173.58, weighed down by weakness in Facebook shares.
17;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2014-02-19T18:10:04Z;Eli Lilly jumps after cancer drug trial;;Shares in Eli Lilly climbed after the US pharmaceuticals group said a study of a lung cancer treatment increased survival rates in patients, meeting the study’s primary goals.The drug, ramucirumab, is a human, receptor-targeted antibody that seeks to restrict the process by which blood vessels supply blood to tumours.The phase three trial of patients with second-line, non-small cell lung cancer compared outcomes of those treated with ramucirumab-plus-docetaxel to a group of patients who had a placebo-plus-docetaxel.Analysts at Credit Suisse have estimated the market for ramucirumab could top $800m per year by 2020, or 4 per cent of Eli Lilly’s overall sales.The company gained access to ramucirumab through its $6.5bn acquisition of ImClone Systems in 2008.Two separate phase three trials of the drug have been successful, although both were tested in patients with gastric cancer.Lilly expects top-line results for phase three trials of ramucirumab in liver and colon cancer later this year.Shares in Lilly rose 5.1 per cent to close at $58.07.Actavis shares rose more than 5 per cent to touch a new record high of $212.57, before closing at $211.15, following the upgrade from neutral to buy by investment bank Goldman Sachs.Analysts at Goldman said the acquisitive Dublin-based company would see a “substantial” sales and profit improvement if it is able to complete its $25bn buyout of New York’s Forest Laboratories.“Blurring the distinction between speciality/generics and large-cap pharma, we see Actavis transforming from a speciality/generic business to a full-fledged pharma company with an equal balance of brands and generics,” analyst Jami Rubin said.Wednesday’s gain added to the company’s 5 per cent advance a day earlier.Garmin shares surged to their highest level since 2008 after the maker of navigation equipment forecast sales for the year would be above Wall Street expectations.The Swiss group said it expected revenues between $2.6bn and $2.7bn in 2014, with earnings of $2.50 to $2.60 a share.“Garmin typically guides conservatively at the beginning of the year so we think the company must be feeling very good about its business,” Wells Fargo analyst Andrew Spinola said.Profits rose 27 per cent from a year earlier in the fourth quarter to $164m, or 83 cents per diluted share, buoyed by sales growth in its fitness, aviation and marine units.Overall sales fell 1 per cent in the period to $760m as Garmin’s auto and mobile business continued to see intense competition from free offerings by Apple and Google.Shares increased 9.56 per cent to end at $51.68.Apparel and shoe manufacturer Columbia Sportswear hit a new record high after chief executive Tim Boyle said the company expected to see “renewed growth” in its wholesale business after market close on Tuesday.The owner of the Columbia and Sorel brands said net sales would grow 15 to 17 per cent over the coming year, driven by its new Chinese joint venture, as well as gains in its direct-to-consumer and wholesale businesses.Columbia shares jumped 12 per cent to $88.25 before falling back to close at $84.16.Private equity firm Carlyle Group reported economic net income more than tripled in the fourth quarter.Revenues rose 117 per cent from a year earlier to $1.6bn while economic net income, a measure that includes unrealised gains, increased to $520m, or $1.64 per share. Analysts had expected economic net income of 91 cents a share.Assets under management rose by nearly $4bn from a quarter earlier to $188.8bn.Carlyle shares initially rose 4 per cent before closing off 1.3 per cent at $35.00.Overall, US equity markets broadly drifted on the day, as investors digested weaker-than-anticipated housing figures in January.The benchmark S&P 500 was 0.65 per cent lower at 1,828.75 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed at 16,040.56. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.82 per cent to end at 4,237.95.
18;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2013-12-05T16:37:13Z;Gadget gifts that are not just for Christmas;;"With the holiday shopping season truly under way, this is the second of a two-part guide to some must-have gadgets with lasting appeal. This section focuses on devices that are mainly for use while out and about, along with a miscellany of some personal favourites.SmartphonesThese top more wish lists than any other gadget as they are both fashion statements and productivity tools.For me, Samsung’s Galaxy S4 is the best, with its big screen, powerful processor and digital photo capabilities. Best of all, but not uniquely, users can access a trove of apps to customise features to mould it to their needs.Apple’s iPhone 5s is a close second, and it is true that the slimmer iPhone is more comfortable to hold and Apple’s curated App Store represents a better experience. If brand is not an overriding factor, decent alternatives include Google’s Nexus 5.CamerasDSLRs, with big digital sensors and interchangeable lenses, represent the pinnacle of digital photography. For the ambitious amateur, two stand out: Canon’s EOS 70D and Nikon’s D7100. Both can deliver outstanding images, but neither is cheap. Sony’s Alpha SLT-A77 is an affordable alternative that still delivers.Not everyone wants a camera with changeable lenses. “Ultra zoom” cameras with extreme zoom lenses are a good alternative. My favourites are Canon’s SX510 and Panasonic’s Lumix DMC FZ70, which has a bigger sensor and boasts the longest zoom (60x) available, making it great for wildlife shots and sporting events.Among action camcorders for enthusiasts of outdoor activities such as cycling, surfing and snowboarding, JVC’s Adixxion 2 is rugged and waterproof with built-in WiFi; a good alternative is the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition.Wearable techFast becoming one of the hottest consumer electronics categories, wearable tech ranges from cameras, such as the Looxcie 3, that you wear around your neck or clipped to a breast pocket in what I call “first-person video”, to smartwatches and fitness and personal healthcare devices.Among the newest smartwatches, I like Samsung’s Galaxy Gear, which has a built-in wrist camera and works with a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 or Note 10.1 (2014 edition) tablet.

19;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2013-02-20T22:09:05Z;US equities sell off after FOMC minutes;;Disappointing US housing data and weaker-than-expected results fromthe largest luxury homebuilder drove down stocks in the sector while broader markets sold off after the release of the FOMC minutes.Main indices fell sharply giving up some of the recent gains after reaching fresh multiyear highs during the previous session.The minutes from the FOMC meeting revealed that “many” officials were concerned about the costs and risks of further asset purchases, as the Fed buys securities at a pace of $85bn a month.Markets which started the day lower, sold off after the release of the minutes with the benchmark S&P 500 index closing down 1.2 per cent at 1,511.95.Energy and materials stocks were the worst hit while all main sectors finished in negative territory.January housing starts in the US fell sharply to below the consensus forecast, damping the mood among investors betting on the housing recovery.But the sharp drop was not as bad as the headline number suggested, said Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors.“Starts were hugely elevated in December – likely because of the much warmer than usual early winter weather,” added Mr Shepherdson. “A correction in January was always on the cards.”The S&P 500 homebuilder index lost 6.5 per cent as Toll Brothers shares fell 9 per cent to $33.56 after the company’s fourth-quarter results missed Wall Street’s expectations – even though it swung back to profit on the back of an improving housing market.New orders jumped 49 per cent to 973 homes but the average selling price for those properties fell 7.5 per cent to $631,000 from the same quarter a year ago, depressing margins and profits.Elsewhere in the sector, DR Horton fell 5.9 per cent to $21.92, PulteGroup lost 6.8 per cent to $18.60 and Lennar Corporation dropped 6.8 per cent to $37.18.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.8 per cent lower at 13,927.54.“The seven-week rally, while rare in the history of stock markets, has been one of the weakest,” said Burt White, chief investment officer at LPL Financial.“Markets have been driven higher by bulls buying defensive stocks, such as consumer staples, rather than riskier cyclicals, while the S&P 500 has been trading in a narrow range for the past few weeks,” he added. “At this point, markets are overheated and we are due for a healthy correction.”Among materials, Newmont Mining shares fell 5.4 per cent to $40.56 while Freeport-McMoRan Copper shed 5.9 per cent to $32.22.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.5 per cent to 3,164.41.Apple shares fell 2.4 per cent to $452.83 after Foxconn, which manufactures its products such as the iPhone and iPad, imposed a hiring freeze across most of its factories in China as it slows production of these devices.Apple shares are down more than 15 per cent since the start of the year.Shares in Tesla Motors, manufacturer of electric cars, fell sharply in after-hours trading as fourth-quarter losses were worse than expected. The company expects to be profitable in the first quarter of 2013. Shares dropped 8 per cent to $35.86 in extended hours trading.In earnings news, Garmin shares plunged after the GPS manufacturer’s fourth-quarter results fell short of expectations.The company’s fiscal 2013 earnings forecast also disappointed investors. Its shares fell 9.4 per cent to $35.54.Life Technologies shares were hit after Reuters reported that the $11bn sale of the biotechnology company looked less likely as the recent run-up in the share price made it less attractive to potential buyer Thermo Fisher Scientific and buyout firms.Its shares fell 8.4 per cent to $58.05 but remain 18.4 per cent higher since the start of the year when it announced that it had hired investment banks to advise it on its annual strategic review, buoying investor hopes of a sale.
20;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2010-12-06T00:06:25Z;New direction: satnav comes to mobile devices;;Location, location, location – the three golden rules for house buying – has also become the obsession of technology companies selling us gadgets and services.Satellite navigation, commonplace in car dashboards, is now embedded in our smartphones and jacket pockets.GPS is being used not just to tell us where to go, but also to pinpoint where we are for marketing purposes.A colleague in San Francisco picked up a free pair of jeans at the local Gap this month in a Facebook deal offered to users who “checked in” at the store using GPS and Facebook’s mobile phone app.My Android smartphone has become my satnav whenever I rent a car. The Google car navigation app allows me to speak where I want to go and shows a Google map with spoken directions, just like any normal satnav system. I can also add layers to the maps, such as satellite pictures and traffic conditions. When I arrive at my destination – my home, for example – the app zooms into Street View and I am greeted by an image of my garage mirroring the one that is, in reality, in front of me.Nokia’s latest smartphones also have free turn-by-turn navigation and are hard to beat in their global reach. On the latest N8 smartphone I tested, I was offered spoken directions in every language from Afrikaans and Basque to Urdu and Vietnamese.The Ovi Maps app also comes with free location-aware Lonely Planet and Michelin guides as well as local weather forecasts, data such as movie times, and Trip Advisor in the US, which reveals places to see, eat and stay.Nokia also grabs anonymous user data on drivers’ positions to calculate traffic speeds and offer information on congestion.With phones offering such strong competition, the makers of personal navigation devices are resetting their product compasses.Garmin has taken on the handset makers with its own Garminfone a handset that is a navigation device first and foremost but also incorporates an Android-powered smartphone complete with camera.Garmin also melds its service with Google features such as Street View and Voice Search, and includes a car-mount kit that usually comes as an extra with other phones. There are services such as local fuel prices and flight status updates, and a Voice Studio feature that allows you to change the navigation voice to that of a friend or family member.The latest TomTom devices released in the US focus on the driving experience. On the TomTom Go 2405, many improvements were noticeable over the built-in satnav in my six-year-old Toyota Prius. However, the car-mount against the windscreen and the power cable trailing to the cigarette lighter were not the most elegant of solutions.But I liked the way it was able to pronounce street names and could figure out which lane I needed to be in at complicated highway intersections. Filling stations and points of interest showed up in timely fashion on the 3D view of the road ahead and the display told me my speed and the local speed limit, showing this information in red when I was going too fast. Putting in directions to my downtown office brought up a list of the nearest parking garages, anticipating where I would choose to park.Tablet computing could pose another threat to personal navigation devices. Samsung’s new Galaxy Tab has a much bigger display area with its 7in screen and has a car-mount accessory as an optional extra. Navigation is provided by Google’s Android 2.2, and Samsung encourages usage of the Layar app for an augmented reality experience.Using the device’s camera, I was able to pan around while walking and see icons appear on screen pointing out restaurants, stores and other places of interest ahead, with a circular radar icon at the top showing their direction and proximity.It was an interesting experience, until walking and holding up the large tablet screen in front of me meant I failed to spot a fire hydrant just below its vision, with unfortunate consequences.
21;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2010-10-26T15:15:20Z;Garmin and Asus change course on smartphones;;Six phone models and 20 months after they joined forces, the smartphone alliance between Asus, the Taiwanese computer maker, and Garmin, the US global positioning device company, is over – at least in its original form.The two companies on Tuesday announced a new mode of cooperation. Instead of jointly developing Garmin Asus branded phones, Garmin will now only provide its navigation software to Asus, on an exclusive basis for the Android platform. Phones from the Taiwanese company, the world’s fifth-biggest PC maker, will from now on be Asus-branded in front, with a “Garmin Navigation” logo on the back.At first glance this may seem like a simple branding and marketing change, but in fact its implications go much further. Firstly, it frees up Garmin to offer its navigation app on Apple’s and Blackberry’s app stores to compete with rivals Tom Tom and Magellan, who both already have a presence on iPhones with apps that sell for $49.99 in the US.Secondly, it gives Asus greater room to broaden the consumer appeal of its smartphones to beyond just location services/navigation phones. Benson Lin, general manager of Asus’s mobile devices unit, said Asus will still aim to be “the best in-car-usage brand” for smartphones, but the company was now also considering making phones with 3D capabilities and those optimised for gaming.Asus phones, Mr Lin maintains, will continue to have better navigation services than rivals because the company has integrated various features, such as voice searching and multi-tasking, which allows the phone to handle incoming calls while navigating, that make the whole experience easier and more enjoyable. For other phones, “all you can download is the map, which just gives you navigation services”.Mr Lin argues that the move is a positive for both companies, but ultimately it is an acknowledgment that the old model never really worked out as planned. The Garmin Asus phones, as a newcomer, were far from achieving the kinds of volume enjoyed by iPhones and Blackberries in the US, where Garmin is a well-recognised brand. This meant Garmin had to sit by while Tom Tom and Magellan gained a presence on the iPhone, while Android and Nokia phone users became accustomed to just using Google and Nokia’s built-in map and navigation services.In China and other emerging markets, where Asus is well-known and wants to expand from netbooks to smartphones, Garmin is a relatively unknown brand and, in fact, often GPS-based services are unavailable in those countries.Mr Lin stopped short of admitting that location-based services have not been big draw for consumers, but said Asus still “needs to educated customers. This takes time and is costly.”
22;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2010-10-19T15:15:17Z;Aircraft manufacturers go big on numbers;;"The pace of competition between the makers of business aviation’s heaviest metal is hotting up. With the market for large business jets holding up much better in the downturn than that for smaller aircraft, three leading manufacturers unveiled new developments around the US National Business Aviation Association’s annual convention in Atlanta.Canada’s Bombardier on October 18 announced two additions to the top end of its business jet line-up, adding to the Global Express XRS and Global 5000, with the longest-range aircraft giving a single-hop potential of Sydney to Los Angeles, or Hong Kong to New York.Cessna, the leading business jet maker by volume, with a total fleet of roughly 6,000 Citation jets in service, has long held the title of fastest civil aircraft, with its Citation X’s Mach 0.92.But the Gulfstream G650, while a much bigger and longer-range jet, is also vying for that crown. It has already notched up Mach 0.925 in testing in the run-up to its planned certification next year and entry into service in 2012. On October 17, it unveiled a new approach to the interior.Cessna on October 18 announced a new version of the Citation X – pronounced “10” – that will be, confusingly, renamed the Citation Ten, scheduled for first delivery in 2013. Cessna does acknowledge there will be “problems [that] people are going to have in differentiating the two in radio interviews”.The Ten, 15 inches longer than the X, will have new Rolls-Royce engines that give a 1.4 per cent improvement in fuel efficiency, as well as a new, Garmin-integrated avionics system. It will feature as standard the winglets that are approved as aftermarket modifications for the current X.Georgia-based Gulfstream has been working along similar lines to Kansas-based Cessna. Both cabin designs are much more European in style. The G650 interior is even titled “Stockholm”, and is intended to have the look of a living room furnished with loose objects – although it is rather more luxurious than most of Ikea’s offerings.Gulfstream has brought in car-design expertise and come up with an idea from the car world that it says is a first in business aircraft – powered seats. Only two of the seats will be electric as standard, though; the others can also be powered but there will be a weight penalty, and Gulfstream is only just squeezing in under its promised maximum weight of 100,000lbs – by a mere 2lb – to allow it access to more airports.It has made the G650 windows much, much bigger than normal, while retaining their trademark oval shape. On walking into the cabin, their effect is immediately apparent – the interior is strikingly airy.The Georgia company says the purpose of all the changes is to make the aircraft a better work tool for its owners. “They might be based in South America, say, and have a business on another continent,” says Larry Flynn, senior vice-president for marketing and sales. “These people are conducting business at a very rapid rate … and they need to go places fast to do business.“They also need to be in shape to do business when they arrive – they rely on the airplane to be their hotel room.”Passengers will be able to control their lights, window shades and entertainment through their own smartphone, using an application downloaded from the internet. The app detects where the passenger is seated and offers options suitable for that zone. Gulfstream has started with the iPod Touch and iPhone, but says it will develop apps for other smartphones and devices.Limiting the wireless range means the app will stop working when the device is further away from the cabin than the wingtips – and the company promises there will be a security coding that stops people very close by on the ground with unauthorised apps having any effect on the aircraft. Hard-wired touch panels on the aircraft will also control the cabin systems, so a lost iPhone is not a disaster.Cessna has also developed a new cabin management system that uses fibre-optic cables for lighter weight, and has touch screens, albeit built into the aircraft.Touch screens make an entry into the cockpit too. The Ten is the first application for the G5000 system from Garmin, the US avionics company. The G5000 is the first Garmin system to be aimed at commercial airliners as well as the top end of business aircraft.The system has three large flat-panel displays, controlled by four small touch screens. The integrated system eliminates many of the knobs and dials in most aircraft, even those that use screens rather than traditional gauges.Garmin – which puts 40 per cent of its aviation revenues back into research and development – is adamant that pilots will find it easier and more efficient to use than physical buttons and switches. A touch has to be consistent with the size of human finger, says Bill Stone, Garmin avionics product manager – “so if you set your coffee cup down on there, it doesn’t extend the landing gear or something goofy”.Mr Stone says it is easy to learn how to interface with the avionics system. “A couple of weeks ago we had Randy Babbitt, administrator of the FAA [the Federal Aviation Administration, the overall US regulator], sit down in a G5000 simulator and, with zero training, he successfully completed a flight,” Mr Stone says. “We wouldn’t advocate this, of course.”The G5000 has also been chosen for three other aircraft so far, adds Mr Stone. “That’s as of today,” he says. “Call back tomorrow – it may be different.”The new Bombardier aircraft, priced at $65m, are based on the Global Express XRS but with new wings and new GE Tech X turbofans, plus other changes such as larger windows.The Global 7000 extends the Express’s cabin by 10ft and has a range of about 7,300 nautical miles, or New York to Dubai. Its entry into service is scheduled for 2016. The Global 8000 is all about range – its 8,000nm range will mean Mumbai to New York non-stop when it enters service in 2017.Both new Globals will cover those distances at Mach 0.85 and have a high-speed cruise potential of Mach 0.90. Gulfstream is talking about a range of 7,000nm at Mach 0.85 for its $64.5m G650, and 5,000nm at Mach 0.90.The Citation Ten is not a direct competitor for these Bombardier and Gulfstream aircraft – except on speed. But Cessna is clear that the new aircraft is being pitched into a competitive marketplace. The current X costs, once typically equipped, $21.7m. Initial pricing of the Ten, in today’s money, is $21.5m.And Jack Pelton, president and chief executive of Cessna, says the Ten “will be the fastest business jet in production tomorrow and the year after. We’re going to continue to hold that position.”Which is why the company is being cagy about the Ten’s top speed until that of its Gulfstream rival is set in stone. “We will give an official figure after the certification date of the G650,” says Mr Pelton."
23;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2010-10-18T23:17:26Z;Flight lines: A factor of Ten;Rohit Jaggi on Cessna’s unveiling of the Citation Ten;Cessna’s unveiling of the Citation Ten, to take over from the $21.7m Citation X that has long been billed as the fastest civilian jet, is much more than a shift away from roman numerals.The more fuel-efficient Ten will have new Rolls-Royce engines, a new Garmin integrated avionics system, and a “revolutionary” cabin management system developed partly in-house that, says Cessna, is “all about connectivity”.It will also be 15 inches longer, have a completely revamped interior, and feature as standard the winglets that are approved as aftermarket modifications for the current X, which has not had any significant changes since 2002.But, while Cessna says it will be quicker than the old one, it is not saying by how much. Gulfstream is snapping at the heels of the Mach 0.92-capable X with its G650 ultra-long-range, ultra-long-cabin, business jet. The G650, which is currently working its way through its flight test programme, has achieved M0.925.Maximum speed “will be something that we decide when we have tested the airplane,” says Joel Mugglin, product marketing manager for the Ten.However, Cessna’s preliminary cruise speed chart shows a maximum cruise of about M0.918.“It’s fair to say it’s faster than today’s airplane at the upper altitudes where people are going to be operating it,” says Mr Mugglin.Jack Pelton, Cessna president and chief executive, has in the past said to me that the Citation X would keep the high-speed crown.The Ten is aiming for certification in 2013, price yet to be announced.The Garmin G5000 system on the Ten is an evolution of the avionics company’s revolutionary systems that have brought sophisticated, flat-screen technology to even the smallest general aviation aircraft.The Ten is the launch vehicle for the G5000, which is the first Garmin system to be aimed at commercial airliners as well as the upper strata of business aircraft.The system, controlled by two touch-screens, has also been chosen for three other airframes, says Bill Stone, Garmin avionics product manager. “That’s as of today,” he told me. “Call back tomorrow – it may be different.”Lift for financingThe inaugural deal at Milestone Aviation, the first finance company to concentrate on the helicopter and private jet markets, will provide 100 per cent lease financing for Brazil’s Omni Taxi Aéreo to buy two new Sikorsky S76C++ helicopters.The deal completed last month, will allow Brazil’s second largest helicopter operator to meet growing demand from the offshore oil industry.Hopes are high in business aviation that Milestone, set up by former NetJets executives, will help to take the crisis out of funding.Wanting in visionHe may have extended the boundaries of helicopter ownership, and use, for ever, but even Frank Robinson’s enthusiasm about spreading the H word has to bow before some forces.One of which is the weather. Mr Robinson’s attempt to visit the headquarters of one of his helicopter manufacturing company’s two UK distributors was delayed by a fog that refused to burn off until much later than his scheduled arrival time.After the usual seemingly interminable delays to see whether the weather would improve – in my experience much more a feature of flying in Northamptonshire than in Torrance, southern California, where Robinson Helicopter is based – he was forced to resort to the road to reach Sloane Helicopters at Sywell Aerodrome.But at least the mist lifted during the afternoon. Enough for the helicopter he was due to travel in – one of his own R44 four-seaters, of course – to have no problems with the short hop to near his hotel at Heathrow.He did not take the controls himself. In fact he tells me that he has cut back on his flying. “And I plan to continue, partly because I have given so many people my word that I am going to live to be 100 – or more.”
24;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2010-10-04T17:15:52Z;Garmin Nüvi 1490 satellite navigation system;;First, a disclaimer. The following is in no way intended as a criticism of my previous motoring navigation system (my wife) which was infallible, with any wrong turnings, u-turns, delayed arrivals etc entirely due to driver error.Second, a confession. I have undoubtedly been a slow and reluctant convert to the use of satellite navigation systems.This reluctance was in no small part due to the excellence of my aforementioned terrestrial navigation system. But it was also the result of an unsuccessful encounter with a satnav when they first began to gain popularity.I am by no means an “early adopter”, one of those blokes who just has to have the latest brand name gadget. My preference is to wait until others have ironed out the teething problems of anything new and until its usefulness has been proved by its ubiquity before I am tempted to try it. To give you an idea of my techno-resistance, I have bought my first iPod in the past 12 months.However, when the satnav was still the preserve of a cutting edge few, I was persuaded to try one. The experiment was not a success. Before relying on the device to guide me on a long drive to an unfamiliar destination, I thought I would try it on my way home. The journey takes an hour and by the time I pulled up on to my drive, the satnav was still trying to connect to its friends in the sky. It quickly found its way back to its owner.My Luddite determination to stick with the tried and tested has subsequently been weakened, however, by the (generally) successful use of in-built satnavs in various cars I have tested. It has become clear both that the technology has improved and that my wife would prefer a voice with a little emotional distance to try and keep me on the straight and narrow.So, with a French holiday looming, I decided it was time to try a standalone satnav again.I chose a Garmin, first, because I drive a Volvo and the company supplies systems to the Swedish carmaker and, second, because Garmin sponsors a team in the Tour de France so I figured they should know their way round the country.My golden rule for all things technological is that if one has to consult any instructions beyond the “Quick set-up” guide it has already failed. However, my first challenge with the Nüvi 1490 was to find that guide - the English version was the 11th of the 11 supplied. This, I decided, simply reflected the multinational nature of the satnav, a reassuring thought as I prepared to set off fo the Continent.Assembly of the Nüvi’s holder took less time than it did to decide where on the windscreen to site the device. This, in turn, took less time than it did for the satnav to connect to its guiding satellites. But, after a brief hesitition, the Nüvi sprang to life, banishing unhappy memories of that early satnav failure.Thereafter, the Nüvi competently met every requirement. It has a large, but not overpowering, screen and perfectly attuned touch screen controls. Destination input is straightforward and intuitive with the exception of a requirement to enter a street name as part of the address. This means that if you just want to find your way to a town, you have to guess at a street name before it will begin route guidance. Having been irritated by this on a few occasions, I noticed that there was the option to simply enter ‘1’ at this point, with the system then taking you to the centre of the town.Once under way, the guidance is clear and timely with a good feature being the graphical illustration of junctions, particularly useful in navigating complex routes on and off France’s ring roads and motorways.The Nüvi did have a habit of shutting down at random, as if suffering a loss of power, requiring a reboot. This is quick but frustrating, particularly if it happens at a critical moment en route.The Nüvi also shares a trait with most other satnavs that I have always found surprising - it does not give a route overview at the beginning of the journey. This had always irritated me, until I enjoyed a Nuvi-inspired epiphany. My irritation, I realised, reflected the fact that I did not trust the device. I wanted to see the planned route, to test it against my own interpretation of the best way forward.This defeats the point. If you already know the best route to the place you are going, you do not need a satnav. And if you do not know the way, or all the traffic conditions en route, or where all the speed cameras are, you must put your faith in the satnav.This realisation dawned on me on the way home from my holiday when, with the motorways heading north choc-a-bloc, the Nüvi calmy and flawlessly guided me along hundreds of miles of French Route Nationales so that I arrived at the Eurotunnel on time and back in England in time to be greeted by a cloudburst.Having no choice but to deliver myself into its hands, as I, obviously, had no idea where I was, my trust was rewarded as the Nüvi delivered me to my destination. My wife could have worked out an alternative route, but why should she be working on the last day of the holiday when, for our friend, Nüvi , the whole thing was effortless.Garmin Nüvi 1490Say goodbye to: tension between driver and put-upon navigatorSay hello to: blaming a machine insteadHow fast?

25;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2010-05-21T00:44:40Z;Raymarine shareholders escape shipwreck;Investors are getting much more than they could have hoped for;Shipwrecks often happen with frightening speed. The City was much amused four years ago when news broke of the sinking off the coast of Dorset of the £250,000 new yacht of Paul Compton of Collins Stewart. Mr Compton had gone below to check the boat’s position on his satellite navigation system, leaving his companion at the helm. Both were rescued after the yacht hit rocks and quickly foundered.By coincidence Mr Compton was head of smaller companies sales at Collins Stewart when the firm brought Raymarine, a supplier of marine electronics to the leisure boating market, to the full list in December 2004.Last week Raymarine, which had been negotiating tricky shoal waters for months after running up too much debt, was put into administration and sold in a few hours.The credit crunch had proved too much for the company, which last November warned shareholders that they were likely to lose all their money. It was a sorry pass for both the company and its investors.Anyone with the remotest interest in taking to the water would see the brand name festooned over both motor and sailing craft in every marina and at every boat show.However, as the year wore on, news of potential bidders emerged, although only Garmin, a competitor based in the US, was identified. But any deal with Garmin would have been subject to antitrust clearance, and that could have delayed a final decision for many months.In March the company’s banking syndicate extended facilities on its debt of more than £90m ($129m) to September. But the company was operating under short-term waivers, the last of which expired at midnight on Thursday.Last Friday’s quick succession of events began with Raymarine’s announcement at 9.39am that one of its bidders was pulling out. However, the bidder had told the banking syndicate that if the company went into administration, it would be willing to conclude a deal.At 11.35am Garmin also said it was prepared to talk to the administrators, and it made a further announcement at 3.53pm saying it was prepared to make an offer “likely to equate” to 35p a share, but conditional on antitrust approvals.At 4.05pm the Financial Services Authority suspended the shares. The banks, facing months more of uncertainty, sent in the administrators at 5.30pm, and by 6.06pm the company had been sold.The buyer is Flir Systems, a $4bn Nasdaq-quoted company that specialises in thermal imaging and infrared equipment. Earl Lewis, chairman and a leisure boater, says the company has started to supply infrared equipment to the boating market.“Raymarine is in a wonderful position, selling equipment to 400 [original equipment manufacturers] and to 1,000 boat dealers,” he says. “In our opinion, it’s the number one supplier and brand.”But he was prepared to walk away after months of negotiations because the sale process had proved so complex. “I believed if it continued to drag on any longer, the company would have started to lose market share and employees.”It looks as though the board found itself in an almost impossible position trying to balance the bidders and the banks. The administrators took the price Flir was willing to pay up to $180m, worth about 20p a share after clearing the debt and well above Garmin’s offer last month, worth 7.2p a share.Some shareholders still believe that the company has been sold too cheaply. But they are getting much more than they can have hoped for six months ago.The last day of trading was chaotic and the shares should have been suspended more quickly. But no one has emerged covered in glory from this saga, which was bedevilled by secrecy. The best that can be said is that a full-scale shipwreck was narrowly avoided, and that as much as was reasonably possible has been salvaged.Slow burnSprue Aegis, which this week took the Plus Company of the Year award, floated in June 2001 at 34p a share after developing an innovative domestic fire alarm. The prospectus looked forward to sales of £8.3m and pre-tax profits of £1.8m in 2002.Last month the company, which now offers a diverse range of safety devices, reported a 53 per cent rise in sales to £14.4m for 2009, and pre-tax profits of £1.9m. It paid a 0.5p maiden final dividend.In nine years the market capitalisation has edged up from £10m to £12.3m. It’s an example of the dogged persistence needed for a company to grow.

26;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2010-05-14T19:59:10Z;Austerity worries undermine London shares;;A week that had begun so brightly ended badly as fresh concerns about eurozone debt levels, and the impact of the austerity measures needed to tackle them, combined to cause a sell-off.The FTSE 100 suffered its biggest one day percentage fall in six months, losing 170.9 points, or 3.1 per cent, to 5,262.8 with mining and banking stocks taking the brunt of the selling. Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 lost 263 points, or 2.5 per cent, to 10,022.9.Traders said the European Union’s €750bn rescue, which triggered a big rally on Monday, was increasingly being seen as a sticking plaster that would do little to tackle the region’s solvency issues.“In our view, the European authorities’ actions ultimately do little to change the underlying dynamics of a western economy that has too much debt and is frantically trying to shuffle it around to assuage affordability concerns and get the lowest interest rate,” said Morgan Stanley strategist Graham Secker.In spite of Monday’s fall, the blue chip index still ended the week 143 points, or 2.7 per cent higher, recovering some of the previous week’s 7.8 per cent drop. The FTSE 250 gained 531 points, or 5.5 per cent, over the week.Mining stocks led the market lower after Chile followed the lead of Australia and announced plans to increase tax on mining companies.“With the concern around the impact of Chinese expansion on the sustainability of the iron ore price and the Henry tax in Australia, one has to wonder whether mining’s near-term future is to be characterised by on-going earnings downgrades,” said Christian Georges of Olivetree Securities.However, Liberum Capital said a Chilean mining tax would not be as punitive as the Australian one because state-owned Codelco, the world’s largest copper producer, was the country’s largest tax contributor.Miners Xstrata, down 7.9 per cent to £10.09, BHP Billiton, off 4.5 per cent to £19.14, Antofagasta, 5.7 per cent cheaper at 902p, and Anglo American, 5.4 per cent lighter at £26.03 – all of whom have operations in Chile – fell sharply.Banks were under pressure, hit by worries about exposure to eurozone debt and a report from Credit Suisse that said new regulations could cost the European banking industry €244bn, or 37 per cent of estimated 2012 earnings.“Given the increase in regulatory proposals in recent months we believe that it is helpful for investors ahead of next month’s G20 summit to track the impact these could have on the European banks sector,” Credit Suisse told clients.Barclays gave up 6.1 per cent to 308.9p, Lloyds Banking Group fell 4.7 per cent to 57.68p and RBS dipped 3.8 per cent to 47.26p.BP remained under pressure, falling a further 3.2 per cent to 530.20p.Capital Shopping Group, which owns the Lakeside shopping centre in Essex, eased 5.3 per cent to 324.1p on profit taking. Panmure Gordon, which started coverage of the stock with a “neutral” rating on Friday, said the shares were only worth 330p given the outlook for regional shopping groups.Wolseley was the only FTSE 100 company to end the session in positive territory. Shares in the building materials group rose 5 per cent to £16.88 on news that group trading profit for the year ending July would be above market expectations of £374m because of a successful cost-cutting programme.Among mid caps,Renishaw, a maker of specialist measuring equipment, added 2.1 per cent to 697p after a positive trading update.Inchcape was marked 7.7 per cent lower at 32.12p on concerns about its exposure to Greece.Fund manager Gartmore dipped 4.6 per cent to 144.20p after a trading statement failed to impress.Raymarine, the heavily indebted marine electronics company, was the main talking point on Friday, writes Neil Hume.Its shares, which started the day at 14½p, were suspended at 18¾p after its lenders demanded immediate repayment of their loans and the company was placed into administration.But, after the market closed, Raymarine said it had sold all of its operating businesses to Flir Systems and a sum of 20p a share could be returned to shareholders.“The administrators concluded that the sale to Flir provided the best available outcome for employees, shareholders and creditors,” said Raymarine.Earlier in the day, Garmin, a US rival, also held talks with the administrators over a similar deal that could have seen 35p a share returned to investors, subject to approval by the competition authorities.Management Consulting Group eased 2 per cent to 25p after the company announced plans to raise £25m by way of a placing and open offer at 22p a share. Collins Stewart said the fundraising would derisk MCG’s balance sheet and help trigger a rerating.Centamin Egypt dipped 4.3 per cent to 149¾p after a vehicle in which Josef El-Raghy, executive chairman, is a shareholder declared the sale of 9.9m shares at 155p a share.European Nickel shed 23.1 per cent to 6½p on news that a permit to develop its Caldag project in Turkey would have to be reissued. However, the company said it expected the process to be straightforward and to be in possession of a new permit before the end of the third quarter.
27;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2010-05-11T18:19:44Z;TomTom fights to stay on right path;;"Faced with Google and Nokia offering for free the service that constitutes its main business, TomTom, the Dutch satellite navigation company, is determined not to appear on the defensive as it launches its fightback.Its high-end “Go Live 1,000” personal navigation device, or PND, which goes on sale this summer, is based on a complete rewrite of the software used in TomTom’s devices with a greater emphasis on speed and internet connectivity.While the new product, which can calculate routes almost instantly, may coax owners of TomTom’s current top-of-
the-range devices to upgrade, the real test will come as it pushes the technology and features on to its lower-end gadgets, where competition from mobile phones is fiercest.The stakes are high. Since 2007, the share price has fallen more than 80 per cent. The average price of a TomTom PND has plunged from €204 ($259) to €89, a drop not fully compensated by a 20 per cent increase in sales volume.Meanwhile, Google is offering free navigation software for the US, UK and Ireland on smartphones running its Android operating system, while Nokia says 10m people have already downloaded free navigation software for its smartphones since January – not far off the 11.5m sales of TomTom PNDs last year.Harold Goddijn, chief executive – one of the four TomTom founders and big shareholders who took the stage at a lavish, Apple-style launch last month – sought to damn the mobile phone offerings with faint praise, saying they were “sufficient for occasional users” but involved too many compromises.Yet one area where rudimentary navigation software on a mobile phone beats a low-end satnav device is its constant connection to the internet, allowing it not only to download up-to-date maps but also receive traffic, weather and other information in real time.TomTom aims to answer that challenge by incorporating mobile phone technology into a wider range of its devices, so that Vodafone can pipe TomTom’s own traffic information to devices in 16 European countries, along with other real-time content and, eventually, third-party services.There is no bill for users, so there are none of the roaming charges that would make using an Android or Nokia phone astronomically expensive for navigation outside one’s home country.Mr Goddijn said he expected 80 per cent of TomTom devices to offer similar connectivity within a year of the launch of the flagship product.The company is also cutting the cost of the previously premium add-on services to zero in the first year and €50 from the second. Mr Goddijn said the price of devices would be “competitive” relative to ones without connectivity and TomTom was relying on sufficient buyers paying for a subscription in year two.“We’ve made assumptions on renewal rates after the first year and, if we’ve got it right, we’re not suffering on the margin,” he said.Analysts agree with TomTom’s assessment that mobile phones are not about to kill off the market for PNDs overnight, but the latter no longer look like a growth market.“You can imagine in 18-24 months you’re going to get to the point where mass-market smartphone adoption kicks in,” said Stuart Jeffrey, technology analyst at Nomura. “But the usability of [navigation on] a smartphone still isn’t quite the same as a PND.”Alongside its digital map licensing business – acquired when it bought mapmaker Tele Atlas in 2007 following a bidding war with US rival Garmin – TomTom earns a small revenue from paid-for navigation on Apple’s iPhone and other phones. But its main growth hope is in the market for “in-dashboard” car navigation.It already has deals with Renault and Fiat to provide in-dash units, typically at a much lower cost than existing offerings. The technical platform TomTom unveiled is based on open-source Webkit display software, which can run third-party applications. It should benefit the in-dash market as much as PNDs because it can be easily tailored to different car models.“In the past, every time we wanted to change something, we had to go back to the engineers and make changes to a big monolithic piece of software,” Mr Goddijn said. “In automotive, the problem is magnified because you want to connect to the air conditioning, the radio, what have you. Now, either the car manufacturer can do that or we can outsource it.”Mr Jeffrey said he believed that TomTom was doing as well as it could, but the crucial step would be in moving its new technology to its cheapest products. “How successfully they do that will determine where they are in three years’ time,” he said."
28;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2010-05-05T17:49:57Z;Wall St down sharply, but trims losses;;"Concerns about the fiscal and political situations in Europe pushed US stock prices lower for the second day, with the Nasdaq suffering its biggest two-day loss since March 2009, but the session ended with stocks well above the day’s lows.Private payroll count in the US as calculated by ADP rose 32,000 in April compared with a revised 19,000 rise in March, boosting hopes that Friday’s non-farm payrolls figures could be in line with expectations.“It seems to me that the US markets have been looking for a reason to pull back a little for a while and the situation in Greece is an awfully good one,” said Mike Shea, managing partner in equity sales and trading at Direct Access Partners, a New York-based brokerage.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.7 per cent to 1,165.87, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.6 per cent to 10,866.83 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.9 per cent lower at 2,402.29.The Vix index, a measure of volatility, was up 6.9 per cent to 25.48, after rising earlier in the session to above 27, near the 2010 high mark that it reached in January.News Corp dived 5.2 per cent to $14.60, making it one of the session’s worst performers as its full-year outlook disappointed investors.The media conglomerate reported strong first-quarter results after the market’s close on Tuesday, boosted by the success of Avatar, a 3D blockbuster film, and by a strong performance of its cable division.The stock was downgraded to “neutral” from “overweight” at JPMorgan with a target price of $16.50 a share.Rival Time Warner was off 2.4 per cent to $31.88 even after the company reported significantly better-than-expected first-quarter results, helped by a strong performance of its film studio and rising advertising sales at its cable network.The media conglomerate, which owns CNN and HBO networks, and Sports
Illustrated magazine, among others, earned 61 cents a share in the quarter, beating average analyst estimates of 48 cents a share.Sprint Nextel was 2 per cent higher to $4.18 as the telecoms group was upgraded to “buy” from “hold” at Deutsche Bank with its target price raised from $4.75 to $6.Consumer discretionary stocks remained under pressure as investors doubted the strength of consumer confidence.Whirlpool, a consumer electronics maker, lost 4.5 per cent to $104.21, carmaker Ford was 4 per cent lower to $12.34 while Best Buy, an electronics retailer, declined 3.7 per cent to $42.90.However, lower-end retailers managed to gain ground, with drugstore chain Walgreen leading the group higher, rising 1.7 per cent to $35.73.Warehouse chain Costco added 1.2 per cent to $60.36, discount retailer Walmart was 1.4 per cent higher to $54.77 and grocery chain Supervalu climbed 1.6 per cent to $15.Garmin, a maker of portable navigation devices, lost 8.8 per cent to $34.19 after the company’s first-quarter profit came in well below Wall Street expectations, hurt by the increasing popularity of smartphones that offer navigation services.Excluding non-recurring items, earnings were 38 cents a share compared with average analyst expectations of 42 cents a share.XL Capital was one of the session’s best performers as the Bermuda-based insurer posted first-quarter profit that positively surprised investors and rose 4.8 per cent to $17.99.The company recorded net income of $143.9m in the quarter, up from $3.1m a year earlier.Drugmaker InterMune plunged 75 per cent to $11.38, making it one of the biggest fallers in the Russell 2000, a small-cap index, on news that it failed to win US regulatory approval for a lung treatment that analysts estimated could bring in more than $1bn in annual sales.Ariad Pharmaceuticals pushed 5.8 per cent higher to $4.03 as the drugmaker announced that pharma giant Merck is to acquire all development and marketing rights of Ridaforolimus, its experimental cancer treatment, for $50m cash and about $19m reimbursement of development costs.Merck was down 0.6 per cent to $35.59."
29;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2010-04-30T02:37:16Z;Big freeze helps groups warm to Aim;;The listings freeze on Aim is thawing but it is still too early to call a recovery.The first quarter saw 16 new admissions on to London’s junior market, according to Deloitte, compared with just five in the same quarter of last year. While companies were still leaving, the pace of delisting slowed. “It encourages people to look at the market again as a place to raise capital,” Deloitte said.True enough, but the data showed that only four of the listings raised £20m ($30m) or more. For others, a float may be a solution to a lack of venture capital money.A report this week on venture capital trends from Ascendant, the adviser to smaller companies, found that in the first quarter, 65 companies received £153m from 82 investors. That compared with 44 companies receiving £114m from 62 investors a year ago.But the headline figures mask several important trends. The average investment size dropped to just £2.4m – the lowest in a quarter for more than nine years – while the biggest single investment was £17m for Oxford Nanopore Technologies.Furthermore, syndication dropped below 60 per cent of deals for the first time in more than 10 years. Stuart McKnight, managing director of Ascendant, said it looked as though smaller deals were done by single investors.Perhaps of most concern was that the total amount of money raised in the period was flat on the fourth quarter.“Usually there is a significant bounce in the first quarter of each year, which sets the pace for the year as a whole. Typically 30 per cent of the whole year’s capital is committed in the first quarter,” said Mr McKnight. “If the market reverts to its normal behaviour, we have a slow 2010 for technology businesses raising finance.”Companies are looking for new sources of capital, such as trade investors or regional government funds, as interest from venture funds was rare, he said.The reticence from venture funds is understandable after the past two years. On Wednesday Ilika, part of IP Group’s portfolio, revealed plans to list on Aim in May. The University of Southampton spin-out hopes to raise £5.2m from its flotation, which would give it an £18.7m market capitalisation.However, the IPO will be at a lower valuation than a private financing Ilika completed in 2007.Ilika says its listing is a natural progression as it matures but if the trends seen by Ascendant continue during the year, others may be looking to Aim to take the place where the venture backer once stood.Tides always turnWhat does a board do if it receives a firm cash offer of 15p a share less than five months after telling its shareholders the equity was worthless?To Raymarine, the marine electronics maker, the answer seems to be to hold out against it.But before shareholders are tempted to throw the management overboard, it is worth examining the board’s stance.Worth 152p when it floated on the main market in 2004, Raymarine shares fell 70 per cent to 1.6p in December after takeover talks with Garmin, the US satellite navigation system maker, ended.Discussions with another party over the sale of the business continued but with falling sales and net debt of £91m due for repayment, Raymarine warned that there would be no remaining value for shareholders.Other offers emerged in April at 4p a share and 7.2p a share. The problem with the latter bidder was that it was a direct competitor. Raymarine worried that any protracted antitrust approval process would be too damaging while its situation was so precarious.Two weeks ago, the suitor offering 4p a share for the equity then tried to change the terms of its bid, preferring to buy the business and the assets for 4p a share. It would also pay Raymarine’s debt.One advantage of that approach is that the transaction would be structured as a disposal and only require 50 per cent approval from shareholders.But on Wednesday, Garmin surprised the market with its 15p offer and said that the combined worldwide market share of the two would be lower than 30 per cent. Raymarine’s reply was to point out that the other party’s proposal could yield 17½p for shareholders.It may be a great bidding war, but Raymarine and its bankers are executing a highwire act. While they have a duty to achieve the highest price, the other side has put firm cash on the table.In technology, a commanding share of the market rarely lasts long. Equally, any delays could hole Raymarine below the waterline. Shareholders may be tempted to get out while uncertainty remains.
30;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2010-03-17T21:04:55Z;Dow rises for seventh day in a row;;Wall Street stocks continued their rally on Wednesday, rising on a quiet news day as investors took comfort from a range of positive economic and corporate data.Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets said: “Indications from the US Fed that interest rate increases may be some time away yet, a benign US producer price report, signs that the US financial system continues to heal with more troubled asset relief programme repayments, and continued easing of sovereign debt fears in Europe this week all appear to be contributing to improved market sentiment.”US producer prices fell by 0.6 last month compared with the expected 0.2 per cent decline. Excluding food and energy, prices rose by 0.1 per cent, as expected.“Even if we see some heat in [US producer prices], the question is whether it can carry through to the core CPI [consumer price index], which would be a problem. That’s not likely soon,” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Schwab.She added: “We are not in an inflationary environment.”After the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.58 per cent at 1,166.21, an 18-month high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.5 per cent to 10,733.67, rallying for the seventh consecutive day. The Nasdaq was 0.5 per cent higher at 2,389.09.BlackRock rose 4.9 per cent to $222.80 as the world’s biggest money manager was raised from “neutral” to “outperform” by Credit Suisse and added to its US focus list.Polycom, the world’s largest maker of video conferencing equipment, rose 8.9 per cent to $33.14 after announcing that it had agreed a deal with India’s Reliance Communications, a mobile services company.India is one of the fastest-growing markets for wireless services.In the same sector, Citrix Systems was one of the biggest fallers in the S&P 500 index, losing 3.1 per cent to $47.43 as the maker of networking software was downgraded from “buy” to “neutral” at Goldman Sachs.Human Genome Sciences, a pharmaceutical company, fell 1.5 per cent to $31.24 after the company said a mid-stage trial of its drug for advanced lung cancer showed no difference in disease response or progression-free survival.Shares in the DVD rental chain Blockbuster dived 29.2 per cent to 28 cents on comments by the company that it may file for bankruptcy due to competitive industry pressures.Garmin, a satellite navigation manufacturer, gained 5.6 per cent to $37.27 after announcing a 100 per cent increase in its annual cash dividend this year.The financial sector rallied in the aftermath of Tuesday’s Fed decision to maintain the level of interest rates. Bank of America was up 1.4 per cent to $17.27, JPMorgan climbed 1.3 per cent to $43.79 and Goldman Sachs rose 0.3 per cent to $176.64.Shares in CIT Group rallied 4.4 per cent to $37.87 after the commercial lender which has came out of bankruptcy said its book value increased to $41.99 per share, beating expectations.Hartford Financial Services climbed 4.8 per cent to $28.58 as the insurer announced plans to sell shares and debt to repay its $3.4bn bail-out.Energy stocks rallied after market underperformance. ExxonMobil gained 1.2 per cent to $67.36, while Chevron was up 0.9 per cent to $74.67.Massey Energy led the sector higher, gaining 5.8 per cent to $53.15, after the coal producer said it is to acquire Cumberland Resources for $960m and would consider raising new equity capital to help finance the acquisition. Massey also warned it expects its first-quarter earnings to be below analyst estimates.AMR Corp, the parent company of American Airlines, fell 0.7 per cent to $9.59, as its flight attendants requested federal approval to end contract talks, thought to be the first step towards a strike at a leading US carrier in almost five years.The airline sector was broadly down.Continental Airlines lost 2.7 per cent to $22.57, UAL Corp, the parent of United Airlines, declined 3.4 per cent to $19.49 and US Airways was 2.3 per cent down to $7.59.

Overall, the S&P 500 financial sector was down 3 per cent.After dropping more than 2 per cent, the S&P 500 closed 1.9 per cent lower at 1,116.48.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2 per cent to 10,389.88 and the Nasdaq was 1.1 per cent lower at 2,265.70.The financial sector was already in focus after a rush of quarterly results unsettled the market.Goldman reported a higher profit for the fourth quarter than analysts had forecast. The bank also responded to the public outcry over bankers’ pay by slashing compensation.PNC Financial Services, the Pittsburgh-based bank, beat profit expectations after a decline in loan losses. The group said that it had benefited from its acquisition in 2008 of National City, a bank based in Ohio. But PNC shares lost 5.3 per cent to $55.70.Keycorp, which is also based in the state, reported a narrower loss than analysts had been expecting but said it was still struggling with a high number of loan defaults. The Midwest region has been hard-hit by the subprime mortgage crisis. Keycorp’s shares surged 5.5 per cent to $7.34.Fifth Third Bancorp also reduced its fourth-quarter loss due to fewer writedowns on mortgages and others loans. Shares in the Cincinnati-based bank rose 6.3 per cent to $12.02.However, it was the S&P 500 materials sector which led the market lower throughout the day as concerns lingered over China’s plan to rein in lending. The materials sector lost 4.3 per cent – its biggest daily drop since last June.Bob Baur, chief global economist at Principal Global Investors, said: “We are seeing a transition from a fast-paced cyclical rally by basic materials, financials and industrials. We had a synchronised global recovery after a synchronised global recession and now we’re seeing some differentiation in monetary policy.”An unexpected jump in claims for unemployment benefits in the US also dragged the market lower from the opening bell.Analysts had been expecting fewer Americans to file fresh claims for unemployment benefits last week. However, the labour department reported initial jobless claims had risen to 482,000.The market had initially edged higher after positive results from Ebaylifted the technology sector.A strong performance by its PayPal payment processing business and a surge in online Christmas holiday shopping helped Ebay to post a
higher-than-expected profit for the last quarter. The shares were still up 8.6 per cent at $24.13 in spite of the mood of pessimism on Wall Street.Elsewhere in the technology sector, satellite navigation manufacturers were under pressure after Nokia announced it would offer free maps on its mobile phones.Companies such as Garmin are suffering from Google’s assault on the market late last year. While Nokia shares climbed more than 1 per cent in Finland, Garmin was down 5.5 per cent at $34.16.Shares in Inspire Pharmaceuticals plunged 16.2 per cent to $5.54 after the drugmaker reported disappointing results from a late-stage trial of its treatment for dry eyes.However, Fairchild Semiconductor added to the sector’s gains by giving a higher-than-expected forecast for the first quarter. The chipmaker’s shares rose 6.3 per cent to $12.02.Continental Airlines announced a surprise profit for the fourth quarter. The carrier said it had seen an improvement in lucrative business traffic. However, the shares were later down 2.3 per cent to $20.15. Southwest Airlines reported a higher-than-expected profit for the quarter. But its shares succumbed to the market mood, losing 3.1 per cent to $11.68."
32;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2010-01-21T18:50:30Z;Nokia offers free maps on its smartphones;;Nokia, the world’s largest mobile phone maker, on Thursday launched free maps for all users of its high-end smartphones, in an effort to woo back customers lost to Apple and Google.The Finnish company is losing market share to Apple’s iPhone and mobile phones that use Google’s Android platform. Both have attracted users with rich offerings of software programs, or apps.Nokia has struggled to attract users to its Ovi store of software and services. The smartphone segment accounts for a large portion of Nokia’s profits.Users of Nokia smartphone will have access to free maps for pedestrians and drivers in 180 countries, with voice-guided navigation available for 74 countries in 46 languages.Also free will be traffic information, and details about speed cameras and speed limits. A Facebook interface allows users to publish their location to the social networking site.Nokia’s turn-by-turn navigation formerly cost from about €1.59 ($2.24) a day, with traffic information from €0.69. The loss of this revenue will dent Nokia’s services sales, which it has promised to increase to €2bn by 2011.Mapping is one of Nokia’s strongest assets, since the acquisition of Navteq, an electronic map company, for $8.1bn in 2007.Analysts said there was a risk that Nokia would have to write down the value of Navteq when it reports fourth-quarter data next week.The move to make the maps free counters Google’s announcement in October that it would offer free maps and turn-by-turn navigation for all new Android phones.“It is a head-to-head race with Google now to secure the most mapping users as quickly as possible,” said Ben Wood, analyst at CCS insight, the technology research company. “Nokia are betting that by doing this they will see growth in map adoption and be able to use that as a base for advertisers and other partners.”Michael Schroder, analyst at FIM, said: “Nokia is using free navigation to slow down its market share loss, until it can get a new smartphone platform out at the end of the year. Navigation is an important and useful feature, but it remains to be seen whether it will make users forgive the rather antiquated handsets.”Nokia’s free mapping services will be a blow to mapping companies such as TomTom and Garmin. Shares in TomTom, which sells mapping services for the iPhone at about $70 for the North American map application, fell more than 10 per cent on Thursday.
33;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2009-10-16T23:42:29Z;The latest high-tech sports watches;;"Garmin Forerunner 405CXReal-time measurement of pace and distance; heart-rate monitoringGarmin was the first company to produce a GPS monitor that resembles a watch rather than a wrist-mounted mobile phone – the Forerunner 405. The new 405CX looks identical but boasts a souped-up GPS receiver (less chance of losing the signal) and HotFix function, which enables it to get reception double-quick on routes you run regularly. Calorie expenditure is now cruelly accurate (did I really burn just 268 calories in 30 minutes?), thanks to new technology using heart-rate physiology to calculate energy output – rather than weight, height and distance covered. The 405CX employs a touch-sensitive bezel, which you tap, hold or slide your finger across to navigate the many menus, settings and options. Sensitive is the word: more than once, I inadvertently ended up flicking to a completely different screen, mid-run, and couldn’t find my way back. You can display up to three parameters at a time: from calorie expenditure per mile to time per km, gradient climbed – even what time the sun is going to set. It’s all programmable and downloadable to your computer via the USB stick supplied with it, for analysis and progress monitoring.Details

GPS and heart-rate monitoring come cheaper with the Polar RS300X G1 (£175; www.polarelectro.co.uk), but the GPS pod is a separate unit that you can either carry or wear on your arm.………………………………………..Timex Expedition WS4A hardy widescreen watch that monitors outdoor conditions for extreme activitiesAction Man would like one of these. Designed for outdoor adventurers, the WS4 monitors altitude, temperature, barometric pressure and direction, and its giant screen (the “dashboard”) enables you to display them all at once. Tested on an expedition to the Himalayas, this is a robust, water-resistant watch that can be used in the dark by switching to NightMode. In the absence of a local mountain range, the best I could do was a hilly off-road run in Epping Forest – I climbed 213m over the course of a 48-minute run in 27.2 degrees. Interesting data, but I couldn’t help thinking I’d also have liked to know how far I’d run and what my heart rate was. Still, the altimeter, which features an altitude alarm (it sounds when you reach a predetermined height), tracks current, maximum and accumulated altitude and displays total ascent and descent graphically, would be a great asset on the mountains, as would the built-in compass on any journey into the wild. It’s heavy though, and dwarves female wrists.Details

You’ll have to do without the compass, though.………………………………………..Suunto T6CA top-of-the-range heart-rate monitorI didn’t fall in love with the Suunto T6c straight away – it’s not the simplest of gadgets to get to grips with and for a heart-rate monitor without integrated GPS, it comes at a hefty price. But after a few goes, I was won over. Dubbed the “sports laboratory on your wrist”, the T6C goes beyond the usual readings of heart rate and calorie expenditure to give information on training effect (the aerobic benefit of a given session on a scale of one to five) and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC – the amount of oxygen used post-exercise to help restore the body to a resting state – which enables the monitor to recommend how to adapt your training). While 21 different parameters are measurable, many of them rely on you purchasing sport-specific add-ons. For example, you need the Foot POD if you want to monitor cadence or pace, or the Bike POD if you want the monitor to double up as a cycle computer. One of my favourite features was the interval training function. Set up a warm-up period and programme how long you want each effort and recovery period to last. The watch will then beep to indicate the start and end of each interval. But to make it worth the extra money, you really need to make use of the data analysis software that comes with the T6C.Details

Sigma Onyx Pro £99.99. Easy to use with all the standard functions and a few extras (such as marathon training mode), a great entry-level option; www.sigmasport.co.uk………………………………………..Nike SportBandA low-cost, minimalist speed and distance monitorThe SportBand is a minimal, lightweight wrist strap that measures pace, distance, time and calories burned during running or walking, receiving data from the accompanying sensor housed in your trainer. Officially, you need a Nike shoe, which has a designated slot for the sensor beneath the insole, but lace-mounted holders are widely available, enabling you to use it with any shoe brand. I applaud the simplicity of the SportBand, but it’s a shame that you can only display one parameter at a time (not much use if you want to do timed efforts, as you can’t keep tabs on time and distance simultaneously). While the SportBand unit itself can store 16 hours’ worth of runs, it comes into its own when you detach the display unit from the strap and plug it into your computer, gaining access to the NikePlus website, where you can store and analyse data, chat to other runners and issue or undertake challenges. If you simply want to know how far you ran, or what your average pace is, this is a reasonably accurate, straightforward tool.Details

Not a product, but a freely accessible online tool that tells you how far you went (or intend to go) and, if you enter your time, your average pace.………………………………………..Polar CS600XA dedicated cycling performance toolThis is a gadget for committed cyclists – the handlebar-mounted design means you don’t actually get a watch, just the face of a watch, which slots on to your handlebars. The downside of this is that despite having a heart-rate strap, you can’t use the device to monitor performance in other sports. But when it comes to cyclist stats, the CS600X is impressive. Mercifully easy to set up and attach to your bike, it records everything you could possibly want to know, from heart-rate data to average and maximum speed to calories per km or mile, angle of incline/decline, total ascent/descent and ambient temperature. While speed and distance are recorded via the spoke-mounted speed sensor (included) you’ll need to fork out extra for the crank-mounted cadence sensor (an additional £38) or for the GPS sensor, which gives you the option of tracking your routes using Google Earth for an extra £120. But Polar’s ProTrainer software is included, opening up a world of data-gazing online and turning the monitor into a feedback device. Another useful function is that it can be set up to be used on up to three different bikes – particularly useful if you have a mountain bike and road bike with different wheel sizes.Details

34;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Garmin offering looks a little dated;;As far back as 18 months ago, Garmin, the US-based satellite navigation market leader, put a new device on display – under a sealed glass dome – at the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona.Last week, the Garmin Nuvifone G60, the first Linux-powered combination 3G mobile phone and full-feature GPS navigator, made it to market with AT&T in the US.The Nuvifone, which I have been testing, includes most navigation features you would expect to find in a standalone device, including text-to-speech capability and full search functionality. But it already looks dated and, while it functions well as a standard mobile phone, it lacks some of the advanced features found in high-end smartphones such as the iPhone, Palm Pre and latest Android-powered devices.Meanwhile, GPS navigation has become a standard feature for most smartphones, and Garmin’s rival standalone GPS manufacturers, including Navigon and TomTom, have launched iPhone applications (Navigon’s iPhone application is particularly impressive.) That makes it difficult to recommend the Nuvifone G60, particularly with its $299 price tag (after a $100 rebate) with a new two-year contract.
35;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

But light trading volume suggested investors were reluctant to commit themselves after analysts had predicted equities would fall after the summer’s rally.“After a huge run over the last couple of days, the market is a bit overbought so everybody is waiting for a pull-back,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com.After the oil price sunk back below the psychologically significant $70 level, stocks erased their early gains. The S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent lower at 1,042.73 points after gaining 2.6 per cent this week.The Nasdaq fell 0.2 per cent to 2,080.90 points but it has still outperformed the other indices in recent sessions and was up 3.1 per cent for the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2 per cent to end the session at 9,605.41 and was up this week by 1.7 per cent.After leading the market higher this week, technology stocks deteriorated throughout the day. Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, lost 1.3 per cent to $19.51 even after an upgrade from Roth Capital.In spite of posting better first-quarter results than had been expected, National Semiconductor fell 5.9 per cent to $15.03. The chipmaker’s shares have risen 30 per cent since the beginning of July after investors bet on a sector recovery.Garmin, the maker of GPS products, rose 0.3 per cent to $36.18 after a recommendation from Bank of America.But Cree, a maker of light-emitting diodes, weighed on the sector after it announced on Thursday that it would place 11m shares in a common stock offering. Its shares fell 5.2 per cent to $34.83.After strong performances in the week, the energy and materials sector also dragged the market down but industrial stocks stayed strong. During the week, General Electric powered the sector after JPMorgan upgraded the stock and Goldman Sachs raised its price target on the company the day after.Its shares fell back 0.9 per cent to $14.67 but were up 5.8 per cent for the week.Fedex delivered a further boost to the sector on Friday. The second-largest US package-shipping group, considered a gauge of economic activity, rallied 6.4 per cent to $77.32 after announcing earnings would exceed its forecast.In the pharmaceuticals sector, Quidel gained 1.7 per cent to $16.99 after the maker of tests for pregnancy and infectious diseases forecast strong profit in its third quarter due
to higher demand for flu products.Healthcare stocks also fell back after a week of volatile trading.Uncertainty lingered over President Barack Obama’s address to Congress on Wednesday evening, during which he appealed for a bipartisan reform of the healthcare system. After clawing back some losses on Thursday, Wellpoint fell 0.3 per cent to $54.03 and Unitedhealth Group also slipped 0.1 per cent to $29.07.The financial sector, however, was in negative territory from the outset.American International Group was downgraded by Wells Fargo Securities, which said the company had no tangible book value.Its shares, which have lost 7.5 per cent this week in spite of the market’s rally, fell 0.8 per cent to $37.55. Morgan Stanley was one of the few gainers in the sector. The shares rose 0.6 per cent to $28.82 after it said John Mack, chief executive, would step down and be replaced by James Gorman, head of retail
brokerage."
37;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2009-08-17T21:43:44Z;Raymarine in talks on sale to Garmin;;Raymarine, the troubled Portsmouth-based manufacturer of radar and navigation systems for leisure boats, is holding takeover talks with Garmin, the US satellite navigation manufacturer.The group has been in refinancing discussions with its lenders since the start of the year, after the fall in the value of the pound pushed up the cost of its non-sterling borrowings.Foreign exchange losses of £4.9m ($8m) contributed about half of the group’s financing costs during 2008. At the start of April the group had net debt of £88.4m and total banking facilities of £104.2m.The group said it was in “preliminary discussion with a number of parties, including Garmin, which may or may not lead to a sale of the company”.Raymarine’s shares, which have fallen by more than 95 per cent since their most recent peak last May, rose 65 per cent as markets opened on Monday, before settling back to close at 16½p, up 3½p, or 27 per cent, from Friday’s close.The company has suffered from the decline in the leisure boat market, which is exposed to high-income customers hit by last year’s financial turmoil.According to IC Consulting, global leisure boat revenues fell 3.4 per cent to €7.4bn (£6.4bn) in 2008, while the number of boats sold fell from 142,000 to 136,000. The consultants forecast that global sales were unlikely to rise until 2011.Raymarine was broken out of Raytheon through a management buy-out in 2001 and its products were most famously used by Dame Ellen McArthur, the round-the-world yachtswoman. It previously entered takeover talks last April but the discussions fell apart the following month.Garmin shares fell about 3 per cent in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq exchange, to 27¾ cents. On the basis of Raymarine’s April debt figure, the company has a total takeover value of £102m, compared with $960m (£588m) in cash held by Garmin at the end of June.Oliver Wynne-James, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, said Raymarine had “an uncertain financial future unless new funds are raised or a new owner emerges”.Raymarine said that it was still exploring the possibility of a capital raising from investors and the chance to renegotiate more favourable lending conditions with its syndicate of banks.
38;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2009-06-15T15:34:29Z;TomTom’s capital raising;;"Talk about wishful thinking. Shares of TomTom jumped a fifth on Friday amid a rumour that Apple, the US computer group, was eyeing a stake in the struggling maker of mobile satellite navigation units. Investors soon learnt the truth: not only was the rumour nonsense, but shareholders are being asked to fork out more than €359m through a rights issue to ease the company’s heaving debt load. Three investors will contribute another €71m through a private placement. The shares fell 11 per cent at one point on Monday.TomTom’s is a familiar story of bad timing and over-reach. The Dutch group last year took on €1.6bn of debt to fund its €2.9bn acquisition of Tele Atlas, a maker of mapping software, after a bidding war with Garmin, its US rival. Tying Tele Atlas’s maps to TomTom’s gadgets looked promising, but by the time the deal completed last year, the financial sector was on the verge of implosion. This year, the recession’s hit to sales and profits left TomTom in danger of breaching covenants on €1.2bn of net borrowings.This week’s planned capital raising should put those fears to rest. TomTom should end up with €720m of net debt – about 2.5 times this year’s forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, and well within amended covenants requiring net debt below 3.5 times ebitda at year-end. Investors may sigh at the 8.5 per cent dilution they will take as a result of the private placement. But TomTom’s founders will pay the biggest price for the extra headroom. They will lose majority control as the new investors dilute their stake from 51.5 per cent to 47.2 per cent. Painful, but a price worth paying to put the focus back on growth, and away from a tattered balance sheet.TomTom, the Dutch maker of satellite navigation devices and software, is to raise €430m by offering new shares and through a private placement, which Harold Goddijn, its chief executive, said should put concerns over its debt “off the table”.The company paid €2.9bn to buy digital map maker Tele Atlas at the end of 2007 and has since struggled under the debt burden.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

39;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2009-06-05T21:01:58Z;BlackBerry maker buys Dash;;Research In Motion, the Canadian manufactuer of the BlackBerry family of smartphones, has quietly acquired Dash Navigation, the US-based startup which was forced to change its business plans in November after its internet-connected GPS unit failed to attract a large enough user base. The deal was first reported by GPS Business News.Dash, which was backed by Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia, pioneered the idea of a network connected personal navigation device that logged the position and speed of users and then fed users back real time traffic reports based on the data. While the concept, built into Dash’s first and only windscreen-mounted GPS unit, attracted considerable interest, its success was inevitably dependent on building a large enough user base.Unfortunately Dash entered the market at a time when competition in the North American GPS navigation market between vendors like Garmin and TomTom was heating up. In the end Dash was forced to cut its staff dramatically and refocus on selling its software rather than hardware devices.RIM has provided no details of the acquisition or its plans for the Dash business, other than to confirm the deal. However, GPS navigation is already built into most smartphones including most of the latest BlackBerrys. Some industry analysts believe that mobile phone-based GPS navigation will eventually replace dedicated GPS units and suggest this is why growth in market for PNDs is slowing.Last year Nokia, the world’s largest mobile phone maker and a key competitor in the smartphone market, completed its acquisition of Navteq, the digital mapmaker, as part of the Finnish company’s strategy to expand location-based services in its handsets under the Ovi brand.
40;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2009-02-21T00:18:15Z;Cycling comes clean;;"David Millar lies flat out in the hotel parking lot, in the still warm November sun, nursing a hangover and waiting for his teammates. The squad, sponsored by Garmin GPS systems, are in Boulder, Colorado, for their pre-season training camp. More about bonding than real training, the week is nicknamed “booze camp” since it takes place ­during the riders’ short off season and they make the most of this fleeting freedom. They are staying in the four-star ­St Julien Hotel and last night enjoyed a wine tasting that lasted well into the small hours.This is the last day of the camp, which has been organised into sessions covering everything from new training methods to dealing with the media to schedules and goals for the 2009 season. All week, the 30-odd riders and equal numbers of support staff have taken over the hotel’s spacious lobby. At any time of day, groups of skinny athletes sprawl across sofas with their laptops, talk to sponsors and team managers or huddle in corners being interviewed by reporters.This morning, they are heading out on a three-hour training ride into the foothills of the Rockies – and the effects of last night are clear as the riders trickle out to the team van to pick up their gear. Millar, one of the team leaders, has been in demand all week. The lanky Brit is known in the press corps for his intelligence and individual style: his customised cycling shoes have Union Jack flags on the heels and later today he will turn out at the team’s official launch in a Vivienne Westwood-designed outfit involving plus-fours and argyle-patterned socks.He is also famous for having confessed to using illegal ­performance-enhancing drugs and serving a two-year professional racing ban – and for the fact that he has talked publicly and extensively about his doping experiences as part of a push to clean up the sport.This reforming enthusiasm is matched by his boss, team manager Jonathan Vaughters, a former professional who competed against Millar in his racing days and was a teammate of Lance Armstrong. Still racing-thin, 35-year-old Vaughters has a kind of geek-chic cool and used to be nicknamed “the professor”, thanks to his interest in scientific training theories. This morning, he is patiently trying to corral his riders, who are milling around, fiddling with their bikes and stocking up on water and energy drinks. Nothing happens quite on time at training camp, but the group slowly comes together and heads off.The ride is easy by the standards of professional cyclists, and the team sweat out last night’s excesses as they pedal ­double-file, chatting and joking. We turn off the main road into the hills but the pace remains steady as riders take it in turns to lead. I am sitting in a team car with Vaughters, who is driving; while we talk, he gets a message on his BlackBerry from Senator John Kerry. At the same time, he is keeping an eye on the riders. Wedged in the boot, the FT’s photographer calls ­Millar and his teammate, British Olympic gold medallist ­Bradley ­Wiggins, to the front. They grimace at the effort.For this squad, the sunny November interlude was all too brief. Since new year, many of them have travelled to ­Australia, Qatar and Malaysia for races. Others have holed up in far more serious training camps ahead of their first big test of the season: this week’s Tour of California.…At eight days in length, the Tour of California race is not quite the Tour de France. The west coast event is, however, the most prestigious US race, and winning here is a huge goal for US outfits such as Team Garmin-Slipstream. But this year’s race is big for more than just team hopes: it also marks Lance Armstrong’s first race on US soil in almost four years.Armstrong became an inspiration to millions when he survived a battle with testicular cancer and went on to win a record seven Tours de France. The gruelling, three-week race is reckoned to be one of the toughest endurance events in the world. Retired for more than three years, Armstrong – now 37 – is making a comeback, with the aim of raising awareness and funds for cancer research. He remains as big a draw as ever. At his first race in Australia last month, politicians and other public figures rushed to be associated with him and his cause while journalists lined up for interviews. Yet for the cycling world, his return to racing is a mixed blessing. It attracts enormous attention but it has also brought back the old and never proven rumours that Armstrong, the biggest star the sport has ever seen, doped.Armstrong has denied this repeatedly – successfully suing over the issue – and is reluctant to talk about it now, on the grounds he has nothing new to say. But to dispel the suspicions and put his results beyond question, he’s doing something new this ­season: putting himself through an extra series of tests, far beyond what is required, to prove that he is clean. And that will, inevitably, bring doping – and testing – to the fore.Drug testing has always been based on the assumption that athletes are innocent until proven guilty. Armstrong is following in the footsteps of a handful of cycling teams, including Garmin, who are acting on the assumption that this no longer applies in sport and are prepared instead to prove themselves innocent. There is certainly a case for the guilty-until-proven-innocent premise. Suspicion of doping is now so high that sceptics deride any outstanding achievement as drug-fuelled even if there are no positive tests because they believe the dopers are at least a step ahead of the scientists. In many cases, the statement “I’ve never tested positive” might be true, but means very little.What Armstrong and the Garmin team are doing is known scientifically as longitudinal testing. This involves undergoing a lot more testing, at regular intervals, to build up a reliable biological profile of each athlete. This can be used either to produce evidence of sophisticated doping that slips through the net of normal testing or it can, for the first time, show that an athlete is clean.“Lance knows what he’s supposed to do if he wants to come back and it’s what we are doing. He is almost taking a leaf out of our book,” says Millar. “Nowadays the majority of us, we have to prove our innocence. We can’t take it for granted.”…Millar knows he is one of the many reasons for public suspicion of professional athletes. He was caught in 2004 as part of an expanding police investigation into his then team. He never tested positive, but a police raid on his Biarritz home uncovered used syringes with traces of erythropoietin, or EPO, a drug developed to help cancer patients by boosting production of red blood cells. Its use in sport was outlawed in 1990. Millar was arrested – in contrast to the UK, doping is a crime in France – and confessed.Doping is not new; people have always sought ways to produce more for less effort, and the history of doping in ­competitive sport goes back to the ancient Greeks, who used specially prepared herbal potions to improve performance. Nineteenth-century endurance athletes, including cyclists, are known to have turned to strychnine, cocaine and alcohol, among other substances – but doing so wasn’t illegal then. Only as the use of drugs and other performance-enhancers grew did sports federations begin to act, from the late 1920s.In spite of bans, little changed – mostly because doping tests were only developed in the 1960s. They made their first Olympic appearance in 1968, at the Mexico games. They could not come too soon for cycling; in 1967, Briton Tom Simpson, a world champion and tabloid celebrity, died during a stage of the Tour de France in Provence. He had amphetamines in his blood and reportedly drank brandy before his fatal climb up Mont Ventoux. During the 1970s and 1980s, tests continued to be developed – and a slowly growing number of athletes were caught. Yet, doping only really came to the public’s attention in 1988, when runner Ben Johnson tested positive for anabolic steroids after setting a world record time of 9.79 seconds in the 100m sprint at the Seoul Olympics.By this time, the focus was switching in many sports from steroids to blood-boosting drugs, particularly EPO. But a reliable test for this was not introduced until the 2000 Sydney Olympics, by which time its use was rife, particularly in cycling. The early 1990s saw a rash of deaths linked to the drug, many of which occurred when cyclists were asleep. This is because EPO, if misused, can thicken the blood beyond what the heart, which slows during rest, is able to deal with.The full extent of what cyclists were up to was revealed in 1998 with the “Festina affair”, when members of the Tour’s top team (sponsored by watchmaker Festina) were caught systematically doping with EPO and a series of other substances after customs officials discovered a haul of drugs in a team official’s car. Over the following months, the full story came out, from the kitty maintained to buy the drugs to the detailed doping diaries kept by the team’s medical staff. Even the official transporting the drugs was doping: to stay awake while driving, he had taken “pot belge” – a well-known concoction among cyclists that includes cocaine, amphetamines, caffeine and morphine.The Festina affair led to the formation of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), the international body that co-ordinates and monitors the fight against sports doping. It also triggered a degree of soul-searching in the cycling community.Cheating is part of cycling lore. Maurice Garin, the first winner of the Tour de France in 1903, was stripped of his title the following year because officials believed he’d caught a train during part of the race. It has featured for so long partly because cycling is one of the hardest sports of all. The early organisers of the Tour wanted to make the race so tough that only a handful would finish. When they added mountain routes – then little more than dirt tracks in remote areas – they were spat at and called “assassins” by the racers.Although organisers now make sure that no leg of the race is too extreme, cycling still demands a mix of strength and endurance that means the smallest performance gains can make a huge difference. “Cycling is exceptionally vulnerable to doping because it’s like creating human F1 cars,” says Vaughters. “It takes the human body to limits that just aren’t seen in other sports. This means it is very much predisposed because it’s so high-performance.”Even outside cycling, the scandals have kept coming. In 2003, athletics was jolted by the Balco affair, named after the US laboratory that manufactured a steroid known to users as “the clear” and to scientists as tetrahydrogestrinone, or THG. Those caught included Tim Montgomery, the US sprint star who had his 2002 100m record nullified, and his now ex-wife Marion Jones, winner of five medals (three of them gold) at the Sydney Olympics. Although she never tested positive, Jones confessed in 2007 to lying to a grand jury over the ­matter and was stripped of her titles.Within cycling, the positive doping tests continue. Most famously, Floyd Landis lost his 2006 Tour title after testing positive during the race; last year’s Tour saw a series of riders caught with a new version of EPO that they had thought to be undetectable. Small wonder trust in cycling and sport more generally is so low.…The upshot of the permanent suspicion, especially for cycling, is a lot of testing. In Boulder, the entire Garmin team are called back from a beer-fuelled night out in a brewery when officials from the UCI (International Cycling Union), cycling’s governing body, show up unexpectedly for testing.The riders are used to the testers, whom they nickname, perhaps predictably, the vampires. Each athlete expects to be tested somewhere between 40 and 50 times this year through a combination of visits by the UCI, national cycling federations, race organisers and, most of all, through Garmin’s internal testing programme.To begin to build up the biological profiles, blood and urine samples are at first taken every few days. This then eases to fortnightly for a few months before slipping to roughly monthly. There will also be tests at races to monitor what happens to the riders’ profile under physical stress. The results are analysed by an independent laboratory and made available to the official anti-doping authorities. The team would be notified of any riders with positive tests or with anomalies that needed investigating. Those riders are then suspended and subjected to further testing. Vaughters would be sacked should anyone on the team test positive, and Garmin can walk away from its sponsorship. In the two years the scheme has run, the tests have thrown up a couple of questionable results, but these were found to have causes other than drugs.Creating longitudinal profiles is not a simple process. Every­one’s blood volume fluctuates through the day: exercise, and it will be different from when you are lying in bed. Analyses of results have to take account of this, together with other factors such as the altitude that the tests are conducted at (higher altitudes boost red blood cells). That means that the testing is not cheap. The annual cost for each athlete will be approximately $20,000, which, for a top-level team such as Garmin with between 25 and 30 riders, amounts to roughly half-a-million dollars out of their total annual budget of about $8m-$10m. This would be enough to recruit at least a couple of very good riders.But the tests do have an advantage beyond proving athletes’ innocence. They also give the team extra data on how a rider is performing. Cycling is, at heart, a gritty, working-class European sport where the training methods of 20 or 30 years ago are still revered today. Its expansion into the US and other English-speaking cultures, where its followers are largely ­middle-class and college-educated, has brought a new interest in the science of the sport. Vaughters again draws a comparison with Grand Prix motor racing. “It’s almost like a Formula 1 team because you can see how the car is adapting to the load and the nutritional changes and so on. You wouldn’t be able to see that without consistent testing.” As a result of the monitoring, he has changed riders’ training programmes.Vaughters believes longitudinal testing could be the key to dramatically cutting doping. Drug-taking becomes a vicious circle because everyone believes everyone else is doing it, and so to win, they must do it too. If it is widely accepted that ­others are winning clean, many athletes will, it is hoped, feel far less pressure to cheat.Some scientists are sceptical that it can be that simple in practice. Michael Ashenden is an Australian anti-doping expert working with the UCI to develop a “biological passport” based on longitudinal testing. This will, controversially, give the organisation the power to sanction riders because of suspicious changes in their profiles, even without a positive test. Ashenden says the doping trend – or suspected trend – these days is to use a mixture of EPO and blood transfusions, with both at levels low enough not to test positive or be easy to spot on a longitudinal profile.When we talk, I bring up an oft-quoted point about average speeds on the Tour de France getting slower. It’s a fact touted as proof that there is less doping. Ashenden laughs and shakes his head. Cycling, with its long, successive days in the saddle, is not all about maximum effort all the time, but more the ability to recover from each day’s effort in order to be ready to go again. “Say you’re cycling at 36kph. When you’re on EPO, you’re still cycling at 36, but it feels easier. And when you stop that night, you recover more quickly. Three weeks of the guy next to you flogging his guts out, but you’re just riding along merrily. That doesn’t show up in speeds or statistics.”To be fair, Ashenden doesn’t think it’s just cycling; his suspicions extend to all sport. “There are very few sports that don’t either have short, intense bursts or an endurance component. Sports all the way from road cycling down to the 100m sprint have been shown to be using blood doping. Everything else more or less falls within those two bounds, so if they’re your bookends and they’re using it, why should you think something in the middle is not?”When Millar used EPO, it was to get the wins his team were demanding. He had become a young star of the sport when he won a stage in his first Tour de France in 2000 and his presence was often required for the team to be invited to a race. By that point, he was aware of the scale of cheating that was going on because some of the riders were getting flasks of ice delivered to keep their drugs cool. Even after the 1998 ­Festina affair, it was clear that nothing had really changed. “That was when I started to get very resentful,” he says. “But I made it through 2000. By the time it was 2001, I had just given up. I realised nobody cared if I was clean or not.”Millar is matter-of-fact when talking about his transgressions and it is clear that his comeback after his ban ended in 2006 is a form of redemption, although he says it has gone far beyond that now. He has always been a candid interviewee, but his frankness about his past is still rare in a sport with an unspoken code of silence when it comes to the outside world – a code that has made the doping culture so hard to break. When Millar was caught in 2004, he says it was almost a relief. But for his fans, including fellow cyclist Bradley Wiggins, it was hard to take. “We all looked up to him,” he says. “He was someone who was immensely talented, so it was never really doubted that he wasn’t doing it off just sheer talent and working hard. It was quite shocking at the time because I think you never imagine it to happen to one of your own.”Wiggins has long been vocal in attacking doping, but he had his own moment with the French police in the 2007 Tour de France when his teammate Cristian Moreni tested positive for testosterone. At the finish of that day’s race, all the team were arrested and questioned by the police. “That was not how sport’s supposed to be,” says Wiggins, with habitual understatement. “It really, for the first time, made me question my involvement in the sport. It was definitely my lowest point.”…Proving yourself clean is a lot of work but the Garmin team believes it makes business sense. With no gate receipts, teams rely entirely on corporate sponsors and a number of these have left the sport in the wake of doping scandals. Getting Garmin to underwrite the longitudinal testing is likened by Vaughters to the choice a customer makes when they buy an organic banana rather than a regular, cheaper one. “We can actually create a consumer preference if we do this right,” he says. “And if you do that, all of a sudden the massive amount of money that it takes to properly test these athletes makes sense for sponsors as opposed to being seen as a drain.”The team has won admiration among the jaded sports media for its stance, adding to the publicity value for its backer. The bigger question is whether other sports should adopt a similar approach. Cyclists have long complained that their sport comes up with positive tests because it does much more testing than most others. Recently, athletes including tennis player Rafael Nadal have begun complaining about new Wada rules that mean they now have to provide their exact whereabouts for an hour each day when they are available to be tested – a requirement to which cyclists have long been accustomed. Random, out-of-competition testing is much more effective at catching dopers, but is being resisted by many sports as a violation of athletes’ privacy.Vaughters is unrepentant about what his riders go through. He has a high profile within the sport and says that since the Tour de France last summer, he has been approached almost daily by those wanting to thank him for introducing the testing. For fans of cycling, made cynical by years of ­scandal, it takes quite a lot for them to believe the sport can clean up. “It’s a privilege to be a professional athlete, it isn’t a right,” says Vaughters. “Because they decided to take on the notoriety and the money and all that goes with it, then there are certain res­ponsibilities. And one of those is proving that you are worthy of being a role model.“People want a reason to believe. So we just have to give them that.”Jennifer Hughes is the FT’s financial correspondent and also writes regularly about cycling"

year target by increasing sales by nearly 30 per cent compared with 2007. It expects to continue to increase its revenue by between 10 and 20 per cent this year, although the average selling price of its phones will fall slightly.According to CLSA, the Asia-focused brokerage arm of Crédit Agricole, HTC commanded 8 per cent of the global smartphone market last year. It is one of the fastest-growing makers of smartphones, the type of mobile phones that offer advanced, computer-like capabilities.It is also at the forefront of the battle between Google and Microsoft to provide the underlying operating system for this new generation of phones, as HTC is both the maker of the first phone using Google’s Android operating system and also the world’s biggest manufacturer of Windows-based phones.But the smartphone market is becoming more competitive as computer makers crowd into the market.Taiwan’s Asus, pioneer of the mini-notebook sector, recently tied up with US navigation devices maker Garmin to launch phones focusing on location-based applications. Meanwhile, Taiwan’s Acer, the world’s third-biggest PC maker, has just unveiled its first smartphone.Mr Chou said there was room for improvement in phones’ ability to provide more efficient user experiences through better software. For example, HTC found its users often became “quite frustrated with trying to access other phone functions, like SMS, while in the middle of a call”, said Mr Chou, as it sometimes resulted in the user accidentally cutting the line while trying to find the right buttons.“Everything is down to the usability,” he said, especially as the line blurs between business market, the traditional users of smartphones, and the mass market. “More advanced doesn’t necessarily mean more features”.At the World Mobile Congress, which opened in Barcelona Monday, HTC unveiled new versions of phones using both operating systems: an updated, smaller Google phone, which will be distributed by Vodafone, as well as a second version of HTC’s Windows-based Touch Diamond phone.Mr Chou said that the two operating systems embody “very different set of values . . . Microsoft Windows Mobile is strong in office [related functions], while Google is very strong in [providing an] online experience”."
42;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2008-07-21T18:13:21Z;TomTom moves to reassure over its debt;;TomTom, the Dutch maker of satellite navigation devices, sought on Monday to reassure investors about its debt after the completion last month of its acquisition of digital mapmaker Tele Atlas.The firm’s share price, which has dropped 61 per cent over the past year, has been pressured in recent months by speculation that the debts it incurred to fund the €2.9bn acquisition were stretching loan covenants.The group said it ended the second quarter with a net debt of €1.3bn, or 2.8 times net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. It said it expected this ratio to drop below 2.5 times by the end of 2009.“TomTom is comfortable with the covenants of the loan based on how we see the business going forward,” the company said. It confirmed the covenants were based on the ratio of net debt to ebitda but did not say what limits were in place.It won control of Tele Atlas last November after a bidding war with US rival Garmin, seeing control of the maps as crucial to developing more sophisticated products. The bidding war was sparked after Nokia bought Navteq, Tele Atlas’s main competitor, for €8.1bn.TomTom, which reported its results a day earlier than expected, said net profit fell from €68m a year earlier to €52m. Earnings per share fell from €0.58 to €0.41.However, after a weak first quarter, the group reported healthy sales, partly thanks to an updated line-up of products.TomTom sold 3.1m devices in the quarter, up 70 per cent from a year earlier, although the average selling price of each unit has dropped a third. Revenues for the group rose from €380m a year ago to €453m.“Consumer demand for our products and services proved resilient in the face of difficult macroeconomic conditions,” Harold Goddijn, chief executive, said in a statement.TomTom’s shares closed 6.7 per cent higher at €16.05, before the results were released.
43;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2008-07-11T22:39:58Z;End of a vicious cycle;;Matt White waves at the crowds lining the road as he eyes the bumper only inches in front of the car he is driving. “This is what’s great about cycling – its free for the fans, and you get so close to the riders,” he says.A professional rider himself last year, the Australian is directing the Garmin-Chipotle team in their first Tour de France. Driving just behind the peloton, or main group of riders, White has to cope with avoiding other teams’ cars, riders pedalling perilously close as they make their way back to the bunch and excited spectators snapping pictures inches from the riders and vehicles.At the same time, he’s trying to direct the team by listening to race radio, talking with his own riders by radio and dealing with any emergency, from flat tyres to crashes. “I love it,” he grins, as the race winds its way through the Loire region of western France.His upbeat attitude reflects that of the Tour as its first week draws to a close. Many French newspapers literally wrote the race’s obituary last year after drugs scandals grabbed the headlines for a second year running, while Lance Armstrong, the retired seven-time champion, dealt cycling a blow when he disbanded the team he part-owned, citing the depressing environment.But despite the negative publicity, the crowds have turned out again and the stories so far have focused on the racing and the event’s carnival mood.At the start each day, hordes of fans hover around the team buses seeking autographs. On the relatively new and young Garmin team, those of White and Jonathan Vaughters, the team’s manager and also a former professional rider, are as sought-after as the riders themselves. The team won a wild-card entry to the Tour and know they have to justify their place.So far all is going well. Their American rider Will Frishkorn came second on stage three in a breakaway ride and the team have two other riders, Scotland’s David Millar and Christian Vande Velde of the US, in the top 10 overall. Millar and Vande Velde, both established riders, joined the team this year as management upgraded its cyclists in order to compete in the top races.Frishkorn has been with the team from its early days when it was a small US-based outfit run by Vaughters, a former team-mate of Armstrong.“This was always Jonathan’s plan, to be here, and I think a lot of people thought he was crazy, but I had faith,” says Frishkorn, who still finds it unbelievable to be on the Tour himself.With riders such as Millar and Vande Velde, the team had the calibre to make the Tour – but it was arguably their strident anti-doping message that was even more attractive to the race organisers. This was the brainchild of Vaughters, who helped develop their rigorous testing programme, which goes far beyond the tough regime imposed on the rest of the sport.Garmin riders have hair, blood and urine samples taken regularly. Unlike standard doping tests which, cat-and-mouse-style, aim to catch riders out, these do not test for specific substances but are analysed by an independent laboratory to establish an athlete’s biological profile. If these “biomarkers” move beyond set parameters, the rider is benched until they return to normal.The approach aims to shift the balance between the risks and rewards of cheating. By suspending riders merely for suspicious levels, it brings the financial risks of doping much closer to home since benched riders will lose precious race time and could struggle to get a contract for the next year. The frequency of the testing also rules out doping opportunities.“Our system works because we take the temptation away,” says White. “The guys now starting out are used to all the controls and for them it’s normal not to see or hear of doping.”The same system is being used by Team High Road, which announced that Columbia sportswear would be its new title sponsor in the weeks before the Tour began. Vaughters’ team did likewise, gaining the support of Garmin, best known for its satellite navigation devices. The company says the decision to back the team was purely a marketing decision.Doug Ellis, a New York investor and the team’s owner, says the sponsorship was an endorsement of the team’s anti-doping stance and a boost to the sport as a whole. “New money is an indication that cycling is off the bottom and coming back,” he says.So far, this Tour has enjoyed a week in the headlines purely for excellent racing. Its organisers are hoping, like Ellis, that the emphasis has truly changed.
44;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2008-07-03T19:16:42Z;Gadgets find new ways forward;;"Portable navigation devices, or GPS-based satellite navigation systems, have become one of the hottest consumer electronic gadgets for drivers – as shown by the frequency with which they are a target for thieves.I have been a big fan of in-car GPS navigation systems from the start. Even so, I have learned over the years that it makes sense to prepare for a road journey by also printing out maps and directions from a web-based service such as Google Maps, Yahoo, or MapQuest as a back-up.In preparation for the next Taylor family road-trip – the peak summer holiday driving season is about to start in the US – I checked out the latest GPS units from the market leaders: TomTom (www. tomtom.com) in Europe, Garmin (www.garmin.com) in North America, and an innovative new system from a US-based start-up called Dash (www.dash.net).Most GPS devices have a lot in common. Virtually all use map data supplied by either Navteq or Tele-Atlas, have the same high-performance GPS receiver chips, and have similar point-of-interest (POI) data­ bases. Most vendors have caught up with TomTom, the Dutch company that pioneered the first easy-to-use and operate GPS systems, and now build devices that feature similar touchscreen interfaces and easy-to-use software.The prices have plunged too. Only recently, the cheapest systems cost more than $300, but today some are as little as $150 even with fairly advanced features.As a result, GPS system manufacturers have had to differentiate their products with extras, such as using voice for instruction as well as typing, real-time traffic data and being able to play music or display pictures.So, for example, TomTom’s flagship Go 930, one of the most sophisticated devices available, includes a feature that guides you towards the correct lane as you approach a junction, and another that provides easy access to traffic information with the optional Traffic Receiver add-on or via a subscription to its Traffic service (currently available for around 10 European countries, including the UK).Other features include being able to dictate your destination and a built-in FM transmitter so the device can hook up to your vehicle’s sound system.Similarly, Garmin’s top-of-the line Nuvi 880 boasts plenty of entertainment and travel tools, integrated access to MSN Direct content including weather, traffic information and local petrol prices, hands-free calling through its integrated Bluetooth technology and – the star feature – full and remarkably accurate speech recognition that means you can control the Nuvi and navigate all its menu options with voice commands.Both are impressive devices, with advanced features for technophiles and yet simple enough for virtually anyone to use. But there are important differences.
TomTom Go 930
I particularly like the lane guidance feature and in my experience, TomTom also does a good job optimising route calculations based on historical traffic data. It enlists the driving experiences of TomTom users through its Map Share technology in which drivers report back with changes like blocked roads or new street names.TomTom’s Bluetooth integration works very well, although the
list of supported mobile phones is limited.One let-down is that the Traffic service is not available everywhere. But, more important, I found the voice recognition feature, designed to let users enter a destination using speech in­stead of typing, mostly unpredictable and inaccurate, especially on numbers. This is a pity because voice input is potentially more convenient and safer.Garmin Nuvi 880In contrast, the Garmin Nuvi 880’s voice recognition technology works very well and allows users not only to say their destination, but also to control most of the features. In fact the Nuvi 880 is the first portable GPS product with full speech recognition capabilities.The Nuvi 880’s sleek and slim design and integrated Bluetooth capabilities are also big attractions. Unfortunately, the MSN Direct over-the-air radio service is available only in the US, and the $1,000 (£500 in the UK) price is a little steep, especially alongside the $450 (£350) TomTom Go 930.Dash Navigation’s Dash Express
I have also been testing a GPS system, called Dash Express, that takes an innovative approach to in-car navigation and mobile search.The Dash Express, which costs $299 for the device (it is not yet available in Europe) is built around an integrated GPRS cellular data module and WiFi technology, so the device is always connected to the internet. The internet connection costs $10 a month after a three-month free trial.This has some key advantages. First, Dash Express can automatically download the latest software, features, maps, and traffic data to the device.Second, it enables the device to deliver up-to-the minute internet-based information from the Yahoo Local search service or other websites while you are driving. I used my test unit to find the cheapest petrol nearby, local movie listings and the nearest cash-dispensing bank ATM machine.Third, each Dash unit is part of the Dash Driver Network. It sends in­formation anonymously to Dash about your vehicle’s speed and position, which it uses to calculate traffic conditions in real time and send the data back to Dash Express units so drivers can be alerted to traffic problems. Obviously its usefulness depends on the number of Dash units on the road. But Dash also taps into more traditional sources of traffic data, inc­luding details supplied by road sensors, ensuring that even if there are few other Dash Express units in the vicinity, users still receive the best information available.Dash owners can also use the con­nectivity of Dash Ex­press to send an address from an internet-connected PC directly to their device – typically, the transfer takes just seconds. I found this is the quickest and easiest way to send details of my planned destination before I leave home so that when I get into my car I simply select the new destination on the screen and hit ‘Go’.Like other GPS navigation devices, Dash Express does the rest, providing users with a choice of routes and then directing the driver to the destination with voice instructions."
45;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2008-04-08T16:20:16Z;Europe loses steam as tech stocks drag;;Dutch digital navigation device maker TomTom tumbled yesterday after a surprise profit warning as wider European markets snapped a two-day winning streak.Fears that more downbeat first quarter sales figures could be in the pipeline weighed on the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300, which was 0.8 per cent lower at 1,318.39, as the earnings season kicked off on a sour note across the AtlanticIn an unexpected trading statement, TomTom said it expects full-year revenues of €1.8bn to €2bn, cutting its earlier outlook.The announcement echoed a similar warning from US rival Garmin last week. TomTom shares fell 13.8 per cent to €22.78 – their lowest level since 2005.Petercam analyst Eric de Graaf said that market leaders Garmin and TomTom had been able to gain market share in the satellite navigation market by dropping prices of handheld devices.“Previously there were sharp declines in component costs so prices could be reduced without significant effects on margins. That may no longer be the case, so you will see a lot of pain in the industry, “ he added.TomTom’s CEO reiterated that the company was committed to buying out digital mapmaker Tele Atlas, which dropped 2.3 per cent to €24.34.“Everything points to TomTom’s willingness to close the Tele Atlas deal at almost any price, but that still doesn’t mean that it will close and that is reflected in the Tele Atlas share price,” said de Graaf.Also in Amsterdam, chip maker ASML fell 6.3 per cent to €15.70 after Credit Suisse downgraded its price target from €23 to €20. The brokerage said ASML was the only quality name in the European semiconductor industry because it had no US dollar exposure.European technology stocks were dealt a blow by Advanced Micro Devices of the US, the second-largest maker of computer processors, which said it would cut 10 per cent of its workforce after first-quarter sales fell more sharply than expected.The news drove investors to cash in profits on chipmakers across the Atlantic. German peer Infineon dropped 6.7 per cent to €4.74 after Credit Suisse downgraded it to “neutral” from “outperform, while in France ST Microelectronics fell 1.8 per cent to €7.22.“The level of the US dollar versus the euro will impact operating margins significantly in 2008/9 for European companies within the sector, whose revenues are largely US dollars denominated with a cost base in euros,” said Adrien Bommelaer at Credit Suisse.“We expect this will lead to more earnings downgrades,” he added.Banking stocks put in a mixed performance with Swiss giant UBS extending its gains, edging up 0.7 per cent to SFr35.64. Rival Credit Suisse fell 0.4 per cent to SFr57.60 while Julius Baer retreated 1.5 per cent to SFr74.50.In Germany, Deutsche Postbank, fell 3.7 per cent to €58.69 after the chief executive of parent company Deutsche Post’s said he may put off the sale of the bank. Postbank has long been seen as a takeover target for rival German banks hoping for a slice of the lucrative German retail banking market.Across the border in France, BNP Paribas fell 0.8 per cent to €69.68 after management said worsening market volatility would make it difficult for the company to fulfil its promise matching last year’s investment banking revenues difficult.Fears that the credit crissis would continue to bite weigh on the sector, dealers said.France’s Natixis fell 2.2 per cent to €10.36 and Dexia slid 2.8 per cent to €18.25, while Anglo Irish Bank fell 3.9 per cent to €8.050
46;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2008-04-08T13:33:39Z;TomTom troubles;;In the 19th century a considerable amount of military manpower was used to draw detailed maps of the British Isles. Updated regularly ever since, this valuable intellectual property is owned by Ordnance Survey and protected by a tiny, but intentional flaw in each map that identifies copies. But the road maps based on the data have become cheap commodity items. The challenge for personal navigation device maker TomTom is to avoid that fate.The attempt is not going well. TomTom shares lost another 10 per cent on Tuesday morning following a trading update. The Dutch group has now seen its market capitalisation shrink by two-thirds from its October high. The problem is rapidly falling prices. Nervous about the outlook for consumer spending, electronics retailers have been clearing inventory, as have some smaller map device makers. So while unit sales unit sales for the satnav market doubled in North America in the first quarter, compared with 2007, and grew by 40 per cent in Europe, TomTom’s revenues actually fell. Margins collapsed, and full year guidance for sales has been cut by a tenth.TomTom has product updates ahead that it hopes will reinvigorate sales of high-end models. But the group’s difficulties appear more profound. Penetration growth is being driven by the cheapest devices, which will continue to put pressure on average selling prices. Competition remains tough, particularly as US peer Garmin is trying to increase its market share in Europe. Meanwhile subscription- based services such as traffic updates, remain a long way off from making a material contribution. Developing the software and services side of the business is essential and explains the rationale for taking over map designer Tele Atlas. But if the competition authorities approve the deal, the €1.8bn of debt necessary to fund it will leave TomTom with little room for manoeuvre if rivals push harder on pricing. The way ahead is far from clear.Post and read comments on this Lex
47;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2008-04-03T19:28:20Z;Profit taking leads European bourses lower;;TomTom, the Dutch personal navigation device maker, fell after a US rival forecast a steep decline in quarterly revenues as consumers tightened their belts.TomTom shares dropped 3.9 per cent to €25.73 after Garmin of the US said first-quarter revenue would fall between 40 and 50 per cent.In Amsterdam, mapmaker Tele Atlas also lost ground, retreating 2.6 per cent to €24.Garmin and TomTom are going head-to-head in a battle for market share in Europe’s satellite navigation device market.Wider European markets were weaker as banks followed two sessions of strong gains with profit-taking, drawing the sector lower. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 was down 0.4 per cent to 1312.10.The main bright spot was Syngenta, the Swiss agrichemicals group, which rose 5.9 per cent to SFr299.75 after raising its earnings outlook following a 20 per cent jump in first-quarter sales.The industry has been driven by soaring demand for crop protection products and fertilisers thanks to rising agricultural commodity prices that have prompted farmers to try to boost crop yields.Yara International, the Norwegian fertiliser maker, rose 6.8 per cent to NKr306 after JPMorgan lifted its price target to NKr380 from NKr350 and kept its “overweight” rating citing strong increases in the price of nitrogen fertilisers.Germany’s Bayer rose 1.7 per cent to €52.49 while Dutch rival Akzo Nobel climbed 2.3 per cent to €52.82.K&S, the German potash group, climbed a further 2.4 per cent to €225.17 thanks to rising prices for the fertiliser constituent.Among the banks giving back some of their recent gains, Natixis, the French investment bank, tumbled 9.3 per cent to €10.26, Anglo Irish Bank slid 8 per cent to €8.60 while Germany’s Commerzbank shed 3.3 per cent to €21.85 and Switzerland’s UBS lost 4.7 per cent to SFr32.40.Deutsche Bank fell 1.5 per cent to €75.15, but WestLB said the shares had reached a stage where, in spite of recent writedowns and reduced earnings estimates, valuation had become “compelling”.Portugal’s Banco Espirito Santo swam against the tide, gaining 4.9 per cent to €12.15 after announcing that its capital position and liquidity remained strong and it would maintain its growth outlook through to 2010.Metrovacesa, the Spanish real estate developer, fell 11.8 per cent to €85.50 on rumours that the Sanahuja family, which currently owns around 70 per cent of the shares, was to lower its stake in order to raise the free float.PPR, the French luxury goods group that owns the Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent brands, fell 3.8 per cent to €90.77 after MF Global downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “buy” a day after Deutsche Bank cut its rating to “hold” from “buy”.Dollar weakness has hit companies that rely on US sales for a large part of their revenues and will bite further, said Roger Hirst, European equity research director at Bear Stearns.Air France-KLM gained 2.4 per cent to €19.35 after it withdrew from takeover talks with Alitalia. The Italian airline, which is now teetering on the verge of bankruptcy, had its shares suspended.Low-cost Irish carrier Ryanair dropped 4.5 per cent to €2.89 after oil costs rose. Germany’s Lufthansa fell 1.2 per cent to €17.64.French beverage group Pernod Ricard extended its gains, rising 3.7 per cent to €73.09 as investors cheered its €5.6bn acquisition of Absolut vodka maker Vin & Sprit.
48;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2008-04-02T16:36:20Z;Raymarine rises 22% on approach;;Shares in Raymarine jumped after the marine electronics specialist received an approach from a possible buyer.The company, formed by a management buy-out of Raytheon’s recreational marine division in 2001, floated on the full list at the end of 2004 with a share price of 152p.The shares reached a peak of almost 500p early last year, but then halved because of tough times in the US market, which accounted for almost half the £140.7m total turnover.On Wednesday the company described the approach as preliminary, and there was no certainty that an offer would be made. The shares closed up 22 per cent at 299¾p.A note from Panmure Gordon identified three possible trade buyers – Garmin of the US, Furuno of Japan and Navico of Norway. Oliver Wynne-James, Panmure’s analyst, suggested that several other European yachting suppliers might be interested.He predicted that a private equity buyer might be prepared to pay up to 12 times forecast earnings for this year, equivalent to about 325p a share. However, trade buyers might be able to find up to £60m of synergies, raising the potential price to 385p.Raymarine in February reported a jump in annual pre-tax profits from £14.1m to £23.4m as margins continued to improve following the outsourcing of production to Hungary. It said the strength of sales in the UK, Europe and Asia had helped to offset the weaker US market.Malcolm Miller, chief executive, said at the time that he expected the US market to remain flat but that regions outside the US would continue to expand in much the same way as they did in 2007. Builders of mid-to-large boats were, he said, reporting healthy orders.The company last year acquired three of its distributorships and has since bought its Italian and Finnish distributors.
49;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2008-02-21T19:47:37Z;Tom Tom gets lost;;Can TomTom plot a route back to the hearts of investors? The Dutch maker of electronic navigation devices has seen its market capitalisation almost halve in the last four months, including a 9 per cent drop following full-year results.The problem is a familiar one in consumer electronics: the battle to maintain margins as prices fall and maturity approaches. So far TomTom has used falling input prices to its advantage, passing savings onto customers to drive volume growth and build market share. So while average price tags in the fourth quarter were almost 40 per cent lower than the year before, margins were steady.Yet sales growth in its core European market is slowing as penetration rises and competition increases. Pre-installed navigation systems are moving into the standalone device market. US competitor Garmin warned on Monday that average selling prices could fall faster than component prices this year. As TomTom will need North America to supply a large chunk of the 20 per cent sales growth it is targeting this year, a price war could eat into margins.Still, longer term there is a clear opportunity to increase high margin service revenues – currently contributing just 5 per cent of turnover. The larger the user base TomTom can build, the greater potential there is to sell map updates and real time traffic information. These should be able to coexist happily with the pedestrian focused services on offer from the mobile phone makers.The real value is in intellectual property and software, hence TomTom’s intention to buy map designer Tele Atlas. Assuming the European competition authorities approve the deal, and that TomTom is overpaying by 30 per cent, Tele Atlas would account for around a third of TomTom’s enterprise value.

50;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2007-12-19T01:08:23Z;Wall St volatile as credit fears continue;;Wall Street stocks battled through another volatile session on Tuesday to end in positive territory but not before the major indices had fluctuated wildly amid continuing credit market anxiety.A massive injection of liquidity from the European Central Bank primed stocks for an early rally on Tuesday but the brokerage sector struggled after some cautionary comments from Goldman Sachs’ chief financial officer.Stocks traded higher for most of the morning, then fell sharply, before rebounding strongly as traders weighed the boost to liquidity against lingering credit market fears.The S&P 500 closed up 0.6 per cent at 1,454.96, well off its highs for the session, but having fallen as much as 0.7 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.8 per cent to 2,596.03 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 per cent to 13,232.47.A recent market downturn has dragged the S&P below its 200-day moving average, a bearish indicator and a blow to those hoping for a December rally.“I’m very disappointed with the way the market has reacted over the last four or five days. The rally that we had in place till last Tuesday [we thought] would continue to have legs,” Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said.Of the 10 leading sectors on the S&P on Tuesday, utilities and energy were strongest while financials again lagged the market.Investors expecting a Goldman-induced rally were disappointed in spite of quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. Some chastening words from David Viniar helped to depress a range of investment banking stocks on Tuesday.“We’re cautious about the near-term outlook for our businesses as we see dislocation in some of the world’s capital markets has continued,” Mr Viniar, chief financial officer, said. Goldman’s shares fell 3.4 per cent to $201.51 after Mr Viniar said the sub-prime market had not yet bottomed out while hedge fund redemptions would increase.The company’s fourth-quarter profits rose 2 per cent to $3.22bn, helped by a good performance from its equity-trading unit, while revenues increased 14 per cent to $10.7bn.“I thought the Goldman numbers were terrific and probably should have provided more support for the market,” Mr Orlando said.Goldman was kicking off a big week for Wall Street’s investment banks. Morgan Stanley, down 3 per cent at $48.07, reports on Wednesday and Bear Stearns, 1.6 per cent lower at $92.59, on Thursday. Both are expected to reveal mortgage-related losses.Investment banking stocks lagged in spite of news that the ECB had allotted €348.6bn ($502bn) in short-term loans to help stave off the threat of a year-end liquidity crisis.The move followed a $20bn term loan auction by the Federal Reserve, the results of which will be known on Wednesday.Homebuilders wobbled after construction permits plumbed a 14-year low. Although housing starts fell less than expected last month, the 3.7 per cent decline was accompanied by a 16-year low for single-family home construction. The S&P homebuilder index closed 0.5 per cent higher at 360.22.Adobe Systems provided a boost to the software and services sector after it reported fourth quarter profits rose 21 per cent, beating Wall Street’s expectations.The shares added 2.8 per cent to $42.03 after Adobe increased revenues by 34 per cent and said it would buy back an additional 30m shares. Deutsche Bank upgraded the shares to “buy”.On the Dow, large-cap tech names, including IBM, up 1.7 per cent at $106.31, and Hewlett Packard, 1.6 per cent higher at $36.61, enjoyed strong gains. Tech laggards included Garmin, the navigation device maker, which fell 7.3 per cent to $94.35.After the market closed Palm, the smartphone maker said it made a $9.6m loss for the third quarter and revenues declined. The stock closed up 5 per cent at $5.93 but fell 10.6 per cent in after-hours trade.Consumer-electronics vendors were also in focus after Best Buy’s better-than-expected results were overshadowed by its downbeat guidance. Circuit City Stores, which reports quarterly results on Friday, fell as much as 10 per cent before recovering to close 1 per cent lower at $6.62.
51;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2007-12-09T22:10:51Z;Satnav gadgets show way in seasonal gift sales;;Personal navigation devices, the dashboard-mounted gadgets used for turn-by-turn driving instructions, are set to take the honours as the breakthrough consumer electronic gift this Christmas, according to early indications of sales.The holiday rush caps a year that is expected to see global sales more than double from the year before, to some 30m, marking the emergence of a new mass-market category.“It has been one of the biggest-selling categories in all of consumer electronics,” said Ross Rubin, an analyst at NPD. The firm, which tracks US retail electronics sales, is due to release figures on Monday confirming the jump in sales since the “Black Friday” start of the US holiday shopping season.In one indication of the surge in interest, seven of the 20 biggest-selling electronic products on Amazon.com at the end of last week were navigation devices, and Wal-mart confirmed that it had seen a jump in demand for the gadgets on its own website.Navigation devices emerged as a consumer category only after 2000, when the US government relaxed the technological restrictions that had prevented public use of its GPS satellite navigation system. Steady price falls since have brought the gadgets into the mass consumer market.Garmin, a big US manufacturer, last month disclosed that the average price for its devices had fallen to $270, down nearly 20 per cent from a year ago.The sales forecasts have also turned Garmin and TomTom, the Dutch company that leads the European market, into two of the hottest technology stocks. Fewer than one in five cars in the US and Europe have navigation devices, pointing to very strong sales for up to three more years, said Richard Keiser, technology analyst at Sanford C Bernstein.In spite of the boom, concerns that price declines could spiral into a damaging price war have hung over the producers in recent months. Profit margins have already been falling, with Garmin’s operating margin slipping from 38 per cent five years ago to under 30 per cent.So far, however, the declines have matched the typical pattern for when a new consumer electronics category goes mainstream, with rapid volume increases more than making up for falling prices, said Mr Keiser.Additional reporting by Jonathan Birchall
52;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;TomTom launches tie-up with Google;;TomTom, the Dutch maker of satellite navigation aids, has launched a tie-up with Google that allows users to send business addresses they find on the internet using Google maps to their devices.TomTom’s service requires the navigation device to be taken out of the car and attached to a personal computer running a piece of TomTom software.But the tie-up follows the launch last month in the Netherlands of a new generation of TomTom devices that include a mobile data link that uses Vodafone’s telephone network.The service, to be launched with Vodafone in the UK early next year, is intended to be used solely for sending traffic updates, partly due to bandwidth costs, but could later be expanded to include other information.TomTom is seeking more ways for customers to use and improve its devices, including allowing them to correct map errors or mark road works, at a time when mobile-phone makers such as Nokia are integrating global positioning system chips into more of their handsets.Harold Goddijn, chief executive, is unruffled by the threat of GPS-enabled phones replacing TomToms on car windscreens. “What you see on mobile phones will be complementary and not replace personal navigation devices,” he said last month. Last month the Dutch company emerged as the victor in a bidding war against US rival Garmin for control of mapmaker Tele Atlas. The deal is seen as strat-egically important after Nokia’s purchase of Navteq, the other big digital mapmaker.But it comes at a price. To reduce the amount of extra debt used to pay the €2.9bn ($4.3bn) price, TomTom said this week it would issue €500m of new shares.Tom Tom says one-fifth of its 15m customers have downloaded the free TomTom home software that works with Google maps.
53;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;TomTom beats Garmin in battle for Tele Atlas;;TomTom, the Dutch personal navigation device maker, on Friday looked to have won the bidding war for Tele Atlas after US rival Garmin withdrew its €2.3bn ($3.4bn) offer for the digital mapping company.Last week TomTom raised its offer for Tele Atlas to €30 per share in cash – or €2.9bn – and bought 28 per cent of the company’s shares.TomTom’s victory comes as a surprise, as it was the smaller of the two navigation companies, with a market capitalisation of $9.1bn against Garmin’s $18.5bn.However, TomTom is Tele Atlas’ biggest customer, and many analysts saw it as a better fit with the company than Garmin.Garmin had offered €24.5 a share for Tele Atlas, but on Friday said it would no longer pursue a bid. Instead, the company has opted to extend its contract with Navteq, a rival digital mapping company, for another six years and the potential to extend for a further four.Both Garmin and TomTom had been vying to buy Tele Atlas amid rapid consolidation in the digital mapping industry.Nokia, the mobile phone maker, bought Navteq – Tele Atlas’s only sizeable rival – in September for $8.1bn, and there have been concerns that mobile phones with mapping services could cannibalise the market for standalone navigation devices. Both TomTom and Garmin have been keen to own their own mapping company to be able to develop more innovative products.Garmin said its contract with Navteq would still allow the company to develop innovative mapping products. “Our objective was not necessarily to make an acquisition but to have great mapping content. We can achieve that through our great relationship with Navteq,” Garmin said. Garmin added that Navteq had given it guarantees that there would not be a conflict of interest from Nokia’s ownership of the company.Shares in Garmin rose more than 14 per cent to $96 Friday, while shares in TomTom rose more than 6 per cent to €60.36.“It would have been massively dilutive for Garmin if they had kept going with the bidding war, so this is not a bad compromise,” said Richard Valera, analyst at Needham & Co. “However, what they give up is strategic control over future features and functionality of maps. Time will tell how much of an advantage that will be for TomTom,” he said.Garmin still has a stake of about 5 per cent in Tele Atlas, bought this month, but has not disclosed whether it now plans to sell this.Tele Atlas shares fell 8.6 per cent to €29.32, a slight discount to TomTom’s offer price, reflecting some concern over whether the deal will be approved by competition regulators.
54;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2007-11-07T20:04:52Z;Europe’s carmakers shift into reverse;;Concern over rising export costs hit European equities on Wednesday after the euro hit a new record high against the dollar.Carmakers and luxury goods groups headed the list of worst-hit sectors, which all drew a large portion of revenues from the US.Germany’s BMW fell 4.1 per cent to €41.55 after Credit Suisse downgraded the stock from “outperform” to “neutral”. Local rival Volkswagen fell 1.7 per cent to €184.94, while France’s Renault lost 4.1 per cent to €104.91.Among the luxury goods sector, Swiss watchmaker Richemont fell 3.1 per cent to SFr75.8, despite JPMorgan raising its target price and giving it an “overweight” rating. Rival Swatch fell 4.5 per cent to SFr65.4. France’s LVMH fell 1.9 per cent to €84.4 and Italian designer eyewear maker Luxottica lost 1.6 per cent to €22.85.France’s CAC 40 declined 0.46 per cent to 5,683.22 while Germany’s Xetra Dax fell 0.35 per cent to 7,799.62.Shares in TomTom, the Dutch electronic navigation device maker, fell 2.7 per cent to €55.01.It raised its bid for digital mapmaker Tele Atlas to €30 a share, trumping the €24.50 offer by rival Garmin. TomTom also announced it had acquired a 28.3 per cent stake in Tele Atlas. The news sent Tele Atlas shares up 19 per cent to €32.06.Meanwhile, Swiss Life said it was to sell its Banca del Gottardo subsidiary to BSI, the Swiss banking arm of Italian insurer Generali, for SFr1.875bn. Generali fell 1.1 per cent to €31.74.Shares in Swiss Life were down 4.1 per cent to SFr312.5, however, after weak results from rival ING hit the life insurance sector.The Dutch financial services group missed third-quarter profit forecasts as trading revenues were lower during the liquidity crisis.Swedish banks slid sharply after Goldman Sachs cut its price targets on SEB and Swedbank due to slowdowns in Baltic earnings. Swedbank fell 5.6 per cent to SKr178.5 while SEB softened to 3.7 per cent at SKr171.A fair wind lifted renewable energy stocks, which topped the European gainer’s list for the second day running.An investment fund led by Al Gore, the former US vice-president turned environmental activist, bought into Spanish biofuel company Abengoa while the surging oil price, approaching $100 a barrel, also helped to boost biofuel, solar and wind power stocks across Europe.Abengoa gained 3.6 per cent to €28.38.Acciona, a family-controlled construction-to-energy company, jumped 5.3 per cent to €228.05. It is among the world leaders in wind-generated power.Solaria, which makes solar energy cells, added 7.2 per cent to €22.70 and Gamesa, the Spanish turbine maker, gained 1.2 per cent to €36.3.Denmark’s Vestas Wind, the world’s largest wind turbine manufacturer, extended Tuesday’s gains rising3.3 per cent to DKr533, while Norwegian peer Renewable Energy climbed 2.4 per cent to €298.Meanwhile France’s Total received a boost from rising energy prices, lifting it 4.7 per cent to €57.17.France’s Capgemini jumped 4 per cent to €44.5 after it raised its operating margin goal for the year and extended contract with British tax authorities for the coming three years.Positive results also boosted Henkel, which jumped 3.2 per cent to €36.62 after the German household product group lifted its organic sales growth forecast for the year to 5-6 per cent. Price increases and robust growth in Europe, Asia and Latin America offset a 6 per cent fall in third-quarter sales in the US, which accounts for 20 per cent of total sales.
55;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2007-11-06T20:04:37Z;Tele Atlas bidding war might be averted;;Tele Atlas shares fell 3.2 per cent to €26.95 on Tuesday amid talk that an anticipated bidding war for the Dutch digital mapmaking group might be averted.TomTom, the personal navigation device maker, was said to be in talks with US rival Garmin that could lead to a joint €24.50-a-share bid for Tele Atlas.The Tele Atlas acquisition is seen as key to the control of the consolidating personal navigation industry following Nokia’s purchase of Navteq, the mapmaker’s only global rival.If a joint bid won approval from regulators, TomTom and Garmin could leave Tele Atlas as a stand-alone company, but use its maps to build their navigation businesses, analysts noted.TomTom shares jumped 6.7 per cent to €56.54.The broader market snapped a three-day run of losses as resource and energy stocks attracted buyers. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.3 per cent to 1,554.17.Denmark’s Vestas Wind Systems, the world’s biggest wind turbine maker, surged 15.7 per cent to DKr516 after forecasting a 25 per cent growth in sales in 2008.The stock was boosted further by short covering, dealers said.Vestas said the improved sales forecast was a result of greater efficiency, higher prices and more activity in the sector.Shares in Norway’s solar power equipment maker Renewable Energy tracked its Danish peer upwards, rising 4.9 per cent to NKr291.Both companies have been given a shot in the arm by rising crude prices, as a consensus builds that more people will turn to alternative energy sources in the face of escalating oil costs.Steel stocks got a boost after a rocky two weeks with Germany’s ThyssenKrupp up 1.9 per cent to €43.68 after Deutsche Bank rated it a “buy” and upgraded its price target from €42.85 to €54.The brokerage said: “2007 was a great year for ThyssenKrupp and we have indications that this scenario is likely to repeat in 2008,” based on rising steel prices coupled with strong demand.Domestic peer Salzgitter rose 4.3 per cent to €135.55, while Sweden’s SSAB rose 2.5 per cent to SKr203 and ArcelorMittal rose 1.2 per cent to €52.9.After a turbulent few days bid rumours were back in circulation.Germany’s Siemens rose 1.3 per cent to €95.17 as talk swirled that it would make a $55-a-share takeover bid for US solar wafer manufacturer LDK Solar, which needs more capital to fund its expansion, according to analysts.French steel tube maker Vallourec got a lift from lingering rumours Alisher Us-manov, billionaire Russian metals magnate, was eyeing a stake in the company, rising 1.8 per cent to €194.03.Meanwhile, French financial group Natixis dived 5.8 per cent to €13.06 on continued subprime worries.Fitch has announced it is reviewing the ratings of bond insurers after a review of their capital to take into account collateralised debt obligation downgrades, with many US bond insurance monolines who insure fixed income products at risk of downgrades.Natixis owns CIFG, a monoline that Fitch believes is at high risk of being downgraded.After a turbulent few days, banking stocks staged a recovery with Swiss wealth manager UBS up 0.9 per cent to SFr55.1, BNP Paribas rising 0.5 per cent to 70.7 and Belgium’s Dexia adding 1.1 per cent to €19.3.Not all banks were out of the woods, however, with Credit Agricole – which reports earnings in the coming days – down 1 per cent to €25.40, and Credit Suisse off 0.4 per cent at €70.95.
56;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Battle for digital maps;;The world is full of lost souls in need of shepherding – or at least better directions. This is the assumption behind the looming battle between rival navigation device makers for the designers of digital maps.Garmin’s €24.50-a-share approach to map producer Tele Atlas on Wednesday trumped the existing offer from TomTom by 15 per cent. This implies an enterprise value for the group of €2.1bn, or almost seven times expected sales. These have been growing at about 30 per cent a year, but the Dutch map provider has been making a loss for years. On current guidance Tele Atlas will deliver an operating profit in 2007 of just €3m, and US-listed Garmin has no plans to cut costs by shedding jobs. Yet the shares leapt above the offer price in anticipation of a bidding war.The rationale for such a fight is clear. Sales of personal navigation devices are set to double this year from 16m in 2006, but the data that power them largely come from just two providers, Navteq and Tele Atlas. Following Nokia’s $8.1bn takeover of Navteq, either TomTom or Garmin will face a potentially significant competitive disadvantage.Still, most of the value of the targets resides in the databases that aggregate maps and data feeds, and the software that translates them into navigable maps. Neither are particularly difficult to replicate. TomTom shares fell on Wednesday, reflecting fear that it might pay more, or the expectation that it will lose out. Yet the latter would not necessarily be a disaster. Were TomTom to bow out, it could still buy data from Navteq or Tele Atlas, while doing deals with smaller digital map providers to build coverage. Refusing to pay an outrageous price would be a move in the right direction.
57;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2007-10-31T22:22:23Z;Garmin in €2.3bn Tele Atlas bid;;Garmin sparked a bidding war for Tele Atlas on Wednesday when it launched an unsolicited €2.3bn ($3.3bn) bid for the Dutch digital mapping company, trumping an offer by rival TomTom.US-based Garmin, which makes portable navigation devices, is offering €24.50 in cash for each Tele Atlas share, 15 per cent more than TomTom’s offer, announced in July, which values Tele Atlas at €1.8bn.Garmin’s move is the latest in a wave of consolidation in the personal navigation industry. Tele Atlas is one of only two large global providers of digital maps, and its closest rival, Navteq, was bought by Nokia for $8.1bn last month.Maps are key consumer services offered on mobile phones and the internet by companies such as Nokia and Google. There are some concerns that Garmin and TomTom’s market for standalone navigation devices may be cannibalised by mobile phones with built-in GPS and maps.Both Garmin and TomTom are keen to own a mapping company to develop more compelling products and keep down the costs of providing maps.“It is the right time for Garmin to step in and exercise a leadership role in this industry,” said Kevin Rauckman, chief financial officer.Garmin is offering a similar price as Nokia paid for Navteq – about 33 times earnings estimates for this year. However, Tele Atlas shares rose more than 16 per cent to €27.95, well above Garmin’s offer, on anticipation that Dutch-based TomTom would respond with a higher counterbid. TomTom shares fell 20 per cent to €54.20. Garmin shares fell 6.33 per cent to $112.85.Tele Atlas said it would “review the terms and conditions of the offer and further steps and will inform the market as soon as reasonably possible”.TomTom said on Wednesday that it was “considering its options” on Tele Atlas.Garmin, which has a market capitalisation of $26.1bn, compared to TomTom’s $11.1bn, has invited the Tele Atlas board to a meeting within a week. The board and International Asset Management, one of Tele Atlas’s biggest shareholders, together representing more than 17 per cent of shares, have given irrevocable undertakings to support the TomTom bid, and Garmin will want to sway them.However, Garmin said it would pursue the offer even without board support. Garmin has built a stake of between 5 and 10 per cent in Tele Atlas and needs to gain a total of 66.7 per cent of shares for the bid to succeed.Credit Suisse is lead advisor to Garmin, while Lehman Brothers is advising Tele Atlas and Goldman Sachs is advising TomTom.
58;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2007-10-31T20:33:09Z;Wall Street buoyed by Fed rate decision;;US shares surged higher on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point.The Federal Open Market Committee’s decision to cut both the fed funds rate and the discount rate by 25 basis appeared to satisfy the market. Shares fell into negative territory immediately after the decision but then soared above previous highs for the day as traders received the news most had expected.Stocks surged even as the language used in the statement accompanying the FOMC’s decision seemed to play down the likelihood of another rate cut.The FOMC said it judged that ”the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth.” One member of the Federal Open Market Committee dissented, voting to keep the fed funds rate on hold at 4.75 per cent.However, the statement also cautioned that “economic expansion will likely slow in the near-term.”Thomas Nyheim, vice president and portfolio manager at Christiana Bank & Trust said: “I think it’s pretty much what was expected. But the language of the Fed’s statement looks like this might be the last cut.”Before the publication of the FOMC decision the S&P 500 was trading as much as 0.8 per cent higher. Shares wobbled after the decision, but then rebounded.The S&P 500 closed 1.2 per cent higher at 1549.36. The Nasdaq Composite was 1.5 per cent higher at 2,859.12 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1 per cent at 13930.01.Volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Vix index, de­clined 11.6 per cent to 18.62.Brokerage stocks reacted positively to the Fed’s decision while energy and materials stocks also surged higher.The S&P investment bank index gained 2.3 per cent at 211.51. Goldman Sachs rose 3.2 per cent at $247.92 while Merrill Lynch was up 1.2 per cent at $66.02. But Citigroup fell 0.5 per cent at $41.90 after Morgan Stanley cut its rating.In earnings news Kraft Foods reported a 20 per cent fall in third-quarter profit compared with a year-ago, which had included a one-time gain. But excluding the gain, Kraft beat estimates. The shares rose 2.5 per cent at $33.41.Alcatel-Lucent, the telecoms equipment maker, reported a loss of some $373m for the third quarter, slightly larger than analysts’ expectations. But news of 4,000 more job cuts lifted the stock 3.2 per cent to $9.69.Weyerhaeuser was also higher in spite of a 55 per cent fall in net income as the US housing slump hit demand for its timber products. The shares were up 2.2 per cent to $75.91.Third-quarter profit at Newmont Mining doubled to $397m. The shares gained 9.6 cent to $50.90 Its results provided support to the S&P materials index, which closed 2.5 per cent higher at 271.42Energy stocks also made strong gains as crude oil surged to a new record close of $94.30 a barrel. The S&P energy index rose 1.9 per cent at 585.43.ExxonMobil, due to report third-quarter results on Thursday, gained 0.9 per cent to $91.93. Chevron, which reports quarterly results on Friday, rose 1.6 per cent to $91.51. National Oilwell Varco rose 4.5 per cent to $73.24.Technology stocks once again attracted buyers. Google closed at a new all-time high of $707 on reports of partnership talks between the company and Verizon Wireless. Microsoft hit a six-year high, gaining 3.5 per cent at $36.81.But Garmin declined 10.9 per cent at $107.40. The navigation device maker made an unsolicited $3.3bn bid for Tele Atlas, the digital map company, which has already agreed to be acquired by TomTom, Garmin’s rival.Investors were earlier cheered by some positive employment news. ADP Employer Services estimated companies hired 106,000 employees in October, well above economists’ forecast gain of 58,000.Meanwhile gross domestic product rose 3.9 per cent during the third quarter, more than an expected rise of 3.1 per cent. It was the strongest quarter for growth since the economy expanded by 4.8 per cent during the first quarter of 2006.There was mixed news on the inflation front, as the price index for personal consumption expenditures rose 1.7 per cent in the third quarter after a rise of 4.3 per cent in the preceding quarter. The core PCE reading, which excludes food and energy, rose 1.8 per cent.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
60;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2007-10-31T11:17:24Z;Bid activity drives European stocks higher;;Tele Atlas, the Dutch digital mapmaker, surged 15.2 per cent to €27.66 on the prospect of a bidding war between the world’s largest maker of car navigation devices TomTom and its US rival Garmin.Garmin made an unsolicited bid of €24.50 per share for Tele Atlas, in an offer that was 15 per cent higher than TomTom’s and 48 per cent higher than Tele Atlas’ share price in July. TomTom shares dived 13.6 per cent to €58.58.The TeleAtlas acquisition is seen by analysts as key to winning the battle for control of the consolidating industry in the wake of Nokia’s $8.1bn takeover this month of Navteq, Tele Atlas’s only global rival in the digital mapmaking business.Garmin plans to launch its offer by December 4, when TomTom’s offer for Tele Atlas expires, and says it has secured financing commitments for its counter-offer.Although, Garmin hoped to keep Tele Atlas’ current management in place it was willing to make a hostile bid if talks with the board this week fall through, the company said.In mid-morning trade the FTSE Eurofirst 300 was 0.4 per cent higher at 1,587.8, Frankfurt’s Xetra Dax climbed 0.2 per cent to 7990.38, the CAC 40 in Paris gained 0.4 per cent to 5824.46 and London’s FTSE 100 rose 0.3 per cent at 6678.5.Swiss biotech group Actelion jumped 5.8 per cent to €57.65 on talk that French drug company Sanofi-Aventis as planning a bid.

61;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2007-10-31T10:47:18Z;Garmin sparks bidding war over Tele Atlas;;Garmin sparked a bidding war for Tele Atlas on Wednesday when it launched an unsolicited €2.3bn ($3.3bn) bid for the Dutch digital mapping company, trumping an earlier agreed offer from rival TomTom.US-based Garmin, which makes portable GPS devices, is offering €24.50 in cash for each Tele Atlas share, 15 per cent more than TomTom’s offer, announced in July, which values Tele Atlas at €1.8bn.Garmin plans to launch the offer on December 4, the day that TomTom’s offer expires. Garmin executives called their counterparts at Tele Atlas early on Wednesday morning to advise them of the offer, but had had no previous contact.Garmin has invited the Tele Atlas board to a meeting within the next week to seek support, but has said it will pursue the offer even if it is not backed by the board.The navigation and mapping sector is undergoing consolidation, with Navteq, Tele Atlas’s key, US-based rival, due to be bought by Nokia for $8.1bn.Tele Atlas shares rose nearly 15 per cent to €27.60, well above Garmin’s offer, on anticipation that TomTom would respond with a higher counterbid. TomTom shares fell 11.66 per cent to €59.88.Like TomTom, Garmin said it would continue to run Tele Atlas as a separate company headquartered in the Netherlands, keeping management and staff.“A combined company will expand Garmin’s ability to serve more customers in wireless, in-dash automotive, internet, and enterprise markets by offering a broad range of solutions including content, applications, and devices,” Garmin said in a statement.Tele Atlas confirmed it had received the offer and said it would “review the terms and conditions of the offer and further steps and will inform the market as soon as reasonably possible.”
62;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2007-10-30T23:16:32Z;Actelion buoyed by takeover rumours;;Actelion, the Swiss biotech group, was in focus yesterday as takeover rumours circulated, pushing the stock up 5.6 per cent to €57.55.Sanofi-Aventis, the French drug company, and Roche, its Swiss peer, were touted as possible buyers. However, some traders cast doubt on the renewed bid talk, saying Actelion’s share price could be buffeted by the release today of a clinical trial from United Therapeutics, a US rival.United Therapeutics is due to release results on the trial of Remodulin, its pulmonary hypertension treatment, which are expected to show the treatment is easier to use than Ventavis, the competing drug from Actelion, according to dealers.Sanofi-Aventis gained 2.2 per cent to €60.54 after reporting forecast-beating profits and raising its full-year outlook. Roche rose 1.9 per cent to SFr220.2.European equity markets rose on the back of positive results in the banking and pharmaceuticals sectors and hopes of an interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 added 0.9 per cent to 1,595.70.Germany’s Fresenius Medical Care, the world’s largest maker of dialysis machines, climbed 7.9 per cent to €54.73. The company beat forecasts with a 14 per cent rise in third-quarter profits to $397m, on the back of cost cuts and sales growth in the US, its largest market.However, GPC Biotech shares plunged 60 per cent to €3.22 after the German company said the late-stage trial of its proposed prostate cancer drug Satraplatin failed to boost the long-term survival prospects of patients.Another major loser was TomTom, the world’s largest maker of car navigation devices, which tumbled 19 per cent to €55.06 as fears grew that the Dutch firm would get locked into a bidding war for digital mapmaker Tele Atlas with US rival Garmin.The Dutch mapmaker surged 15 per cent to €27.58 after Garmin made an unsolicited bid of €24.50 per share – an offer 15 per cent higher than TomTom’s and 48 per cent higher than Tele Atlas’s share price in July.The Tele Atlas acquisition is seen by analysts as key to winning the battle for control of the consolidating digital mapmaking sector in the wake of Nokia’s $8.1bn takeover last month of Navteq, the only global rival to Tele Atlas.Although Garmin hoped to keep Tele Atlas’s current management in place, it was willing to make a hostile bid if talks with the board this week fall through, the company said, adding it had already secured the financing for the takeover.Deutsche Bank jumped 3.7 per cent to €92.05 after issuing positive results. Germany’s biggest bank said third-quarter profits rose 31 per cent to €1.62bn as tax credits and gains from asset sales outweighed the first loss at its investment bank in five years.The news buoyed other banking stocks, with Credit Suisse up 1.4 per cent to SFr77.9 and Swiss peer UBS up 1 per cent to SFr61.95, while France’s BNP Paribas was up 2 per cent to €76.09 and Société Générale rose 2.3 per cent to €115.86.Germany’s MAN rose 4 per cent to €123.2 after Europe’s third largest truckmaker reported third-quarter operating profit that beat analysts’ estimates and raised its revenue forecast amid surging truck sales in Russia and Poland.Revenue this year will probably rise 15 per cent, compared with an earlier prediction of 10 per cent growth, the company said.Meanwhile, German carmaker Volkswagen rose 4.4 per cent to €131.Swedish engineering firms were among the biggest losers, hit by dollar weakness. Sandvik slid 2.2 per cent to SKr120 and peer Atlas Copco lost 2.1 per cent to SKr106.25.Two of Sweden’s largest banks climbed in defiance of the wider market yesterday on renewed rumours of a tie-up between the pair that could create a new force in European banking.

Tele Atlas shares were flat at €22.76, above TomTom’s offer of €21.25 a share.Eric de Graaf, Petercam analyst, cut the recommendation on TomTom shares to “hold” from “add”, saying TomTom’s acquisition plans would likely fall through.Nokia announced a plan on Monday to buy Navteq, Tele Atlas’s only global rival in the digital mapping business, in a move that would exclude other handset makers from the growing sector and weaken internet mapping suppliers such as Google or GPS providers such as Garmin.European shares edged higher, with no clear direction, as investors were cautious before Thursday’s European Central Bank and Bank of England interest rate decisions and key US jobs data Friday.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 was 0.2 per cent, or 2.69 points, higher at 1,570.95.Millennium BCP, Portugal’s largest listed bank, rose 5.2 per cent to €3.26 on speculation that it would merge with smaller rival BPI. BPI shares gained 2.6 per cent to €6.42.Telekom Austria rose 1.6 per cent to €19.11 after announcing the acquisition of a 70 per cent stake in MDC, the second largest mobile operator in Belarus, for €730m.ABN Amro suggested that STMicroelectronics, Europe’s largest chipmaker, could consider buying a US competitor to strengthen its product portfolio and offset its high sensitivity to weakness in the dollar. STM fell 1.1 per cent to €11.61.Sodexho gained 3.9 per cent to €51.11 after better-than-expected preliminary full-year results from the French catering group.Sodexho said it expected operating profits to increase from 12 per cent to 15 per cent in the year to August 31 as actions to manage food and labour costs had enabled the company to curb inflationary pressures.Shares in French media group Lagardère, a major shareholder in EADS, the aerospace company, tumbled 5.4 per cent to €58.45 after France’s top stock market watchdog passed preliminary findings from an insider trading investigation to the French courts.The regulator is investigating whether management and shareholders at the aerospace group sold shares before the company unveiled problems at aircraft unit Airbus. Shares in EADS fell 0.8 per cent to €21.71.Germany’s biggest bank, Deutsche Bank, rose 2.3 per cent to €95.68 after it said quarterly net profit exceeded €1.4bn and stuck to its 2008 profit forecast of €8.4bn.Also in the financial sector, Goldman Sachs downgraded Italian insurer Generali to “sell” from “neutral”, saying the share was due for a correction relative to its peers in the sector after outperforming them by 10 per cent over the past three months. The shares fell 1.2 per cent to €30.80.Swedish authorities said Qatar Holdings, which has applied to boost its 10 per cent stake in OMX, the Nordic bourse operator, will not be granted a fast-track application review.Sweden’s regulator must grant approval for any foreign companies seeking to own more than a 10 per cent stake in certain groups. If Qatar gets the green light, it raises the prospect of a battle for the Nordic exchange operator between Qatar and a Borse Dubai-Nasdaq alliance. OMX shares edged up 0.3 per cent to SKr282.5.

The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks was 0.9 per cent firmer at 831.97.The National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index in August fell 6.5 per cent to 85.5, a record low. The index has fallen 21.5 per cent in the past 12 months.Economists expected a fall of 2.1 per cent after July registered a 12.2 per cent decline.“This renewed deterioration in pending sales activity suggests another leg down for sales in coming months,” said TJ Marta, fixed income strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “In turn, the renewed downturn should weigh on prices and personal consumption.”But the news failed to reverse a two-day surge in homebuilder stocks pro­m­p­ted by a note from Citi Investment Research, which said it was time to buy into sector weakness.“While we don’t expect any of the homebuilders to move much lower over the near-term, we expect the larger-cap builders and those with the strongest balance sheets to benefit most from any near-term bounce – much as they did coming out of the 1990 trough,” Stephen Kim, an analyst, noted.The S&P homebuilder index climbed as high as 8.4 per cent and, although it fell back after the NAR data, it still closed 5.4 per cent higher at 453.31.Among the leading stocks on the S&P 500, Pulte Homes was 5 per cent higher at $15.50, DR Horton was up 6.5 per cent at $14.34, while Beazer Homes soared 12.4 per cent to $9.44.“Market fundamentals are actually better now than they were on July 17, which makes a strong case for the bulls,” said analysts at Bespoke Investment Group. “The price to earnings, price to book and price to sales ratios of the S&P 500 are all currently lower and the index’s dividend yield is higher.”It was a mixed day for carmakers. Ford rose 4.1 per cent to $8.57, in spite of a 21 per cent decline in US sales in September. General Motors gained 2.8 per cent to $37.05 after adjusted US sales increased 4 per cent.The Chicago Board Options Exchange volatility index, often referred to as Wall Street’s fear barometer, a measure of perceived market volatility, climbed 3.3 per cent to 18.42 on Tuesday.The index has declined about 30 per cent since the Federal Reserve cut interest rates last month.Analysts at Susquehanna Financial said selling option volatility was “the predominant trend amid the notable decline in the Vix”.In deal news, TD Bank, a Canadian bank, announced a $8.5bn deal to buy Commerce Bancorp.

65;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2007-07-23T11:52:07Z;TomTom to buy Tele Atlas for €1.8bn;;TomTom, the fast growing Dutch navigation systems company, on Monday made a €1.8bn ($2.5bn) cash offer for Netherlands-based Tele Atlas, its main supplier of digital maps, in a deal that will bring its hardware and software under one roof.The offer represents a 28 per cent premium to Tele Atlas’s last closing price and is 28 times its 2007 projected earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation. US-based Navteq, Tele Atlas’s main rival, trades at around 20 times projected ebitda.The proposed acquisition will be financed with €1.6bn in debt provided by Goldman Sachs, which advised TomTom on the transaction, with the rest from TomTom’s cash reserves.The offer has been accepted by Tele Atlas’s management and IAM, an institutional investor with a 17.4 per cent stake in the company. Its other main shareholders, Fidelity and Capital, also institutions with a combined stake of around 20 per cent, have yet to express a view.Tom Tom justified the hefty premium by saying the transaction would allow it to exploit coming developments in the industry towards more interactive maps that update information regularly with intelligent routing and real-time traffic data.The acquisition also reflects the fact that Tom Tom is flush with cash. It reported on Monday that second-quarter net profit rose 81 per cent compared with the same period last year, to €68m. Its performance has been driven by the increasing popularity and commoditisation of GPS navigation systems.One possible strategic query over the proposed deal lies in the fact that Tele Atlas also supplies maps to Nasdaq-listed Garmin, TomTom’s main rival.TomTom said Tele Atlas would honour existing contracts, raising the question of why TomTom would allow a wholly-owned company to supply its main competitor with technology that will compete directly with its own.Harold Goddijn, TomTom’s chief executive, said he believed the revenue generated from selling more advanced systems across the market outstripped possible revenue from terminating those contracts and selling to its own customer base.“We took the holistic view,” he said.TomTom also raised its 2007 volume growth targets, saying it now expects to ship between 8m and 9m systems compared to an earlier forecast of between 7m and 8m.Sales in the second quarter rose 37 per cent year-on-year to €380m. The gross margin was 45 per cent, up 2 percentage points year on year, and its operating margin was 25 per cent, also up 2 percentage points.Analysts and investors welcomed the deal, primarily because TomTom would be able to generate its own synergies while maintaining sales to Tele Atlas’s existing customers.TomTom shares rose 7.4 per cent at €44.02 while Tele Atlas was up nearly 27 per cent to €20.96. Lehman Brothers advised Tele Atlas.
66;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2007-06-22T17:56:52Z;Smart, fast and enormous fun;;"At Hawker Beechcraft’s customer delivery center in Wichita, Kansas, the airworthy Beech Model 17 biplane that sits behind the reception desk sets the tone. Racy-looking, fast and a pleasure to fly, the Staggerwing, as it was known, was the first design from the Beech Aircraft Corporation after it was set up in 1932.Behind the building is the company airfield with a huge 8,000ft runway – and its own crash trucks. Fortunately, these were not needed when I flew the Beechcraft Bonanza G36.The six-seat, single-engine
aeroplane is also a big part of Beech’s past – this is its 60th year of continuous production, during which time 18,000 Bonanzas have been delivered.It was always meant to be fast. When it was launched in 1947 the aircraft had an innovative V-tail – just two wing surfaces at the tail, each pointing out and up at about 45 degrees – to cut drag. Along the way it lost its distinctive V-tail and picked up a conventional tail. But it is still fast.It is selling fast, too – sales of the Bonanza and of the Baron (its big brother), were 16 per cent higher last year than the previous year, with 80 Bonanzas sold.I climb aboard from the right- hand side – over the wing for the pilot and co-pilot or front-seat passenger; behind the wing for the two rearward rows of seats. The few doors make a strong airframe, but also make it harder to get in and out – especially for the pilot, who has to shuffle across the co-pilot’s seat.Rear-seat passengers are well catered for, with a double door that opens wide. But though the Bonanza has six seats, it cannot – like almost all light aircraft – fill all those seats and carry full fuel. The fuel that can be taken on with four 170lb people in the aircraft gives a range of about 875 nautical miles. However, those passengers that can be accommodated are cossetted in leather and mahogany and can choose from a huge number of cup-holders.I settle into the left-hand seat, with Hawker Beechcraft demonstration pilot Justin White in the co-pilot’s seat, the garish 1950s Americana of the white-leather-covered control yokes only slightly denting the confidence inspired by the high-tech Garmin G1000 integrated flight, navigation and communications system.A screen on the left says which way is up and which way to go, while a screen on the right shows you where you are, where you are going and the weather to expect when you get there. It’s all a bit more complicated than that, but it is light years ahead of interpreting little round dials, each with its own quirky way of conveying information.A lack of cabin pressurisation tends to keep Bonanzas below 10,000ft. Even using supplemental oxygen, the ceiling of 18,500ft is not high enough to avoid all the weather, which makes the real-time weather depictions all the more necessary.With just two of us on board, the G36 leapt off the runway and the climb performance was substantially better than the 1,200ft per minute expected at maximum weight. The aeroplane feels lively, powerful and solid – a characteristic it shares with its bigger stablemates such as the King Air turboprop aircraft. And it certainly is fast – even from 5,000ft up, Kansas’s big fields, grid-pattern roads and occasional sunlit lakes fairly flashed past.However, in any aircraft that lays claim to being a serious travelling tool, the pilot must
be happy flying relatively slow blind approaches to airports through cloud, using only instruments. White pointed me to the airport at nearby Newton, and I flew a handful of instrument approaches. The Bonanza’s stability and well-weighted controls meant I could set it up in a descent and the aircraft would track true and unflustered right down to the runway threshold.For my final descent I used the Garmin GFC 700 autopilot – which, of course, flew the approach perfectly. On the 172 four-seat light aircraft from rival Wichita manufacturer Cessna, also equipped with the Garmin systems, pilots are recommended to switch on the autopilot at 800ft above the ground after taking off and not switch it off until 200ft above the ground before landing.Though the Garmin system really is that good. But it would be a shame to lose so much of the tactile pleasure of flying the Bonanza and leave it all to the autopilot.The test flightSay hello to: a speedy, capable, economical, single piston-engined six-seat airplane with electronic avionics systems better than those in many airliners.How powerful? 300hp Teledyne Continental flat 6 engineNumber of seats: six – two in the front and four in the backHow fast?

In three quarters of a century the company and its forebears have put 54,000 aircraft into the skies, 32,000 of which are still flying.The Beech Aircraft Corporation was set up in 1932 by Walter and Olive Ann Beech. It was a brave move in the darkest days of the Depression, but their story did not start there. Walter, ex-US Army Air Corps and barnstormer, had been one of the cornerstones of Travel Air Manufacturing, set up in Wichita, Kansas, in 1925 to target the emerging breed of business flyers.His partners were Olive Ann Mellor, who became his wife, along with Clyde Cessna and Lloyd Stearman, both of whom went on to set up their own successful aircraft manufacturing companies.Walter and Olive Ann started out on their own with a winner in the Staggerwing, which was faster than military aircraft of the time. The company diversified into that sector, too – building 7,400 aircraft for US and Allied forces in the second world war alone.Beech has built aircraft for the personal, military and airline markets, but it worked particularly hard to get businesses aloft by introducing aircraft such as the large-cabin, jet-prop King Air range in 1964, with a larger version following 10 years later.The business aviation side was boosted further after the company was bought in 1980 by Raytheon, the US defence and technology giant. In 1985 Raytheon bought the rights to an advanced corporate jet from Japan’s Mitsubishi and rebranded it the Beechjet. In 1993 Raytheon bought the Hawker corporate jet business from British Aerospace.This purchase brought in a rich slice of aviation history from the other side of the Atlantic – Hawker included de Havilland, the pioneering British manufacturer famed among other things for its Tiger Moth biplanes, which have trained many a generation of pilots. Walter died in 1950 but Olive Ann kept going until 1993.In March this year, just in time for the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Beech Aircraft Corporation, the sale of Raytheon’s aircraft division to private equity backers was completed.The $3.3bn cash sale to GS Capital Partners, a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs, and Onex Partners allowed a new company to be set up with a name – Hawker Beechcraft – that echoes its origins, and an unclouded focus on making its range of personal, business and military aircraft.www.hawkerbeechcraft.comwww.newpiper.comrohit.jaggi@ft.comMore reviews at www.ft.com/testdrive"
67;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2007-05-31T10:27:44Z;Rohit Jaggi’s test flights;;"The Cessna Citation MustangThe Cessna Citation Mustang’s weight, carrying capacity and equipment make it one of the very light jets, a new low-cost class that has promised to change the face of air transportation. But Kansas-based Cessna Aircraft Company, the largest manufacturer of general aviation aircraft in the world, can afford to take a more relaxed view: “Call it what you will,” says Jack Pelton, Cessna chief executive. “We’re calling it an entry-level jet.”The Mustang was born, Mr Pelton tells me, out of the availability of sophisticated, integrated all-glass cockpits from avionics manufacturer Garmin, and improvements to the efficiency and price of turbofan engines from Pratt & Whitney Canada.A preflight check of the Mustang outside Cessna’s hangars at Wichita’s Mid-Continent Airport provides the first evidence of user-friendliness. The number of safety items to check is probably fewer than for the 172 – the four-seater that is the entry-level aircraft for Cessna’s single-piston-engined range.Each of the Mustang’s P&WC W615F turbofans has an oil sight gauge at eye-height behind a little panel, a few other levels to check, and a glance at the sturdy landing gear. The aircraft is low – height of the T-tail is just 13ft 5in – so checking the 40ft 7in length, 43ft 2in wingspan airframe is easy.Inside the 4ft 6in tall cabin, plush leather passenger seats face each other in a club arrangement. The spaciousness is in line with larger Citations – perfectly adequate office space for the three-hour endurance of this aircraft.Climbing into the cockpit seats is much easier than on most jets: there is actually room to slip your legs between the seat and the pedestal that houses the trim controls, the power levers and the flight management system keyboard.The turbofans have sophisticated electronic systems to control them, simplifying the pilot’s workload hugely. There are just two power levers, one for each engine, and startup using the onboard battery is not much more difficult than starting a car engine.While the aircraft is designed and certified for single-pilot operation, there are full controls for a co-pilot. Both places have a 10.4in flat primary display in front of them. The two primary displays each show all the flight and navigation information that would have been displayed on old-style dials, but more clearly.The single, central 15in multi-function display can show a Global Positioning System map, or an instrument approach. It also shows engine indications, with anything out of the ordinary in red. So fully integrated is the Garmin system that this is also where the pressurisation is set – simply by dialing in the elevation of the destination airfield. The system does the rest.Cleared to take off, I line up on the runway and push both power levers to the take-off setting. The 1,460lb of thrust from each turbofan quickly pushes us up to take-off speed. We rapidly climb to 20,000ft for the hop south-east to Independence, Kansas, where Cessna manufactures the Mustang along with its piston-engined aircraft. Even going on up to the 41,000 ft certified ceiling would only take 27 minutes in standard conditions.The Garmin autopilot gives a number of options – a yaw damper, normally engaged soon after take-off, a flight director that puts “command bars” on the primary display to indicate where you need to point the aircraft to fly the flight plan you have entered, and the full three-axis autopilot.All the way, the Mustang is stable but very biddable. If the speed creeps a knot or two above the 98kt approach speed, a touch of back pressure on the yoke bleeds it off without putting us above the glide slope. And judging the moment to start the flare is remarkably easy – the landing is so smooth that we hardly feel the wheels kissing the tarmac.The Mustang production line at the Independence plant displays the expertise that Cessna has developed in bonding aluminium alloy. With a healthy order book of more than 260 aircraft, production is set to rise from one a week to two a week by the end of the year, and to three a week by the end of 2008.Departing Independence for our return to Wichita, we do not use anything near the 3,110ft of runway that the Mustang would need at its 8,645lb maximum takeoff weight. I let the autopilot fly the Mustang so that I can play with the avionics system. There is a weather and terrain radar in the nose, a traffic alerting system that allows me to see other aircraft overlaid on the central map screen, and a satellite link that shows weather and winds across the US. Both for the level of information, and for the ease of accessing it, the Garmin system brings airliner standards of flight information into the bottom rungs of the business class.Cessna’s entry-level jet is as docile and easy to fly as a humble four-seat piston-engined 172, but with a maximum cruise speed of 340kts (391mph) at 35,000ft it is about 100kts faster than most of its turboprop opposition. Its range, at maximum weight of 1,150 nautical miles (1,323 miles) with generous reserves, gives it long legs too, though with full fuel you could only fill four of the six seats.An operating cost of about $4 per nautical mile, assuming 400 flying hours a year, makes it more costly than some of its turboprop rivals. But the price tag of $2.6m is keen. Cessna includes a 12-day type-rating course for a pilot, worth $18,500. There are also finance and insurance deals for buyers worldwide.The Beechcraft King Air B200The Beechcraft King Air B200 is the most popular model of turboprop aircraft of all time. It sits in the middle of a range of twin-engined aircraft launched in 1964 – since then more than 6,000 King Airs have been produced, and between them they have logged 40m flight hours.The turboprop aircraft have survived a number of changes in the company that makes them – the latest was in March when the aircraft subsidiary of Raytheon, the US defence company, was sold to Hawker Beechcraft, a company formed by a Goldman Sachs subsidiary and Onex Partners, for $3.3bn.The sale may be new, but the name harks back to former times. Walter and Olive Ann Beech founded Beech Aircraft Corporation 75 years ago last month in Wichita, Kansas. Beech became a subsidiary of Raytheon in 1980, which in 1993 bought the Hawker corporate jet business from British Aerospace. Last month’s sale completes the circle.The King Air range, according to Ron Gunnarson, marketing director and an 18-year veteran at Beechcraft, is “one of the backbones of our company”.The first King Air 200 appeared in 1974, and almost 2,000 have been delivered since then. The latest iteration, the eight-seat B200, was certified in February 1981. According to Mr Gunnarson, “it has a better safety record than any comparable sized jet, and a better dispatch rate”. It can handle grass strips and runways as short as 2,600 ft, and has low operating costs, at $2.65 per nautical mile.Almost a third of B200 King Airs are owner-flown, which means that handling and ease of use are vital too.Approaching a B200 at the company’s own Beech Field airport, the aircraft has huge ramp presence. Nearly 44ft long and 15ft tall, with a 54ft 6in wingspan, it looks supremely capable. The 94in propellers hanging off the Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-42 turbine engines look as though they take huge chunks of air each time they turn.The cabin is impressive too. At 16ft 8ins long, 4ft 9ins tall and 4ft 6ins wide, it is big. The circular windows are big, too, and there are a lot of them, so the six passengers in the back have a great view. The toilet at the back of the cabin is fully enclosed, and there is a large baggage area that is accessible in-flight.There are also 32 tuning forks in the cabin that improve on a troublesome but innovative noise reduction system and bring the average sound level in the cabin to a quiet 79 decibels.The cockpit is dominated by the three flat screens of the Collins Pro Line 21 fully integrated avionics system. Climbing into the left-hand seat over the input keyboards of the flight management system is awkward, but I manage it with only a slight bump to my head on the roof.Starting the engines cannot compare for simplicity with that of modern turbofans with digital engine management systems. But the B200 wins back points with checklists that can be called up on the central multi-function display. There is also a reverse thrust position for the throttles that makes taxiing easier – and allows shorter landing distances.Turned up to maximum forward thrust for takeoff the 850 shaft horsepower from each turbine engine makes the B200 leap
off Beech Field in short order – even at the 12,500lb maximum takeoff weight, the aircraft needs only 2,600ft.Climb rate is impressive too – nearly 2,500 feet per minute at maximum weight.As befits an aircraft whose usage shows 78 per cent of time is logged as being on business, the ride is stable – passengers in the back would have no problem having a business summit. At the helm, the B200 feels steady, but responds smoothly and precisely to control inputs. It gives the impression of being a reassuring partner for bad-weather flying.Cruise speeds can vary between 289kts (333mph) for maximum speed, and 228kts (262mph) for maximum range and almost half the fuel consumption. Range with five on board and generous reserves would be more than 1,300 nautical miles, or easily London to Moscow.The aircraft’s ceiling is 35,000ft, enabling the aircraft to skip above a large proportion of bad weather.Handling at the lower end of the speed range and in landing configuration is benign, too, with solid feedback from the controls.Almost all King Airs are bought by businesses, but a buyer who is also a pilot would have to be very tied up with business matters to not want to fly this aircraft. And while the purchase price of $5.08m might be on the high side compared with some of the small jets coming on to the market, direct operating costs are impressively low."
68;GRMN;Garmin Ltd;2007-02-15T17:08:40Z;I’d be lost without my GPS;;Being lost in a strange town on the way to a meeting is not fun. Being lost driving to an airport to catch a flight is even worse. So the last time it happened to me – on my way to interview the chief executive of Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, outside Toronto – I made a mental note to pack a portable GPS navigation system next time.Three weeks later, with a Pioneer GPS on the dashboard, I managed to navigate a hire car from Palm Springs airport to a conference.In spite of concerns about forsaking a map for another electronic gadget, I have been a convert to GPS navigation systems for years.Some of the early systems took drivers on a kind of urban magical mystery tour. But, generally speaking, newer devices are built round the latest SiRFStar III chipset, which guarantees better signal sensitivity and ensures a short time-to-first-fix, as well as using up-to-date map data and being reliable and easy to use.I have used several after-market add-ons. My favourites include the in-dash Eclipse AVN7000 system and Tom Tom’s Go 910. The latter, which costs about $500, comes with maps of Europe, the US and Canada on its internal 20Gb hard disk and a built-in MP3 player. It also features a 4in LCD touch screen, a menu system that makes it easy to adjust settings and enter destinations, and sophisticated voice technology.Other manufacturers, such as Garmin (www.garmin.com) and Magellan (www.magellangps.com), have mostly caught up, building sophisticated hard drive-based portable units that attach to the windscreen and can be moved between vehicles.Newcomers, such as Cobra (www.cobra.com), Lowrance Electronics (www.lowrance. com) and Michelin (www. viamichelin.com), have also emerged.The growth of the market, especially in Europe, has led to the development of new segments including pocket-sized personal GPS units, or “personal travel assistants” as Garmin calls them.These battery-powered devices are equally useful for holding as you walk along the street or mounting above a dashboard, usually using a suction-cup arm. Garmin’s popular nüvi GPS units fall into this category and include devices for both European and US markets.The recently launched nüvi 670 comes loaded with US and European maps, a 4.3in widescreen display, Bluetooth wireless connectivity and an integrated FM traffic message channel receiver that helps route users round traffic jams. Small enough to fit into a jacket pocket, it has a recommended retail price of $1,179 in the US where it has just gone on sale.Pioneer’s AVIC-S1 (www. pioneer.com), which costs about $400 and is roughly the same size, has a 3.5in touch screen and a barrel-style jog wheel that makes it very easy to use and operate with one hand.The maps and database of points of interest are stored on 2Gb of flash memory, meaning it is ready to use as soon as you press the power-on button, simple to operate and the turn-by-turn voice directions are accurate.Increasingly, these handy personal GPSs have multimedia capabilities, and can play MP3 music tracks and display digital images.Both Delphi’s NAV200 (www.delphi.com) and Mio Technology’s DigiWalker H610 (www.mioGPS.com) come with maps loaded and have SD card slots for loading audio, video and image files. At $300 the NAV200 is exceptionally good value, but the $449 DigiWalker is significantly more compact.HP’s personal digital assistant-style iPAQ rx5935 Travel Companion, is an interesting option at $600. This device, powered by Windows CE 5, is a fully featured PDA but also has WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity, a suite of personal productivity tools and comes with a big touch screen, sensitive chipset and Tom Tom GPS software.I have also been testing the new Pocket LOOX N100 from Fujitsu Siemens, the smallest and lightest personal GPS unit I have come across. It can slip into a shirt pocket but comes with some advanced features and produces stunning 3D maps on its 2.8in touch screen. It is built around a Samsung 300MHz processor running Windows CE 5.0.The N100 features the SiRFStar III GPS chipset and supports both WAAS and EGNOS technologies, which improve positional accuracy and lock in satellite signals quickly. It also comes with a built-in MP3 player and a miniSD card slot to add extra storage capacity. Overall, the N100 is a delight to use and good value at $380.If you don’t want to carry round a dedicated GPS unit, consider a GPS-enabled mobile phone or smartphone, such as the new BlackBerry 8800, which features Tele­Nav’s software, or Nokia’s navigation-enabled handset, the 6110 Navigator.THE BREAKDOWNECLIPSE AVN7000 HDD NAVIGATION SYSTEMPros: Stunning design, sleek and powerful. The Rolls-Royce of AVN systems.Cons: Price.Eclipse navigator leads the wayFor the past few months the Taylor family’s ageing 1999 Subaru Outlook has played host to a stunning piece of new technology – the Eclipse AVN7000 HDD Navigation System from Fujitsu Ten.The AVN7000 and its European version, the AVN8826, is a powerful dashboard-mounted car navigation and entertainment system with a 20Gb hard drive and a 7in-wide high-resolution touch sensitive LCD display that emerges from the unit and tilts up at the push of a button. Fujitsu Ten (www.eclipse-web.com) pioneered the concept of integrating audio, visual and navigation (AVN) capabilities into a single in-dash unit.Aside from its sleek design, the AVN7000 is also unusual for packing an advanced DVD video player, multi-source audio and radio receiver and touch-controlled GPS system into a standard-sized package.It is sophisticated but easy to use. For example, you can search for a destination in several ways, such as by address, map co-ordinates, points of interest or telephone number. Like most GPSs, the AVN7000 offers options such as setting preferences for certain kinds of road,a choice of recommended routes and route previews, and allows requests for detours. Intelligent auto-rerouting activates as soon as you stray off the route to guide you back on track.The AVN7000 also tells you which lane you should be in for turns and provides auditory notice of upcoming turns while the map display automatically zooms in to show the intersection. All extremely helpful and very accurate.The AVN7000 also shows driving distance and arrival times and the clock is automatically adjusted when crossing time zones.The entertainment capabilities are also impressive. The unit can play just about any format of DVD or CD.Such performance does not come cheap. The AVN7000 costs about $2,400 but it sets the benchmark for high-performance entertainment and GPS navigation systems.
