0;IRM;Iron Mountain Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;US dividend stocks smoked by higher yields;Utilities and Reits have fallen from January peak while alarm has risen over high valuations;As investors anticipate the end of easy US monetary policy this year, the fallout has landed with a thud in key sectors on Wall Street.The era of ultra-low bond yields has supported a tremendous rally in equities since 2009 and the bull run has been distinguished by investors piling into stocks that pay robust dividends, such as utilities and real estate investment trusts.This search for yield in areas of the equity market illustrates the scale of demand for income streams that exceed the meagre returns from bonds. But, now this trend has shifted, with utilities and Reits being punished of late by a slide in Treasury prices that has pushed yields on 10-year US government paper to their highest level since September, and well above the S&P 500’s dividend yield of 2 per cent.Utilities and Reits tend to move in tandem with bonds and have registered substantial corrections since January. Firming economic data, including recent indications that wages and inflation are turning higher, along with a sell-off in European government debt, has unravelled much of the rally in Treasuries this year.“These more rate sensitive, high dividend paying sectors underperform when the Fed tightens,” says Jill Carey Hall, an equity strategist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The S&P 500 utility index has fallen roughly 13 per cent from a January peak while Reits on the benchmark US index have slipped 12 per cent. In contrast, the broader market has climbed 5 per cent during the same period.Every Reit within the S&P 500 has declined since January 28, including Ventas, Iron Mountain and HCP, which have all dropped more than 20 per cent. Investors in utilities have not fared better: only two utilities on the index have advanced over the same period while 28 have slipped.The repositioning arrives three months before traders and investors expect the Federal Reserve to increase rates. Although forecasts point to a shallow pace of tightening — some economists say the central bank may only raise interest rates once this year — the effect may squeeze margins at both Reits and utilities, which are saddled with debt.“Fundamentally it is an awkward time to own Reits,” says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank. “I don’t think yields are going to spiral out of control. The fact is that the 10-year Treasury should track closer to nominal GDP, which is somewhere between 3.5 and 4 per cent.”Investors have also sounded an alarm over valuations. Utilities ended 2014 trading at 18.2 times earnings, in line with the S&P 500. On average, since 2000 the sector had ended the year trading at an 18 per cent discount to the broader market.To some extent the recent correction has alleviated some of those concerns — price-to-earnings metrics for both utilities and Reits have moderated. But investors have not yet stepped in to buy the dip.“We think there could be more to go,” says Ms Hall. “Even with the sell-off, valuations for many of these sectors are stretched, particularly utilities, tobacco stocks, and Reits.”Investors have pulled more than $5.2bn from utility equities and $3.6bn from US financials stocks this year, which includes Reits, as they shift into European stocks benefiting from quantitative easing and the devaluation of the euro, data from EPFR shows.Credit Suisse strategists note that while the sellside remains largely neutral on utilities, buyers have grown increasingly cautious, with the percentage of funds overweight the sector below its 12-year average. Hedge fund exposure is also below average, the investment bank notes.Mr Ablin said it was still too early to invest in Reits ahead of what is expected to be a volatile summer with the Fed. “They were priced to perfection and things are not perfect right now for them,” he says.While the uptick in the US economy bodes well for cyclically geared sectors such as financials, industrials and technology companies, tightly regulated utilities find less of a benefit — electricity producers do not see a surge in demand and subsequent acceleration in earnings growth as the economy improves, strategists note.Instead they will find increased borrowing costs, which will make it more expensive for levered companies to roll over debts. That is a potential concern for S&P 500 utilities and Reits, which carry net debt to projected 2016 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of 3.7 and 4.9 times. The wider S&P 500 carries net debt of 1.4 times projected 2016 ebitda.“There is a lot of market positioning around the Fed and until the market gets a bit more clarity on the timing of the first rate hike and how far [the Fed] is going to go, I think you could see more of the same — being stuck in this range,” says David Lefkowitz, an equity strategist with UBS Wealth Management. “The closer we get, that’s when investors will get a bit more comfortable with making a bet in either direction.”

Sales rose 9 per cent to $4.92bn driven by an improvement in customer traffic and average transaction amount.Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of 82 cents a share on sales of $4.94bn.Dollar General said same-store sales, a key industry metric, gained 3.7 per cent, missing estimates for a 4.1 per cent gain.“We were looking for slightly better sales performance given the improvements we have seen in blue-collar labour trends and modest upward pressure on wages — although the gas price tailwind is rapidly losing steam due to the rebound in gas and oil prices,” said Scot Ciccarelli, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Dollar General maintained its full-year earnings guidance in the range of $3.85 to $3.95 a share and said it expects sales to rise 8-9 per cent.Shares of Dollar General, which have gained 39 per cent in the past year, rose 3 per cent to $74.92.PVH Corp was one of the best performing stocks on the S&P 500 after the retailer, which owns the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands, topped first quarter adjusted earnings forecasts and lifted its full-year earnings guidance on Monday.The New York-based company increased its full-year adjusted earnings guidance to a range of $6.85 to $6.95 a share from an earlier forecast for $6.75 to $6.90 a share. The projections compared to Wall Street estimates for full-year earnings of $6.86 a share.The outlook accompanied PVH’s first-quarter results, which showed profits tripled from a year earlier to $114.1m, or $1.37 a share, in the three months to May 3. Sales declined 4 per cent to $1.9bn, in line with expectations.PVH shares jumped 7 per cent to $112.13.Iron Mountain shares slid 6 per cent to $34.68 after analysts at Jefferies downgraded the US storage and information management company to “underperform” from “hold” and lowered their price target to $29 from $33.“Iron Mountain was once a beacon of stability but steepening declines in paper usage and ever cheaper cloud storage . . . should result in a further deterioration in Iron Mountain’s already battered North America storage rental organic growth,” said Dan Dolev, an analyst at Jefferies.The company agreed to acquire Recall Holdings earlier this year, but Mr Dolev said this would not resolve its “chronic cash shortfall” and that Iron Mountain would likely have to issue equity or raise debt to avoid cutting its dividend.Airlines stocks were under renewed pressure on Tuesday after Delta Air Lines warned that a key industry metric, PRASM, or passenger revenue per available seat mile, fell 5.5 per cent in May from a year earlier. Shares of the US carrier shrunk nearly 3 per cent to $43.21, while the NYSE Arca Airline index fell as much as 1.5 per cent before paring back losses.US stocks were modestly lower as Greek debt talks continues and utilities lagged behind the benchmark S&P 500.The S&P 500 declined 0.1 per cent to 2,109.60, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 18,011.94.

2;IRM;Iron Mountain Inc;2013-06-10T18:06:38Z;Reit conversion: the IRS cometh;Scrutiny of Iron Mountain’s application by US tax authority is wise, if tardy;Move over Tea Party. The latest target of America’s Internal Revenue Service is companies that may not totally be about property but want to be (at least for tax purposes).Last week Iron Mountain, which runs warehouses where clients archive documents, announced that the IRS was “tentatively adverse” (sic) to offering its blessing to allow conversion to real estate investment trust status. The shares dropped 16 per cent on the news.The IRS’s view hinges on whether Iron Mountain’s “racking structures” should count as real estate. Switching to a Reit structure would allow it to avoid most tax as long as it paid out substantially all of its earnings to shareholders. And Iron Mountain is just the latest in a string of traditional companies that range from cell tower operators to private prisons that are trying to capitalise on their real estate to become Reits – sometimes at the prodding of an activist investor trying to jolt an underperforming stock.To be sure, the structural hurdles to jump through are substantial but the tax savings just may be worth it. Piper Jaffray estimates that as a Reit, Iron Mountain’s stock price could be worth 65 per cent higher than its DCF value as a full taxpaying entity.Iron Mountain’s announcement also revealed that the IRS had established a working group to study the rules that define real estate. This is a wise, if tardy, move given the rush of newfangled property companies looking at Reit conversion.Yet it all feels like catch-up. Companies will zig and zag to avoid taxes faster than authorities can keep up – whether it is using foreign subsidiaries as Apple does or exploiting the benefits of pass-through entities such as Reits. How does this end? Perhaps with a tax code where people not companies are taxed. Even if such an approach is not fairer, it would be easier.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
3;IRM;Iron Mountain Inc;2013-06-07T17:53:38Z;US Reit conversions face IRS scrutiny;Shares knocked as regulator reconsiders eligibility standards;"The Internal Revenue Service is scrutinising a provision that permits US companies to qualify as real estate investment trusts, a special structure that allows businesses to pay lower corporate taxes while returning more income to investors.The revelation came from several companies seeking Reit status, knocking back their shares and raising questions about whether US tax authorities will narrow the definition for which enterprises qualify.Timber producers, mobile phone tower operators, prison groups and data centres have all made the switch to Reits – which trade off lower corporation taxes in return for paying out at least 90 per cent of taxable income as dividends.Companies ranging from Equinix, the world’s largest data centre provider, to Iron Mountain, which rents storage space to businesses, and Lamar Advertising, a billboards business, fell sharply in Friday trading as analysts said it could delay their conversions.The IRS is assessing whether to revise the legal definition of real estate for the purposes of converting to a trust and has convened a working group to consider the matter, these companies disclosed in filings. The IRS did not respond to multiple requests for comment.A company must invest at least 75 per cent of its assets in real estate and derive at least 75 per cent of its gross income from rents, interest on mortgages, financing property or from sales of real estate to qualify, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.Iron Mountain, the paper and online records storage company, said it had received a “tentatively adverse” ruling from the IRS relating to its Reit conversion, sending shares down 15.8 per cent to $28.95. The IRS is questioning whether its warehouses filled with stacks of servers constitute real estate.“The company believes that under current legal standards, the company’s racking structures are ‘real estate’ for Reit purposes; however, the company can provide no assurances that the IRS will agree,” Iron Mountain said.Meanwhile, Equinix, which operates data centres for companies such as AT&T and Amazon, said it “cannot predict when the IRS working group will complete its study or what the outcome of the study will be”.It added that it would continue to move forward with its plans to convert to a Reit, but that it did not expect the IRS review to delay its plans to pursue the status by 2015.Lamar echoed this statement, saying it had no reason to conclude that it will not be able to convert into a Reit by January 1.Shares in Equinix dropped 5.5 per cent to $192.57, while Lamar lost 4.2 per cent to $43.62.CBS, which said in January it was moving towards Reit status for its US outdoor advertising unit in 2014, dipped 1.7 per cent to $48.03 as analysts said the plan may be slightly delayed but was unlikely to be derailed.While industry watchers doubted that those companies seeking conversion will ultimately be denied, analysts at Citi said they expected the Reit conversion process to become “bumpier and longer”.“We expect the market to reassess the probability for successful Reit conversions,” they said in a note to clients."
4;IRM;Iron Mountain Inc;2012-08-07T17:37:12Z;Yields on US junk-rated debt hit new lows;;Demand for US junk-rated debt has propelled yields towards new lows, as investors seeking returns in a low-interest rate environment have been attracted by a record number of deals so far this month.The Barclays High Yield index has dropped to 6.63 per cent, just 2 basis points shy of its all-time low of 6.61 per cent set in May 2011. So far this year, high-yield bonds have returned 9.9 per cent, on pace to more than double last year’s gain of 4.2 per cent.The prospect of further easing in September by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank has boosted market sentiment, while last week’s US jobs report has soothed near-term worries about the economy.The $9.36bn of junk-rated deals sold so far this month represent a record pace for August, according to Dealogic data that goes back as far as 1995.“We are seeing some investors sell investment-grade debt and buy high-yield at a time of strong inflows into the market,” said Wesley Sparks, fund manager for global high-yield at Schroders. “Investors have a lot of cash and there is a lack of supply.”This is illustrated by a slew of new deals at the start of this week, including Constellation Brands, MarkWest Energy, Advanced Micro Devices and SandRidge Energy, trading higher in price and lower in yield after they were sold. New issues have strongly outperformed the broad market, providing investors with outsized returns.“High yield new issues have outperformed the US High Yield Index or the appropriate quality index by approximately 1.8 per cent year-to-date,” said Barclays.Further deals were due on Tuesday, led by Iron Mountain pricing $1bn of debt.But some doubt that the rally in junk can extend much further. Many companies are facing pressure on their margins and struggling to cut costs.“While the bid for high-quality yield is understandable in this environment, we question the extension of this reach into the economically and risk appetite-sensitive portions of the credit spectrum,” said Oleg Melentyev, credit strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.With investment grade debt yielding an average of 2.8 per cent, investors are eyeing higher average yields of 5.25 per cent for double-B rated debt and 6.1 per cent for single-B rated companies.One missing part of the junk-bond rally has been companies with triple C ratings, or those in the highly speculative range and which yield about 10.1 per cent.“If the rally continues, we need to see investors stretch for the riskier part of the market, not remain focused on double-B rated companies,” Mr Sparks said.
5;IRM;Iron Mountain Inc;2012-06-06T19:10:26Z;Iron Mountain/Recall: strategy makes sense;At last, some excitement in the document storage industry;Typical. You wait forever for some excitement in the document storage industry and suddenly two stories come along at once. On Monday, Australia’s Brambles said it was giving up trying to sell its Recall business after bids failed to “reflect its value”. Then on Tuesday, Iron Mountain announced that it has decided to turn itself into a real estate investment trust. Shares of the US company jumped by 13 per cent on the news.That both companies are trying to extract value from document storage suggests that the business is getting tougher. Certainly, Iron Mountain’s share price reflects as much, trailing way behind the S&P 500 over six months, one year and three years. In fact, returns are holding up well. Iron Mountain’s return on equity is double that of a decade ago. Its gross margin at 59 per cent is 5 percentage points higher than in 2008. Recall’s profitability improved last year, too.The problem, it seems, is the slow arrival of the much-hyped paperless office. After an impressive record of high-teen revenue growth, Iron Mountain’s top line only grew in the low single-digits in the last three years. This seems extraordinary considering that only about a third of the document storage market is currently outsourced in the US, according to Morgan Stanley, not to mention the potential in emerging markets. Regulation also spurs storage while data security fears help the shredding side-business.But the move to digital archiving and electronic vaulting has been more rapid still, and companies such as Iron Mountain and Recall have struggled to work out how to adjust. These markets are also far more competitive with even lower barriers to entry. Hence Iron Mountain sold many of its digital assets last year. Thus becoming a Reit now makes perfect sense. Brambles also has better businesses to be focusing on. Cue shredding noise.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
6;IRM;Iron Mountain Inc;2011-07-27T16:11:02Z;Cloud services lift Autonomy profits;;Autonomy, the UK search software company, on Wednesday said profits were likely to beat expectations in the fourth quarter after a sharp rise in the number of customers using its cloud computing services.The Cambridge-based company also said it was considering spinning out Aurasma, its new augmented reality business, in much the same way that it demerged its Blinkx online video search unit in 2007. Mike Lynch, chief executive, said the company already had tax clearance for the move.The spin-out of Aurasma could give shareholders a potentially lucrative bonus. Autonomy investors were issued free shares in the Blinkx demerger, and have seen their price quadruple, especially after Blinkx reached profitability late last year.Cloud revenues at Autonomy rose 37 per cent to $64m in the three months to the end of June, and now account for a quarter of total sales. Customers have signed up for cloud contracts worth about $437m, making the company confident of future profits.“We foresee an increase in profitability in Q4 2011 versus current expectations and continuing improvement in prospects for 2012,” said Mr Lynch. “The market is still assuming growth of around 10 per cent in 2012, but the rates have been much higher than that. We are now seeing cloud signings increasing rapidly,” he said.Shares in Autonomy rose as much as 6 per cent intraday in reaction to the news. In late afternoon trading the shares were up 4.3 per cent at £17.27.The raised outlook comes a day after SAP, Europe’s largest software company, gave a bullish outlook on the year due to an upswing in business IT spending. UK-based Sage, which provides software for small businesses, also reported solid trading on Wednesday, as did Atos Origin, the French IT services company.“We are seeing a continued, cautious recovery in business-to-business software sales, and we have seen discretionary spending increase,” Mr Lynch said. Concerns over Europe’s sovereign debt, he added, did not appear to be harming business so far, he added.Autonomy provides software that allows companies to search and organise unstructured information such as e-mails, word processing documents and phone calls. Large financial institutions, for example, have used the technology to look for incriminating documents when preparing for litigation related to rogue trading.Companies are increasingly looking for Autonomy to store and manage their data remotely, rather than putting the software on their own servers. A number of call-centre companies, for example, have Autonomy keep all recordings of calls and check them for compliance problems or evidence that particular staff members were not handling calls as effectively as they could.Autonomy bought digital assets from Iron Mountain in May to help expand its cloud business, which now manages more than 31 petabytes of data. Even stripping out the Iron Mountain acquisition organic cloud growth was 17 per cent.Overall sales at the company rose 16 per cent to $256m, in line with market expectations, while pre-tax profit rose 8 per cent to $72.9m. Earnings per share were $0.22, up from $0.21 in the year-ago quarter.

The $11bn offer had been higher than NYSE’s already agreed deal with Deutsche Börse.The two exchanges, which had been threatening to go hostile with their bid after it was rejected by the NYSE board, blamed the move on a failure to secure regulatory approval from US authorities.Shares in Nasdaq lost 2.5 per cent to $26.23 while ICE was up 3.3 per cent to $122.22.In the wider markets the S&P 500 closed down 0.6 per cent to 1,329.147 as weak data on housing and manufacturing left investors feeling uneasy.Figures from the New York Federal Reserve showed that manufacturing growth in the New York area had fallen to its lowest level in five months.The Empire State manufacturing index fell from 21.7 in April to 11.9 in May, the lowest level since December and well below economists’ expectations of 19.9.Separately, the National Association of Home Builders’ housing market index stayed at low levels, highlighting the weakness of the US housing market.This left the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.4 per cent to 12,548.30 in the session while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6 per cent to 2,782.31.This follows a loss of 1.9 per cent on the S&P 500 over the past two weeks as commodity prices tumbled lower and investors worried about the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Greece.The retail sector lost ground in the session as a week of earnings reports from big industry groups kicked off in a mixed fashion after JC Penney surpassed expectations but Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, released disappointing results.JC Penney, the mid-range US department store, reported first-quarter earnings up 7 per cent, benefiting from cost reductions and from strong sales in its exclusive brand names.But sentiment in the sector was weighed on by Lowe’s lacklustre results.First-quarter net income for the home improvement store fell 6 per cent, as the weak housing market limited demand for remodelling projects.The company blamed the 1.6 per cent fall in sales on poor weather and the housing market. Lowe’s reported earnings of 34 cents a share on net income of $461m, short of the 36 cents a share expected by analysts.Shares in Lowe’s fell 3.6 per cent to $24.83 while JC Penney fell 3.2 per cent to $37.21, dragged down with the rest of the sector.The S&P retail sector was down 1 per cent, one of the worst performing on Wall Street. Last Monday, Macy’s reported strong results and later this week Home Depot, Walmart and Target will report their first-quarter earnings.The general ‘risk off’ trade hit technology stocks the hardest, with the S&P technology index falling 1.5 per cent.These losses were led by Monster Worldwide, the jobs listings service provider, was down 8.3 per cent to $14.99 while Yahoo fell 4.5 per cent to $15.81. Salesforce.com, which provides an online service for salespeople to manage their customer data, lost 4.4 per cent to $128.96.In deal news, Joy Global, which manufactures mining equipment, bought equipment maker LeTourneau Technologies from Rowan for $1.1bn. The news sent Joy Global up 1 per cent to $88.36, but Rowan lost 0.2 per cent to $37.96.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Siga Technologies added 2.3 per cent to $14.52 after the pharmaceutical company said it had won a $433m contract with the US Department of Health and Human Services to deliver 2m courses of its smallpox antiviral.The contract includes options that would raise the total value to approximately $2.8bn.Merck, another drugmaker, was up 0.6 per cent to $37.30 after it won approval to launch a new hepatitis C drug after the Food and Drug Administration evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the treatment in clinical trials.Iron Mountain, the US information storage company, was up 0.7 per cent to $32.67 after Autonomy, the UK software group, said it had agreed to buy selected assets of the company’s digital arm for $380m in cash.
9;IRM;Iron Mountain Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Autonomy buys Iron Mountain digital assets;;Autonomy finally put some of its huge cash pile to use on Monday when it announced a deal to spend $380m on buying a number of digital business units from Iron Mountain, the US information storage company.The UK-based search software company said it was buying Iron Mountain’s digital archiving, eDiscovery and online back-up and recovery businesses to help boost its presence in cloud-based data management. Autonomy will also be gaining some 6,000 Iron Mountain customers through the deal.“When Autonomy went into the data management business, Iron Mountain were the big player. With this deal we will now be the world’s largest cloud platform with 25 petabytes of data,” said Mike Lynch, Autonomy’s chief executive.Autonomy put together a $1.1bn war chest for acquisitions last year, and originally said it was planning to sign a large North American deal in the autumn of 2010. A transaction failed to materialise at the end of last year, however, leaving questions over what Autonomy planned to do with its money.It is understood the Iron Mountain deal is one of two acquisition opportunities that Autonomy has been pursuing for some time. Conversations about the deal had started as far back as 2009.Following the transaction, the Cambridge-based company will still have more than $700m to spend on further deals. Mike Lynch, chief executive, said Autonomy had pursued another deal but decided to pull out after the target company missed performance targets.Iron Mountain, the world’s largest document storage company, said last month it could not continue investing in technology development for its digital business. It is selling parts of its digital unit following pressure from Elliott Management, the hedge fund investor.Shares in Autonomy were up 3.4 per cent at £17.93 in afternoon trade.FT CommentInvestors have been waiting for Autonomy to announce is big white wedding, a truly transformational deal with a North American technology company. This was not it. But it is a pragmatic, “low-risk” marriage of convenience for the company which left even the bears with little to criticise. The shares, which have been in the doldrums for the last year, rose as much as 8.5 per cent intra day on relief. The Iron Mountain assets are an easy fit with Autonomy’s already big eDiscovery business, which works with many of the world’s banks and law firms to help manage their documents. Autonomy is relatively good at making efficiency savings and can upsell services Iron Mountain’s 6,000 customers, so getting the promised 15 per cent increase to earnings per share from the deal next year doesn’t look difficult. Trading at around 22 times this year’s earnings estimates Autonomy’s shares are expensive compared to the rest of the UK tech sector. But US cloud computing companies can trade at 38 times, and given that much of Autonomy’s investor base is now American, there may well still be appetite for the stock..
10;IRM;Iron Mountain Inc;2011-03-23T23:36:39Z;Iron Mountain in investors’ dispute;;A bitter proxy fight has broken out between the board of Iron Mountain, the data storage company, and its two largest shareholders, money manager Davis Advisors and activist hedge fund Elliott Management.What began the week as a shareholder debate about strategy has now been recast as a battle against a possible corporate raider by a board spooked by unusual trading activity.On Monday Iron Mountain sent out proxy voting materials to shareholders, including a proposal from Elliott to elect four new independent directors to the 12-strong board.Two days later the board adopted a hastily organised poison pill takeover defence.“In response to extraordinary trading activity in our securities through yesterday, the Iron Mountain board of directors implemented a stockholder rights plan,” the company said.“The plan is designed to reduce the likelihood that any person or group would gain control of the company by open market accumulation or other coercive take­over tactics without paying a control premium.” It follows unusual activity in the option market on Tuesday.More than 220,000 call options – which give the buyer the right to buy shares at a set price on April 16 – changed hands, equivalent in volume to more than a 10th of the shares outstanding.However, it also followed the endorsement of Elliott’s position by Davis, which owns 19.5 per cent of Iron Mountain and has been a major shareholder for several years.“It is heinous corporate governance”, said Kenneth Charles Feinberg, portfolio manager for Davis, in reaction to the poison pill. He argues that while the management has raised margins in the core US business, both it and the board have done a poor job of investing overseas and in new technology.“Sometimes companies are so focused on their business they benefit from some new ideas, particularly on capital allocation,” he said.Elliott also proposed efficiency improvements and changes to the way capital is allocated to investments. It has suggested Iron Mountain could make tax savings by converting to a real estate investment trust.Elliott’s beneficial ownership of Iron Mountain remains just below 5 per cent, according to a person familiar with the situation.
11;IRM;Iron Mountain Inc;2011-03-10T21:43:33Z;Tech stocks drag down Wall St;;A pull-back in technology shares matched a broad decline in US stocks as confidence in the economy was hit by troubling data.The Nasdaq Composite index, weighted towards tech groups, dropped 1.8 per cent to 2,701.02, below its 50-day moving average, a key technical marker.Especially troubling was a report from China that Hewlett-Packard, the personal computer maker, was considering spinning off its PC business.HP said the unit was not for sale, and many analysts discounted the likelihood of such a move.But HP shares were off 1.4 per cent to $41.48, their lowest level of the year. Rival Dell was off 1.2 per cent to $15.24.The moves followed a report from analysts at JPMorgan Chase on Wednesday that supply of “tablet” PCs, like Apple’s iPad and Motorola’s Xoom, could outstrip demand by 36 per cent. Shares in Apple were off 1.7 per cent to $346.67.The Philadelphia Semiconductor index was down 2.5 per cent, adding to its 3 per cent drop on Wednesday, to below its own 50-day moving average.“Semiconductors are the best indicator, because they go into everything, from toasters to aeroplanes,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of US equity trading at Canaccord Adams. “The shares always top out first and bottom out first.”Micron Technologies fell 3.8 per cent to $9.93 a share and NXP Semiconductor was down 4.6 per cent to $26.51 a share.NetApp, a provider of data storage, fell 6.1 per cent to $48.41 after it sold its external data storage unit to LSI, a rival. LSI rose 3.1 per cent to $6.32.The broader S&P 500 index was 1.9 per cent lower at the close, at 1,295.11. The Dow Jones Industrial average was also off 1.9 per cent to 11,984.61. Both were, like the Nasdaq index, below their 50-day moving averages.A negative jobless claims report was received as evidence emerged that rising oil prices were a threat to the economic recovery. The US labour department reported that 397,000 people filed unemployment claims last week, against a consensus forecast of 378,000.Trade data were also troubling. China reported a $7.3bn deficit as its exports, a key measure of global economic activity, declined. Meanwhile, the US trade deficit, widened to its highest level in five months in January. “To the extent that this surge reflects the strength of domestic demand . . . it isn’t necessarily a disaster,” said Paul Ashworth, economist at Capital Economics.“Nevertheless, it is a concern, particularly when we know that the latest surge in the cost of imported oil will drive the deficit above $50bn over the next few months.”Energy shares pulled back as US oil prices fell, though they remained above $100 a barrel.The S&P 500 sector fell 3.6 per cent, its worst one-day decline since last June. Chevron, the oil group, fell 3 per cent to $99.08, and rival ExxonMobil fell 3.6 per cent to $81.38.Materials and industrials groups were also hit hard. Caterpillar, the producer of industrial equipment, fell 3.9 per cent to $98.39 a share. Alcoa, the aluminium group, lost 3.1 per cent to $15.80.Shares in General Motors, the US carmaker, fell 2.6 per cent to $31.42 after it said that Chris Liddell, chief financial officer, was leaving the company.“Now [GM has] talented people in all the right spots but they don’t seem to want to hang around,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group. He said it was reassuring when Dan Ammann, the incoming CFO, said he planned to stay indefinitely.HCA, the hospital group that went public in a $3.8bn deal on Wednesday night, opened at $31.02, a 3.4 per cent rise from its issuing price of $30 a share.Starbucks, the coffee and beverage retailer, was the top gainer in the S&P 500, hitting an all-time high.Shares were up 9.9 per cent to $37.97 after it made a deal with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, makers of the Keurig single-cup serving system, to allow it to use Starbucks brands. Shares in Green Mountain soared 41 per cent to $61.71 a share following the deal, a record high.Iron Mountain, which handles data storage for companies, saw its shares jump 5.2 per cent to $27.66 after Elliott Management, a hedge fund, nominated four members to the board.Elliott has argued that Iron Mountain could unlock value if it spun off its warehouses used for storing documents into a separate property company.
12;IRM;Iron Mountain Inc;2010-02-25T21:48:09Z;US stocks fall on Greece debt fears;;"US investors were spooked on Thursday by higher-than-expected jobless claims combined with increased concerns about the Greek sovereign debt crisis following warnings by two ratings agencies that the country’s long-term credit ratings could be downgraded.Higher-than-expected durable goods figures were not enough to offset the negative sentiment.“This morning’s data were mixed but with a slight and measurable upward bias,” said Stephen Wood, chief market strategist at Russell Investment Group.“What we are seeing is stabilisation but not much improvement,” he said. “The labour market is just beginning to pop its nose above the water line. This is turning out to be a grinding and sluggish recovery.”After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was down 0.2 per cent to 1,102.96, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.5 per cent to 10,321.11 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent lower at 2,234.22.Drinks group Coca-Cola lost 3.7 per cent to $53.12 after the company said it was to buy the North American operations of Coca- Cola Enterprises, its largest bottler, in an essentially cashless deal, involving the acquisition of $8.8bn of CCE’s debt and about $5.6bn of CCE’s equity. A special $10 dividend will be paid to CCE shareholders.Shares in Coca-Cola Enterprises surged 32.85 per cent to $25.48.Coca-Cola said the deal would deliver $350m in synergies over four years.Dr Pepper Snapple gained 11.1 per cent to $31.83 on the release of fourth-quarter results that were slightly higher than expected.Sales were flat when currency effects are stripped out. The company said it expected sales to be up by
3 to 5 per cent this year.Financials were in focus after Ben Bernanke, US Federal Reserve chairman, said the central bank would look into Goldman Sachs’ role in creating currency default swaps for Greece.The bank’s stock fell 1.2 per cent to $156.44. Goldman helped the Greek government raise $1bn in off-balance-sheet funding in 2002 using swaps, which the European Union said it knew nothing about until recent days.Any probe by the Fed looking into the use of swaps will likely affect other banks involved in similar activities.Morgan Stanley lost 0.3 per cent to $27.74 after John Mack, chairman, said the bank plans to sell its 34 per cent holding in a Chinese affiliate because the Chinese government refuses to grant the bank permission for a controlling stake.Rival JPMorgan was down 0.5 per cent to $40.64 on its annual investor day.Jamie Dimon, chief executive, is expected to weigh in on some of the current issues facing the banking industry.Heinz, the world’s leading packaged food company, decreased 0.6 per cent to $45.66 after it reported quarterly earnings that narrowly beat estimates, helped by a significant marketing push, strength in emerging markets and new products in the US.Third-quarter sales were up 13 per cent compared with the same period last year.Private equity company Blackstone Group fell by 0.6 per cent to $13.92 in spite of posting fourth-quarter results that beat Wall Street estimates, helped by improved valuations of its portfolios and better performance fees.Information and record manager Iron Mountain rose 7.1 per cent to $26.02 after the company revised upwards its forecasts for the year following better-than-expected fourth-
quarter earnings.The technology sector was broadly down.Palm, a maker of smartphone handsets, was one of the heaviest fallers in the Nasdaq, losing 19.3 per cent to $6.53 after the company revised downwards its outlook. It said it expected third-quarter and full-year revenues to be below expectations as consumer demand for its handsets failed to get traction.Apple inched up 0.7 per cent to $202.00. The company said it had sold than 10bn songs via its electronic iTunes platform. The stock has more than doubled in the past 12 months.Nike, the sports wear company, rose 1.9 per cent to $66.16 after the stock was added to Goldman Sachs’ “conviction list”."
13;IRM;Iron Mountain Inc;2006-09-04T19:50:49Z;James Altucher: At heart, Buffett is still an 18-year-old kid;;I genuinely believe I’m not an inherently smart person. Therefore my best chance for success is to be around and learn from other intelligent people.In 2005, working along those lines, I completed a study of Warren Buffett’s trading career (published by Wiley as Trade Like Warren Buffett) which detailed not Mr Buffett’s value investing but the other forms of investing Mr Buffett does – private investments in public equity (PIPEs), activism, merger arbitrage, convertibles, distressed debt, liquidations, and so on. So when Mr Buffett files a 13F-HR filing, it is usually something I pay attention to. I then try to pick it apart to see what is going on. This is the guy who was buying carpet companies and furniture stores immediately before the housing boom, and buying distressed energy companies right before oil spiked to what seems to be infinity.First there are two new positions – Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi Aventis, both in the pharmaceuticals and healthcare sectors. Mr Buffett is not a hard-core value investor in the sense that he tries to buy things at a low price/earnings ratio or trading below book value. He is more of a demographic/macro investor. He looks at changes in population, demographic changes and other macro factors, chooses an industry he thinks will benefit and then backs up the truck on the stable, growing companies with consistent histories. Clearly he is guessing that an ageing population that will need ever-increasing amounts of medical care will drive up the prices of the stable, mega-cap companies in this sector.J&J – which makes consumer products, pharmaceuticals and medical devices – appears fairly inexpensive. Due to several issues such as patent expirations and research and development setbacks, its recent results have not been impressive. But these setbacks are temporary and will not affect the long-term prospects of this company, which has had a consistent operating history since 1886. As J&J will increase earnings about 10 per cent to $4.05 a share next year, I expect the dividend to rise to about $1.60. With an authorised $5bn share buyback and a coming rebound in operating performance, Mr Buffett seems to be on a winner.Another interesting company Mr Buffett owns is Iron Mountain, which provides administrative services that include record keeping, document keeping and information management. Since 1998, the group has acquired more than 40 administration-related companies. While there are short-term concerns – mainly its significant leverage, which is a negative in a rising-rate environment with higher gas prices – the longer term looks good, assuming the company can grow its storage segment.With regulators more concerned than ever about a company’s ability to store all documents in hard and soft formats it is clear that Iron Mountain will be riding a demographic trend that is here to stay.Then there is Comdisco Holdings. While Mr Buffett enjoys his growth and demographic plays, at heart he is still the 18-year-old kid learning from Ben Graham about buying stocks for two thirds of book value and waiting for them to liquidate. This strategy can take years to get a payout. In my book I detail some of the microcap liquidations that Mr Buffett has played in recent years with his personal portfolio.More recently, through Berkshire Hathaway, he has been buying shares in Comdisco Holdings. The group was a dotcom-bust poster child – a good business that got caught up in the gusto and burnt itself out. Now its sole purpose is to liquidate its business as prescribed by the bankruptcy court and distribute those holdings to shareholders. Those assets are fairly difficult to understand but with the 13F-HR filing, we can piggyback on Mr Buffett’s research to look.Since Comdisco’s emergence from Chapter 11 on August 12 2002, the focus has been the orderly sale of its remaining assets. The company says it has $90m in unrestricted cash and $102m in assets. This equates to $23 a share – pretty good for a company with no debt and a market price below $16 a share. The profits made from the sales of assets are to be returned to shareholders. Eventually this stock will be worth $0 but by then shareholders will have received $23-$26 in dividends, depending on how well the sale of assets goes. If you like a potential 50 per cent return in the next few years, in our low-return environment this looks like a good pick.james@formulacapital.com
