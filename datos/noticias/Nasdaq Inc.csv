0;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-03-17T17:19:19Z;Could shutting exchanges stop the markets rot?;US Treasury secretary floats idea of shorter trading hours as staffing hit by virus;As worries over coronavirus sweep through markets, generating sharp bouts of volatility, some regulators have floated the idea that trading hours be curtailed, fearing that swings in prices have become disorderly and institutions with depleted workforces cannot cope with heavy volumes.“We absolutely believe in keeping the markets open,” Steven Mnuchin, US Treasury secretary, said on Tuesday. “We may get to a point where we shorten the hours if that’s something they need to do.”Australian regulators on Monday told the most active traders on the country’s equity markets they would have to trade significantly less, as higher volumes would put brokers and the exchange itself under strain.The Philippine Stock Exchange, meanwhile, will be closed from Tuesday after president Rodrigo Duterte placed the largest island of Luzon into an “enhanced community quarantine”.The moves raise the question of whether trading should be more broadly shut in response to the coronavirus crisis. Jay Clayton, chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, told CNBC he was in favour of keeping markets open.The Financial Conduct Authority, the UK financial regulator, agreed. “Our aim is to continue to maintain open and orderly markets notwithstanding current volatility,” said an FCA spokesperson.Yes, but shutdowns are rare and have tended to be brief, connected mostly to particular problems in the vicinity of exchanges. The London Stock Exchange last closed for trading in 1987 when storms prevented thousands of traders from getting into the city. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq closed in October 2012 to prepare for Superstorm Sandy and also shut for several days after the terror attacks of September 2001, when communication cables and offices were damaged. Such examples illustrate that a critical mass of people was once needed to be in a particular location, at one time, for markets to function. These days, the nature of trading has changed, and humans have been cut out of the process to a large extent. Most deals on equity, futures and currency markets are executed automatically by computers on servers in data centres.Still, traders say the shift to operating in remote locations such as disaster recovery sites and even in the home, in response to the virus, is exacerbating pockets of poor liquidity.Not all shutdowns have been caused by logistical problems. In Greece in 2015 the Athens Stock Exchange was closed for five weeks following the imposition of capital controls, along with bond and derivatives markets and clearing and settlement houses.Many have been activating their business continuity plans. Companies such as the LSE, Nasdaq and Intercontinental Exchange have split their staff into those working remotely, from home or on call for certain critical operations such as surveillance and technology.Ancillary services, such as opening and closing ceremonies have been either truncated or cancelled. CME, CBOE Global Markets and Nasdaq have closed their “open outcry” pits for trading options, although they continue to operate these markets electronically. So far most exchanges’ operations have held up, and reported few problems.But some changes have been brought in to ease the stress. For example, the LSE has eased the bands by which market makers, normally banks or high-frequency traders, are able to quote prices to buy and sell some securities.That will allow them to offer more attractive prices to market participants, and persuade them not leave the market when it seems too risky. The European Securities and Markets Authority has tightened rules around disclosures for short selling securities.In practical terms it would lessen the strain on exchanges and the brokers who use them, potentially reducing the scope for market accidents on top of an economic and public health crisis.This is what regulators in Australia have sought to pre-empt. As Guy Warren, chief executive of ITRS, a UK trading technology provider, explained: “Without the right capacity planning tools it is extremely difficult to identify what the pinch point is for an IT system and when it is going to happen.”Stocks, bonds, exchange traded funds and futures are traded across borders, in markets that are highly interlinked. Trading in FTSE 100 stocks, for example, tends to cluster on the LSE, but futures on components of that index are more active on ICE Futures Europe. UK-listed companies are also components of the Euro Stoxx 600 index, which is traded in Germany. Morning trading in Europe, meanwhile, is highly influenced by the price of “eMini” futures contracts, which are traded in Chicago.Unless all those big venues are shut simultaneously, traders will go to locations that are open and liquid. One European official said the result would be “a mess”.Shutting markets could even make matters worse once they reopen. When the Athens market reopened after its hiatus five years ago, it tumbled by a fifth. Shutting markets could prevent investors from getting out of sliding shares while their assets retain some value. Some funds, of course, also profit when asset prices fall.Stacey Cunningham, president of the NYSE, on Monday said it was “important” for markets to remain open, and that closing them would only compound market anxieties.“[It would] not change the underlying causes of the market decline, would remove transparency into investor sentiment, and reduce investors’ access to their money,” she tweeted.
1;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-02-05T19:06:38Z;Market questions why ICE would make eyes at eBay;Talks came to nothing, said exchange group, but its shares had their biggest fall in a decade;"The bewilderment that greeted news that the world’s second-largest exchange group had considered buying eBay is unlikely to faze its chief executive Jeffrey Sprecher.He built Intercontinental Exchange into a $50bn powerhouse that provides the data and infrastructure that companies use to trade in financial markets and has spent his career looking one way as rivals have looked the other.But investors fear that a move into the consumer market would be a leap too far.Following news it had held discussions about combining with eBay, ICE shares fell by 8 per cent, their biggest one-day drop in more than a decade.“We’re sceptical of how ICE could leverage its experience and technology into eBay . . . a purchase of such a different kind of company could be bold but also a sign of reaching for growth,” said Chris Kuiper, analyst at CFRA Research.Mr Sprecher’s investment approach has driven ICE from an Atlanta-based start-up in 2000 into an increasingly influential US company. Last month, his wife Kelly Loeffler, an early ICE employee, was appointed a senator for Georgia. She sits on the senate agriculture committee that helps regulates ICE.Mr Sprecher was a power plant manager before setting up a power exchange that was the forerunner of ICE. When its rivals were fighting for assets in big M&A deals, ICE opened the first clearing house in London in 100 years in 2008. As exchange megadeals became bogged down in competition questions, ICE was the first to move into fixed income data and trading instead.The risk this time around is that [ICE] management have been so visionary that investors think they are hallucinatingThat solidified its reputation among investors, not only for the coherence of strategy but for executing on its deals. Over the past decade, reinvested total returns for ICE have been 410 per cent; for the S&P 500 Composite it has been 268 per cent, according to Refinitiv Datastream.What the discussions with eBay do indicate is ICE’s new willingness to look for opportunities beyond the traditional exchange world of trading, data and clearing.Mr Sprecher’s management team meets every two weeks to discuss potential deals. “The risk this time around is that management have been so visionary that investors think they are hallucinating,” said one analyst.Still, ICE damped expectations it was prepared to jump fully into the consumer market.It confirmed it had approached eBay to explore possibilities that could “create value for the shareholders of both companies”. However, it said the discussions had since been dropped and the two were not engaged in negotiations. Barely a day later, ICE said it would buy Bridge2Solutions, a company that runs customer loyalty programmes, for an undisclosed sum.Chris Turner, an analyst at Berenberg in London, said it looked like the market had reacted to a completely different scenario from the one ICE had in mind.The Bridge2Solutions deal would accelerate the push into consumer markets by Bakkt, an ICE subsidiary for trading digital assets such as bitcoin that was run by Ms Loeffler before she moved into politics.Yet Bakkt, along with other recent acquisitions such as mortgage provider Mers and last year’s $335m purchase of real estate technology group Simplifile, are long-term projects that are unlikely to materially affect ICE’s earnings for many years.Since it moved into data provision with the purchase of Interactive Data Corp for $5.2bn in 2016, ICE has traded rapid revenue growth for steadily rising earnings per share and operating margins, which were 52 per cent in 2018.Ed Ditmire, head of investor relations at Nasdaq, pointed out that many exchange businesses were maturing and it was harder for them to do M&A because of antitrust and political concerns.“It’s really hard to find the perfect puzzle piece now,” he said. “We’re moving from a transactional relationship with customers to deeper, higher quality one.”Even so, that change may not come easily to an acquisition machine such as ICE. Mr Sprecher told investors in December that he felt pressure to grow and deliver consistent earnings growth. But “when we do [a deal] and announce it, you all have to say, ah, that’s so logical.”"
2;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2019-12-26T21:26:14Z;Wall Street hits fresh highs buoyed by trade hopes;S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq all close at record levels while oil approaches three-month high;Wall Street hit fresh highs on Thursday over raised hopes that an interim trade deal between Beijing and Washington was still on course to be signed in January.“The deal is done,” said Donald Trump on Christmas Eve. “It’s just being translated right now.” The day after the president's remarks, it was reported that a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, had said the two sides were in close touch about a signing ceremony.The anticipation of a ceasefire to the protracted trade war helped the three major US stock indices reach new records. The Nasdaq climbed 0.8 per cent to 9,022 points, pushing the index beyond the 9,000 milestone for the first time, with the technology-heavy benchmark having its 11th consecutive day of positive returns. This is its best run since a 12-day stretch in July 2009. The performance was boosted by a 4.5 per cent jump in Amazon shares, after it reported a bumper holiday sales season albeit without details.The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent to 3,239 in New York, eclipsing Monday’s record close of 3,224, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent to hit 28,621, edging past the prior high-water mark of 28,551 set on Monday.Adding to the upbeat mood was data from the US Department of Labor, which revealed that US jobless claims had fallen 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 in the week ending December 21.“The number of Americans made jobless by their employers dropped back . . . to more normal levels showing the economy’s record run isn’t done yet,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank.The lift in market sentiment led to a modest sell-off in core government bonds, with the yield on the 10-year US Treasury rising 7 basis point to 1.89 per cent.A month-long bounceback in oil continued with Brent crude, the international benchmark, up 0.9 per cent to $67.79 a barrel, its highest level since mid-September when Saudi Aramco oil-processing facilities were attacked by drones, sparking fears of supply shortages. WTI, the US marker, rose 0.8 per cent to $61.61 a barrel.Gold is another commodity that has rallied strongly this week. The precious metal rose 0.8 per cent to break through the $1,500-an-ounce mark, capping three days of significant rises since Monday. Markets in Europe and parts of Asia are closed on Thursday.Additional reporting by Richard Henderson in New YorkFor market updates and comment follow us on Twitter @FTMarkets
3;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2019-12-11T17:31:54Z;Brazilian brokerage XP jumps almost 30% in US market debut;Near-$2bn IPO is the fourth-biggest of the year in the US;Shares in XP, the Brazilian financial services group, jumped on their debut in New York on Wednesday after completing one of the year’s largest public offerings.The company raised almost $2bn on the Nasdaq stock exchange, having priced its shares above the top of the range previously mooted, indicating strong investor demand in contrast to a recent chill in the performance of new listings.Shares closed at $34.50 for a first day gain of 28 per cent on the listing price of $27.The company sold 42m new shares, bringing in $1.14bn, while existing private shareholders sold a further 30m existing shares representing about $810m.The near-$2bn total makes XP the fourth-largest US initial public offering of the year. After a pop in early trading, the company had a market capitalisation of more than $18bn.XP launched in 2001 offering classes in stock and bond investing to ordinary Brazilians traditionally shut out from capital markets by high fees, and it grew by selling them its brokerage services. It is now a full-service group offering brokerage, fund management and distribution and investment banking.Its aim has been to break open Brazil’s concentrated finance sector. The company serves 1.5m customers and has generated $170m in profit on $890m in revenue so far this year, according to a filing with the US securities regulator.Bruno Constantino, XP’s chief financial officer, said the money raised in the listing would help build out new business lines, including offering banking services to existing clients.“The IPO will lead us to the next phase of disruption in the financial system in Brazil,” he told the Financial Times, adding that investor education was more important than ever as Brazilian interest rates fall.“Brazil has always been about a loose fiscal policy and a tight monetary policy, but now for the first time in our lives we’re seeing the opposite,” Mr Constantino said.The large IPO comes after a number of high-profile flops this year had softened the market for new listings.Shares in just one of the five largest US listings remain above their IPO price. Uber, the largest deal of the year with $8.1bn raised, and Lyft, which raised $2.6bn in the third-largest, have both lost nearly 40 per cent of their value.The debacle of WeWork’s failed flotation has also hit sentiment. The private market valuation of the office company, which scrapped plans to list in September after investors voiced concerns over its governance and leadership, has dropped from $47bn to just $8bn.Investment banks responded to the weaker environment by pricing more deals at the lower end of their ranges this quarter than earlier in the year.Outside the US, Saudi Aramco raised $25.6bn on the local Tadawul stock exchange, eclipsing Alibaba’s 2014 IPO to claim the largest listing on record.
4;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2019-11-27T04:00:29Z;Nasdaq on track to steal NYSE’s IPO crown;Tech-heavy exchange last topped rival’s listings haul seven years ago;Nasdaq’s listings business is on course to eclipse that of bitter rival the New York Stock Exchange for just the second year since the dotcom bubble.The Times Square-based exchange raised $32bn across 153 initial public offerings in the first 11 months of the year, outpacing the $26bn in 46 listings for NYSE, according to Dealogic data.Nasdaq last surpassed the NYSE in 2012. Before that, the technology-heavy exchange had failed to edge ahead of the “Big Board” since 2000, during the giddy highs of the internet boom.Nasdaq’s dominance for the year has upended the usual state of play in one of the most cut-throat rivalries on Wall Street. NYSE typically raises the biggest sum in IPO proceeds by securing the larger deals, while Nasdaq soaks up a greater number of smaller listings.The contest has “always been intense”, said Nelson Griggs, president of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. “Every single deal we fight for and for a larger IPO it’s a bigger fight.”Nasdaq secured two of the top-five listings, including the third-largest of the year for ride-hailing company Lyft. But the exchange lost out on the two largest deals to NYSE, with the top spot going to Uber, which raised $8bn when it went public in May.Uber’s decision to list on the NYSE came a decade after the exchange dropped a policy that blocked lossmaking companies from listing — a move designed to weaken Nasdaq’s grip on the tech sector.Over the past few decades Nasdaq has attracted the likes of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook, which now form the largest companies by market capitalisation in the S&P 500 index.Now a new front is emerging in this battle between the New York bourses. Nasdaq raised $4.7bn from biotech IPOs in the year to date, around 15 per cent of its total, while NYSE secured none. But in a move designed to attract biotech groups, NYSE cut listing fees by 75 per cent in May and capped them at $100,000 over three years for businesses with less than $5m in revenue that are valued above $200m.John Tuttle, vice-chairman and chief commercial officer for NYSE, said the exchange “continued to execute the biggest IPOs of the year” and pointed to its ability to attract other deals including direct listings, where a company’s shares are released on to the market but no capital is raised, and special purpose acquisition companies, or “spacs”.NYSE has stamped its authority on direct listings by adding Slack to its marketplace this year after Spotify went public on the exchange in the same fashion last year. Nasdaq is now working to secure its own direct listings as more companies express an interest in this offering.“I can’t get out of a meeting on the west coast without talking about direct listings,” said Mr Griggs.
5;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2019-11-15T18:49:40Z;Nasdaq fees increase to fund Times Square upgrades;Exchange justifies rise by saying New York facilities provide value to listed companies;Nasdaq is planning to raise the fees it charges companies to list on its market, in part to help fund the gleaming Times Square showroom it uses to compete for new customers against its bitter rival, the New York Stock Exchange.The higher fees would support upgrades to its new site on one corner of the famous location, which houses a state of the art digital broadcast studio, the company said in a regulatory filing. The group also pointed to price inflation and improvements to its online tools as driving the fee increase.The enhanced premises include a TV studio where the opening and closing bell ceremonies are held, a 10th floor outdoor terrace and a curved video screen which shows pictures of people and companies listing on the exchange.Nasdaq has continually refurbished its facilities over the years to compete with NYSE’s iconic neoclassical building downtown that opened in 1903 and houses the daily bell-ringing ceremony. Defending its position, Nasdaq said it “provides a tremendous amount of value to our listed companies throughout their entire corporate lifecycle”.The two exchanges are locked in a fierce battle to secure initial public offerings as they are the only exchanges that launch companies on to the US stock market. One former NYSE executive described the rivalry as a “knife fight”.$159,000Nasdaq listing fee maximumNasdaq is typically seen as the cheaper option for listing, in comparison with its downtown rival. The largest companies listed on Nasdaq will pay $159,000 to the exchange each year, a $4,000 increase, according to the Thursday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Fees charged to smaller companies and for other types of listings including depositary receipts will also increase.Lee Shapiro, chief financial officer of Livongo, a digital health start-up that listed on Nasdaq in July, said the facilities were a prominent factor in selecting Nasdaq over NYSE.“They make their facilities available to us for investors relations,” Mr Shapiro said. “We’ve done events there in connection with the IPO but also they let us use the space for meetings and our own events.”Nasdaq has raised $31.4bn across 146 IPOs this year, edging ahead of the $25.7bn raised in 45 listings for NYSE, according to Dealogic data. If Nasdaq’s lead holds through to the end of December it would mark the first year the exchange group has outpaced NYSE since 2012.High-profile listings on Nasdaq this year include Beyond Meat, the plant-based protein group, and the ride-hailing group Lyft, while NYSE won Uber, one of the most anticipated listings in recent years.
6;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2019-11-12T20:05:57Z;Nasdaq to sell commodities futures business to German exchange;US group fails to break duopoly in energy markets;Nasdaq is to sell its commodities futures business to an exchange owned by Deutsche Börse, ending a four-year effort to break into energy markets dominated by US rivals CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange.EEX, controlled by the German exchange, said it would pay an undisclosed sum to buy the business, known as NFX, which hosts oil and freight futures contracts.Spearheaded by former Nasdaq chief executive Bob Greifeld in 2015, NFX aimed to halve the cost of trading some of the world’s biggest energy futures contracts.Direct competition between futures exchanges is rare, as different venues tend to dominate in their chosen market, but energy is an exception. CME and ICE battle fiercely over market share in highly active oil and gas contracts such as WTI and Brent crude.Peter Reitz, chief executive of EEX, described the purchase as a “landmark deal” for the exchange in its attempt to break into the US seaborne commodities and freight trading markets. NFX’s biggest contracts are in US power, natural gas and oil.Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Virtu Financial, the proprietary trading firm, were among NFX’s early supporters. In spite of incentives such as zero transaction fees for the first nine months of operation, it was unable to garner extensive volumes. Instead, traders tended to stick with the deepest, most liquid markets where they can enter and exit without moving prices.NFX’s WTI contract traded 4m contracts last year, down 63 per cent year on year, according to data from the FIA, the futures industry trade association. The comparable contract on the CME traded 306m in 2018.EEX, whose revenues rose last year by 21 per cent to €256.6m, aims to complete the integration of US power contracts on NFX to its US subsidiary Nodal by the end of the year, and to transfer all open positions in dry bulk freight by next February. Other contracts will be transferred in spring next year.It has already pushed into trading in trucking freight futures, which track the spot rate for trucks on routes between several US cities.Adena Friedman, Nasdaq’s chief executive, has sharpened the exchange’s focus on growing markets, such as financial data and technology, and reduced the focus on underperforming assets such as fixed income and commodity futures.Earlier this week ICE said it would launch an exchange in Abu Dhabi to host the first futures contract based on the state oil company’s flagship Murban crude.The contract will set the price for the country’s oil and marks a radical departure for the Abu Dhabi government, which had a longstanding policy of retroactively setting monthly official selling prices for its mainly Asian customer base.
7;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2019-11-01T15:47:52Z;Glitch forces Nasdaq to close Stockholm stock market early;;Nasdaq, the world’s biggest supplier of technology to stock exchanges, was forced to close its largest equities market in Europe earlier than expected on Friday owing to technical problems.The exchange had repeated issues with its equities and derivatives market during the day and shut its Stockholm market at 11am, two hours earlier than expected. The issue also forced the early closure of its Baltics markets. Nasdaq runs the main exchanges in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.Lauri Rosendahl, president of Nasdaq’s European equities and derivatives business, said the exchange was working diligently to correct the fault and was in close contacts with its regulators. “We apologise for the inconvenience this has created for our exchange members and all investors in our markets,” he said.After delays of two hours Nasdaq reopened its main equities and derivatives markets in Copenhagen, Helsinki and Reykjavik..
8;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2019-09-27T10:23:49Z;Peloton’s saddle-sore investors rue lack of restraint in pricing;Pulled listings of WeWork and Endeavor suggest common sense could be breaking out;By mid-morning in New York on Thursday traders knew there was a problem. Shares in exercise equipment company Peloton, primed to list on the Nasdaq stock exchange, had not yet started trading.Investors around the world were looking to the New York-based company’s initial public offering to gauge the health of new listings after the year’s most high-profile deals had disappointed.Shares in Uber are 30 per cent lower than their May debut. Lyft, its ride-hail rival, has fared worse — its shares have lost 42 per cent since their March listing.WeWork, a fellow unicorn (start-ups with a value of more than $1bn), failed to canter into the public market. Corporate governance and leadership concerns weakened investor demand for its listing. The company last week shelved plans to list and on Monday chief executive Adam Neumann was pushed out.By 11am, a crowd awaiting Peloton’s fate began to form around the terminals of the Nasdaq Listing Center overlooking Times Square. Exchange staff stooped over computer screens waiting for adequate investor demand to kick-start trading and vindicate the $29 share price, which was set the previous day at the top of its range.But when trading began at 11:57am, investors set an early price of $27, down 7 per cent from the IPO price. Investment bankers shot instant messages across financial centres to one another saying “saddle-sore” investors in the seller of exercise bikes were “back-pedalling fast”, according to Neil Campling, an analyst at Mirabaud Securities.Peloton shares ended the day 11 per cent below the IPO price, wiping $925m from the group’s equity valuation. Investors who bought the 40m shares at the listing price suffered combined paper losses of about $130m.The poor opening was the third-worst on record among companies valued above $1bn. SmileDirectClub, which listed last month, remains the worst. Shares in the teeth-straightening group opened 11 per cent below its IPO price and today trade more than 40 per cent lower.The bleak tone continued on Thursday. By early afternoon Endeavor, the parent group of Hollywood’s biggest talent agency, had cut the amount of shares it aimed to float on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday by 30 per cent. Investors indicated they simply were not interested in the stock. By late afternoon the IPO was scrapped.Why are IPOs faltering?As investors have looked beyond public markets for returns, trillions of dollars have flowed to private equity and venture capital asset managers, which, in turn, have been pressured to pour money into start-ups which burn through capital to grow.SoftBank and its Saudi-backed Vision Fund, for example, tipped $9bn into WeWork. SoftBank alone bought $1bn of shares in a private placement that inflated the office-space provider’s valuation to the $47bn level. No other investor purchased a stake in the company at this price.“We have had a bubble in the tech start-ups that have developed as private companies,” said Susan Schmidt, head of US equities for Aviva Investors. “WeWork brings this to the forefront.”The losses from the debuts of Uber, Lyft and Peloton also have a lot to do with a lack of restraint among the underwriters bringing them to market, said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist for Federated Investors, a Pittsburgh-based fund manager with $502bn in assets.A group of 21 banks, led by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, were onboard for Peloton. Together, they came up with a dizzy price for a company whose annual net losses rose by about 50 per cent over the three years to June, to $246m, after spending on sales and marketing almost quadrupled to $324m.Goldman and JPMorgan were also the top advisers for WeWork’s IPO, aiming for valuations above the $47bn price tag SoftBank’s last investment put on the company. As the plan to list unravelled, a $15bn valuation was mooted. Even at this level, investors were uninterested.“The risk today is that companies are coming to market at full value or at a premium,” said Mr Campling of Mirabaud.Mr Orlando stressed that bankers should have a role in curbing the enthusiasm of the listing executives they serve. Peloton chief executive John Foley bubbled over in the offering prospectus, writing that the company’s “mission” was to “to better ourselves, inspire each other, and unite the world through fitness”. Investors might have been reminded of WeWork’s pledge to “elevate the world’s consciousness” in its IPO filing.Mr Orlando said: “As the investment banker you have to slap their hands and say, ‘No, you’re being greedy.’”
9;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2019-09-26T20:07:29Z;Peloton skids on stock market debut;Shares in lossmaking fitness equipment company drop more than 11%;"Peloton got off to a sluggish start as a public company on Thursday, closing more than 11 per cent lower on its first day of trading and raising fresh questions about Wall Street’s appetite for businesses without a clear path to profitability.Shares in the New York-based provider of fitness equipment opened at $27 after it floated 40m of class A common stock at $29 per share, raising $1.2bn. The share price gave the company a $7.7bn valuation, 83 per cent above the $4.2bn price tag attached to the company after its last round of private fundraising in August 2018.Shares traded as low as $24.75 on Thursday — a drop of 14.7 per cent — before finishing 11.2 per cent lower on the day at $25.76.The listing was seen as a test of investors’ demand for lossmaking companies that burn through cash to grow. Peloton’s revenues doubled to $915m over the year to June 30, but this has come at a price — the company’s losses jumped fourfold over this period to $196m.“We are prioritising growth over profitability for the next few years,” John Foley, Peloton chief executive, told the Financial Times. “You say losses and cash burn; I say investments.”The company is also facing a $300m lawsuit from a group of music publishers who claim Peloton has used songs in its workouts without paying licensing fees. “I’m not worried about it. I don’t feel like I have a sword above my head,” Mr Foley said of the legal action.Peloton’s IPO comes after several hotly anticipated public offerings have disappointed this year. Uber, which listed in May, is trading about 30 per cent lower than its $45 a share IPO price, while Lyft, which made its debut in March, has slipped 42 per cent from its $72 listing price.WeWork, which was on track to be one of the biggest listings this year, shelved its IPO plans last week. It has since replaced its chief executive after investors raised concerns over the company’s governance and leadership.Peloton sells $2,200 exercise bikes and $4,000 treadmills, equipped with 22-inch screens that beam live workouts for a $40 monthly subscription fee. The group has also launched a $20 monthly subscription for users who do not own its equipment.“You will see a lot of investors looking at [Peloton] and saying what are the lessons learned from Uber and WeWork,” Michael Underhill, chief investment officer for Capital Innovations, a fund manager that participates in IPOs, said ahead of the trading debut. “I wish them well, but I don’t think this will be a successful IPO.”* This story was amended on 27 September; Peloton is based in New York, not Silicon Valley"
10;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2019-09-12T20:53:18Z;SmileDirectClub shares tumble 28% in public debut;Dental company priced IPO above the range, yet stock slumped below;SmileDirectClub made a frown-inducing debut as a public company on Thursday, having priced shares for its initial public offering above the range of expectations only to see them slide 28 per cent.The dentistry company priced its shares at $23 each, implying a market capitalisation of $8.9bn, but they closed at $16.67, valuing the company at less than $6.5bn.That is still twice the $3.2bn SmileDirectClub achieved in private markets, but it raised new questions over public investors’ appetite for lossmaking start-ups.The Nashville-based company, which sells clear teeth aligners directly to consumers for less than traditional orthodontists, reported a loss of $75m last year, even as revenues almost tripled to $423m. Its business has faced pushback from the American Association of Orthodontists, which has claimed in complaints with state attorneys-general and dental boards that the service is “illegal and creates medical risks”. The company denies those suggestions.The percentage slide in its shares was the third-worst among all IPOs of more than $100m since 1990, according to Jay Ritter, a business professor at the University of Florida. The one-day dollar loss of $370.5m was the second worst, exceeded only by the $617m loss for Uber Technologies on its debut earlier this year.SmileDirectClub listed 58.5m shares worth $1.3bn in an offering on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The company had previously targeted a range of $19 to $22 a share, before upping the price late on Wednesday.Kyle Wailes, chief financial officer, said he was not concerned with the company’s early trading. “For our investors, it’s really the long-term growth we’re focused on,” he said.SmileDirectClub is the latest lossmaking start-up to test public markets this year and one of the largest since governance and business model concerns threw WeWork’s $4bn listing into doubt.The IPO was due to mint three new billionaires on paper: co-founders Jordan Katzman and Alex Fenkell and Mr Katzman’s father David, who serves as the company’s chief executive and runs its private equity backer Camelot Venture Group.One person familiar with SmileDirectClub’s roadshow said the company faced questions about David Katzman’s dual role and his day-to-day involvement at Camelot. Mr Wailes said Mr Katzman was “100 per cent focused” on SmileDirectClub and was not actively managing any other Camelot-backed companies.“He owns a very large percentage of the company overall, and he’s very committed to the long-term success of the company,” Mr Wailes said.The company is using a so-called up-C structure, providing tax advantages to company insiders that critics contend are not fully shared with other investors. David Katzman will retain control of the company through supervoting shares that carry 10 times the weight of class A common stock sold in the offering.JPMorgan and Citigroup are serving as the lead underwriters for SmileDirectClub’s listing.
11;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2019-09-10T03:00:28Z;New York’s rival bourses are in a ‘knife fight’ for IPOs;The next big unicorns could settle this year’s tight contest between Nasdaq and the NYSE;If the WeWork IPO goes ahead — if being the operative word, after the Financial Times reported its biggest investor SoftBank was pushing it to cancel the flotation — it will help decide who wins this year’s hard fought race between New York’s rival stock exchanges.And if it does not, investors can expect the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq to battle even harder for revenues from corporate listings. They have fought intensely to host the likes of Uber, Lyft, Levi Strauss and Tradeweb, in what is on pace to be the biggest year for listings in half a decade.WeWork had been leaning towards NYSE as its venue of choice, according to three people with knowledge of the deal, but it is Nasdaq that leads IPO proceeds by a whisker this year having raised $23.3bn across 105 deals, according to Dealogic data, ahead of NYSE’s $22.8bn across 36 IPOs. If its lead holds for the full year, it would mark a comeback for the Times Square-based exchange, which has trailed its fierce downtown rival since 2013.The exchanges have gotten more creative in what they offer to entice companies to listThe rivalry was now “more competitive”, said Richard Repetto, a principal and analyst at Sandler O’Neill, an investment bank. “The exchanges have gotten more creative in what they offer to entice companies to list.”Both groups tend to approach companies directly, largely circumventing the investment bankers who advise on other elements of a listing, such as the price range of the shares. A typical package for an IPO includes TV and billboard advertising, choreographed listing events in front of broadcast media and access to the exchanges’ offices and conference spaces. Both exchanges like to trumpet the quality of their trading infrastructure, but this rarely factors in a company’s decision, bankers say.“The process to attract companies takes months, if not years,” said John Tuttle, vice-chairman and chief commercial officer for NYSE, which often nabs the larger deals while Nasdaq, which charges lower fees, gets more volume. “There’s always been a spirit of competition in attracting new listings.”Mr Tuttle played a big role in luring Uber to NYSE. The car-booking giant raised $8bn in its May debut, the most of any IPO this year.For NYSE, the deal was the result of a tweak to the exchange’s listing rules that until 2009 barred companies that operated at a loss, all but blocking tech groups that churn through capital to grow.The change bridged a chasm that for decades had defined the pair. Nasdaq lured Microsoft and the entire suite of “Faang” stocks — Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google, which trades as Alphabet. Netflix apart, these have grown to become the five largest companies in the S&P 500 index, worth a combined $3.5tn. “In the high-profile tech listings it’s an intense rivalry,” said Jeff Thomas, head of western US listings for Nasdaq. “Every deal is competitive.”But Nasdaq’s delay in listing Facebook shares in 2012, because of a tech glitch, gave a leg-up to NYSE. Seven years on, the incident still comes up in discussions on venues, said one prominent Silicon Valley investment banker.A new battleground has emerged: biotech. Companies such as BridgeBio Pharma and Adaptive Biotechnologies have raised hundreds of millions of dollars on Nasdaq this year, in part attracted by the exchange’s biotech index. Nasdaq has won 96 per cent of biotech listings since 1995, according to Dealogic. It is a stranglehold NYSE is keen to weaken.In May, NYSE offered sweeteners to attract businesses that have yearly revenues of less than $5m and market capitalisations of at least $200m, cutting listing fees by 75 per cent and imposing a $100,000 cap on the fee for three years. Such parameters tend to include biotechs still in development phase, which often have little to no revenue.Companies such as Livongo, a digital health start-up that listed on Nasdaq’s platform in July, are precisely the type of groups NYSE is targeting. The Chicago-based company sided with Nasdaq for a generous assortment of ads plastered across Times Square, access to the exchange’s event space and its suite of investor relations services.“It was a difficult decision,” said Lee Shapiro, Livongo’s chief financial officer. “Both exchanges were highly competitive with one another.”Playing the rivals off each other is now par for the course for an IPO candidate, according to Doug Adams, co-head of equity capital markets for the Americas at Citigroup. “Companies are getting more sophisticated at evaluating their service providers and, in many senses, exchanges are another service provider,” he said.Other well-known targets await. Airbnb is expected to list this year and Palantir, the data giant, is waiting in the wings. Saudi Aramco, seen as an outside chance to sell shares in the US, is also seeking to raise an anticipated $100bn, which could mark the largest sum ever raised in an IPO.The battle between the pair should intensify, said one former NYSE executive. “It’s a knife fight.”Additional reporting by Eric Platt
12;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2019-07-15T22:00:27Z;South-east Asian tech boom leaves Singapore exchange behind;Low valuations and thin liquidity encourage companies to sell stock elsewhere;When Singapore’s homegrown technology unicorns Razer and Sea Group cantered off to list in Hong Kong and New York a couple of years ago, the city-state’s bourse knew things had to change.The following year, Singapore Exchange (SGX) introduced new rules to allow groups to list with dual-class shares — a funding structure favoured by tech companies — in an attempt to make it a more attractive destination. It has also entered into agreements with America’s Nasdaq and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange to pursue simultaneous or secondary listings that can help fast-growing businesses expand globally.More measures came this year, with SGX offering a S$75m (US$55m) grant to help young businesses cover the costs of listing, while Muthukrishnan Ramaswami, its longtime president, said he would step down by the end of this year after a restructuring to pursue growth. All of these efforts, the exchange said, have “accelerated interest” in Singapore as a fundraising hub.Yet the steps have so far failed to turn the tide. Singapore’s stock market continues to shrink, and observers question whether the exchange has the capacity to serve the region’s fastest-growing companies.SGX has seen the total number of companies listed on its exchange decline by 28 in the past five years to June 30, according to the exchange. The trend has continued in the first half of this year, with a net loss of three companies, despite south-east Asia’s tech boom gathering pace. *Leng Ng, director of capital markets at Fidelity International in Singapore, says the trend “is a function of low valuation and liquidity”, as well as ample capital in the world of private equity. “New issuers would tend to gravitate towards larger and deeper markets where they believe they can fetch the best valuation.”Singapore’s net loss in listings since the end of last year compares with a net gain of 67 companies in Hong Kong, its main rival in the region over the same period. The equity capitalisation of Singapore’s stock market, at $546bn, pales alongside Hong Kong’s $2.7tn.“While SGX might not be a listing of choice for foreign companies, a more concerning trend could be local companies seeking to list in overseas markets,” said Mr Ng, alluding to the 2017 moves by Razer, a gaming company, and ecommerce company Sea Group.A boom in investment in south-east Asian tech companies, led by China, could help encourage more of them to list locally, said Harsh Modi, co-head of Asia financial equity research for JPMorgan in Singapore. “Many of these companies are seeded by Singapore-based investors,” he noted.However, some analysts and investors argue that the Singapore exchange remains ill-equipped to meet the needs of the region’s most promising companies. “I don’t think the rapid expansion of [venture capital] is necessarily going to reverse the overall trend of delistings,” said Min-tze Lean, a lawyer with Baker McKenzie Wong & Leow.“Everyone shoots for the US [for listings],” said Justin Hall, partner at Golden Gate Ventures, a Singapore-based venture capital firm. “There should be other public markets that local companies can list in . . . and that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.The SGX is also grappling with a new challenge: the next generation of tech unicorns is raising large sums by tapping the region’s big, cash-rich conglomerates — as well as other, larger unicorns.Acquisitions of south-east Asian tech companies have totalled $4.8bn in the first half of this year, which is already about 80 per cent of last year’s total, according to Refinitiv, a data provider. Large funds such as SoftBank, Chinese internet companies Alibaba and Tencent, along with other south-east Asian tech giants such as Indonesia’s Tokopedia, have provided an exit for investors.The thinly traded, undersized exchanges in Singapore — and south-east Asia more broadly — “provide an opportunity for conglomerates”, said Elvin Zhang, head of investments at Gear Innovation, an investing arm of Sinar Mas, one of Indonesia’s largest groups.Lippo, another Indonesia-based conglomerate, has made 24 investments and recently acquired two start-ups in the “$20m-$40m range” through its e-wallet service Ovo, according to its chief executive John Riady.He credits conglomerates and established start-ups like Go-Jek and Traveloka for helping to build a dependable framework for growth funding. “Now that the smaller start-ups can exit by selling to them, you have others willing to invest at the seed stage, knowing they can exit,” he said.Mohamed Nasser Ismail, SGX’s head of equity capital markets, is undaunted, noting that the exchange has a “healthy pipeline of IPO mandates”, including technology listings, that he expects will come on to the market in the next few months.“The introduction of dual-class share listing structures also seeks to provide more choice for both issuers and investors,” he said.*An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to Bloomberg data on equity listings and delistings that included dual class shares and subsidiaries as company listings and delistings.
13;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2019-07-09T02:06:19Z;Chinese streaming site DouYu seeks up to $944m in US IPO;Tencent-backed company pushes ahead with listing even as other start-ups hold off;DouYu International, the Tencent-backed game-streaming start-up, has filed to raise up to $944m in an initial public offering on Nasdaq, pushing ahead with plans to list despite clouds over the Chinese technology sector arising from trade tensions.The Chinese company, which like Amazon-owned Twitch streams esports matches and other games-focused content, will offer 44.9m new American depositary shares and another 22.5m of existing stock from current shareholders, priced between $11.50 and $14 apiece, according to a filing on Monday night with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Even at the low end of that price range, the listing would bring in $775m, above the $600m to $700m bankers had expected DouYu would seek a year ago. Existing DouYu shareholders planning to sell shares in the IPO include Zhang Wenming, the company’s co-chief executive and co-founder, who personally stands to make up to $4.8m.DouYu’s move to go ahead with its IPO comes despite other high-profile Chinese tech companies putting their listing plans on ice as the US-China trade war chills investor sentiment. SenseTime and Megvii, rival facial recognition companies backed by Alibaba, were among the latest to reassess plans, joining other anticipated listings including ByteDance and Didi Chuxing that have yet to materialise this year.One banker working on the IPO said DouYu was looking to build up a sufficient war chest to take on rival streaming platform Huya while also accommodating an early angel investor seeking to sell. The timing, the banker said, was a matter of taking advantage of the latest ebb in trade war tensions following the resumption of talks after the G20 summit. “They saw a good window and decided to take it,” the banker said.The decision also came after the company turned a profit in the first quarter of 2019. DouYu reported an adjusted net loss for the 2018 financial year of Rmb818m ($119m), deepening by about 38 per cent from 2017, according to the SEC filing. But it notched a quarterly net profit of Rmb35.3m for the three months through March, compared with a net loss of Rmb149.9m for the same period a year ago.Monthly active users on the video streaming platform also increased in the first quarter to 159m, up 32m from a year ago, as the number of paying users rose by 2.4m to 6m.DouYu initially considered a Hong Kong listing before opting for New York. Among the factors that prompted a shift, according to one Hong Kong-based IPO lawyer, was the Hong Kong stock exchange’s unease with Tencent being one of the company’s biggest shareholders while also having a stake in Huya.After DouYu’s listing, Tencent will hold about 37 per cent of outstanding shares through its wholly owned subsidiary Nectarine, according to the SEC filing, allowing the Chinese technology group to appoint up to two directors.New York Stock Exchange-listed shares in Huya have risen 107 per cent from their $12 issue price since the company’s IPO in May 2018.Bookrunners for DouYu’s listing are Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and CMB International Capital.
14;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2019-05-27T06:55:54Z;Nasdaq withdraws offer for Oslo Bors;Decision clears way for Euronext to buy Norway’s main stock exchange;Nasdaq has withdrawn its offer for Oslo Bors, ending a lengthy battle with Euronext for control of Norway’s main stock exchange.The US exchanges operator — which also owns the main exchanges in Denmark, Sweden and Finland — announced its decision on Monday after failing to garner enough shareholder support for the bid, effectively clearing the way for its rival to proceed with its buyout.Nasdaq’s decision comes after a five month tussle with Euronext as the two exchange groups sought to court Oslo shareholders. Both had offered NKr158 per share, valuing the group at nearly €700m.“The support our offer received from the Norwegian business and financial community emboldens our European strategy and strengthens our commitment to our clients and the region,” said Lauri Rosendahl, president of Nasdaq’s Nordic division, on Monday.“This process has allowed us to establish even deeper ties to our clients and we will continue to move their interests forward by further expanding our commodities franchise and extending our overall European presence, of which Norway will remain a crucial part.”Monday’s announcement follows a decision by the Norwegian government to give the green light to both Euronext and Nasdaq to buy Oslo Bors, which effectively cleared the way for a Euronext takeover as it had garnered the most shareholder support, despite Nasdaq’s offer having the backing of the Oslo board. Euronext shareholders subsequently voted unanimously to approve the deal.Nasdaq said on Monday that shareholders who previously accepted its offer would be released from any obligations.
15;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2019-05-03T03:00:34Z;Nasdaq chief doubles down on data as NYSE fight intensifies;Adena Friedman tries to position New York exchange group as hub for technology;As a business school grad more than two decades ago, Adena Friedman was drawn to Nasdaq as the “cool and up-and-coming” exchange that listed Microsoft and other racy tech groups.But as chief executive of the New York-based group since 2016, she has focused on beefing up the backroom operations, such as the technology and data businesses. Over the past two years she has spent $1bn on acquisitions designed to insulate the group from squeezed commissions from trading and patchy revenues from hosting new listings.The pivot reflects a shift in the role of stock exchanges from utility-like trading centres to hubs of financial data and technology. For Nasdaq, the transition comes as a recent run of big tech initial public offerings — including Uber, Pinterest and Slack — has headed to the exchange’s fierce downtown rival, the New York Stock Exchange, threatening its reputation as the preferred option for tech companies.Ms Friedman’s plan to turn the 48-year-old group into a data and technology juggernaut has involved snapping up data companies like eVestment, for $705m, and Quandl, along with technology providers Cinnober and Sybenetix. The deals mark a departure from the exchange-focused acquisitions of former CEO Bob Greifeld that included Nordic exchange operator OMX and eSpeed, a fixed income trading venue.In an interview with the Financial Times, Ms Friedman indicated that the focus would soon turn from doing deals to developing those investments.“We are more diversified, with multiple opportunities to grow,” she said. “We are focused on organic growth.”Quandl is emblematic of the shift. The company provides non-traditional data such as satellite images and credit card purchases. The sector has boomed as hedge funds and quantitative investors have sought the hard-to-access information to boost returns, and is set to expand further as traditional fund managers like BlackRock and T Rowe Price follow suit.Cinnober has also shown some early promise. The Swedish company that supplies software to clearing houses helped propel the revenues of Nasdaq’s trading and surveillance technology business by 28 per cent to $77m in the first quarter.“The strategy is bearing some early fruit,” said Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill. “Overall, she has invested in some of the faster growing areas with a couple of acquisitions, while making divestitures of slower growing businesses.”Nasdaq hopes add-ons like these will help propel its investment data and analytics business to expand at a double-digit annual rate, as the bedrock of its traditional data businesses — selling stock trading information to investors and other trading venues — has matured.Turnover from selling the information accounted for 16 per cent of Nasdaq’s revenues last quarter and the exchange expects only moderate growth in the business over the next five years. The shift toward passive investing, which typically requires smaller volumes of data, and a spat with regulators over the price of that data, has added extra pressure.Nasdaq, NYSE and Chicago-based CBOE Global Markets are locked in a legal spat with the Securities and Exchange Commission after it ruled in October that increases in fees for market data were unjustified.The shift in M&A strategy has been accompanied by the cleaning up of some of Nasdaq’s other purchases. The exchange group sold non-core assets in public relations and digital media and closed its London-based interest rate futures trading venue, while taking a $578m charge related to its fixed-income unit.Ms Friedman said there were no further sales in the pipeline although there would be an annual review of Nasdaq’s portfolio of businesses.Despite these changes, the IPO business remains key to the company. This year Nasdaq has lured ride-hailing app Lyft, Tradeweb, a fixed income trading venue and Beyond Meat, a vegan burger maker. Luckin Coffee, a fast-growing Chinese start-up that has aspirations of being larger than Starbucks in its home country, is also preparing for a listings ceremony at Nasdaq’s Times Square digs.But more of the biggest tech deals, chief among them Uber, have headed to NYSE.The bungled debut of Facebook in 2012, for which Nasdaq paid a regulatory fine, as well as changes NYSE made to its listings requirements have made the rivalry more of a dogfight in recent years.Revenue from listing services has been about 11 or 12 per cent of Nasdaq’s total for the past several quarters, but listings feed other businesses, said Alex Kramm, an analyst at UBS. For instance, Nasdaq receives more fees from the buying and selling of stocks which are listed on the exchange itself. It also charges a premium for those stocks to trade during the crucial open and close of the day.These factors mean the rivalry with NYSE over listings should continue.“Large companies with big market caps that trade actively are clearly beneficial, so Nasdaq goes head to head with NYSE every day,” Mr Kramm said. “If you are Nasdaq, you want to win all of them.”
16;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2019-04-24T12:04:17Z;Pivot to data and technology helps Nasdaq beat earnings forecasts;Group’s traditional trading business remains under pressure;Nasdaq topped Wall Street expectations in the first quarter with growth in data and technology sales helping to offset weakness in the traditional trading business.Nasdaq chief Adena Friedman has spent her early tenure as chief executive, a role she took up at the start of 2017, focusing the business on technology, data and analytics while shedding noncore assets.At $634m, Nasdaq beat analysts’ expectations helped by a 10 per cent increase in net revenue from non-trading businesses, but divestitures and revenue declines throughout the trading business led to a 5 per cent drop versus a year ago.Earnings in the quarter jumped to $1.48 a share from $1.05 a year ago and handily beating consensus forecasts for $1.04. Excluding one-time items, EPS was flat at $1.22, but above expectations for $1.16.Profit margins for trading have shrunk with heightened competition over the last 10-15 years and the trading business is reliant on the vagaries of financial markets. Trading and IPO volumes were unremarkable in the first quarter and revenue from trading-related operations slumped 7 per cent.Nasdaq has invested $1bn in its market technology and information services segments, the two fastest-growing areas in the quarter, since announcing Ms Friedman’s “strategic pivot” in late 2017.For Nasdaq’s market technology business, where it sells trading and surveillance technology to other exchanges, revenue jumped 28 per cent to $77m helped in part by the acquisition of Swedish fintech company Cinnober. That added $10m in the period.Information technology revenue, which includes the group’s data, index and analytics businesses, increased 11 per cent to $193m.Market data, which contributed 16 per cent to revenue in the quarter, was flat at $100m amid increasing debate and scrutiny over what Nasdaq and rival exchanges charge brokers and investors for information on stock orders and trades.
17;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2019-04-08T08:13:59Z;Euronext and Nasdaq both garner regulatory approval in Oslo tussle;Norwegian markets authorities push final decision on future of exchange on government;Norwegian markets authorities have pushed a final decision on the future of Oslo Bors to the government, after approving both Euronext and Nasdaq as “fit and proper” owners to purchase Norway’s largest exchange.Euronext is strongest placed to succeed in the four-month pursuit of Oslo, having already secured 53 per cent of Oslo shares. Nasdaq, the US exchanges operator, has made a rival offer that has the backing of 35 per cent of shareholders, and the board.On Monday the Norwegian Financial Supervisory Authority approved both companies as potential buyers of the exchange. The Ministry of Finance is expected to make a final decision in May.Euronext is aiming to close the takeover saga by the end of June, ending a dispute between shareholders and the board at Oslo, begun when a majority of shareholders sold their stakes to Euronext before Christmas without the Oslo board’s knowledge. Nasdaq has matched Euronext’s NKr158 per share offer price, which values Oslo at nearly €700m.Last week Euronext said Tom Vidar Tygh, the former chair of Oslo Bors, would rejoin the board as an independent director once the deal was completed.Analysts have speculated that the Norwegian government may impose minimum share ownership requirements, such as a two-thirds threshold, for a bidder to succeed.Nasdaq, which owns the Stockholm, Copenhagen and Helsinki exchanges, must also pass antitrust approval in Norway, Sweden and the UK. “We remain confident that our offer is the best alternative for the continued long-term success for the Norwegian financial markets, and we look forward to the final decision by the Ministry of Finance,” it said in a statement.. 
18;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2019-03-26T18:33:13Z;NYSE and Nasdaq lock horns over 2019 IPO rush;There is more at stake than bragging rights;A rush of US technology companies preparing to list in coming months has highlighted a battle between the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq to be the listing venue of choice for one of the most vital segments of the US economy.Ride-hailing app Lyft is expected to go public on Friday, while Uber, Airbnb and Pinterest are among other big-name tech companies slated to offer shares to the public this year.For the exchanges, there are inevitable bragging and marketing opportunities that come with such initial public offerings, but there is also an economic incentive. Besides the trading and membership fees, the closing auctions for daily trading — which set the final price for investors to measure the performance of their portfolios — must take place at the company’s primary listing venue.The rapid expansion of index-based investing and exchange traded funds has meant that up to a fifth of daily trading in shares has gravitated to the last few minutes of each day.The New York duo have had contrasting fortunes since the financial crisis. Nasdaq, for so long the “go-to” exchange for tech companies emerging from Silicon Valley in the 1990s, continues to win the lion’s share of listings. But its reputation took a hit after it bungled Facebook’s IPO in 2012 and it has taken several years to recover its poise. In that time, NYSE addressed its underperformance, particularly after Intercontinental Exchange bought it in 2013. NYSE revamped its listings rules as it belatedly realised tech companies, such as Snapchat and Spotify, would be the new titans of industry. Its snagging of Uber underlines the other big shift of the past decade — Nasdaq wins more but NYSE has won the biggest of the tech offerings.
19;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2019-03-04T14:41:18Z;Nasdaq raises Oslo bourse bid to match that from Euronext;US operator seeks to break deadlock over Norway’s exchange, which is valued at €700m;Nasdaq has raised its offer to take over Oslo Bors but eased the thresholds for shareholders to accept the deal in an effort to squeeze out a rival offer for the Norwegian exchange from Euronext.The US exchanges operator on Monday said it would increase its bid from NKr152 to NKr158 per share, valuing Oslo at nearly €700m and matching the price offered by Euronext last month. It will also lower its minimum acceptance level by shareholders from 90 per cent to at least two-thirds.With its gambit Nasdaq is aiming to break an impasse between shareholders and the board at Oslo, begun when a majority of shareholders sold their stakes to Euronext before Christmas without the Oslo board’s knowledge.The takeover battle has split shareholders. Euronext has irrevocable support from 50.5 per cent of them, while Nasdaq has 35 per cent of shareholders pledging irrevocable support, and approval from the Oslo board. Euronext’s acceptance period is set to expire in a week’s time, on March 11. The Oslo board again on Monday recommended shareholders reject the Euronext offer.In response Euronext said it was willing to engage with the Oslo board and shareholders who did not tender in their favour would be welcome to remain shareholders.But it added that Euronext had already secured a majority of the Oslo Børs’ shares and fulfilled a condition on minimum ownership requirements. Euronext “will complete the transaction once regulatory clearance has been obtained,” it warned.Both suitors have pledged to enhance Norway’s capital markets if they are victorious. Oslo is dominant in seafood derivatives and expertise in oil services and shipping. It also owns a central securities depository, where deals are settled.Norwegian authorities will have to make a ruling on the deal. Nasdaq confirmed on Monday that it had submitted its formal application to purchase Oslo Bors to regulators in mid-February.Both sides have pledged an interest payment of 6 per cent a year on the offer price until the deal is closed.
20;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2019-02-28T00:03:31Z;IEX alleges that certain Nasdaq patents are invalid;Exchange files counterclaim over allegations that it infringed trading platform copyright;A legal dispute between Nasdaq and IEX Group over trading technology is heating up in the latest example of the fiercely competitive landscape in the world’s largest equity market.In a filing late on Tuesday, IEX alleged that patents held by Nasdaq were invalid and has separately petitioned patent authorities to have them declared as such. Two of IEX’s patent challenges were rejected, one is going to move forward to the merits stage and four are still pending.The moves come after Nasdaq last year sued IEX alleging that it knowingly violated a series of Nasdaq patents in developing the Investors Exchange’s trading platform.As part of its counterclaim, IEX claimed that some of Nasdaq’s patents were “unenforceable due to inequitable conduct” before the US Patent and Trademark Office.The filing cited a 2003 email from Fred Stiening, a former Nasdaq director, to Nasdaq lawyers saying that OptiMark and the London Stock Exchange were already selling and using, respectively, technology that was similar to what Nasdaq sought patents for. Mr Stiening also said non-Nasdaq employees were not named as inventors on Nasdaq’s patent applications, while Nasdaq employees who had not contributed were improperly named as inventors.Nasdaq declined to comment.It argued in its lawsuit last year that former employees who are now at IEX have been involved in crafting its rival’s trading platform, and that IEX has said that its closing auction process was “based on extensive review of the auction designs” of other exchanges including Nasdaq, and that the information it disseminates as part of that auction is “substantially similar” to a patented process at Nasdaq.In addition to developing trading technology for in-house use, Nasdaq sells trading technology. In 2018 revenues from selling market technology were $270m out of a total of $2.5bn.IEX, which was founded in 2012, fought a bitter battle to become an exchange, with Nasdaq among those opposed to its application. Since launching as a registered stock exchange in 2016, the Investors Exchange has garnered a market share of less than 3 per cent.“Just like Nasdaq’s failed attempt to prevent Investors Exchange from obtaining SEC approval, its attempt to use this court to shut down Investors Exchange is baseless,” IEX said in the filing.

Its offer has already been backed by 35 per cent of Oslo’s shareholders, including the two largest, DNB Bank and KLP.Oslo’s board has sought to generate formal other bids after Euronext became its majority shareholder without the Norwegian exchange’s knowledge last month. In December, a group of shareholders controlling 45 per cent of Oslo’s equity joined together to collectively auction their holdings, which Euronext won. The Paris-headquartered group subsequently bought another 5.5 per cent of stock on the open market, giving it majority control.But the rival deal may hit plans by Euronext to take full control of Oslo. Earlier this month, the Paris-headquartered group published a formal 35-page prospectus to secure the support of the remaining 49.5 per cent of Oslo Bors shareholders for the deal.Oslo Bors is dominant in seafood derivatives and has expertise in oil services and shipping. It also owns a central securities depository, where deals are settled.Euronext’s bid would extend its buying spree to redraw Europe’s fragmented exchange landscape.

We continue to communicate and work with regulators, our members and other stakeholders in order to further enhance our exchange and commodities business,” it said in a statement.
23;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2018-12-18T09:34:53Z;Nasdaq raises offer for Sweden’s Cinnober to $220m;;Nasdaq, the US exchanges operator, has substantially raised its offer to secure Cinnober after failing to win over enough of the Swedish trading technology company’s shareholders with an initial bid.The US group on Tuesday upped its bid to shareholders to SKr 87 per share and SK 121 per warrant, compared to an offer in September of SKr 75 per share and SKr85 per warrant. The proposal values Cinnober at around $220m (SKr1.9bn).Shareholders have until January 9 to accept the proposal and just over 82 per cent have already accepted the revised bid, Nasdaq said in a statement. The exchange needs 90 per cent of shareholders for the deal to proceed.Cinnober supplies clearing software to some of the world’s largest exchanges, such as B3 of Brazil, the London Metal Exchange and the Japan Exchange. It has struggled for profitability in the past 18 months after losing some key customers and changing the way it charged customers for its software.However, a deep cost-cutting plan under new chief executive Peter Lenardos, who took over in August, has improved Cinnober’s earnings and boosted shareholders’ optimism that Nasdaq’s offer undervalues the company.Mr Lenardos urged shareholders to take up the offer. “Nasdaq is acquiring a company that is in much better financial shape than it first thought, with good revenue momentum and a much lower cost base, in addition to no funding requirements,” he said.Only 37 per cent of shareholders had accepted the first offer, with many arguing it undervalued Cinnober. They included David Zetterlund, a private investor who owns 3.7 per cent of the shares and represents two other large private shareholders. The deal is also being examined by UK antitrust authorities, with a decision expected in February.

Chief executive Adena Friedman, who took over last year, has stepped up the charge and last year bought eVestment, another data provider.Alternative data provide a new revenue stream at a time when exchanges’ use of traditional trading data is under scrutiny. Investment groups, dealers, brokerages and high-frequency traders are rebelling against the rising cost of trading feeds, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has indicated some concern over the rising prices charged by exchanges.Quandl was founded in Toronto in 2012, and offers a wide variety of non-traditional digital data sets, such as that derived from corporate aircraft leases — used to predict M&A deals — emailed shopping receipts, auto insurance or shipping sensors.“Quandl will allow Nasdaq to partner more closely with the investing community as the industry continuously seeks ways to evaluate an endless supply of information to drive new insights, investment ideas and deliver alpha,” Bjorn Sibbern, head of Nasdaq’s global information services unit, said in a statement on Tuesday.There has been an explosion of alternative data providers popping up to meet the rising demand from hedge funds and traditional investment managers. The number of vendors tallied by AlternativeData.org, a trade body, has more than trebled over the past decade to 375.Industry insiders have long predicted that the embryonic industry will have to consolidate, with many asset managers frustrated at the disparate standards and annoyed at having to deal with lots of smaller players, rather than a few big heavyweights.The expectation is that big data companies such as Nasdaq, S&P Global, Bloomberg or Refinitiv will play a role in consolidating the Balkanised alternative data industry.Terms of the Quandl acquisition were not disclosed.Additional reporting by Nicole Bullock.

The UK Competition and Markets Authority has opened a comment period which will end on December 7, a week before the expiry of Nasdaq’s acceptance period. It is expected to lead to a first phase investigation, which would be concluded next year. Nasdaq declined to comment.Nasdaq needs 90 per cent of shareholders for the deal to proceed but a minority say the price is not enough.David Zetterlund, who owns 3.7 per cent of the shares and represents two other large private shareholders, controls enough shares to prevent Nasdaq from reaching its threshold.Cinnober supplies clearing software to some of the world’s largest exchanges, such as B3 of Brazil, the London Metal Exchange and the Japan Exchange. However it has struggled for profitability in the past 18 months after losing some key customers, and new chief executive Peter Lenardos has undertaken a deep cost-cutting programme.
26;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2018-10-24T12:11:18Z;Nasdaq profits weighed down by Nordic trader default;;Nasdaq, the exchanges operator, reported a 4.1 per cent drop in net income for the third quarter, which included an $8m loss related to the default of Einar Aas, a private Norwegian trader whose bets in the European power market collapsed last month.Nasdaq is the principal trading exchange where futures contracts tied to physical energy markets in the Nordic region are transacted.The loss contributed to an increase in Nasdaq’s overall operating expenses in the quarter to $354m from $341m a year ago.On a GAAP basis, net income fell from $170m to $163m from a year ago, or 97 cent a share, below expectations according to Bloomberg. On an adjusted basis, excluding one-time items, Nasdaq beat analysts forecast by a penny at $1.15 a share.Net revenue in the quarter fell by $3m to $600m due to the sale of the public relations solutions and digital media services business and unfavourable foreign exchange rates. The exchanges operator said the quarter benefited from 5 per cent organic growth and the contribution of revenue from its purchase of eVestment.The market services business, which accounts for 37 per cent of revenue and includes cash equity, derivatives and fixed income and commodities trading, had a 1 per cent increase in net revenue to $222m.Revenue from information services, which accounts for 30 per cent of the total, increased 19 per cent to $179m.That includes market data revenue, an area that has come under renewed scrutiny after the Securities and Exchange Commission recently ruled that Nasdaq and rival exchange the New York Stock Exchange, a unit of Intercontinental Exchange, have not justified some previous market data fee increases. Market data revenue in the quarter fell by $2m to $95m, or 16 per cent of total revenues.
27;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2018-10-23T04:00:34Z;There is a fight over data brewing on Wall Street;Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange have long profited as aggregators;The big beasts of Wall Street are duking it out over data.Last week, the US Securities and Exchange Commission issued a landmark decision in a decade-long fight over the cost of market data between the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq on the one hand, and the country’s biggest brokers on the other.The SEC found the exchanges had failed to justify two specific price increases on two lucrative streams of equity market data. It also ordered Nasdaq and NYSE to re-examine 400 additional price increases that brokers have complained about. On Thursday, the commission will follow up with an unusually long two-day roundtable on the subject.At first glance this is an industry food fight with little relevance for retail customers, who rely on a different data set that is essentially free.Indeed, the exchanges were quick to point out that the big winners from lower fees will be some of the world’s richest and most profitable banks and high-frequency trading firms — they are the ones who pay for massive amounts of data to feed their trading algorithms. Nasdaq and NYSE also complain that a key SEC staff member involved in the case, Brett Redfearn, had fought the fee increases on behalf of JPMorgan before joining the commission last year.But there is potentially a lot more at stake. Investor and consumer groups say the SEC’s fees decision is an overdue step toward proper oversight of the exchanges, which have long enjoyed and profited from a privileged position as the aggregators of essential data.Not only have the exchanges basically enjoyed free rein to raise prices — they have also been free to cut and slice data and sell it to HFTs in formats and at speeds that allow them to make trades that disadvantage ordinary investors. If the SEC wades into that part of the market, it could seriously shake things up.“The exchanges and HFTs have been extracting billions of dollars from ordinary investors simply because they can,” says Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets. “This may be the first glimmer of hope that the SEC is getting back into the business of protecting investors.”The SEC could eventually let all these fee increases through — the ruling that sent back the 400 other fees suggested it mainly wants exchanges to give customers more notice of fee hikes and provide evidence that increases are justified. But chairman Jay Clayton put the action in a larger context, saying the aim was to ensure that “market data fees are set, reviewed and regulated in the best interest of our markets and our Main Street investors”.The markets data rulings come as concern is rising in some parts of Washington that big companies that gather and control information have had too much freedom to exploit it without proper oversight. Democratic Senator Mark Warner said last week that he was concerned that “the aggregate amount of data that [the big tech companies] already have may make it virtually impossible for any new competitor to actually ever get to scale.”So far, it has been hard for consumer groups to gather much support for reining in the big data companies. That is what makes the SEC fight over market data so interesting — the exchanges lost this round precisely because the brokers on the opposite side were as rich as, or richer than, they are.What if the same thing happened elsewhere? Advertisers are already suing Facebook alleging the social media platform lied about viewing data for videos. It is not hard to imagine that big consumer groups might take up the cause of data regulation, which would change the dynamic.In that case, “you aren’t just talking about poor people versus plutocrats. You are also talking about big institutions that are in conflict with each other,” says Matt Stoller, of the advocacy group Open Markets Institute.That is a fight worth watching.brooke.masters@ft.com
28;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2018-10-16T21:02:46Z;SEC rules NYSE and Nasdaq did not justify data fee increases;Landmark decision puts pressure on exchanges over cost of trading data;The Securities and Exchange Commission ruled on Tuesday that the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq did not justify previous market data fee increases, in a landmark decision that adds pressure on stock exchanges over the cost of trading data.The decision comes as the exchanges face tough scrutiny from the US regulator over how they operate, with a SEC commissioner recently delivering a strong rebuke of not only the way exchanges sell and distribute market data, but also their dual role as regulatory bodies and for-profit companies.Jay Clayton, the SEC’s chairman, said the regulator’s decision did not mean the fees were too high. “Rather it means that the exchanges have not provided sufficient factual and legal support to continue to charge those fees,” he said in a statement.The SEC’s move will be welcomed by brokers, who have been engaged in a long-running battle against the exchanges over market data fees.“This pragmatic ruling by the SEC indicates increasing recognition by policymakers that the fee structure for proprietary market data products is broken,” said Melissa MacGregor, associate general counsel at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (Sifma), which had challenged the fees.NYSE, a unit of Intercontinental Exchange, had no immediate comment, while Nasdaq said it would appeal against the decision.“We are disappointed by the SEC’s decision given the strength of our evidence, convincing record of facts and our track record in the courts,” Nasdaq said. “This decision represents the latest in a 20-year long series of attempts to over regulate the best capital markets in the world, in order to benefit the largest financial institutions.”The ruling on Tuesday set aside two fees levied by NYSE and Nasdaq that Sifma challenged. The fees were for depth-of-book data, which traders use to gauge market demand.In a 59-page opinion on the depth-of-book fees, the SEC laid out its views on the exchanges’ arguments in the heated debate over market data pricing. In particular, it dismissed NYSE and Nasdaq’s arguments that prices were constrained by algorithmic traders who could easily move to another exchange if the costs were set too high.“Although the exchanges may rely on a relatively small group of firms to provide a large portion of order flow, these firms are dependent on the exchanges’ depth-of-book data to execute their trading strategies,” the SEC said in the opinion. “Indeed, the exchanges have increased prices for depth-of-book data on those customers that rely on it and that the exchanges believe derive the most benefit from it.”At the same time, the SEC also remanded a further 400 challenges by Sifma and Bloomberg back to the exchanges for reconsideration.“There is a new standard to justifying market data fees,” said Doug Clark, head of Americas market structure at ITG, an agency broker that buys data from the exchanges. “In the past the SEC has assumed competitive forces would keep data fees in line. The new regime has stated in a couple of places that it does not believe those forces are adequate.”In the past, the exchanges have met little, if any, opposition from the SEC to fee increases, leading to criticism from judges. Since Donald Trump took office, it has taken a tougher stance.Brett Redfearn, who was appointed director of the division of trading and markets last year, has long been an outspoken critic of market data fees. NYSE and Nasdaq had called for him to be recused from this lawsuit given his previous job at JPMorgan Chase, the investment bank and one of the largest Wall Street brokerage firms.The commissioners voted unanimously to approve Tuesday’s action.Robert Jackson, a Democratic commissioner who has been particularly critical of the exchanges, said in a statement that the SEC had “leapt off the sidelines with a clear and compelling message for US stock exchanges: competitive forces, rather than market power, must justify any increase in the price exchanges charge for stock market data”.The pressure on the exchanges is expected to mount as the SEC continues to scrutinise market data pricing. The regulator is holding a two-day roundtable on the issue next week in Washington.
29;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2018-10-06T00:29:49Z;Exchanges go on offensive in dispute over cost of market data;NYSE and Nasdaq call for recusal of SEC official from lawsuit over fee increases;Rival exchanges New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq this week went on the offensive in a bitter industry dispute over the cost of market data.Nasdaq and NYSE affiliate NYSE Arca filed a motion dated on Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission calling for the recusal of Brett Redfearn, the head of the trading and markets division at the regulator, from a lawsuit over fee increases for data on the US equities market.Information on orders and trades has become more crucial for brokers and investors with the rise of electronic and automated trading spread across myriad venues. Against that backdrop, exchanges which sell the data and traders and investors who buy it have locked horns for years over whether the market data fees are fair.The dispute has intensified lately after Robert Jackson, an SEC commissioner, surprised exchanges with staunch criticism not only of the way they sell and distribute market data, but the broader system of for-profit exchanges.Mr Redfearn’s appointment last year also caught the attention of exchanges. He was an outspoken critic of data costs in his previous job as global head of market structure at JPMorgan, the investment bank.In 2016 the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association lost a drawn-out lawsuit against the exchanges over the cost of data, but appealed against the decision.“The privilege log filed by Sifma in this proceeding demonstrates that, before joining the division of trading and markets, Mr Redfearn, in his capacity as a Sifma member representative, was deeply involved in formulating Sifma’s legal strategy in this proceeding,” the filing said.It said Mr Redfearn’s name was listed 16 times in the privilege log, including 10 times in entries for communication with Sifma’s counsel containing “discussion of litigation strategy”.“Mr Redfearn’s substantial personal participation in this proceeding on behalf of Sifma mandates his recusal from any involvement in the commission’s consideration of this matter,” the filing said.The exchanges also called for oral arguments in the case before a ruling on the appeal.The SEC had no immediate comment.
30;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2018-09-14T15:40:24Z;Regulators probe Nasdaq’s derivatives market safeguards;Move comes after trader blew €114m hole in protections for European power derivatives market;Swedish markets regulators are to investigate Nasdaq as the exchange and its customers began rebuilding their defences against defaults in the derivatives markets, after they were badly damaged by soured bets from a Norwegian trader.Inquests and demands for fresh funds from market participants began on Friday following a turbulent week.Einar Aas, one of Norway’s best known power markets traders, was unable to maintain his positions in the German and Nordic power markets after prices went sharply against him.The outsized positions used up several layers of protection at Nasdaq’s clearing house, which is designed to insulate the market from the effects of a default. Nasdaq had to use two-thirds of its mutual default fund, in which the market shares any extreme losses.“It’s not caused any financial stability issues but I am worried that a clearing house has lost two-thirds of its default fund. That’s a very unusual situation,” Erik Thedéen, director-general at Finansinspektionen, the regulator, told the Financial Times.“We have to see if there were any breaches of rules or regulations by Nasdaq. We will investigate. There’s no presumption of right or wrong but we will start as soon as possible.”The European Securities and Markets Authority also said Nasdaq’s supervisor was looking into how the default of the clearing member was managed.“At this stage we can say that the pre-funded resources of the clearer were sufficient to withstand the losses. This is consistent with the EU-wide clearing house stress test results,” Esma said.It cost €114m to close out Mr Aas’s positions, which will be covered by both the exchange and members of its clearing house.“We are working closely with all our member firms and regulators,” Nasdaq said. It has also increased margins on spread positions and hired a third party to review all its clearing house practices.Clearing houses have become important pillars for global market stability following the financial crisis, as policymakers insisted they process more derivatives trades.Nasdaq began rebuilding the range of buffers it uses to insulate itself. The 166 members of its clearing house, including banks and energy traders such as Morgan Stanley, UBS and Equinor, Norway’s state oil company, began receiving demands to replenish its mutual default fund.The fund cushioned the impact from Mr Aas’s trades, and consists of contributions from all clearing members. Nasdaq needed a total of €100m from its members to replenish the fund by Monday morning.Contributions are based on the amount of risk they take on. The largest members, such as Fortum, a Finnish energy company, will pay around €20m. Smaller members, such as Statkraft, a generator of renewable energy, have been asked to pay €5m,In addition, Nasdaq said on Friday it would set aside a further €19m (Skr200m) of its own funds as a backstop in the clearing house.The exchange said the extra layer of capital will be in place for an interim period of 90 days starting today, it told members in a notice. Nasdaq said its move was “in order to strengthen our commitment to the commodity market and its members”
31;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2018-09-14T06:57:06Z;Nasdaq to buy Sweden’s Cinnober for $190m;;Nasdaq, the US exchange, has made a $190m bid to buy Cinnober, a Swedish trading technology group, to deepen its push into technology and analytics.In a statement on Friday Nasdaq said it would offer to pay SKr75 per Cinnober share, and SKr85 per warrant, by public tender. It will fund the deal out of its own resources. Cinnober closed yesterday at SKr61.5 per share.“The combined intellectual capital, technology competence and capabilities of Cinnober and our Market Technology business will expand the breadth and depth of our fastest growing division,” said Adena Friedman, chief executive of Nasdaq.The move comes a day after one of Norway’s richest men blew a €100m hole in Nasdaq’s European power futures market after making a series of wrong bets. Nasdaq closed out his trades on Wednesday, resulting in losses of €114m that will be covered by both the exchange and members of its clearing house.Cinnober supplies clearing software to some of the world’s largest exchanges, such as B3 of Brazil, the London Metal Exchange and the Japan Exchange. However it has struggled for profitability in the past 18 months after losing some key customers and changing the way it charged customers for its software. An expansion plan also has yet to pay off. Shares had fallen by more than 40 per cent in the last year.Last month it replaced Veronica Augustsson as chief executive with Peter Lenardos, a former analyst at RBC Capital Markets in London. Since his arrival, the US-born Mr Lenardos has begun a deep cost-cutting programme, fuelling speculation Cinnober could be a bid target.The deal has the backing of Cinnober’s board and Nils-Robert Persson, its co-founder, chairman and largest shareholder. The deal “reinforces the strong technology foundation in Sweden,” said Mr Persson.The Swedish capital has become a hub for developers in trading and risk software for the world’s financial markets. Local companies such as Nasdaq, Cinnober and TriOptima are widely used by global banks and exchanges to run critical operations. Nasdaq said the deal would boost its earnings per share in the first year of ownership.

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
33;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2018-08-30T22:03:47Z;Nasdaq admits closing auction blunders;Exchange says it mistakenly executed more than a thousand trades;Nasdaq has mistakenly allowed more than a thousand trades to be executed around the market open and close, an error that it said prevented other investors from getting their orders filled at a crucial time of the trading day.In an alert to the market, Nasdaq said certain orders, called minimum quality orders, were mistakenly included in the opening and closing “cross” where outstanding orders are executed.The exchange said the error dates back to November 2011. Closing prices are widely used to set the valuations of mutual funds and other investment instruments.Minimum quantity orders are so called because execution of the trade is contingent on a certain amount of the order being filled. However, because these orders often do not result in actual trades, Nasdaq decided to exclude them from the cross, but failed to do so.Since implementation, Nasdaq has excluded minimum quantity orders from the opening and closing price calculation, the alert said, “but included them in the execution process”.The mistake meant there were instances where other orders did not execute because the minimum quantity orders that were ahead of them “by price or time” were included in the execution process, Nasdaq said.“It is seven years and them not knowing about it — that is just unacceptable,” said Joe Saluzzi, co-founder of Themis Trading. “The person who lost here appears to be the person who did not get the [order filled] and should have. Also, had these orders been in the calculation, there might have been a different closing price.”Mr Saluzzi also questioned whether some sophisticated traders may have detected the “bug” and been able to profit from it. A spokesman for the exchange declined to comment.Nasdaq did not provide information on the full period since 2011 but said its analysis of 2018 data shows that 1,287 minimum quantity orders have been executed during 1,231 opening or closing crosses.The exchange pointed out that these orders represented a tiny fraction of trading activity: it has executed more than 48m orders across more than 892,000 opening and closing auctions so far in 2018, it said.Nasdaq said that about 50 customers were affected in 2018.It pledged to fix the problem.A person with knowledge of the situation said Nasdaq reported the issue to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been taking a tougher stance on interruptions and glitches that have come to characterise modern markets.In March, the New York Stock Exchange agreed to pay $14m to settle regulatory charges over a string of alleged violations of new rules around computerised trading in US equities.The growth of index investing and exchange traded funds has added to the importance of the closing auction since ETFs need to create or redeem shares by the close of trading.

On a reported basis, Nasdaq missed with 97 cents a share — down from 87 cents a share in the year ago period — against Wall Street expectations of $1.06 a share, according to estimates from Bloomberg. Net income rose 11 per cent to $162m.Net revenues in the quarter rose by 3 per cent to $615m with 7 per cent of the gain from organic growth, 1 per cent from advantageous foreign exchange rates and 5 per cent reduction related the net result of acquisitions and divestitures.With chief executive Adena Friedman at the helm in recent years, Nasdaq has been beefing up its operations in information services and market technology, areas that grew by 22 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively in the second quarter.Among the drivers were record assets under management of $187bn for exchange traded products tracking Nasdaq indexes, as well as the group’s efforts to ramp up the number of customers using its trading technology. Nasdaq said market technology order intake rose 18 per cent year-over-year in the first six months to $109m and that it now counts five clients in the cryptocurrency space that will be using its technology for trading, clearing or surveillance.Nasdaq also raised its guidance for annual expenses on non-GAAP basis to $1.31m to $1.335m versus $1.295m to $1.335m, for reasons related to performance-linked compensation.
35;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2018-07-23T02:30:25Z;Maker-taker irony as NYSE and Nasdaq challenge SEC;Regulator’s scrutiny of fee structure highlights need for greater transparency;"The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, two of the world’s largest stock exchanges, are pitched against some of their biggest customers in a row with national regulators over the assessment of trading fees.The dispute centres on how technological innovation has changed the way capital is deployed.It may appear arcane but there is an important consideration: transaction costs, a real if little-understood challenge for the fund management industry.The issue centres on the “maker-taker” model by which customers are charged to place or lift firm bids to deal in shares. The US Securities and Exchange Commission wants to test the effect of charging some customers, but not others, to see if it changes where middlemen trade and the amount they pay for stock.The SEC launched a pilot study this year to examine the effects of the increasing use of the maker-taker model.There is an irony in the fact that the two largest US exchanges are challenging this regulatory scrutiny.Nicola Beattie, founding partner at Market Partners, a consultancy, notes that it was the maker-taker fee structure that led to the plethora of competitors of stock exchanges, not only in the US but Europe too.“You can’t start a new platform without liquidity,” Ms Beattie said, pointing to a truth that both sellside and buyside know well. This truth applies not only to exchanges but also automated trading systems and off-exchange trading venues that match bargains internally.Start-up alternative platforms, such as Arca (now owned by NYSE) and Chi-X in Europe, could only compete against traditional exchanges by showing that investors would pay lower transaction fees and also find tighter bid-offer spreads and better pricing.To do that they had to entice liquidity providers — market makers who trade stock, and fund managers who buy and sell — to use their platform. This necessitated paying them.Exchanges demonstrate what economists describe as “network effects”: that is, the more users they have, the more valuable they become; this brings in yet more users who will be increasingly confident of finding what they want.It is a principle that applies to businesses ranging from eBay to Facebook to bricks-and-mortar retail. Indeed, in its objection to the SEC study, NYSE said that none of the 33 registered ATSs and 36 other trading venues were being asked to participate despite their use of maker-taker.Central to the NYSE complaint is the fact that both it and Nasdaq will be required to set a ceiling on some prices currently charged to end-investors while this will not apply to competing ATSs and other systems.It is agreed that competition has led to cuts to trading fees — a good thing for the asset management industry whose customers pick up the bill.The rise of this competitive environment, however, has not necessarily benefited end-investors as much as it could have done.One example Ms Beattie cites is proprietary trading shops: those that have invested in high-speed technology have been able to dive into venues far faster than some broker dealers, securing the keenest prices and turning the market against the investor.In a 2015 research paper, professors at the University of Notre Dame and Indiana University argue that maker-taker can incentivise brokers to select the venue that offers the higher rebate for liquidity rather than the venue with the keenest price.Alasdair Haynes, chief executive of Aquis Exchange, a competitor of traditional trading venues, says that if end-investors are to benefit, the emphasis has to be transparency.Who receives the rebate, the broker-dealer or the end investor, is currently hidden. “When fund manager A is charged a fee (by its broker-dealer) the rebate (for providing liquidity) goes to the broker-dealer, not fund manager A,” said Mr Haynes.Aquis, where Ms Beattie is also a director, is charging a flat fee for unlimited use of its trading platform, similar to the business model used by Spotify and Netflix.Meanwhile, the requirements of Mifid II, which demands greater transparency in the actual costs of trading, are concentrating fund managers’ minds like never before. In a low-inflation, low-returns environment, transaction costs are likely to face increasing scrutiny."

The IPO raised $153m.At $22.39 at the close of trading on Thursday, the company had a market value of nearly $2bn.“It is a big deal for the cannabis industry’s expansion plans,” said Matthew Kennedy, an IPO market strategist at Renaissance Capital, which runs exchange trade funds that buy newly listed shares.A US listing gives companies access to large pools of capital and heightened levels of publicity. US exchanges are able to list companies so long as their operations are legal in the jurisdiction where they operate.“You have a much easier path to finding capital and a much cleaner way to invest,” said Sean Stiefel, a portfolio manager at Navy Capital, adding that the US was beginning to “institutionalise” cannabis investing.Brendan Kennedy, Tilray’s chief executive, told the Financial Times that 70 per cent of the buyers of the IPO were US-based investors, 18 per cent Canadian and 12 per cent from outside North America, including London, Frankfurt and Hong Kong.“It is a validation for us and the entire sector that [cannabis] is a global opportunity,” Mr Kennedy said. “It signifies a global shift in perception.”Both Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange have accepted companies that were already listed in Canada as well as listed shares of companies that operate in cannabis-related business.Originally listed on the Toronto stock exchange, Canopy, a producer of medical marijuana, achieved a dual listing on NYSE in May. Similarly, Toronto-listed Cronos Group began trading on Nasdaq in February.Nasdaq is also home to MTech Acquisition Corp, a special purpose acquisition vehicle, or spac, that intends to buy a companies “ancillary to the cannabis industry”.NYSE lists a real estate investment trust called Innovative Industrial Properties, which owns industrial and greenhouse buildings leased to state-licensed medical-use cannabis growers.Medical use is authorised at the federal or national level in 29 countries, according to Tilray, and, in October, Canada is expected to become the first major industrialised nation to legalise adult-use cannabis at the federal level. Citing figures from the UN, Tilray put the value of the global cannabis market, including the illicit market, at an estimated $150bn annually with more than 180m estimated users.Momentum of cannabis shares and the perceived market opportunity are the lure for buyers, but there are risks beyond the remaining legal uncertainties. Mr Kennedy noted that Tilray remained unprofitable in a highly competitive industry.Since it began operations in 2014, the company has yet to turn a profit, clocking a net loss of $7.8m in 2017 and $5.2m for the three months ended in March.Proceeds will help fund an expansion plan aimed at increasing its production space from about 60,000 sq ft to about 912,000 sq ft as well as debt repayment, working capital and acquisitions.Cowen and BMO Capital Markets are acting jointly as book runners.Sign up to the FT Markets WhatsApp group to receive daily markets news and analysis alerts.
37;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2018-07-02T20:05:44Z;Nasdaq launches US interest rate futures contract;;Nasdaq is moving forward in its attempt to revive its ailing Treasury trading business, launching a futures contract designed to help investors protect against movements in US interest rates.The move will pit the exchange against CME Group, which dominates interest rate futures trading in the US. CME also recently-acquired Nex Group’s BrokerTec platform which is the largest treasury trading venue with 80 per cent market share, having chipped away business from Nasdaq’s own platform.It marks the next step in efforts by Nasdaq to breathe life back into its US interest rate business, which has faltered since the exchange bought its treasury platform from Howard Lutnick’s Cantor Fitzgerald in 2013. The exchange rebranded its offering under Nasdaq Fixed Income in January 2017, later consolidating the business beneath Tom Wittman in July 2017, who also runs equities and options trading globally.Ted Bragg, head of Nasdaq Fixed Income, says efforts to stem the decline in market share have proved successful, claiming to have steadied treasury trading volumes at about 19 per cent of the market this year, down from roughly 40 per cent when they acquired the venue.“The first goal was to stabilise market share which we have done and now we are moving to something new,” he said. “We will continue to build on this.”The strategy comes at a pivotal time for the US Treasury market as the Federal Reserve pares its balance sheet and continues to raise interest rates, with investors poised for greater volatility — and higher trading volumes — ahead.The new contract, called a DVO1 Treasury Future, is the exchange’s first interest rate future and will allow investors to trade the US dollar value of a one basis point move in the treasury market, with contracts for different treasuries with maturities between two and 30 years.Whether the contract will significantly reverse Nasdaq’s fortunes in the treasury market remains to be seen, with heightened competition in the market adding a further challenge. Howard Lutnick has re-entered the market, launching a new rival for cash treasuries, and the acquisition of BrokerTec by CME will create a US interest rate powerhouse.“You always have to be concerned by the competition,” said Mr Bragg. “But our clients have said they are supportive of what we are doing . . . Right now you can only really trade [treasury futures] at CME, there is no alternative. In the cash market there is BrokerTec, ourselves and some start-ups. For our clients, competition is good thing.”
38;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2018-06-05T12:17:14Z;NYSE buys business advice video group Radiate;Deal comes as exchange aims to boost services in corporate listings battle;The New York Stock Exchange is buying Radiate, a company which creates short videos of career advice from business leaders, to boost its services in the arms race for corporate listings in the world’s biggest equity market.Betty Liu, who founded Radiate and worked as a business journalist for outlets including Bloomberg Television and the Financial Times, will join NYSE as executive vice-chairman as of July 9 and have a seat on the NYSE Group board. “We have 2,400 listed companies on the exchange and we want to create a bigger community for them,” Ms Liu told the FT, saying Radiate’s short videos on leadership and live events would help make a NYSE listing “more than just a trading relationship” for existing members and prospective initial public offering candidates.Her appointment comes just weeks after Intercontinental Exchange, NYSE’s parent, named Stacey Cunningham as the first female leader in the New York exchange’s 226-year history. NYSE and Nasdaq are locked in a battle for corporate listings that involves not just intense blitzes for IPOs, but efforts to persuade companies to transfer from rival exchanges.[Ms Liu will] help us offer our customers even more opportunities to tap the NYSE network to connect and share ideasThe pattern over time has been that Nasdaq wins a greater number of deals, but the “Big Board” attracts listings of larger size. So far this year, 55 companies raising $12.3bn have listed on Nasdaq while 29 companies raising $15.7bn have opted for NYSE.Following the dotcom boom of the 1990s and early 2000s, NYSE changed its standards and has targeted more tech listings, winning high-profile deals in recent years like Snap, the owner of messaging app Snapchat, and music streaming service Spotify.NYSE did not disclose the financial terms of the deal, but said the transaction would not affect ICE’s 2018 results or capital return plans.Radiate, which has just three full-time staff and about 20 freelancers, has built a library of concise video lessons from chief executives about leadership and management challenges, from how to hire good people to how to fire underperformers. Lessons on time management and how chief executives handle emails were among its most popular videos, Ms Liu said.“We look forward to building on Radiate, the innovative business [Ms Liu] founded, as part of our efforts to enrich the NYSE network and experience for our listed issuers and the broader business community,” said Jeff Sprecher, ICE’s chairman and chief executive.Ms Cunningham said Ms Liu would “help us offer our customers even more opportunities to tap the NYSE network to connect and share ideas on our global stage”.
39;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2018-04-25T12:54:31Z;Winklevoss twins hire Nasdaq to monitor crypto market;;The Winklevoss twins have hired Nasdaq to monitor its cryptocurrencies trading venue, marking the US-based exchange operator’s first such surveillance deal in the sector.Under the arrangement, the Gemini Trust Company — the company run by twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss — will use Nasdaq’s SMARTS Market Surveillance Technology related to the trading of bitcoin, ether and the auction settlement process for Cboe Global Market’s bitcoin futures contract.The cryptocurrencies market overall has been plagued by manipulation attempts and has increasingly found itself in the crosshairs of regulators.Separately, Nasdaq reported a 15 per cent increase in first quarter net revenues from the year ago period to $666m. Net income was $177m, or $1.05 per share, compared to $168m and 99 cents per share. The exchange beat on top-line results, but trailed analysts' forecasts on the EPS, according to Bloomberg.The first three months of the year marked a return of volatility to financial markets after a historic period of clam had weighed on all types of business that rely on trading.Nasdaq said its market services business delivered record quarterly net revenues of $250m, a 15 per cent jump from the prior year period thanks to rising trading volumes and results at its equity derivatives business after its purchase of options exchange ISE. The division is Nasdaq’s biggest and accounted for 38 per cent of total group net revenue during the quarter.
40;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2018-04-24T11:34:25Z;The 30 minutes that have an outsized role in US stock trading;An increasing concentration of volumes from 3.30pm to 4pm is causing concern;The increasing concentration of buying and selling of US stocks in the final 30 minutes of the day has some investors calling for a shorter trading period to help limit the market’s growing operational risk.A seismic shift towards exchange traded funds and other index-tracking investment vehicles has heightened the importance of the last half-hour of the US trading day, from 3.30 to 4pm, when these passive funds typically conduct most of their activity to accurately match their benchmarks. That has prompted traditional active managers to conduct more of their trading during this window to benefit from greater market “liquidity”.“This dynamic is a pretty big story,” said Bob Minicus, head of global equity trading at Fidelity. “We view the close as an opportunity. As more volumes migrate towards the close, we will follow it.”Some traders and investors complain that the funnelling of activity into the last half-hour of the day — which comprises nearly a quarter of all US stock trading — is sucking liquidity away from the middle of the day, when making large trades can now have a noticeable market impact.Indeed, what traders refer to as the “liquidity smile” formed by the pattern of trading volumes has recently become more pronounced and turned it into a “liquidity smirk” due to the lopsided importance of the 3.30-4pm trading window. Some now fret that, with so much money sloshing around in a small window, it increases the risks of market mishaps.“A lot of trading is concentrated in a very narrow period of time,” said Marco Pirondini, head of US equities at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management. “It can be a very big technical problem. I would love regulators to start to think about this before there’s a problem, rather than after one.”Sucking more liquidity away from midday trading heightens the risk of making markets more prone to volatility around lunchtime. The share of US stock trading that happens between noon and 2pm has dipped from more than 23 per cent a decade ago to about 20 per cent, according to Credit Suisse. Given the clear trajectory of the trend, more midday volatility could start to become more apparent in the coming years.“It’s become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The liquidity feeds on itself,” said Todd Lopez, head of electronic trading for the Americas at UBS. “The concentration around the close is likely to accelerate as more people try to minimise their market impact.”There have already been some examples that the thinner midday trading can cause problems, most notably the “flash crash” of 2010, when the US stock market suddenly swooned at 2.45pm. While the blame fell primarily on a badly executed order by a big asset manager that was exacerbated by high-frequency trading, some experts say the severity was worsened by the thinner early-afternoon liquidity.The first and last half-hour of the US trading day now accounts for 39.6 per cent of all volumes, up from 31.5 per cent a decade ago, according to Credit Suisse data. A decade ago about 16 per cent of all trading happened in the final 30 minutes, but that rose to more than 20 per cent in 2012, and almost 25 per cent this year. The closing auction alone — when most ETFs do their rebalancing — now accounts for 8.2 per cent of volumes in 2018, up from 3 per cent in 2007.Closing auctions in shares are mostly held at a company’s primary listing venue, concentrating liquidity at Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange.“It does come with increased operational risk,” Mr Lopez said. “If an exchange has an issue, it’s already quite disruptive, but as more trading happens at the close the risks become potentially much worse.”Stacey Cunningham, NYSE’s chief operating officer, said that while the “auctions are complicated”, NYSE and Nasdaq now had a system where they backed up each other’s closing auctions, making the system more resilient. “If one market suffers a technical problem, then the other one can handle the auction,” she said.Nonetheless, some traders argue that the US stock market’s hours should be shortened to reflect the new reality of when trading occurs — which might focus liquidity without sapping markets of overall volume.“It’s changing the market’s dynamics,” said Drew Miyawaki, head of global equity trading for Legal & General Investment Management America. “The question is whether we should have a shorter, more concentrated trading day.”While a lack of overlap with the European markets is a concern for some, Amundi’s Mr Pirondini said he would welcome a shorter trading day, arguing that the impact would be minimal and would bring with it many benefits.“I would support that with all my heart,” the portfolio manager said. “It would give investors more time to think. We’ve been widening the trading window for decades, but it doesn’t make markets more efficient, and most of the action is in the last half-hour anyway.”
41;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2018-04-24T03:00:29Z;NYSE challenges Nasdaq’s reign as king of the tech IPO;Having secured Snap and Spotify, Big Board readies for battle over Uber and Airbnb;Ever since high-profile tech listings burst into the public imagination more than two decades ago, the Nasdaq stock exchange has been synonymous with the online giants that have helped define the modern era.But in little over a year Nasdaq’s cross-town rivals at the New York Stock Exchange have landed the two highest-profile listings: the $3.9bn raised by messaging app Snapchat’s parent in March 2017 and the listing of music streaming service Spotify this month.That has raised questions over who is the new king of the tech IPO at a time the stakes are expected to get even bigger.The expectation on Wall Street is that the trickle of deals in 2018 could gather pace in the coming years, with companies such as Uber and Airbnb trading in their private status for a jump into the public market.John Tuttle, head of listings at NYSE, admits the exchange was “slow to catch on” as a series of now high-profile companies such as Amazon listed on Nasdaq. Nasdaq suffered a black eye with Facebook’s 2012 IPO in which technical mishaps contributed to a delayed and chaotic opening for the stock, further encouraging the NYSE.The exchange, which is owned by the Intercontinental Exchange, ultimately caught on to the idea that tech companies would be new titans of industry, changed its listing standards and began aggressively recruiting in Silicon Valley. NYSE’s share of the number of tech deals has boomed from the single digits in the late 1990s to 52 per cent from 2013 to 2015, according to Dealogic.“NYSE was always home to innovative companies — tech is the next phase in innovation,” said Mr Tuttle. “We modernised our listing standards to meet the demands of companies in the 21st century.”In January, NYSE recruited Jose Cobos, a San Francisco banker and former Navy Seal to lead its charge for tech listings. NYSE also modified its rules for direct listings in February, a move it hopes sets the stage for other tech “decacorns”, or unicorns valued at $10bn or more, that may want to try Spotify’s approach and list its shares without raising any new money.Nasdaq has not been without recent successes. Cloud storage company Dropbox picked Nasdaq when it raised $869m in a flotation last month. And at its headquarters in Times Square, Nasdaq has given exchange veteran Nelson Griggs oversight of its corporation solutions business, which sells companies investor relations and board services, as well as listings, to solidify part of the Nasdaq’s pitch to companies of both offerings.“The rationale to combine them is that in many cases they have the same end customer: corporate CEOs, CFOs as well as board members,” Mr Griggs said.Although NYSE dominated in 2017 with 51 per cent of deals and 80 per cent of money raised, Nasdaq captured 85 per cent of tech listings in 2016 and so far this year is leading with 54 per cent, Dealogic data show.“The numbers point to the fact that we are recovering from Facebook,” said Mr Griggs, president Nasdaq stock exchange.A breakdown of the figures shows that the average IPO size for the NYSE is higher than Nasdaq. Although Nasdaq has gained more tech listings — 183 for Nasdaq versus 160 for NYSE since 2010 — NYSE has won the bigger tech IPOs in recent years. All told, the tech listings on NYSE have raised $74.4bn since 2010 compared with $49.6bn for Nasdaq.NYSE and Nasdaq retain different listing standards, which can affect decision making. NYSE listing fees for companies are capped at $500,000 a year versus $155,000 a year at Nasdaq.Both Spotify and Dropbox declined to comment, but executives of other tech companies indicated the choice of exchange is a personal one.Tien Tzuo, the chief executive of Zuora, which sells software that enables companies to transform into subscription businesses, said its customers, which include Caterpillar, were increasingly NYSE-listed and “it was important to be there with them”.By contrast, Rob Bernshteyn, chief executive of Coupa, said Nasdaq helped the provider of spending management services for companies to make valuable contacts. “I was introduced to John Chambers [the former executive chairman of Cisco Systems] and it developed into a mentoring relationship,” he said.The pageantry of NYSE’s storied digs in Manhattan’s financial district and the thrill of ringing the opening bell on listing day count for some. For Mr Bernshteyn, it was important to have as many colleagues with him as possible. NYSE has a limit of 14 guests on its podium largely because of fire code reasons, while up to 75 can share the Nasdaq stage for the market open in Times Square.While listing fees are not a major contributor to the revenues of either Nasdaq or NYSE’s parent ICE, victory in the battle for tech listings is not a pyrrhic one. The close of daily trading in a company’s shares must happen at the home exchange, and with the proliferation of index-based investing and exchange traded funds, a higher volume of trading has gravitated to the end of the day.Yet if more tech unicorns do go public, the big prize for these competing exchanges may ultimately be something far more intangible: branding.“If you are NYSE and Nasdaq and you cannot get anyone to list on your venue,” said Kyle Martin, a research analyst at Westwood Holdings, “who are you?”
42;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2018-04-18T15:46:23Z;Fire extinguisher prompts lengthy outage at Nasdaq Nordic;;The open of trade on Nasdaq equities bourses in seven countries was delayed by hours on Wednesday after the exchange operator faced a serious issue at a Swedish data centre that houses its servers. Trading across the group’s stock markets in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania did not begin on Wednesday until 1:15pm — 2:10pm CET (12:15pm — 1:10pm BST), hours after the typical opening time. Wednesday’s issues were sparked by an “errant fire extinguisher system” at a data centre operated by a third party in Väsby, Sweden, a Nasdaq spokesperson said. DigiPlex, the group that runs the data centre, said that “there was no fire, but the fire system triggered the gas suppression system in the module of one of our customers.” “We view this very seriously and are now performing a thorough root cause analysis, and already this morning called in external specialist for this process,” the group added.Data centre troubles are not entirely uncommon for exchange operators. However, the time it took to switch to a back-up facility may raise eyebrows among member firms keen to trade, as well as regulators.“We will be closely investigating the issue with the data centre partner to determine the root cause and find a permanent resolution,” the Nasdaq spokesperson said. Equities markets in affected countries were placid on the day, echoing the performance elsewhere in Europe. The OMX Stockholm 30 gauge was up 0.49 per cent, while the OMX Copenhagen 20 was essentially flat. The pan-European Stoxx 600 benchmark rose 0.31 per cent. Nasdaq’s woes on Wednesday come two days after a Euronext hiccup  caused a delay in the opening print for several closely watched indices, including France’s CAC 40 gauge. Deutsche Börse, the German exchanges operator, faced “serious issues” in March that caused a delay in the opening of equities and futures trading. 
43;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2018-03-19T03:30:24Z;Dropbox IPO is yet another corporate governance low point;The ‘one-share, one-vote’ proposition is a victim of competition between exchanges;The big investment institutions are losing their battle against the use of dual-class share structures. That much is clear from the forthcoming initial public offering of stock in Dropbox, the internet storage group. As well as proposing to float with B shares that carry 10 votes for every class A single vote, it aims to have the right to issue non-voting C shares similar to those of Snap in last year’s notoriously voteless IPO. That offering, from the promoter of the disappearing message app Snapchat, marked a low point in corporate governance in a tech sector where standards were already egregiously poor.Dropbox’s founders have been undeterred by index providers’ more restrictive post-Snap approach to including dual-vote companies in the indices, which implies lower liquidity for the shares and thus a loss of value. The same is true of Spotify, the digital music services outfit, which has filed for a direct listing that entails extra voting rights for the founders.The rot — at least from many big investors’ perspective — set in with Google’s dual-class listing in 2004. Such listings increased in the US from 487 in 2005 to 701 in 2015, an eye-catching 44 per cent rise. Among those issuers have been high-profile tech companies such as Facebook, Groupon, LinkedIn, TripAdvisor and Zynga. In effect investors have been trading in their governance rights in the hope of backing another Google and the belief that the founding entrepreneurs are miracle workers.The ability to assert control, some argue, eliminates the agency problem that exists where ownership and control are divorced. It also provides a shelter from capital market short-termism. Yet the costs that result from forfeiting votes are potentially high.First and most obviously, founder-directors are insulated from accountability. They cannot be booted out if their wizardry turns out to be less than miraculous or wanes over the years, as is all too likely in a tech sector where constant disruption is the norm.Lucian Bebchuk and Kobi Kastiel of Harvard University have convincingly demonstrated that dual-class structures tend to become less efficient over time. As a classic illustration they cite Viacom’s Sumner Redstone, the media baron who unquestionably was a wizard in his day, but who at a frail 94 has been called a living ghost. Yet he still retains control with a small equity stake. In recent years Viacom’s performance has been woeful.A further problem is that founders with a low percentage of the equity bear only a fraction of the cost of any damage they do to the company while capturing the full private benefits. By the same token they are incentivised to extract private benefits of control at the expense of majority shareholders through related party transactions, empire building and the rest. The smaller the founders’ stake the worse the alignment of interests with the other shareholders. Academic evidence suggests that the larger the gap between the founders’ fraction of voting rights and fraction of the equity — the so-called wedge — the greater the reduction in the company’s value.The one-share, one-vote proposition has proved particularly vulnerable to competition between exchanges. For six decades until 1985 the New York Stock Exchange had a one share, one vote rule. But soon after General Motors threatened to move to the more permissive Nasdaq it altered its listing requirements to permit dual-class voting. Competition is now global and thus more intense. The Hong Kong stock exchange has long prohibited dual-class structures, but having lost the Alibaba IPO to New York, it now plans to reverse its policy, albeit with some safeguards, including a sunset provision where a multiple vote owner ceases to be a director.As the governance newsletter Global Proxy Watch points out, this relaxation raises the concern that differential voting rights could open the door to Communist party entrenchment in China’s state controlled entities. Meantime the authorities in London, with an eye on oil-rich desert sands and a share of the proposed Saudi Aramco new issue, are sorely tempted to become more permissive on this and other scores.The implication for the big investment institutions is that they will have to win back ground by other means. Expect a fight for better disclosure of the wedge between equity ownership and control rights and of the governance risks implicit in dual-class voting.
44;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2018-03-10T01:18:34Z;Tech groups show their resilience and hit new highs;Sector continues to attract investors because of revenue and earnings growth;Shares of technology companies rallied to fresh highs on Friday as the sector’s growth continues to attract investors in what has been a tumultuous start to the year for US equities.Both the Nasdaq Composite and the information technology sector of the benchmark S&P 500 index set records, rising 1.8 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively. The tech sector has remained resilient even as US shares sold off last month on fears of rising inflation and accelerated interest rate rises.Investors and analysts said tech continues to shine on revenue and earnings growth amid uncertainty over big-picture issues around the strength of the US economy, the pace of inflation and the direction of monetary and trade policy. On Friday, a jobs report that pointed to economic growth, but that eased the worries over runaway inflation, added to the appetite for risk assets, including tech shares.“In an environment where you have modest growth without a lot of inflation, companies that can generate top-line and [earnings per share] growth continue to lead,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.“The leaders continue to be the Fangs — momentum continues to be the primary driver,” he added, referring to the group of large, influential tech companies that have led the gains in recent years and continue to outperform.So far this year, Netflix is up 73 per cent, Amazon 35 per cent, Alphabet 10.9 per cent and Apple 6.4 per cent.The S&P 500 has added 4.2 per cent in 2018.“Momentum begets more momentum [with] buying in the category of stocks that has been working well, specifically technology sector stocks,” said Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations.He added that a better than expected earnings report for Marvell Technology, a semiconductor company, breathed some additional life into that area of the market.The info-tech sector of the S&P 500 is the top performing sector year-to-date, with a 11.2 per cent gain coming on the back of a 34 per cent rise last year.“Typically growth [companies do] better when actual economic growth is scarce and that is what we have had in this economic cycle,” said Max Gokhman, head of asset allocation at Pacific Life Fund Advisors.Mr Gokhman cited aspects such as automation and consumer adoption of smartphones as helping to drive profits.For the fourth quarter, companies in the info-tech sector have reported earnings growth of 22.6 per cent versus a year ago, on revenue gains of 13.4 per cent, according to FactSet.Still, some investors including Mr Gokhman expect more traditional value-style companies, such as financials and energy, to outperform if economic growth accelerates.
45;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2018-03-01T23:26:00Z;Nasdaq sues IEX for allegedly infringing technology patents;Rival claims move is attempt ‘to obstruct an innovative new competitor’;Nasdaq is suing rival IEX, alleging the upstart exchange knowingly violated a series of Nasdaq patents in developing its trading platform.IEX has failed to gain substantial market share and is gearing up to launch a listing business by luring transfers from Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, which are home to nearly all US-listed companies.Nasdaq is seeking to halt IEX’s use of the technology and receive damages, according to a complaint filed on Thursday in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey.The suit involves the infringement of seven patents that Nasdaq says represent “millions of dollars in investment over decades”. They include technology used in the closing auction process that is central to running a listings business.Other aspects of the lawsuit pertain to technology used to match buyers and sellers of securities, known as the “matching engine”, as well as ways to transmit market data and the architecture of a trading platform.“These seven patents cover important innovations that we, and our customers, rely on for reliability, scalability, and transparency,” said Edward Knight, Nasdaq’s general counsel and chief regulatory officer.IEX said: “Similar to our exchange application process, this is yet another attempt by Nasdaq to obstruct an innovative new competitor.”IEX, which was founded in 2012, fought a bitter battle to become an exchange, with Nasdaq among those opposed to its application. Since launching as a registered stock exchange in 2016, IEX has garnered a market share of less than 3 per cent.In addition to developing trading technology for in-house use, Nasdaq made more than $300m in revenue selling trading technology in 2017. Nasdaq’s trading technology is used by 90 exchanges around the world.Nasdaq argues that former employees who are now at IEX have been involved in crafting IEX’s trading platform, and that IEX has said that its closing auction process was “based on extensive review of the auction designs of” other exchanges including Nasdaq, and that the information it disseminates as part of that auction is “substantially similar” to a patented process at Nasdaq.Michael Lewis’s book, Flash Boys, catapulted IEX to fame, depicting the group and its founder, Brad Katsuyama, as crusaders against a market that had become “rigged” to the benefit of high-speed traders.
46;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2018-02-28T23:59:44Z;Volatile month sees S&P 500 fall nearly 4% in February;US index suffers worst monthly performance in more than two years;Wall Street ended a tumultuous month on a sour note on Wednesday, suffering a second consecutive decline of over 1 per cent and slipping to its worst monthly performance in more than two years.The S&P 500 had stayed in positive territory for most of the day, but the bounce came undone in the final hour of trading, as it closed 1.1 per cent lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sinking 1.5 per cent. The Nasdaq Composite finished 0.8 per cent weaker.For February, the S&P 500 fell 3.9 per cent, the first monthly drop since March. The decline ended one of the index’s longest monthly winning streaks on record. The blue-chip equity index is now up just 1.5 per cent for 2018, despite its best start since 1987.The Dow was down 4.3 per cent in February while the Nasdaq gave up 1.9 per cent.The FTSE All World index fell 4.3 per cent in February for its first monthly drop since October 2016. This also ended a 15-month winning streak for global stocks, the longest since at least 1994, according to Thomson Reuters data.“February finally cracked the volatility genie out of the bottle, and now the big question is: will he stay out for good?” wrote Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial, in a note to clients.The month started with a bang, as rising concerns over inflationary pressures sent bond yields higher and forced stock market investors to take note. The sell-off then tripped up several exchange-traded products that bet on volatility, and contributed to one of the fastest stock market corrections in history.Markets quickly regained their footing thanks to the healthy economic backdrop, but rising speculation that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates more than three times this year has supported the dollar and weighed on the bond and equity markets.The dollar index, a measure of the US currency against a basket of peers, was up 0.3 per cent on Wednesday. The index staged its second-best month of Donald Trump’s presidency in February, with an advance of 1.7 per cent.However, the US Treasury market found some support as stocks dipped, pushing the yield of the benchmark US 10-year Treasury yield down by 3 basis points, to 2.86 per cent, after rising above the 2.9 per cent mark on Tuesday following Fed chairman Jay Powell’s unexpectedly hawkish comments to Congress.“Our forecast that Treasury yields will rise further is one reason why we think that equities are not out of the woods,” Capital Economics said in a note on Wednesday. “The Fed tightening that has typically been accompanied by rising bond yields has tended to take a toll on the economy and the stock market in the US eventually.”
47;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2018-02-22T16:13:38Z;Nasdaq accuses Long Blockchain of misleading investors;Former drinks company added ‘blockchain’ to its name in December;Long Blockchain, the iced tea maker that last year changed its focus to blockchain, has been accused by Nasdaq of misleading investors.The New York exchanges operator sent a letter to Long Blockchain last week, indicating that it plans to use its “discretionary authority” to delist the company, according to a filing Long Blockchain made on Thursday with US securities regulators.Nasdaq staff “believed that the company made a series of public statements designed to mislead investors and to take advantage of general investor interest in bitcoin and blockchain technology, thereby raising concerns about the company’s suitability for exchange listing,” according to the filing.Long Blockchain, which last December changed its name from Long Island Iced Tea Corp, said in the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it “strongly disagrees” with Nasdaq’s decision. It has filed an appeal with Nasdaq, meaning it will continue trading on the Nasdaq market.A Nasdaq spokesperson did not immediately return a Financial Times request for comment.In October 2017, before Long Island Iced Tea changed its name and business strategy, it said it received a warning from Nasdaq that since its market value was below $35m for 30 straight working days, it was at risk of being delisted. Nasdaq had given it until April 2018 to remedy the situation.Its market value did not retake the $35m mark until December, when its decision to convert to Long Blockchain sent its market value shooting in the course of a single day from $22.3m to $63.2m, according to FactSet data. Since that time, it has fallen back to just under $30m.Long Blockchain’s first public foray into the sector came on January 5, when it issued a press release indicating it had reached a pact to acquire 1,000 bitcoin mining machines that were to be shipped to “a secure data centre in the Nordic region to immediately commence mining operations.”“We view this transaction as an important and validating initial step in the company’s progression into blockchain technology,” said Philip Thomas, who was then Long Blockchain’s chief executive. “The commencement of our mining operations places us on a path to generating blockchain-related revenue through the accumulation of bitcoin.”A week and a half later, Long Blockchain appeared to deepen its blockchain ties by saying it had signed a letter-of-intent to merge with the UK’s Stater Blockchain in what Mr Thomas described as a “potential milestone.”However, by February 2, Long Blockchain hit a stumbling block: it decided it would not buy the 1,000 bitcoin mining rigs after all. It said that after “thoughtful consideration and in consultation with outside technology advisers, the company will instead focus its efforts on seeking to enter into and ultimately consummate its previously announced proposed merger with Stater Blockchain.”Long Blockchain and Stater told the FT on Thursday that negotiations are still in progress.This week, the story took another twist. The group said Mr Thomas “terminated his employment agreement”. Shamyl Malik, who says he has held senior roles at Morgan Stanley and Citigroup, has taken the reins as CEO.Long Blockchain’s board has also approved a spin-off of Long Island Brand Beverages, its drinks subsidiary, to “allow the company to focus exclusively on its move into the blockchain technology industry.”Reach the author of this story on Twitter: @adamsamson.

Among the changes include the creation of a new 10th floor outdoor terrace above Nasdaq Tower, the curved video screen at Times Square which shows pictures of people and companies listing on the exchange.The exchange already has its main commercial and marketing presence, MarketSite, at Times Square, and it is the regular venue for business TV broadcasting.Redevelopment will begin this summer and is due to be completed in December 2021, although some employees will begin moving from next year.
49;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2018-01-31T13:19:20Z;Nasdaq revenues boosted by growth in non-trading businesses;;Nasdaq, the exchange operator, posted a net profit of $246m, or $1.45 per share, in the fourth quarter compared with a loss in the year ago period, with double digit revenue growth in some of its non-trading businesses.On an adjusted basis, stripping out one-time items, Nasdaq earned $1.05 a share ahead of Wall Street expectations for $1 a share.Net revenue in the quarter rose 6 per cent to $635m, versus the year ago period with the group’s non-trading related businesses, such as information services and selling market technology, growing at a faster rate than trading-related businesses.While best known as a tech-heavy bourse, Nasdaq over time has shifted into non-trading businesses. Chief Executive Adena Friedman, who took over last year, has stepped up the charge and is focusing the business further on data, technology and analytics businesses.Earlier this week, Nasdaq announced the sale of public relations and digital media businesses.As companies throughout the US make adjustments related to the tax reform package passed in late 2017, Nasdaq said it recorded a decrease in tax expense of $87m in the quarter related to the remeasurement of deferred tax liability at the lower US federal corporate income tax rate.
50;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2018-01-23T19:47:40Z;Nasdaq seeks boost from bitcoin products;Chief executive Adena Friedman exploring cryptocurrency offering for retail investors;Nasdaq is actively exploring bitcoin-linked products and other digital currencies that would appeal to retail investors, Adena Friedman, the exchange’s chief executive has said. The initiative comes as the financial establishment is looking for ways to play a part in the rise of cryptocurrencies, which gathered pace with bitcoin’s sharp appreciation last year, where trading volatility stands in sharp contrast to the placid markets for traditional assets.Nasdaq rivals Cboe Global Markets and CME Group already have rolled out their own bitcoin futures contracts.“We are looking to create a product geared to investors, not traders, as an investible asset,” Ms Friedman told the Financial Times, adding that what she is calling a “digital gold” model might be the most effective precedent to use when structuring retail-friendly products.She described digital gold as a store of value that would exist alongside other “real” currencies, rather than a fully fledged currency in its own right. Nasdaq wants its product to be a vehicle for long-term investment rather than trading or arbitraging against moves in bitcoin.Nasdaq has previously expressed interest in bitcoin futures. While it did not offer specifics, a total return future is a type of derivative that mimics a privately-negotiated swap, but is traded on a regulated exchange.Nasdaq is also likely to create a bitcoin index, which might pave the way for exchange traded products, further broadening the retail appeal for digital currencies. CME has a bitcoin reference rate and Intercontinental Exchange recently unveiled plans to create a consolidated price data feed for cryptocurrencies.Nasdaq officials stress that they have not yet taken any formal decision about when they might unveil this move, not least because US regulators have been opposed to bitcoin-linked ETFs. However, the exchange group has already quietly worked with partners to launch exchange traded notes linked to bitcoin and Ethereum on its Scandinavian exchanges, where regulators have permitted these innovations.And the discussions inside Nasdaq about potential retail bitcoin products have accelerated after the CME and Cboe Global Markets each launched futures contracts linked to bitcoin last year.Retail investors can already trade existing bitcoin futures through retail brokerages such as TD Ameritrade and ETrade and the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the regulator, show interest from retail investors, even though Cboe’s future, for example, requires an outlay of more than $10,000 based on the current bitcoin price.Until recently, Nasdaq was wary of jumping into the sector since its senior officials feared that the structure of the unregulated digital currency market left retail investors at a deep disadvantage. One problem is that when an investor buys or sells bitcoin at present, brokers usually only offer “indicative” price, rather than stop limits, meaning that brokers cannot guarantee the price at execution. The market is also prone to technical glitches, particularly when volumes are high, and transparency is low. “There are a lot of opportunities to improve the market structure as it exists today,” Ms Friedman said. “Other instruments [in finance] have matured into a mode which is offered to retail investors. There is room for this to happen in cryptocurrency. We will only launch a product if we can make it much better.”
51;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2018-01-18T01:10:21Z;Cboe approval shakes up stock market’s closing auction;Rival hopes to lure lucrative end-of-day business away from NYSE and Nasdaq;Regulators have given Cboe Global Markets approval to create an alternative to closing auctions for the US stock market, in a victory for the exchange that could shake up one of the most important moments in the trading day.The decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission, late on Wednesday, is a blow to the New York Stock Exchange, a unit of Intercontinental Exchange and Nasdaq, where nearly all companies list their shares and for whom the closing auction has guaranteed a certain amount of trading volume.While US equities trade on about a dozen exchanges and through a myriad of dark pools during the trading session, the official closing price is set through the auction on a company’s home exchange.The new regulatory approval allows Cboe to launch what it calls the “Cboe Market Close”, which will match trades using the closing price set on the home exchanges, potentially luring volume away from its rivals.Cboe argued industry participants were frustrated with closing auction trading fees, which it said have increased between 16 per cent at NYSE and 60 per cent at Nasdaq over the past five years.“It is a big win and a significant change in market structure,” said Larry Tabb, founder of the Tabb Group, a capital markets consultancy.“To the extent that 8-10 per cent of volumes is at the close, that is 8-10 per cent [Cboe] does not get, but now has access to,” Mr Tabb said. “It could be an impactful aspect of their trading revenues.”Cboe equity exchanges are second to NYSE in terms of volumes traded, but can boast only one corporate listing: Cboe’s own shares.With the growth of index investing and exchange traded funds, the closing auction has become an even more critical part of the overall system, since ETFs need to create or redeem shares by the close of trading.Volume executed in the auctions rose more than 70 per cent between 2012 and 2016 — meaning a growing portion of trading is increasingly expensive.“Cboe Market Close was created in response to widespread industry frustration with existing closing auctions,” said Bryan Harkins, head of US equities and global FX at Cboe, in a statement.Given the increasing importance of the closing auction …and the apparent concerns that a competing facility could have unintended consequences, we respectfully advise great cautionThe SEC approved Cboe’s plan against opposition from NYSE and Nasdaq.A NYSE spokesperson declined to comment on whether the exchange would appeal the regulator’s decision. “The NYSE Closing Auction is consistently the largest daily liquidity event globally thanks to its unique mix of technology and human judgment that reliably delivers the best outcome for listed companies, investors and index providers,” they said.Nasdaq declined to comment.Large fund managers, such as T Rowe Price, and listed companies including FedEx also opposed the approval of Cboe Market Close. For their part, S&P Dow Jones Indices, the owner of the benchmark S&P 500 and other indices widely tracked by ETFs, urged caution.“In keeping with the overall ethos of passive investing, SPDJ applauds any measures that decrease costs, increase transparency and generally result in greater utility for investors,” said Alex Matturri, its chief executive, in a letter to the SEC.“However, given the increasing importance of the closing auction to those same investors, and the apparent concerns that a competing facility could have unintended consequences, we respectfully advise great caution in approaching any changes to this aspect of our market structure.”Supporters included Sifma, the US trade group for the securities industry, rival exchange IEX and market maker Virtu Financial..
52;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2017-12-04T07:23:52Z;Saudi Arabia signs major markets upgrade with Nasdaq;;Saudi Arabia has signed a deal with US group Nasdaq to upgrade the country’s financial markets infrastructure, another step towards its long-term goal of diversifying its economy.The country’s stock exchange, the Tadawul, on Monday said it would use technology from the US group as the backbone for share trading.Nasdaq, which supplies trading technology to dozens of markets around the world, will replace Tadawul’s current registry, depository, clearing and settlement systems, which are more than 16 years old.The upgrade will be completed by 2020. Last year crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman launched an ambitious “Vision 2030” programme, which set out plans that Saudi Arabia would no longer dependent on oil revenues.For many big western investors keen to see Saudi Arabia open up, the prize is to be able to start trading over-the-counter derivatives contracts in the kingdom, or derivatives market based on crude oil production.Eng. Khalid Abdullah Al-Hussan, chief executive of the Saudi Stock Exchange said deal was a “crucial step” and would “integrate securities trading in Saudi Arabia with global equity markets, and enhance post trade infrastructure and efficiency for local and foreign investors.”The exchange has already announced plans to reform its share settlement system, to bring it into line with international norms and make it easier for overseas institutions to invest.As part of the deal Nasdaq will rebuild the country’s central securities depository. The venue that settled trades is a registry and so does not have access to central bank money to settle trades.
53;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2017-10-12T16:20:24Z;Nasdaq’s future lies in tech, data and analytics, says chief;Market sets sights on adapting to 21st century economic developments;To many Nasdaq has a clear identity — the eye-catching, fast-paced equities exchange on business TV that hosts the pioneers of the US technology industry, such as Microsoft, Google and Apple.However, as even the company admits, this perception is a little dated. When equities profit margins were squeezed it long ago diversified into markets such as options and selling trading technology. But since the botched Facebook listing in 2012 it has seen all of the big tech  flotations of recent years — such as Alibaba, Twitter and Snap — go to its great rival the New York Stock Exchange.These high-profile deals also have been few and far between of late as the most recent crop of innovators has opted to stay private.“There’s a lot of misconception about the exchange business — they’re really tech businesses now. When I talk to portfolio managers the first thing they think is NYSE and Nasdaq and tech listings,” says Kyle Martin, an analyst at Westwood Holdings Group.As markets and exchanges change, Nasdaq too is evolving. Adena Friedman became chief executive in January, taking over from Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq’s longest-serving head and the architect of the modern business.Ms Friedman, who rose through the ranks from the mid-90s heydays, has her sights set on adapting to 21st century economic developments, such as passive investing, data management, artificial intelligence and even the so-called gig economy.“We are not doing an about-face or even a 90 degree turn,” she says. “These trends are going to dominate the future. Nasdaq is a global technology company focused on the capital markets.”After a company-wide review Ms Friedman has determined the future lies in technology, data and analytics, which collectively accounted for about 35 per cent of net sales in the first half of this year. That compares with 37 per cent for market services, the unit that contains its trading businesses in equities, options, derivatives, fixed income and energy markets. The rest is the listing business and corporate services.“It is a recognition and realisation of where we can really define ourselves and going after the growth opportunity in our space,” says Ms Friedman.Advancements such as cloud computing, machine intelligence, even emerging blockchain technology, make the moves possible now, she says.She has already taken some steps to a reorganisation. In July it bought Sybenetix, a UK software company that uses artificial intelligence to snuff out rogue traders, and in September announced the $705m purchase of eVestment, an analytics business for asset managers. Ms Friedman’s first moves as chief executive included taking a $578m charge related to its eSpeed business and closing its London futures venue.Analysts applaud Nasdaq’s plans to spend money on higher-growth emerging businesses, after spending heavily on trading businesses  that faced pricing squeezes and a dependency on market volatility. However, they caution that some fund managers still need to catch up.“Investors may struggle with understanding what exactly is Nasdaq,” says Alex Kramm, a senior research analyst at UBS, who has a buy recommendation on the stock, “a collection of lot of different businesses that seem to make sense together, but clearly there are a lot of different things in there.”Nasdaq plans to accentuate some parts of its business, such as capitalising on its brand to sell technology for matching buyers and sellers of financial assets — now used by 85 markets globally as well as 31 in-house ones at Nasdaq — beyond financial assets. “If you look at the elements of what is happening in the economy today, we are moving much more to electronic marketplaces — pretty much trading everything and that is going to continue,” says Michael Splinter, chair of Nasdaq’s board.The company is looking at the gig or “sharing economy”, which is expected to grow from $14bn in 2014 to $335bn in 2025, according to Brookings. Futures exchanges for advertising and loyalty points using adapted versions of Nasdaq’s matching engine are expected to launch in the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2018, respectively. It is also looking at possibilities for areas including reinsurance, container space and ticket sales.Crucially Nasdaq has also signalled it is willing to exit businesses and is exploring a potential sale for public relations and digital media assets. “Capital allocation is the most important and most challenging of a CEO’s jobs,” says Mr Martin of Westwood. “Not being involved in empire-building is always good.”The job now is to convince investors. “If successful, investors should be willing to pay a higher multiple for [Nasdaq] than the current mix of businesses she inherited as CEO. It’s still too early to draw conclusions but I believe the vision has merit,” says Stephen Rigo, an analyst at ClearBridge, which owns Nasdaq stock.One thing is clear. Even with the strategic “pivot”, as Nasdaq calls it, Ms Friedman is adamant in her commitment to listings and the core US exchange it is best known for. “The equity exchange is the cornerstone of who we are,” Ms Friedman says. “It is the foundation of Nasdaq.”
54;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2017-10-10T07:28:28Z;Nasdaq senior executive to retire;;Hans-Ole Jochumsen, one of Nasdaq’s most senior executives, is to retire at the end of the year.Mr Jochumsen, a well-known and influential figure in the European market infrastructure industry, was most recently vice chairman of Nasdaq but has also served as president of its global trading and market services business.His retirement was announced in an internal memo circulated late on Monday.The Dane was instrumental in many purchases under previous Nasdaq chief executive Bob Griefeld, including the $400m acquisition of equity venue Chi-X Canada and the $1.1bn deal for International Securities Exchange (ISE), the options exchange, in 2016. He also launched Nasdaq’s energy futures market.He was particularly well-known in Europe, where he was head of the Copenhagen Stock Exchange and merged it with its rival the Stockholm Exchange in 2005. He was also an active member of industry lobbying groups, especially the Federation of European Securities Exchanges and World Federation of Exchanges.“Hans-Ole has made considerable and lasting contributions that have deeply benefited both Nasdaq and the industry as a whole. Our Nasdaq Nordic business has grown exponentially under his leadership, and his dedication, drive and general love of the business is nothing short of inspirational,” said Adena Friedman, Nasdaq chief executive in the memo.
55;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2017-09-28T17:45:12Z;Nasdaq explores ‘alternatives’ for its PR and digital media units;Trading venue owner is refocusing on technology, data and analytics;Nasdaq is exploring “strategic alternatives” for its public relations and digital media services units, stepping up its efforts to reshape the company to focus on technology, data and analytics.The New York group, which owns trading venues in the US and Europe, may sell, restructure or seek a partner for the units, which generated about $195m of revenue in the 12 months to June 30, or about 8 per cent of Nasdaq total revenue.The move marks a further refinement to Nasdaq’s long-term strategy since chief executive Adena Friedman took over in January.Since the start of the year Nasdaq has intensified its push into data and analytics, buying eVestment, which sells analytics to asset managers for $705m, and Sybenetix, a London-based software company that uses artificial intelligence to snuff out rogue traders.In the same period it has taken a $578m charge on its underperforming US Treasuries trading venue and closed a struggling London trading venue.“As a technology company, our growth path requires a review of our core strengths matched with the evolving needs of our clients,” Ms Friedman said in a statement on Thursday.Nasdaq said it had not set a timetable to conclude the future of the public relations and digital media units, which provide outsourced media relations services to companies, such as publishing media releases as well as web hosting and webcasting of quarterly earnings calls and investor meetings.In 2015, an operational error at one of the businesses led to the premature release of disappointing results from Twitter, causing some confusion. Twitter’s share price also declined. and Nasdaq apologised.“We believe exploring strategic alternatives like what they’ve outlined today and refocusing capital and resources on the market technology, information services and certain other businesses better positions [Nasdaq to concentrate] on where the puck is going and the more valuable exchange opportunities of the future,” said Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill.The exchange said it would retain the corporate services units that provide tools to boards of companies and investor relations teams.Mid-morning in New York, shares of Nasdaq were up 0.9 per cent to $77.83. Year to date, shares are up 16 per cent.
56;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2017-09-25T19:17:52Z;Eminem royalties shares to be sold in IPO;Music start-up aims to list on Nasdaq offering stakes in top artists’ catalogues;Ever wanted to invest in the song catalogue of Eminem? The producers behind the rapper’s hit songs such as “Lose Yourself” are set to make this possible through a public listing of their copyrights, as companies look to cash in on optimism surrounding the music business. Jeff and Mark Bass, the Detroit producers who first signed Eminem, have agreed to sell up to 25 per cent of their holdings of Eminem’s song catalogue to a music start-up called Royalty Flow. Royalty Flow is looking to raise $11m to $50m via a Regulation A+ offering, a type of crowdsourced fundraising enabled by Obama-era legislation, according to a regulatory filing on Monday. If successful, the company then aims to list on the Nasdaq. Royalty Flow’s main asset is the future royalty income from these Eminem songs, but it says it plans to add catalogues from other big artists in the future. The Bass brothers made about $5.1m from their Eminem copyrights last year, according to Royalty Flow, on a catalogue including tracks from “The Slim Shady LP” and “The Marshall Mathers” albums. Royalty Flow was formed by Royalty Exchange, an online marketplace for music royalties. The company bills this as a way for average investors and music fans to buy into the budding recovery in music. They are asking for a minimum investment of $2,250 for 150 shares in Royalty Flow, from investors who believe the value of songs by Eminem, who commands 18m listeners a month on Spotify, will grow as streaming takes off. The listing “gives investors simple, direct access to royalty opportunities that previously were available only to industry insiders,” said Joel Martin, manager of the Bass brothers. The filing comes as another securitisation of music assets looms, with the expected public listing for Spotify, the leader in music streaming.While music sales are still a fraction of their CD-era peak, Goldman Sachs this month predicted that global revenues would jump to $41bn by 2030, from less than $16bn last year. Lofty expectations have fuelled a wave of dealmaking in music publishing. Carlin Music, which controls the rights to songs by Elvis and David Bowie, is in talks to be sold to Round Hill Music for $250m, according to Bloomberg, while Imagem, which controls rights to songs by artists like Pink Floyd, was sold in June for $600m. $5.1mMade by the Bass brothers from their Eminem copyrights last year, according to Royalty FlowThe value of music copyrights has also been climbing, with songwriter shares being valued at between seven and 12 times their royalty income, said one executive. However, some executives cautioned that experiments like this have historically borne little fruit for investors, because the music business is small compared to other royalty-generating copyrights, such as drug patents. “These things draw attention because it sounds cool. You can buy shares in Amazon or you can buy shares in Eminem,” said one music publishing executive, comparing the filing to the “David Bowie bonds” pitched by investment banker David Pullman in 1997.“The problem is the music business is a small industry . . . you don’t have hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions in the marketplace. I’ve seen these things come and go and there’s never a look back to see whether they worked out.”The Bass brothers have been at the heart of a debate about how to share the money made from new digital music platforms. Their company in 2012 won a key lawsuit against Universal Music Group over whether deals with companies like Apple were treated as a licence or a sale. As a result of the court ruling, FBT Productions, their production company, would receive about 50 per cent of revenues from digital downloads and streaming in perpetuity.

A pension fund, for example, may use the service for performance and other details in selecting hedge fund investments. Evestment includes as many as 2,800 individual data points on more than 74,000 investment vehicles, which it sells to investment managers, consulting firms and pension funds.“There are a lot of new strategies becoming available and a lot more need for data and analytics to make investment decisions,” Ms Friedman said.Citing research from Boston Consulting, the total size of investable assets is set to increase from $71tn in 2015 to $100tn by 2020, she said.Nasdaq will integrate eVestment with its existing mutual fund quotation business, which collects information from mutual funds, and plans to help eVestment expand. The logic of the transaction also comes in that eVestment operates by subscription, making it a source of recurring revenue for the group.“We’ve grown this business at a 13 per cent annual growth rate since 2013, and together, we expect to produce new and expanded opportunities for our clients by combining our proprietary capabilities with Nasdaq’s core information services offerings,” said Jim Minnick, chief executive and co-founder of eVestment.In the second quarter, market services, which include Nasdaq’s trading businesses, accounted for 37 per cent of its $602m net revenue. The remainder was 27 per cent from corporate services, such as listings, information services at 24 per cent, where eVestment will be housed, and market technology at 12 per cent.The other acquisition by Ms Friedman this year was the purchase in July of Sybenetix, a London-based software company that uses artificial intelligence to find rogue traders.Ms Friedman also said Nasdaq has been making internal investments in analytics and technology to expand those areas organically as well as through acquisitions.

59;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2017-08-17T04:04:18Z;Nasdaq Nordic market raises challenge to London’s Aim;Exchange for small growth companies to offer UK investors tax breaks;Nasdaq’s junior stock exchange has secured legal approval to offer UK investors tax breaks for investing in its Nordic markets, ramping up its challenge to London following the UK’s vote to leave the EU.Nasdaq First North, an exchange for small growth companies available across cities including Stockholm, Helsinki, Copenhagen and Reykjavik, is the first market outside the UK and Ireland to be granted “growth market status” by HM Revenue & Customs.The approval will allow UK-based investors to receive tax exemptions when they invest in UK companies listed on the exchange. The new status is a boost for Nasdaq First North as it tries to lure British companies and investors away from their local London market to the burgeoning Nordic equities market and, more broadly, attract international companies that want to list in Europe.The UK’s equivalent, the Alternative Investment Market, has held the status since 2014.Aim has long been established as Europe’s main venue for emerging and lighter-regulated stocks, outlasting competitors such as Germany’s Neuer Markt. This year it reached £100bn of capital raised since its launch in 1995.Adam Kostyál, senior vice-president and head of European listings at Nasdaq, said Nasdaq First North was pushing to position itself as a “strong alternative” to Aim.“This will be part of a game-changing process in terms of making this market more internationally recognised and accessible for investors,” he said.From an international point of view, looking at London, uncertainty is not an ideal factor when evaluating a possible IPOThe exchange, launched in 2006, said it had gained traction with international investors following the UK’s Brexit vote, pointing to a recent increase in the number of initial public offerings. In 2016 Nasdaq First North hosted 51 IPOs, compared with 39 on Aim, according to data from PwC. This compared with 46 IPOs in 2014, versus 81 for its London equivalent.“You have the uncertainty of what will the impact of a hard or a soft Brexit be and you have the uncertainty of the capital markets in terms of attracting flow,” Mr Kostyál said. “From an international point of view, looking at London, uncertainty is not an ideal factor when evaluating a possible IPO.”While still a nascent market — it is home to about 300 companies compared with roughly 960 Aim companies — Nasdaq First North has grown rapidly in recent years. Since the beginning of 2016 it has raised €1.1bn.Still, Aim dwarfs First North in terms of the number of secondary offerings it hosts and is more mature as a market. The average market capitalisation of its newly listed companies at IPO was $111m in the first half of 2017, according to data from Dealogic, compared with $63m in First North’s Stockholm market, its most popular.Aim has been working to strengthen its reputation after a number of scandals, such as the break-up of software insurer Quindell. The LSE has launched a consultation on the market with a view to improving due diligence requirements and corporate governance standards for its new companies. Last month it emerged that on average there are nearly 200 alleged rule breaches on the market each year.

While some open outcry remains in the options market, Box has won the first approval for this kind of exchange in years.“In the financial markets, isn’t it very cyclical?” said Tom Lehrkinder, a former trading pit clerk and senior analyst at Tabb Group, the capital markets consultancy. “We went from open-outcry, to everybody running to electronic and speed and now back to open-outcry, in this instance.”Box said the old-school trading style, which has become nearly obsolete in many financial markets, was better suited to large and complex deals than the liquidity generally available in electronic-only markets and would encourage participation in such trades.“We welcome this opportunity to bring additional competition to the options market, which we believe will spur further modernisation of open-outcry trading,” said Lisa Fall, president of Box Options.Established in 2002 and launched two years later, Box is jointly owned by TMX Group, which runs the Toronto Stock Exchange, and eight broker dealers. According to the Options Clearing Corp, Box had about a 2 per cent share of the 313m options contracts traded in July.Open outcry represents a third of the options trading volume at Nasdaq’s Philadelphia Exchange, while NYSE has floors for options trading in New York and San Francisco. The Chicago Board Options Exchange is a blend of open outcry and electronic orders. It has three other venues that are electronic only.

Tom Wittman, formerly head of equities and options, will now head up the new consolidated group. Mr Shay declined to comment.Mr Shay, formerly of high-speed trading group Virtu Financial, was brought in to boost Nasdaq’s fixed income, currencies and commodities business, which includes the rebranded Treasury trading platform eSpeed, now under the broader name of Fixed Income Solutions.Nasdaq bought eSpeed in 2013 from interdealer broker BGC Partners for an initial $750m, but took a $578m charge on it earlier this year, as its market share has dwindled to about 20 per cent, according to Nasdaq figures. Traders contest that its market share may be even lower, with no official verified numbers across venues available.Fixed income contributes just 1.5 per cent to Nasdaq’s revenues, with the whole of FICC — the business run by Mr Shay — contributing 3 per cent.“There is no magic bullet that is going to completely change the trajectory of that business . . . what John did was bring great client integration . . . he did a really good job,” said Ms Friedman, Nasdaq chief executive, told the Financial Times.The platform, which allows investors to trade short-term and long-term interest rate contracts, was introduced in 2013 as Nasdaq sought to diversify from its traditional business of cash equities, but it has struggled. Competition is set to increase with Howard Lutnick’s BGC Partners re-entering the market with a new offering.Ms Friedman said Nasdaq was folding all the trading businesses together under the leadership of Mr Wittman, a Nasdaq veteran who had previously headed up equities and options, to better align Nasdaq’s structure with that of many of its clients.“Our clients are looking holistically across asset classes,” Ms Friedman said. “To have one organisation and one infrastructure versus two makes more sense.”Net revenue from fixed income products rose to $9m in the second quarter from $8m a year ago while net revenues for fixed income and commodities trading and clearing as a whole were $19m, down $2m from the year-ago period.Nasdaq on Wednesday announced second quarter net revenues of $602m, an increase of 8 per cent. Earnings adjusted for items including amortisation of expenses, mergers, restructuring charges and early debt repayment were $1.02 a share versus 91 cents in the second quarter of 2016.Shares in Nasdaq closed at an all-time high on Wednesday, up 2.4 per cent to $74.45 in New York.

This triggers an alarm in the monitoring system and sends an alert to the fund’s compliance team.The takeover of Sybenetix comes amid a wave of interest in using technology, such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence and biometrics, to help the financial services industry meet a tsunami of regulation unleashed since the 2008 banking crisis.In Europe, the incoming Mifid II rules for investment services are set to force banks and fund managers to collect much more data on trading for regulators than is currently required, creating an opportunity for companies such as Sybenetix.Mr Chaban and Ms Jephson said in a statement: “Being part of Nasdaq will provide enormous growth opportunities for Sybenetix’s surveillance technologies and will also accelerate new product development for the buyside industry.”The group will sit in Nasdaq’s market technology business which contributed 12 per cent of the group’s net revenue in the first quarter and grew by 18 per cent, the highest growth rate of the company’s business lines.Its other divisions are: market services, which includes the trading business and accounted for 37 per cent of revenue in the quarter; corporate services including listings which was 27 per cent; and information services such as selling data which was 24 per cent.“We do see market technology as being a high grower for us over time,” Ms Friedman said. “Assuming I am right, it would become a bigger contributor.”Nasdaq, which is working with its partner Digital Reasoning, acquired its own “Smarts” product in 2010 and sells it to regulators and exchanges to help them monitor for misconduct such as insider trading or market manipulation. It plans to integrate Sybenetix’s algorithms into that business, to accelerate its expansion into the asset management industry."

But, according to traders, volumes remain subdued despite the rebranding. The competition is also set to increase with veteran Howard Lutnick’s BGC Partner launching a new offering.“John has been instrumental in driving product expansion to further strengthen the Nasdaq Fixed Income offering,” said Mr Wittman in his memo. “He also helped to increase operational efficiency to better facilitate how we develop and bring new products to market with more harmonization and control. I want to thank John for his hard work and wish him well on his future endeavors.”

Shares of video games maker Zynga shot up more than 3,000 per cent.The fault was traced to test information typically sent out by exchanges on a daily basis to data vendors, such as Bloomberg, long after the stock market has closed. Test data are sent so that the systems that carry the feeds can be monitored.This dummy information is typically discarded when checks are done, but late on Monday evening several providers used the standard $123.47 as live prices for a host of large US companies. The vendors included Bloomberg and wrong prices also emerged on Google Finance.“This is not a glitch,” Nasdaq, the second-biggest US exchange, said. “In the normal course of business Nasdaq sent out test data but unfortunately third-party vendors misinterpreted the data. This caused inaccurate displays of closing prices on some securities.”Bloomberg terminals listed either “market wide circuit breaker halt — level 2” or “volatility trading pause” on all the stocks affected.The data and news provider, whose terminals are ubiquitous in the world’s financial centres, declined to comment. Google said: “We can confirm that our third-party finance data partner was providing some inaccurate information, which they received from Nasdaq.”The Independence Day holiday on July 4 meant that the US market closed early, and Nasdaq moved the time it sent the test data. Since the US market was closed no trades occurred at the test prices, according to the exchange operator.Data from the New York Stock Exchange and Bats Global Markets were unaffected. Thomson Reuters said its data production systems “were working normally today”.Financial markets have become electronic and increasingly algorithmic in recent years, occasionally leading to mysterious “flash” crashes and rallies — most notably in 2010, when the US stock market suddenly plunged, and in 2014, when the US Treasury market went on a dramatic 15-minute round trip.US tech stocks have recently become extremely popular in structured products in Asia, although those tend to use official closing prices.Monday’s abrupt price moves happened long after regular US trading had ended for the day and the extreme moves also alerted local traders that something was amiss.“We’re more aware these days of the potential for glitches. If something falls by 10 per cent, you would probably worry more than if it’s 85 per cent,” said Mohammed Apabhai, head of Asia-Pacific trading strategy at Citigroup. “A fall of 10 per cent would signal that people are reassessing value, whereas an 85 per cent fall in New York looks like something else is up.”Exchanges have in recent years been hit by a number of electronic glitches.The New York Stock Exchange last year suffered a “technical issue” that affected almost 200 stocks for almost three hours, while Nasdaq suffered a breakdown in August 2013 that halted trading for more than three hours, with normal activity only resuming shortly before the market closed that day.Reporting by Jennifer Hughes, Hudson Lockett, Alice Woodhouse, Robin Wigglesworth, Philip Stafford and Nicole Bullock

Timeline of trading halts at stock exchanges——————–Nasdaq indicated that the glitch was related to “unlisted trading privileges”, a right granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission that allows exchanges to facilitate trading of stocks listed on other official US exchanges as well.In a statement the exchange said: “Nasdaq is investigating the improper use of test data distributed by the UTP [unlisted trading privileges] and consumed by third parties. As part of its normal process, the UTP distributed test data and certain third parties improperly propagated the data. Nasdaq is working with third-party vendors to resolve the matter.”Some affected share prices were not reset to $123.47.

66;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2017-07-04T12:17:38Z;Nasdaq: one size fits all;Glitches can be costly with clients free to take their business elsewhere;Single-price retailers usually sell items such as clothes pegs or colouring pencils for a dollar or a pound. For a short while on Monday it looked as if Nasdaq had applied the principle on which Woolworths was founded to multiple US stocks, each priced at $123.47. The glitch at a third-party distributor highlights the risks inherent in data-dependent businesses such as exchanges.The bug was fixed and blame apportioned swiftly. Nasdaq, which denied responsibility, said test data had been incorrectly swapped for closing prices. These are determined by an auction at the end of the trading day. They are crucial for analysis of share movements. Moreover, equity derivatives often use closing prices to determine the value of their ultimate payout. The closing auction tends to attract the day’s largest trading volumes.Trades triggered by incorrect data can cause steep losses. Merely sorting out who bears the cost of such data tweaks can incur legal fees. While Nasdaq’s price glitch was embarrassing, it was quickly spotted. Smaller mistakes that are hard to detect immediately are more dangerous as they can have a large cumulative effect.The price that providers can charge for data depends in part on how much clients trust its accuracy. The trade can be lucrative. Revenues from data at the Intercontinental Exchange increased elevenfold in the five years to 2016. Both ICE and London Stock Exchange relied on selling market information for about a third of their revenue in the past year.Market data are an intangible asset, which can make it hard for investors to value. Goodwill arising from data group takeovers show what the buyer thinks it is worth. ICE’s balance sheet carries $3.2bn of goodwill relating to its 2015 acquisition of Interactive Data Corp. The LSE’s has £638m from its purchases of indices businesses FTSE and Frank Russell.The incident reflects badly on Nasdaq, whoever was to blame. Exchanges are no longer quasi-monopolies.

A “technical issue” at the New York Stock Exchange affected almost 200 tickers shortly after the opening bell, prompting other exchanges to route trades away from the Big Board. Unable to definitively resolve the problem, NYSE upgraded its severity to “critical” and suspended trading in 199 stocks on the bourse.NYSE, July 9 2015
The New York Stock Exchange suspended trading in all $28tn worth of stocks listed on the bourse about two hours into the session, resuming only shortly before the closing bell.

A technical breakdown on Nasdaq halted trading in 2,500 stocks on the second-biggest US exchange for more than three hours, affecting companies including Apple, Google and Microsoft. The suspension was the longest period of time that trades on Nasdaq have been halted due to a technical outage in its history, according to people close to the situation at the time.NYSE, November 12 2012
The New York Stock Exchange suspended trading in 216 companies, including US Steel and Travelers, for most of the day, with the bourse blaming the outage on one of its order matching engines, which execute trades electronically.Tokyo Stock Exchange, August 7 2012
The TSE was forced to stop trading of derivatives for more than 90 minutes after a router in its Tdex+ trading platform broke. The suspension affected all trading of Topix futures, government bond futures and options, and earned an admonishment from the Japanese regulator, which ordered the exchange to improve its systems.Knight Capital, August 1 2012
Formerly one of the largest electronic market makers on the New York Stock Exchange, Knight Capital suffered heavy losses when a computer glitch inadvertently led to the purchase of billions of dollars of shares in 148 stocks. Unwinding the mistaken positions cost $461m. Knight was subsequently bought by its rival, Getco, after the latter participated in a $400m lifeline for the company.Nasdaq OMX, May 18 2012
Facebook’s initial public offering was hit by a glitch on Nasdaq OMX that halted trading in the social network operator’s shares for 20 minutes. Trading groups were disconnected from the exchange during the auction process, resulting in quotes being cancelled and confusion over whether orders were to buy or sell.

70;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2017-06-06T07:59:59Z;Taking a second look at the maker-taker model;New US administration may revisit controversial issue of rebates paid by exchanges;The winds of change that have blown into Washington DC may soon ruffle Wall Street.A new US administration promising reform of financial regulation and widespread staff moves at the Securities and Exchange Commission, including a fresh chairman in Jay Clayton, could signal a shift in one of the key practices underpinning trading: the issue of rebates, whereby equity exchanges and some other private venues pay brokers to provide prices on their platforms.“People who have always had problems with rebates are looking at this and saying we now may have an opportunity to address this,” says Eric Noll, the former chief executive of Convergex and a member of the Equity Market Structure Advisory Committee (EMSAC), a group of equity market participants and academics that advises the SEC. “There are a lot of people talking about it now.”What are rebates?They are offered by trading platforms, ostensibly to incentivise brokers to make markets in share prices at their venues and help facilitate buying and selling across the broader market.They can range between 20 and 32 cents per 100 shares, according to Larry Tabb, founder of Tabb Group.Rebates are part of a two-way system known as the “maker-taker” model. Exchanges charge brokers and market makers for accepting, or taking, bids and offers on their venues. The difference between the charges for those who take liquidity and the rebates for those who make it is revenue for the exchanges. (Some exchanges offer an inverted version of the model, paying rebates for brokers who “take” liquidity and charging those who “make” liquidity.)Could the system be changed?Critics argue that a system of paying for business creates a world rife with conflicts of interest. It creates an incentive to post orders to (or take them from) venues with the highest rebates (or lowest costs), but which ultimately may not be in the best interest for investors. If brokers post quotes to markets with the highest rebates, it can set up a system that advantages speed. “The problem is that the people who provide the most liquidity are the fastest and can better manage where they are in the order book,” says Mr Tabb. Others say that eliminating rebates could end up costing investors, as brokers would have to widen the difference or spread between quoting a buying and selling price for a share.“If I am a market maker and I don’t have any other incentive than my spread to put a public bid and offer out there, the only way I can get compensated for risk is my spread,” Mr Noll says. “I have to widen my market.”Can we do a test under controlled conditions?A subcommittee of EMSAC has proposed a framework for a pilot programme to reduce the cap for access fees, or the money that exchanges charge brokers to access quotes and monitor the market consequences. The SEC has not decided whether to move forward with the pilot.Although the pilot does not address rebates, lowering access fees would constrict the ability of exchanges to pay rebates.Could the exchanges not simply act unilaterally? Rebates are certainly a sore point for a number of key players in the US equity market. A few years ago, Jeffrey Sprecher, the head of Intercontinental Exchange which owns the New York Stock Exchange, raised the idea of eliminating maker taker, but action has been slower.IEX, which became an exchange about a year ago, has been a vocal critic of rebates and does not pay them. It has a market share of about 2 per cent.But there is some evidence that change already is under way. Last month Bats Global Markets, the second-largest US exchange, unveiled a flat-fee model rather than one paying rebates for one of its venues, in response to industry demand.And in a blueprint aimed at revitalising markets, Adena Friedman, Nasdaq’s chief executive, argued for “an intelligent rebate/fee structure”, but also cautioned against “policies that would eliminate or significantly reduce rebates in the context of less liquid stocks where incentivisation of market making is most impactful”.
71;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2017-05-29T04:03:00Z;Nasdaq and Shanghai exchange in talks over Kazakh bourse stake;Astana hopes US and Chinese investors will attract others to new financial hub;Nasdaq and the Shanghai Stock Exchange are in talks to acquire stakes in the Kazakhstan stock market to be launched this year, as its owners look to attract international investors to the Central Asian country. Under plans to be announced in the coming weeks, the US and Chinese exchanges will provide technology, data services and know-how to the Astana International Exchange, according to three people involved in the negotiations. The new Astana exchange, which is scheduled for launch this winter, is the centrepiece of the Kazakh capital’s bid to create a financial hub for the Central Asian region to attract international banks, traders and legal and financial services companies. Kazakhstan has pledged to list stakes in its largest state-owned companies on the exchange as a lure to foreign capital, and has agreed to allow the Astana International Finance Centre (AIFC) to be ruled by English law and foreign judges independent from the country’s judicial system. Talks with Nasdaq and the Shanghai bourse on equity stakes in the exchange have taken place in recent months and should bear fruit next month, according to the people. Under a separate but related deal, Nasdaq has signed an agreement to provide trading technology infrastructure to the new bourse. Both Nasdaq, the US exchange that is home to most of the world’s largest tech companies, and the Shanghai bourse, China’s largest, declined to comment on the equity talks. The Astana International Finance Centre will be ruled by English law with foreign judges independent from the country’s judicial systemThe AIFC hopes that by bringing the exchanges on board, they will help to encourage US and Chinese investors to use the new bourse, enhance its technological expertise and improve its credibility among investors. In addition to the two primary partners, the AIFC has agreed co-operation agreements with exchanges in Warsaw and Moscow, KospI in South Korea and Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul. Central Asia has no financial capital. Kazakhstan’s biggest exchange is located in Almaty, the country’s former capital, but its capitalisation lags well behind that of peers in eastern European and Asian countries. However, Astana might struggle to convince investors to base themselves in the city or to tempt the larger companies from the region that have traditionally looked to London or Moscow for their capital needs. “International partners and recognised trading platforms should help convince those that might be unsure,” said one of the people involved in the talks. “The [preparation] timeline is aggressive but we want to conduct the first transactions in the fourth quarter.” Additional reporting by Nan Ma in Shanghai
72;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2017-05-12T00:13:56Z;Goldman Sachs to revamp dark pool business;Shifting tech operations to Nasdaq aims to offset regulatory burdens;Goldman Sachs on Friday will begin a reboot of its dark pool business as part of a deal with Nasdaq that is meant to boost competitiveness and offset regulatory burdens.Goldman is replacing its existing Sigma X dark pool, which now ranks 10th in market share, with a new iteration called Sigma X squared, according to a memo to clients obtained by the FT.The move comes out of a partnership under which the bank is outsourcing the technological operations of its dark pool to Nasdaq, but will continue to own it and act as the broker dealer.The deal comes amid new regulations aimed at preventing technological malfunctions, which will require investment by dark pools that reach a certain size in the market.“Outsourcing it has to do with being able to run it more efficiently and having another layer of eyes on regulatory supervision issues,” said Larry Tabb, co-founder of Tabb Group, a capital markets consultancy.Dark pools are promoted as ways for asset managers to trade large blocks of shares without moving the market, but they are subject to less regulatory oversight and transparency. More than a third of daily US equity trading occurs off US exchanges with about 13 per cent of that on dark pools, according to Tabb.Regulators have clamped down on dark pools in recent years resulting in a number of fines, including for Goldman.The revamped Sigma X squared will seek to offer clients a choice on trading partners based on trading patterns versus the type of trading partner.“If they change the matching [of buy and sell orders] it could have an impact on market share — if they do it right,” Mr Tabb said.For example, he said, large asset managers wanting to trade blocks of shares may be flexible on price and more eager to trade with other asset managers, whereas a seller wanting to offload shares quickly may be more willing to trade with high-frequency traders.Goldman is the first client of a Nasdaq endeavour called Ocean that was created to manage the hardware and software of off-exchange trading venues. Ocean is one of several businesses on which Nasdaq has embarked to diversify from cash equities trading where margins have collapsed over the past decade.Ocean will be kept separate from all Nasdaq exchanges.The news was first reported by Bloomberg.
73;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2017-04-28T20:32:45Z;Nasdaq clocks longest monthly winning streak in nearly 4 years;;The Nasdaq Composite, which earlier this week breached the 6,000 level for the first time, clocked its sixth consecutive monthly gain on Friday — the longest winning streak since 2013.The Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.3 per cent over the month to finish at 6,047.61 and is up 7.7 per cent so far this year. That is its longest streak of monthly gains since a rally that began in November 2012 and ended in May the following year.The tech-heavy index has rallied this year as investors have sought companies with strong growth prospects amid concerns that President Donald Trump would be unable to deliver inflation through stimulus and tax reform measures. A strong advance in the Fangs — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google — has also helped lift the benchmark index.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 clocked a more modest 0.9 per cent advance over the month to 2,384.20 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 1.3 per cent over the same period.Oil had a rougher time this month, however, on concerns that rising US output could undercut production cuts from Opec and other non-members like Russia.Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, fell 2.1 per cent to $51.73 a barrel. That marked Brent’s fourth consecutive monthly loss — its longest losing streak since December 2015. West Texas Intermediate, its US counterpart, fell 2.5 per cent over the month to $49.33 a barrel — its second back-to-back fall since last year.
74;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2017-04-28T15:52:28Z;One hundred days of Donald Trump have left investors sanguine;Low interest rates and rising earnings have pushed down the fear gauge;If ever markets defied explanation, it is now. For the past 100 days, the world’s attention has turned to the presidency of Donald Trump. As events in Washington have generated such excitement and controversy, the tendency is to look to the president when searching for an explanation for a hectic few months on global markets.But the market narrative does not fit the political narrative. In the past week, US markets have passed two landmarks that seem incompatible with the political drama. First, the Nasdaq Composite index reached 6,000. This was an event many seasoned investors assumed they would not live to see. The tech-heavy Nasdaq peaked at 5,000 in early 2000, during the dotcom bubble. Historical precedents suggested that after such speculative excesses it can take more than a quarter-century to recover.Tech stocks have not only recovered, but are leading the market. All the Fang stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google — hit new records this week. Add Apple and Microsoft, and just six tech companies account for 29 per cent of the rise in the S&P 500 since Mr Trump was inaugurated.If this sounds like 1990s-style “irrational exuberance”, it should do. A Yale University survey found that a majority of investors believe simultaneously that the market is too expensive and that stocks will rise further. The psychology of “too expensive, but can sell to a greater fool before the crash” is a hallmark of dangerous speculative excess.And yet. Excitement about Mr Trump, which drove a huge “Trump trade” in the first weeks after the election, has dissipated. The companies that pay the highest tax rates, and thus stand to gain the most from tax cuts, have lagged behind companies with low tax rates. Once the first attempt at healthcare reform collapsed, investors largely gave up on imminent tax reform. This week’s underwhelming launch of the policy did not change their mind. There may be some hysteria in the markets, but it is not hysteria about Mr Trump.This brings us to the week’s other landmark. On Thursday, the Vix index — Wall Street’s “fear gauge” of how much investors pay to hedge against future volatility — dropped to its lowest level in three years. Apart from one day in 2014, the Vix is at its lowest since the financial crisis a decade ago — quite something when potential nuclear confrontations are in the headlines.Friends and foes alike can agree that it is not Mr Trump’s style to calm things down. While raising opportunities, his actions of the past 100 days should also raise perceived risk, and volatility. What is going on?The best explanation is that despite our tendency to attribute everything to Mr Trump, market behaviour is not his responsibility. US markets have climbed steadily since 2009. Nobody would attribute this primarily to former president Barack Obama. The prime drivers have been central banks who bought bonds, and kept interest rates low. This made stocks look more attractive.The US Federal Reserve is gently removing its easy monetary policy, but rates of less than 1 per cent still do little to inhibit growth. Meanwhile, central bankers in the eurozone and Japan are still stimulating. Money is fungible, and investors in those areas seek out the best rates they can find, which are in the US.One player is more powerful even than central banks: the bond market. The normal balancing mechanism of markets would see a pick-up in growth matched by a rise in bond yields, which would damp enthusiasm for riskier assets. After a rise from historic lows after the Brexit referendum, that has not happened. Yields have fallen. This could reflect technical factors, such as central bank buying, or higher demand for bonds from ageing populations. Or it could mean that the bond markets don’t buy the argument that growth is coming. For now the bond market still supports enthusiasm for stocks.Another easily forgotten factor is corporate earnings. In recent weeks companies have generally revealed healthy growth in earnings and revenues. This can be overstated, but it supports share prices. Low interest rates and rising earnings are lulling investors and pushing down the fear gauge.How does any of this explain the stampede for tech? While buying at these levels is a risky game, the dominance of Big Tech reflects a different, and less exuberant, calculation than the boom of the 1990s. When growth is scarce, investors will pay more for those companies that have it. Tech companies are growing, with numbers from the bellwether semiconductor groups suggesting more growth ahead. As a market narrows around a few stocks, it is a classic sign of lack of confidence.Those investors who think stocks are too expensive but will rise further are not betting they can find a “greater fool”. They are betting that rates will stay low, tech earnings will remain more robust than anyone else’s and that the geopolitical noise can be dismissed as just noise.This is a risky and uncomfortable position but it is sustainable for now. And in his first 100 days, Mr Trump has not upset the applecart. john.authers@ft.com

76;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2017-04-03T14:29:19Z;Nasdaq hits fresh all-time high before shedding gains;;After clocking its best quarter since 2013, the Nasdaq Composite began the new one by advancing as much 0.3 per cent to a fresh all-time high of 5,928.93 on Monday before trimming back those gains.Silicon Valley stocks have enjoyed a nice run that has seen the Nasdaq advance nearly 10 per cent so far this year. It comes as Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet, so-called Fang stocks rising on average nearly 17.1 per cent so far this year.However, by pixel time the benchmark index had given up its gains to trade flat at about 5,912.26. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were both down about 0.1 per cent to 2,360.69 and 20,648.24 respectively.The moves come as investors digested the latest data showed manufacturing growth cooled and as investors await a fresh batch of economic indicators including the jobs report.
77;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2017-02-07T18:00:29Z;SEC eyes charges over glitch that hit NYSE trading;Parent ICE says it will fight any action over hold-up it admits was ‘embarrassing’;US regulators are seeking to charge the New York Stock Exchange over a technology glitch that halted trading on the equity market for more than three hours in 2015, the Big Board’s owner has disclosed.Staff at the Securities and Exchange Commission have recommended filing civil charges against Intercontinental Exchange, NYSE’s parent, over how it responded to the software configuration issue that led to the trading interruption, the company’s annual report revealed on Tuesday.The outage on July 8, 2015, was a serious mis-step for ICE, which ventured into equities markets when it acquired NYSE Euronext for $13bn in 2013. The prolonged gap in activity accounted for $28tn worth of stocks.NYSE said on Tuesday that it disputed the proposed action, which it learnt in December via a Wells notice might be on the cards. A Wells notice allows parties to present their defences to the SEC before any charges are brought, and Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, told analysts that NYSE would do so.“We dispute the appropriateness of the potential charges that the SEC wants to bring and we have a lot of defences,” he said.“And as a result of that we’ve made our own written submission to the SEC, articulating our points that at the end of the day it was a technology outage, it was very unfortunate, it was embarrassing and a black eye, but we don't believe it violated any law.”It is unclear whether any action will be taken, because of changes at the SEC under President Donald Trump who wants to loosen regulation. A move to file a case would require approval from the five-member commission, which has three vacancies. Mr Trump has nominated Jay Clayton, a Wall Street lawyer, to become its next chairman.The SEC declined to comment. The halt in trading activity during the glitch grabbed attention because of NYSE’s name and the fact that it is one of the last exchanges with a floor, where humans rather than computers can execute deals. The floor served as a television backdrop as exchange executives scrambled to jump-start trading. NYSE-listed securities continued to trade at other exchanges during the session.  At the time the exchange said the suspension happened because of “communication issues” between its platform and customers after the release of new trading software. SEC enforcement lawyers have been investigating the outage since at least 2015, the annual report said, and agency staff notified NYSE in December of their plans via the Wells notice.The SEC also conducted an extensive review of rival Nasdaq after a 2013 outage of a data feed but the exchange was not fined.ICE disclosed the investigation as it reported fourth-quarter net profit of $352m, or $0.59 per share, down from $370m, or $0.66 per share, a year earlier. Adjusted for items, earnings per share rose 9 per cent to $0.71, beating estimates. ICE shares rose 2.6 per cent to $60 in New York. Cash equities made up 11 per cent of ICE’s $518m in trading and clearing revenue in the fourth quarter.
78;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2017-01-31T17:36:18Z;Nasdaq to overhaul its fixed-income trading business;Exchange to take $578m charge to end eSpeed brand and close London futures venue;"Nasdaq has unveiled a radical overhaul to its underperforming fixed-income trading business, taking a $578m charge to end its eSpeed brand name and close its London futures venue.The US exchanges operator said that the impairment charge was because of a decline in operating performance and “a strategic change in the direction of our fixed-income business”.It was announced by Adena Friedman, chief executive, in her first set of earnings since assuming the role a month ago.It marks a retrenchment for a market that Nasdaq pushed into four years ago as part of an attempt to diversify its earnings beyond its traditional base of listings and US equities trading.Nasdaq bought eSpeed from BGC Partners, the US interdealer broker, for an initial $750m to enter the market for most liquid US government securities, so-called “on the run” Treasuries. It also launched a futures trading platform in London.But both ventures have struggled to make headway. Espeed’s share of the US Treasuries market has eroded from about 36 per cent. Its main competitor, the UK’s Nex Group, estimates that it now has a share of nearly 80 per cent.NLX was launched in 2013 but failed to dent the dominant positions of Deutsche Börse and Intercontinental Exchange. NLX was also affected by delays to upgrades in its clearing operations, run by LCH. It will close on April 28.“We made a really good go of it but we just didn’t get the traction we needed,” Ms Friedman said.The exchange’s US and European fixed-income business will come under a single brand called Nasdaq Fixed Income, led by John Shay, the former Virtu Financial executive.Ms Friedman confirmed that it would focus on building “off-the-run” Treasuries products, older bonds and notes that are less liquid but are more profitable deals.It also said there would be charges of $23m related to intangible assets; $20m in merger and strategic initiatives costs; and $12m in accelerated expenses because of the retirement of Bob Greifeld, its long-serving chief executive who stepped aside at the beginning of the year. Shares in Nasdaq rose 1.8 per cent to $69.45 in morning trading in New York.In the final quarter to December 31, Nasdaq reported a 12 per cent increase in turnover, to $599m. Because of the impairment charge, it swung to a net loss of $224m from a profit of $148m a year ago.For the year to December 31, Nasdaq said that revenues, minus transaction-based expenses, had risen from $2.1bn to $2.3bn. Net income fell from $427m to $108m.As part of the reorganisation, Nasdaq will also focus on higher-margin market technology, which encompasses supplying trading technology to exchanges around the world, surveillance and emerging blockchain projects."
79;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2017-01-31T12:56:10Z;Nasdaq pulls back from rates trading, takes $578m charge in overhaul;;Nasdaq, the US exchanges operator, is closing its London-based interest rate futures trading venue and will take a $578m charge related to its fixed income business, as part of an overhaul by new chief executive Adena Friedman.The US group said on Tuesday that it would shut down NLX and would work “with customers to manage the wind down of open positions in an orderly manner”.The platform, which allows investors to trade short-and-long term interest contracts, was introduced in 2013 as Nasdaq sought to diversify from its traditional business of cash equities business.However it struggled to get headway against European incumbents Deutsche Borse and Intercontinental Exchange and was affected by delays to upgrades in its clearing operations, run by LCH.Nasdaq also said the $676m charges was made up of a non-cash charge of $578m due to the write-down of the eSpeed trade name, which it bought in 2013 from interdealer broker BGC Partners for an initial $750m.There were also $23m related to intangible assets, $20m in merger and strategic initiatives costs, $12m in accelerated expenses due to the retirement of Bob Griefeld, the company’s long-serving chief executive who stepped aside at the beginning of the year.In her first set of earnings since becoming chief executive, Ms Friedman said the decision was “to better align our business segments, management, resources and clients. While this had an impact on our quarterly results, we feel it puts us in a stronger position to execute on the market opportunities in front of us.”For the year to December 31, Nasdaq said revenues, minus transaction-based expenses, rose from $2.1bn to $2.3bn. Net income fell from $427m to $108m, hit by the non-cash charge.
80;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
81;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2016-12-06T04:30:47Z;Legal teams are paying their way;The impact of company lawyers is growing as they achieve measurable effects;"Chief executives and their general counsel have often struggled to put a value on what a legal team does for the business. When asked, their response is usually a laugh or a sigh, and comments such as “it’s difficult and imprecise” or “it’s downright impossible”.They can quantify budget cuts and money saved, but few have the numbers or the means to measure accurately a legal team’s contribution.At least, that used to be the case. Chief executives and general counsel of the most innovative teams who took part in this report had no trouble describing precisely where their legal departments contributed to the overall success of the business. Many also talked in depth about the data they are now collecting and analysing to measure that value.Pat Gelsinger, chief executive of VMware, the technology company, says: “While any legal department has to guarantee that risk is minimised, ours also creates value. There are metrics associated with everything they do.”It is not all about measuring costs. For example, the detailed metrics that the legal team collects on new customer contracts are used by the business to understand how well it is meeting the needs of its customers.Data showed VMware’s legal team how to simplify every step of the company’s contract drafting, negotiations and approval process. The team then replaced complex agreements with simpler language. They also reviewed and analysed terms that had been used in previous contracts and removed those where the company always made concessions, saving hours of costly and time-consuming legal negotiation.The time it takes to sign a new customer contract has halved, helping the business do deals more quickly and improving the customer experience.Drawing on the experience of her parents running their own business, and also on her time serving on active duty in the US Navy, VMware general counsel Dawn Smith tries to bring a business mindset to her role. “Unless we run ourselves as a business, are in charge of our own destiny, and can keep costs under control, then in five years someone will come and slash our budgets,” she says.A legal operations team that Ms Smith created five years ago started by improving how it allocated work, outsourcing, e-billing and its management of outside law firms. But over time, the focus has moved to developing a strategy on collecting details of workloads, outcomes, cycle times, responsiveness and other useful information from the various new technologies the company has implemented.Legal operations may not be the first place to look for eye-catching innovation, but it is arguably where the most important changes in the industry are happening. The proportion of North American companies with legal operations personnel — the staff assigned the task of managing the people, process and technology aspects of lawyers’ work — doubled to 48 per cent in 2015, according to a survey by the Association of Corporate Counsel. That figure is expected to jump again this year.Driving transformation in business and industryInnovative in-house legal teamsInnovation in unlocking and delivering valueNew products and techniquesGreat legal ideasManaging complexity and scaleSuch operational roles are likely to become even more important and influential as advances in technology affect almost every aspect of legal services.Aine Lyons, VMware’s head of legal operations, says that “although we all recognise that the nature of legal service delivery has fundamentally changed, we are still figuring out what the implications of these changes are and how to respond to them”.The legal team at publisher Hearst Corp­oration is currently training and coding a machine learning tool named Charlotte. Eventually, it will be able to create non-disclosure agreements with a few simple instructions and support the in-house team to take on complex litigation and M&A deals.These kinds of operational innovations will have far-reaching effects on the legal industry by enabling in-house departments to handle more complex work more efficiently instead of using law firms. They also free in-house lawyers to concentrate on more complex strategic work.For instance, Nasdaq’s legal and regulatory team has long invested in technology and process, and this year it tops a new ranking in the report, on driving transformation in business and industry more widely.Led by general counsel Edward Knight, Nasdaq’s legal and regulatory group not only supports the business, but is an architect of many of its successes.The team, which includes a market surveillance arm, provides consulting services to regulators and exchanges around the world.Recently, it worked with Nasdaq’s technology team to develop the proposal for its new dark pool hosting business, Ocean.Nasdaq signed Goldman Sachs as Ocean’s first client in October.Individual winner:

82;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2016-11-29T17:02:31Z;Nasdaq CEO sees regulation ‘refinement’ under Trump;;The chief executive of Nasdaq, the US exchanges operator, on Tuesday predicted that the incoming administration of Donald Trump would tweak rules governing the stock market and banks rather than change them completely.“You will see under the Trump regime a period of refinement of regulation, but not a wholesale replacement,” said Bob Greifeld, who will step down as CEO of Nasdaq in January and become its chairman, writes Nicole Bullock in New York.Referring to the main rules governing the trading in largest US equity market in the world, Mr Greifeld also said: “For the equity market to totally walk away from Regulation NMS would be a mistake.” Having been in place for more than a decade without major revisions, it can be reformed, he added, and he was optimistic that the new administration would move in that direction.Mr Trump and Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner who is running Mr Trump’s transition team for financial regulation, are advocates of lighter regulation than has been in place since the financial crisis.Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations, Mr Greifeld also said there are major parts of Dodd Frank that should “go under the scalpel, but others that people in the industry will think are suitable to keep.”In particular, he voiced “great trepidation” about the soundness and safety of fixed income markets since the financial crisis and expressed hope that banks will be able to use with their balance sheets again to hold bonds with less capital costs.He also said technology was a bigger risk to jobs than trade. He pointed to driverless cars and the impact they could have on the trucking industry, which accounts for 10m jobs.Mr Greifeld also was optimistic that Wall Street might might be poised for an image change. After the financial crisis, all the big banks were “thrown out of the temple,” he said. “That is something I hope will change under president-elect Trump.
83;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2016-11-24T01:22:26Z;Nasdaq seeks speed bump in attempt to prioritise retail orders;Group asks SEC for new order type that would benefit longer-term investors;Nasdaq is asking regulators to approve a new order type in the latest example of how the dynamics of speed are changing in the world’s largest equity market.In a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US exchanges operator proposed a so-called extended life priority order attribute, which would give priority to retail orders seen by the whole market when traders agree not to cancel them for at least one second.IEX, the protagonists of the Michael Lewis book Flash Boys, launched as an exchange earlier this year with a delay of 350 microseconds meant to level the playing field in what it believes is a market structure that favours high-speed traders over long-term investors.Nasdaq believes that promoting displayed orders with longer time horizons will enhance the market so that it works for a wider array of market participantsIts attempt was fiercely opposed by some rival exchanges, but now the industry is mobilising to compete with different iterations of speed bumps. It marks a departure for the US equities market, which has for the past decade been in an arms race to become ever faster.“Nasdaq believes that promoting displayed orders with longer time horizons will enhance the market so that it works for a wider array of market participants, and will benefit publicly traded companies by promoting long-term investment in corporate securities, whether listed on Nasdaq or other exchanges,” the exchange said in a letter.The Chicago Stock Exchange, the smallest of the designated US exchanges, wants to introduce a 350 microsecond delay, but unlike IEX, it is just on orders that would be able to execute on resting orders, or in market parlance “take liquidity”. Liquidity providing orders, or those that would not immediately trade with resting orders, or cancel messages for resting orders, would not face delays.Like IEX, CSE has faced both opposition and support.Nasdaq said the order type would benefit long-term investors who may not be monitoring minute changes in market prices. Typically the first “displayed” order at a price has priority over the next order. Over time as speed and fragmentation has increased in the market the time priority has led to competitive trading strategies that promote smaller orders and more cancellations of orders. As such, long-term investors may not be able to immediately access bids and offers that are farther down in the order book queue, but would fill their longer-standing orders.The proposal comes after consultation with market participants including investors, market makers, investment banks, retail broker dealers and its listed companies, Nasdaq said. It opted for incentives to reduce order adjustments and cancellations rather than, in a nod to IEX and CSE, impose “artificial latency mechanisms that may distort or have unintended consequences on market quality”.
84;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2016-11-18T05:30:19Z;True blue veteran becomes first woman to head Nasdaq;Adena Friedman hopes her new role will draw women into the industry;Adena Friedman bleeds Nasdaq blue, a former colleague said of the exchange’s newly named chief executive.Ms Friedman began her professional career as an intern at Nasdaq, whose logo is blue, more than two decades ago when the exchanges operator itself was a young upstart.“It was the company that listed Microsoft,” and, to the business school grad, “it sounded cool and up and coming.”Next month she will replace Bob Greifeld, her mentor and another person with Nasdaq in his veins. He wrote his business school thesis on the operator and steps down after 14 years to become chairman of Nasdaq’s board.Ms Friedman will take the helm of a company that is vastly different from the one she first knew. Over the past decade or so, as margins for trading have thinned, Nasdaq has evolved from a single equity exchange to a multi-faceted financial technology and services company. Only about a quarter of revenue now comes directly from trading.Ms Friedman still has her work cut out, though. Nasdaq is squaring off with a new competitor in IEX, the protagonist in the Michael Lewis book Flash Boys, which is shaking up the industry by slowing down orders to and from its venue to thwart high-speed traders. IEX has vowed to take on the NYSE-Nasdaq duopoly in listings next.Nasdaq, moreover, is resolutely staying solo in an industry that continues to consolidate. Most recently rival Bats Global Markets agreed to tie up with CBOE Holdings, while the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have agreed to combine. “You can get wrapped up in that megamerger mentality,” she said. “We have been acquisitive in the past . . . We will continue to evaluate that, but it is all about our customers and delivering the right return to shareholders. If you do that, everything else will fall into place.”Ms Friedman will be the first female head of a leading US exchange. “I am hoping [my role] draws women into the industry and makes them realise that it is possible,” she said.There was a professional dalliance outside Nasdaq. In 2011, she joined Carlyle, the private equity group, as chief financial officer, a decision she calls “gut-wrenching”. “I had a fantastic job in a great company but I had been at Nasdaq for 17 years,” she said. The switch put her on the other side of corporate listings — she was hired in the run-up to Carlyle’s initial public offering on Nasdaq. “It was incredibly appealing to help them through that,” she said.Carlyle also brought the chance to be in the same city as her husband and two sons. For a lot of her career, including now, Ms Friedman has kept an apartment in Manhattan but a home base in Washington.“Flat-out, the time I wasn’t working I was spending with the kids and my husband,” she said. That includes getting a black belt in Taekwondo, which she practices with her son and husband.I am hoping [my role as the first female head of a US exchange] draws women into the industry and makes them realise that it is possibleA few years in at Carlyle she got a call from Mr Greifeld to come back. The next year, she was named chief operating officer making her Mr Greifeld’s heir apparent.“It was a well thought out succession plan,” said Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill. “She has had several roles at Nasdaq — CFO, COO — that make her knowledgeable in different areas of the business.”Despite her familiarity with Nasdaq, Ms Friedman is determined never to become complacent.An example is blockchain, the ledger technology of bitcoin that has the potential to disrupt the capital markets. Nasdaq embraced it early on and is helping other companies integrate it as part of the market technology business.“It is a highly competitive space,” she said. “We need to make sure we are constantly staying ahead, thinking about what is coming.”
85;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2016-11-14T22:51:07Z;Adena Friedman to take the helm at Nasdaq;Appointment will see first female lead a big US exchange operator  ;Bob Greifeld is stepping down as the chief executive of Nasdaq, bringing to an end a 14-year tenure in which he had transformed the high-profile US exchange.He will be replaced by Adena Friedman, chief operating officer who had been seen as Mr Greifeld’s likely successor. Her appointment from January 1 means she will also become the first female chief executive of a major US exchange operator. Mr Greifeld, 59, will become chairman of Nasdaq’s board, replacing Borje Ekholm, who was recently named president and chief executive of Ericsson, but will remain on the board.“We will bring new technology and new ways to partner with our clients to make sure we continue to provide a critical service in the capital markets,” Ms Friedman told the Financial Times. “There is an amazing amount of activity in the technology space — new technology we can bring to bear in transforming the market. Machine intelligence, blockchain, the cloud are all major technological advancements we can and will leverage.”Under Mr Greifeld, Nasdaq has moved away from the TV-friendly but volatile world of US equities trading and listing of technology companies, where it made its name.“Bob had the vision to reimagine Nasdaq as a financial technology company and navigated the organisation through a period of tremendous innovation and diversification,” said Mr Ekholm.Its earnings are also derived from bond, exchange traded funds and options markets, as well as trading technology and corporate services. He bought OMX, the Swedish exchange, for $2.8bn in 2008 but was unsuccessful with two other high-profile public M&A bids — the London Stock Exchange in 2006 and its main rival the New York Stock Exchange in 2011. Mr Greifeld was well known within the exchange industry for running Nasdaq akin to a private equity company, focusing on cost-cutting and forcing performance targets on new projects. Shareholders also trusted his ability to meet promises on costs. Nasdaq’s share price had been ravaged by the collapse of the dotcom bubble but has risen from $6 a share to nearly $65. Under Mr Greifeld, the market capitalisation increased from $600m in 2003 to nearly $11bn.Together, we will continue our journey from one of the earliest fintech companies, to a global leaderMr Greifeld, from a blue-collar family in Queens, is also known to be a fiercely competitive athlete, plays golf, is a long-distance runner and took up Muy Thai boxing in his late 50s. He wrote his business school thesis on Nasdaq.Ms Friedman, 47, began her career as an intern with Nasdaq 20 years ago. She has long been seen by rivals and analysts as a contender for the top role, after rising to become chief financial officer in 2009.That expectation was strengthened after she returned in 2015 as president after three years as chief financial officer of Carlyle Group, the private equity company. She became chief operating officer last December.“Chairman is definitely not a full-time job,” Mr Greifeld told the FT of his next move. “I will fill out my dance card.”He added that he has “a great love of technology and how it is developing”, but that his interest in being “the hands-on CEO” of another company was probably not that high.“The next phase in my life will have more dimensions — both commercial and from a charitable point of view — and more kind of adventures than you can put on your bucket list. Those are all things I need to figure out.”Ms Friedman will also become the most high-profile female exchange executive. Only a handful of more than 60 stock exchange chiefs around the world are women. They include Nicky-Newton King of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, Deirdre Somers of the Irish Stock Exchange, Chitra Ramkrishna of National Stock Exchange of India and Bente Landsnes of the Oslo Bors.Mr Greifeld is the second senior US exchange executive to announce plans to step down in recent days, after Phupinder Gill of CME Group last Thursday.
86;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2016-11-01T05:41:39Z;Goldman taps Nasdaq to manage dark pool operations;Move comes amid new regulations and will save the bank money on upkeep over time;Goldman Sachs is to outsource the technological operations of its dark pool to Nasdaq in a move that will save the bank money on upkeep over time.Nasdaq will receive an undisclosed fee while Goldman will continue to own and act as the broker dealer for Sigma X, the 10th largest dark pool for US equities trading.“This partnership allows GS to capitalise on the expertise and experience of a scale provider of exchange technology used in 33 Nasdaq and many other marketplaces worldwide,” Goldman Sachs said.The deal comes amid new regulations aimed at preventing technological malfunctions, which will require investment by dark pools that reach a certain size in the market.Goldman will be the first client of a new Nasdaq endeavour called Ocean that was created to manage the hardware and software of off-exchange trading venues.Ocean is one of several businesses on which Nasdaq has embarked to diversify away from cash equities trading where margins have collapsed over the last decade.Ocean will be kept separate from all Nasdaq exchanges.The Goldman Sachs news was first reported by Bloomberg.
87;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2016-10-23T16:37:08Z;Nasdaq upgrade raises market data questions;Faster processing of trading information could affect sale of private feeds;Nasdaq is set to roll out a major upgrade to a controversial piece of US stock market infrastructure on Monday, in a move that is again raising questions about the speed and cost of trading data in the world’s largest equity market.The US exchanges operator has improved its Securities Information Processor (SIP), the system that governs the collection and distribution of market data, and used by many investors and regulators as their “view” of the market.For Nasdaq, the hope is that the new system will put behind it a high-profile glitch that crippled domestic share trading for three hours in 2013. But it has broader implications in a market where speed has become paramount.SIPs are operated by Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange and they create a central real-time consolidated record of every exchange’s best offered quotes and trades. Nasdaq’s SIP will process the information in less than 20 microseconds — or a millionth of a second — compared with the current level of around 500 microseconds.The time lag has allowed established exchanges to sell market participants private, more expensive data feeds that run fractions of a second quicker. Many critics have charged that enterprising parties can profit from the difference in speed between the two streams. The SIP also generates more than $100m in revenues, which is shared between the exchanges and Finra, the securities regulator.“If you believe in the premise of latency arbitrage, one of the reasons it exists is people take in information faster than the SIP,” said Eric Noll, chief executive at Convergex. “If you start to eliminate the ability of people to use latency arbitrage — you don’t eliminate it entirely because some people still have faster networks and connections — but if you see the data start to equalise you don’t have an informational advantage any more by using direct feeds.”Jeff Kimsey, head of global data products at Nasdaq, said: “Direct feeds provide choice, flexibility and additional value — including the exchanges’ whole order book. This information isn’t necessarily essential for investors that only need the best bid and offer and most recent trade from the industry standard SIP market data feed.”Bats Global Markets and Virtu, the market maker, in regulatory documents, have voiced concern that Nasdaq wants to increase the cost of receiving their SIP information, but Nasdaq denied it, saying such a move is a decision of the committee that runs the SIP.The Nasdaq changes only affect its own feed. NYSE is working on upgrades that would reduce the median time it takes for trades to be reported by* the SIP from 240 microseconds to 50 microseconds or lower.Questions have also been raised about how the change could affect IEX, the recently minted exchange that uses speed bumps of 350 microseconds in an effort to level the playing field among players using fast, direct feeds and the SIP.“IEX’s speed bumps and design will continue to protect investors from a multitude of latency disparities enabled by today’s exchanges,” said IEX president Ronan Ryan. “Nasdaq making the SIP faster does absolutely nothing to change that.”* An earlier version of this story incorrectly said the NYSE’s upgrades would cut the time it takes for trades to be reported to the SIP
88;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2016-10-09T05:43:10Z;Nasdaq plans China commodity futures trading in Singapore;Exchange joins rivals in wider push into Asia derivatives trading;Nasdaq is planning to give investors direct exposure to China’s freight, iron ore and crude oil markets, through offshore futures contracts traded in Singapore — joining other exchanges in a wider push into Asian derivatives trading.Hanne Johansson, Nasdaq’s global head of commodity sales, said the exchange believes new products can help satisfy demand for offshore access to Chinese markets, in much the same way as offshore renminbi trading in Hong Kong and London does.“We want to explore how we can actually bridge these two markets,” Mrs Johansson said, referring to mainland China and offshore derivatives trading venues.News of the initiative comes as a number of foreign exchanges, including Nasdaq, Intercontinental Exchange and Deutsche Börse, have moved to establish a physical presence in Singapore to extend their reach in Asia.Singapore is one of the world’s busiest ports and a hub for physical commodities trading. Commodities trading houses Louis Dreyfus, Klaveness and Cargill all have freight derivatives trading operations in the city-state.But Singapore has lagged behind on freight derivatives trading, even as Asia plays an increasingly prominent role in the shipping market, with China becoming the biggest importer of seaborne commodities such as iron ore. One reason for Singapore’s relatively limited role is that existing derivatives contracts rely on indices set by London’s Baltic Exchange — some of which are calculated late in the day for Asia.“If you ask how much trading is done in Singapore before London opens, it’s about 10% [of global trading in freight derivatives],” Mrs Johansson said.“It’s still a long way to go to get the trading activity [in freight derivatives] up in this region to mirror the physical trading activity — there’s still huge potential.”Now it’s just a plain old ‘premier listing venue’, if also a more honest oneThe Nasdaq executive welcomed SGX’s move to acquire the Baltic, a deal which is expected to complete in November. The acquisition will give the Baltic a stronger presence in Asia, with SGX creating futures based on Baltic indices.She said: “I would say [the Baltic deal] helps. We will both work to increase the liquidity.”Nasdaq received a licence from Singapore’s regulator in August allowing them to be present in Singapore to promote freight contracts listed in Oslo.Intercontinental Exchange launched a Singapore clearing house last November and Deutsche Börse is planning to open a derivatives arm in the city-state next year.Derivatives have been a growth area for SGX at a time when equities listings are in the doldrums.However, previous attempts by exchanges to launch new contracts for tapping in to the Asian commodities boom have struggled, as investors have preferred to stick with familiar products.
89;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2016-08-09T18:42:16Z;Nasdaq touches new intraday high;Equity gauge lifted by bets on US tech and telecom stocks but unable to sustain full gains;"The Nasdaq index finally hit a new intraday record after periodically flirting with a fresh high since 2015, as a renewed appetite for technology stocks has pushed the equity gauge sharply higher in recent months.The tech-heavy Nasdaq closed at a record last Friday but had proven unable to breach the intraday high of 5,231.9 points touched in July last year, just before the August 2015 stock market swoon sent US equity indices tumbling.The latest march in global equity markets overall helped lift the Nasdaq as much as 0.5 per cent on Tuesday to a fresh high of 5,238.5 points. It was unable to sustain all of the gains, and closed at 5,225.48 points, up 0.2 per cent on the day.The junior US equity index has been buoyed by bets on US tech and telecom stocks. Nasdaq’s computer sub-index has risen 7.6 per cent this year, and telecoms 13.4 per cent. The S&P technology index is up by 8.5 per cent as well this year. The rally has been helped by strong performances of stocks such as Amazon, Facebook and Hewlett-Packard, as well as a recovery in the shares of big energy companies.Better than expected US jobs data have eased some concerns over the economy but not engendered enough optimism for investors to fret that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates aggressively.The rally has been sedate, however, with the S&P heading towards its 22nd straight day of neither falling nor rising more than 1 per cent — the longest such streak since 2014, according to Bloomberg data.The Vix index — a gauge of investors’ expected volatility — also touched a one-year low of just 11 points on Tuesday. So far this month the gauge has averaged 12.18, down from an average of 19.42 last August and the lowest August average in at least 16 years.However, there continues to be simmering concern over a stock market squall. The gains of “cyclical” stocks — which benefit from healthier economic growth — has been notable in the northern hemisphere summer, but JPMorgan’s equity analysts this week cautioned that investors had grown too optimistic.“Sentiment has turned complacent again, in our view, and the key catalysts are behind us; therefore, we advise to fade this move and return to our core preference for defensives,” JPMorgan’s Mislav Matejka wrote in a note.While second-quarter results had once again been better than expected, propping up share market valuations, JPMorgan argued that this was largely driven by pessimistic estimates rather than a fundamental improvement.“We believe that these beats were more a function of the significantly reduced estimates into the reporting season, rather than the truly strong operating performance of the companies,” the note said."
90;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2016-07-27T14:54:22Z;Nasdaq explores moves to compete with speed bumps;;Nasdaq is weighing different options after the approval of IEX as formal stock exchange, including a potential speed bump style venue of its own, its chief executive said on Wednesday.IEX, the startup trading venue, employs a trading delay meant to combat what it believes are abusive high frequency trading styles. It won a bitter battle this year to become an exchange on equal footing with Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange and Bats Global Markets, which all opposed its application, reports Nicole Bullock in New York.The Securities and Exchange Commission in approving IEX’s bid to be an exchange also tinkered with trading rules, paving the way for other exchanges to roll out similar venues.“We are thinking about a number of different things, speed bumps being one of them,” Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive, told the FT. “To the extent that we see there is in some type of speed bump and other market structural changes we can utilise, then we would get on it.”IEX, now operating as a dark pool, is expected to begin its launch as an exchange in August.Mr Greifeld also said he expected a fall launch for a blockchain project in Nasdaq’s Estonia market that will involve proxy voting.On Wednesday, Nasdaq said its net profit fell in the second quarter, but revenues rose across its business lines as the US exchanges operator digested acquisitions.On a GAAP basis, net profit fell to $70m, or 42 cents a share, versus $133m, or 77 cents a share a year earlier as expenses rose nearly 30 per cent on costs related to mergers and acquisitions including Chi-X Canada and Boardvantage.But acquisitions helped to boost sales. Net revenues rose 8 per cent to $559m beating Wall Street expectations. Gains were led by the technology solutions business where revenue rose more than 20 per cent to $163m mostly due to the purchases of Marketwired and Boardvantage.Market services revenues, which is related to trading and account for 35 per cent of total revenue, rose about 3 per cent to $194m. Revenues for the cash equities business rose slightly, but Nasdaq said it lost share in the US and European market. Mr Greifeld said that it would likely tinker with fees as the year progressed to help regain share.
91;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2016-07-22T23:38:36Z;SEC eases path for listing of active ETFs;Bats Global Markets and NYSE given approval to adopt generic standards;Managers of exchange traded funds will have an easier time listing the actively managed variety after the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday approved petitions from two major US exchanges.Until now, the SEC has approved actively managed ETFs on a case-by-case basis which is often costly, lengthy and may have kept small sponsors, in particular, out of the market.Bats Global Markets and the New York Stock Exchange said they had received approval to adopt generic listing standards for actively managed ETFs, which have a benchmark index but also a manager making decision about the portfolio. Nasdaq was expected to submit an identical petition early next week, a spokesman for the exchange said.To qualify for the streamlined process, sponsors would need to structure their ETFs according to a template that would include elements such as limiting certain types of investments.“This is a pivotal moment for the ETF industry as the introduction of these standards will help issuers of all sizes bring innovative funds to the market in weeks instead of months, and with more certainty of approval,” said Chris Concannon, chief executive of Bats.“Small sponsors ofETFs that don’t have the resources to engage in a lengthy approval process now have some certainty,” Mr Concannon said. “They can issue products they would not otherwise be able to do.”The vast majority of ETFs — more than 98 per cent, according to the ICI — are passively managed, or they follow a specific benchmark very closely and seek to limit buying and selling.“The NYSE is committed to reducing complexity in US markets to benefit issuers, market participants and investors,” said Doug Yones, head of exchange traded products at NYSE.NYSE Arca now dominates the ETF space with more than 1,500 exchange-traded products listed, including 103 actively managed funds, but Bats has been aggressively seeking to boost its share. Last year, Bats began offering ETF listings at no cost to sponsors. It has won nearly 30 per cent of all new US ETF filings so far this year.
92;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2016-06-18T01:51:02Z;IEX trading venue wins battle to become an exchange;SEC gives approval after bitter battle which had divided the US equities industry;IEX, the upstart trading venue, has won its battle to become an exchange, ending a controversial fight that divided the US equities industry and marking a sea change in the way stocks will be traded.After IEX and its critics traded barbs for months over whether its unique model met with US rules, the Securities and Exchange Commission gave its approval late on Friday, putting IEX on an equal footing with the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Bats Global Markets. US regulators also opened the door for other exchanges with “speed bumps”, potentially ending a decade-long period of prioritising speed in stock trading.“Today’s actions promote competition and innovation, which our equity markets depend on to continue to deliver robust, efficient service to both retail and institutional investors,” said Mary Jo White, SEC chair. “A critical role of the commission’s regulatory framework is to facilitate the ability of market participants to craft appropriate market-based initiatives, consistent with our mission to protect investors, maintain market integrity, and promote capital formation.”IEX will be the 13th stock exchange in the US.It rose to fame as the centrepiece of Michael Lewis’s book Flash Boys. Led by Brad Katsuyama, it was portrayed as a crusader against a market system that was rigged to the benefit of high-speed traders over long-term investors. The lynchpin of its strategy is a 350-microsecond delay which the group believes will level the playing the field.The speed bump was at the heart of a bitter debate over whether IEX should qualify for exchange status, with critics such as rival exchanges and the market maker Citadel Securities arguing that intentional delays ran contrary to market rules and would muddy stock prices.IEX accounts for less than 2 per cent of daily volume in US equities, but being an exchange is expected to boost its market share since brokers now have to route to them if they show the best price at any given time.“We look forward to becoming a stock exchange, which will provide us the opportunity to have an even greater impact on the markets,” Mr Katsuyama said.Today’s actions promote competition and innovation, which our equity markets depend on to continue to deliver robust, efficient service to both retail and institutional investorsThe SEC decision late on Friday was met with cheers in IEX’s downtown Manhattan offices where colleagues had been drinking from a keg for hours awaiting the news.Authorities have been caught within a web of their own rules by IEX’s application. Its speed bump has jarred with rules that stipulate investors get the best prices immediately. This is further complicated by inefficiencies in the technology and geographic distances between the New York and Chicago exchanges.On Friday, the SEC also issued guidance stating that delays of less than one millisecond were at a de minimis level, but added that within two years it would conduct a study regarding the effects of intentional delays on the market including for asset prices.Both supporters and detractors of IEX have warned that the one millisecond interpretation would lead to a rash of copycat speed bump venues and an explosion of order types further complicating the already fragmented US market.“The trajectory of trying to make the market faster and more efficient has reached its course and this is a very significant change in the direction of not only US maket structure but market structure globally,” said Larry Tabb, founder of Tabb Group.IEX’s application was met with hundreds of comment letters. Supporters included the asset managers and pension funds.Among its critics, NYSE and Nasdaq had no immediate comment while Bats said it “appreciates the significant changes [IEX] made to their application to address industry concerns”.The company altered aspects of its order router earlier this year.Citadel said: “Today’s decision will test and potentially reverse the gains in fairness, efficiency and transparency that have been made to our markets over the last decade. We must be vigilant to identify unintended consequences, and firm in our commitment to equitable and consistent treatment for all investors.”
93;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2016-05-25T20:05:20Z;Nasdaq slams recommendations to restrict market jurisdiction;SEC advisory group did not include input from NYSE and Nasdaq;Nasdaq has slammed recommendations that would restrict the jurisdiction of stock markets for not including the input of the best-known US exchange operators.In a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Nasdaq said the guidance was “not the result of a fulsome debate among an appropriately diverse group of market participants in the capital markets”.The recommendations from the Equity Market Structure Advisory Committee include re-evaluating part of exchanges’ legal immunity and shifting some of their powers to a single regulator.The SEC has created the 17-person committee to advise it on matters related to equity market structure. It has representatives from market makers, asset managers, banks and Bats Global Markets, a US exchanges operator. However, it does not include issuers or the biggest corporate listing venues, Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange — an aspect that the two exchanges have criticised.Echoing the sentiment of its rival NYSE, Nasdaq argued that in spite of a mandate to focus on “trading venues” the recommendations are focused “narrowly on exchanges” and the plans they devise and operate.“Given the concerns that Nasdaq and other parties have raised about the composition of the committee, the commission must carefully consider the merits of the . . . recommendations and the competitive milieu that may have influenced them,” the letter dated on Tuesday said.Nasdaq added that any debate “will now have to be played out through public comment letters”, a situation that has marked the application of small share trading venue IEX to become an exchange. The fierce debate has pushed the SEC centre stage over its own rules.Nasdaq also criticised a pilot programme examining lower access fees — the charge from exchanges to market participants to access quotes — because it includes only the exchanges and not all trading venues. The committee has proposed a framework for a pilot programme to reduce the access fee cap — now 30 cents for every thousand shares — and monitor the impact.In turn, exchanges pay rebates to market participants that place bids or offers in what is commonly known as the maker taker model. The difference between the make and take fee is the revenue for the exchange.
94;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2016-05-19T22:28:51Z;Nasdaq raises the temperature in IEX battle;Warning that SEC could be open to lawsuits over start-up’s bid to become an exchange;Nasdaq has turned up the heat in the ongoing battle over IEX, arguing that the Securities and Exchange Commission could leave itself open to lawsuits if an application by the start-up trading venue to become an exchange is approved.At the heart of the issue are plans by IEX to introduce a trading delay of 350 microseconds on its market to prevent high-frequency traders from having what it argues is an advantage over other parties.This delay would jar with rules that stipulate investors should get the best prices immediately. Since IEX’s application, the SEC has proposed that any delay of less than a millisecond could qualify as immediate.In a letter to the SEC on Thursday, lawyers for Nasdaq said that “the proposed interpretation would be unlikely to survive judicial scrutiny”.The letter argued that the SEC did not have the authority to approve IEX’s application based on existing rules which Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, the law firm, claims prohibit intentional delays.John Ramsay, chief market policy officer at IEX, hit back. “The incumbent exchanges have lost the debate …and Nasdaq’s latest salvo is more sabre-rattling in an effort to stave off competition at all costs,” he said.IEX’s application has won support from academics and asset managers, while critics include Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange and Citadel, which separately runs hedge fund and market making businesses.While the millisecond proposal could pave the way to approve IEX’s application, it has been criticised by both supporters and detractors which fear it could lead to a rash of new “speed bump” venues, an explosion of order types and market abuse.Four years ago, Nasdaq withdrew a proposal for an exchange with a speed bump amid indications that regulators were unlikely to approve it.The SEC is due to make a decision on IEX by mid June. It is unclear if it will decide on the millisecond proposal at the same time.
95;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2016-04-15T01:49:09Z;Nasdaq opposes proposed change to stock trading rules;Move could allow upstart trading venue IEX to become fully fledged exchange;Nasdaq on Thursday formally opposed a proposed change to stock trading rules that could allow upstart trading venue IEX to become a fully fledged exchange.For investors seeking the best prices at any given time, the current understanding of market rules says quotes must be immediately available. IEX’s strategy is hinged on a 350-microsecond delay that it argues prevents high-speed traders from racing ahead of investors to profit from their trades before they make them.The Securities and Exchange Commission, which will decide whether to approve IEX’s bid to become an exchange on an equal footing with the likes of Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, has proposed that a threshold of one millisecond, or 1,000 microseconds, would not constitute a delay.But in a letter to the regulator Nasdaq argued against any artificial delay to quotes. “Any standard for measuring acceptable artificial delay will have inherent ambiguities that create confusion, at best, or manipulation, at worst,” Nasdaq said.IEX’s efforts to become an exchange have prompted a bitter debate in the industry. Supporters include asset managers, while existing exchanges, including Nasdaq, have opposed its application.Other market participants have voiced concern about the consequences of the SEC’s proposal that they say could include copycat venues imposing their own delays and complicating the market.Echoing comments this week from Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive, the letter also said that permitting artificial delays would “open the floodgates” for a new wave of order types, adding complexity to the system for trading US stocks.“If they approve one millisecond, we will play in that world, but that world will be incredibly complex,” Mr Greifeld said on Tuesday at a conference of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. He predicted the number of order types would balloon from 360 to 5,000.Technological advancement meant that a one-millisecond delay “is already somewhat outdated and destined to become further obsolete” in an industry that already measures speed in microseconds and nanoseconds, Nasdaq said.Furthermore, a one-millisecond delay would be costly to investors given that Nasdaq alone executes trades worth $3bn within one millisecond of receiving a displayed order, it said.Stephen Luparello, director of the SEC’s division of trading and markets, has said that one millisecond was consistent with delays that existed in equity trading caused by geographic distance.However, Nasdaq criticised the SEC’s proposal as lacking any empirical evidence supporting a one-millisecond standard versus any other time increment. Before a “radical policy shift” was made, Nasdaq called for a cost and benefits analysis to determine whether the proposed delay would harm the market.“If the commission cons*ders itself compelled to accept artificial delays — which Nasdaq strongly opposes — it should consider a small number of microseconds and not a millisecond,” the exchanges operator added.
96;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2016-03-10T17:49:02Z;Nasdaq shares fall after deal to buy options business ISE;The $1.1bn acquisition is the exchange’s largest in nearly a decade;Investors greeted Nasdaq’s deal to buy International Securities Exchange, the US options business of Deutsche Börse, with some scepticism on Thursday, sending Nasdaq’s shares down as much as 3.5 per cent.The acquisition for $1.1bn in cash and debt is the largest for the US exchanges operator in nearly a decade and will extend its leading share in the highly competitive US options market.It comes as Deutsche Börse is closing in on a merger with the London Stock Exchange Group, although Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange has signalled that it may make a bid to try to break up the deal. Chicago’s CME Group has also been linked with bids for its two European rivals.The deal gives Nasdaq about 40 per cent of the market for US equities options where more than a dozen exchanges fight for business. ISE operates three equity options markets with a combined market share of 15 per cent. Nasdaq said bringing the two options businesses together will mean more competitive pricing in the industry.“The main concern here is that this is the options market and, at the end of the day, it has been very competitive,” said Ashley Serrao, market structure analyst at Credit Suisse. “Other competitors are on the horizon who may be entering the space and are we going to trigger a price war.”Rivals are competing over a shrinking pie. Options volume in 2015 totalled 4.14bn contracts, a 2.9 per cent decrease from 2014, even as volatility returned to the stock market, according to Tabb Group.Mr Serrao said these concerns were somewhat mitigated by the potential to exceed cost savings projected in the deal, which Nasdaq targets to be at least $40m on an annualised basis by the time the deal closes in 18 months.At midday in New York, Nasdaq shares were down about 1.5 per cent.The purchase is Nasdaq’s biggest acquisition since it bought Nordic stock market operator OMX for $3.7bn in 2007.Nasdaq said that it did not expect the deal to have a significant effect on its leverage, dividend or share buyback programmes, but some analysts were unconvinced.The deal will raise Nasdaq’s leverage to 3.1 times gross debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation, but the company has put a priority on reducing that to 2.3x to 2.7x.Nasdaq “has a strong history of deleveraging and we expect it to reach its target within a year of transaction closure, but until then we do not expect any meaningful shares repurchases”, said Peter Lenardos, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, in a note.The exchanges operator suspended share buybacks in 2013 when its leverage rose after acquisitions, but resumed them the following year.As part of the deal Nasdaq will double its stake in The Options Clearing Corporation, the world’s largest equity derivatives clearing corporation, to 40 per cent. The deal excludes Deutsche Börse’s stake in Bats Global Markets, the exchanges operator, and Digital Asset Holdings, a US blockchain start-up.
97;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2016-03-09T23:58:54Z;D Börse sells ISE options unit to Nasdaq;Deal comes as German group closes in on merger with London Stock Exchange;Deutsche Börse has agreed to sell the International Securities Exchange, its US options business, to rival Nasdaq for $1.1bn, as global exchanges swap assets in an industry shake-up.The deal will extend Nasdaq’s leading share of the highly competitive US options market, in which more than a dozen exchanges fight for business. ISE operates three equity options markets with a combined market share of 15 per cent.The move comes as Deutsche Börse is closing in on a merger with the London Stock Exchange Group, although Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange has signalled that it may make a bid to try to break up the deal. Chicago’s CME Group has also been linked with bids for its two European rivals.The ISE sale will mean a loss for Deutsche Börse which paid $2.8bn in 2008. However, the German group has already taken impairment charges of more than €800m on its investments after a downturn in trading after the financial crisis.“We are pursuing the goal to become the number one or two player in every business in which we operate. This goal requires an active management of our business portfolio,” said Carsten Kengeter, chief executive of Deutsche Börse. “In areas where we are not able to meet this goal, we are evaluating other options.”Deutsche Börse said it expected to register a gain of hundreds of millions of euros with the deal.The transaction will give Nasdaq a market share of around 40 per cent in a battle with Bats Global Markets and the CBOE.“We are number one with respect to market share [in US equity options],” said Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive. “For us to extend that lead, that …is a great opportunity.”We are pursuing the goal to become the number one or two player in every business in which we operate …In areas where we are not able to meet this goal, we are evaluating other optionsMr Greifeld said Nasdaq had had its eye on the ISE for several years but that it became “actionable” in the past few months. The sale was not conditional on the LSE-Deutsche Börse deal going through, he said.Nasdaq will pay with a mix of debt and cash, but does not expect the deal to have a significant effect on its leverage, dividend or share buyback programmes.The deal will yield at least $40m of annualised cost savings within 18 months of closing in the second half of the year.The acquisition is Nasdaq’s largest in nearly a decade. It bought Nordic stock market operator OMX for $3.7bn in 2007.As part of the deal Nasdaq will double its stake in The Options Clearing Corporation, the world’s largest equity derivatives clearing corporation, to 40 per cent. The deal excludes Deutsche Börse’s stake in Bats Global Markets, the exchanges operator, and Digital Asset Holdings, a US blockchain start-up.Perella Weinberg advised Deutsche Borse on the deal.
98;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2016-03-07T19:29:25Z;US exchanges: the ‘speed bump’ battle;Trading venue IEX is seeking to become an exchange, prompting a debate over equity market fairness;War has broken out in the US stock market. On one side is the establishment, led by the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. On the other is IEX, an upstart trading venue with a tiny sliver of the business but outsized ambitions to disrupt the world’s largest equity market by becoming an exchange itself.In the middle is the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is weighing whether to grant IEX equal footing with NYSE, Nasdaq and other exchanges, with a decision due as soon as March 21. Beyond the question of whether to change the architecture of the US equity market, the SEC has found itself caught up in a fractious public debate over what would normally be a wonky process of little interest outside the industry.One reason for the public attention is that IEX has successfully framed its quest as a matter central to the fundamental “fairness” of the US markets.The SEC’s stated mission is “to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets”. But with its push to be an exchange, IEX is asking: whose interests does the system really protect?“The IEX application is a referendum on modern US markets,” says Sal Arnuk, principal at Themis Trading and a supporter of the company.Founded in 2012, IEX has enjoyed publicity that most start-ups could only dream of. Michael Lewis, one of the foremost chroniclers of finance and markets, made the New York company the centrepiece of his latest book, Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt. In it, Mr Lewis chronicles IEX’s efforts to upend what it perceived as an “unfair” equity market where high-frequency traders exploit inefficiencies in a highly fragmented market.That fragmentation was enshrined in 2007 when the SEC revamped the market, with a piece of legislation known as Regulation National Market System, or Reg NMS. With the new rules, the SEC sought to modernise the stock market by encouraging the creation of new electronic trading venues to increase competition and keep prices low.The result was an explosion of electronic trading venues, with dozens of new groups entering the business.When IEX began trading six years later, some investors’ faith in this new system had been rattled by the ‘flash crash’ and a sense that lightning-speed trading had distorted the market.IEX had a simple proposal: find a way to halt the industry’s arms race in which high-speed traders continually assess every step in a trade to shave off microseconds. That, it says, could be achieved by what it calls a “magic shoe box” — forcing the trading data to take a detour through 38 miles of coiled-up fibre optic cable to produce a 350-microsecond delay. The delay, equivalent to one one-thousandth of the time it takes to blink an eye, would ensure that all investors would be treated fairly, it says.IEX claims this set-up would also halt the lucrative business that middlemen — including exchanges such as Nasdaq and NYSE — have created from selling ultra-fast connections to high-frequency traders.“We have long thought that the market was overly complex — too many dark pools and too many exchanges, and too hard to express trading interest,” argues Andrew Brooks, head of US equity trading at T Rowe Price. “In some ways the market system has failed to fully protect the interests of long-term investors. IEX is about innovation and speed or thwarting speed — pushing back against a myopic view of speed. If you have a two to three-year [investment] horizon, which we do, it is not about speed. It is about price.”High-speed trading has grown in the past decade to account for about half of daily market volumes in the US, although down from its peak when IEX started. Consultants estimate that this cottage industry made billions from the market volatility of 2008-09.Mr Lewis added to the controversy over high-speed trading when he launched Flash Boys and announced that the markets were “rigged”.“The Book”, as it became known, set off a furious industry clash over whether it fairly portrayed the way US markets worked. Coincidence or not, US regulators began levying ever-rising fines on banks and market operators for falling foul of rules related to the way high-speed traders interacted with investors on their trading venues.Amid the controversy Mr Lewis’s book sales rose and IEX grew increasingly confident. It raised $75m in funds and crafted an application to become a fully regulated exchange. Its backers included powerful hedge funds like Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital and Dan Loeb’s Third Point, as well as venture capitalists and the casino mogul Steve Wynn.Approval would allow IEX to boost its market share, as brokers will be forced to send it trades when it offers the best price.The IEX application was lodged last September, unleashing a wave of debate. “Think of this as Reg NMS round 2. In particular how far does the SEC want to go in locking down market technology?” says James Angel, a professor at Georgetown University.The SEC has received hundreds of comment letters, with the overwhelming majority backing IEX. “A rebuke of the IEX application would be a step backwards for the public’s trust of the market,” said a typical comment.Dozens of retail investors support the application along with Mr Lewis, congressmen, many large institutional investors and academics. Critics include the exchanges such as NYSE and Nasdaq as well as Citadel, a hedge fund, market maker and high-frequency trader.Some market participants are aggrieved that IEX has been presented as the good guy in this fight. Some high-frequency traders privately accuse IEX of trying to game the market but are afraid to criticise it for fear of drawing attention. Exchange bosses are equally annoyed at their portrayal. “It [IEX] tries to intimidate anyone who criticises it as the ‘bad guy’”, says an executive who declined to be identified.Critics argue that IEX’s application runs counter to the SEC’s own rules. First, exchanges are required to send bid and offer information into the market as soon as is practically possible. Second, they say, IEX’s model would contradict an obscure part of Reg NMS known as Rule 611.That regulation is intended to ensure that the prices ordinary investors see on their trading screens are legitimate and represent the most competitive price. Deliberately introducing a delay on pricing of 700 microseconds would violate that.“If IEX is allowed to become an exchange, when you see its price, you won’t be sure if that is still the real price or if it has become stale,” says Jamil Nazarali head of execution services at Citadel. “Putting in a speed bump doesn’t do anything. The fastest party still gets the trade.”In a broadside last month, Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive of NYSE’s parent company Intercontinental Exchange, said IEX was effectively seeking monopoly status. “It is un-American and it’s not fair and not the way that our system should work,” he said.The rise of IEX also threatens another part of the incumbent exchanges’ business: sales of data and connections to their venues. Exchanges are entitled to a share of fees from a record of all US share trading, while investors also need to connect their computers to the platform. They accounted for 7 per cent of total revenues at Bats, the US’s third main stock exchange.IEX claims that while technology costs keep falling, fees levied by incumbent exchanges on brokers and market makers continue to rise. It says data and technology should be provided at a reasonable cost or none at all, “to institutionalise fairness for the greatest number of market participants”.Others say it is IEX’s business that is flawed — otherwise more people would use it. Bats, owned by a consortium of banks and traders, carved out a 10 per cent market share before it applied for an exchange licence. IEX’s detractors argue that sending trades through IEX has another motive: it is three times as expensive as other venues and it needs to justify a return for its big investors.It took Nasdaq, which set out in 1971 to disrupt the old system of floor trading, about five years to succeed with its exchange application. “It is generally a slow, painstaking process and many upstarts never make it through,” Mr Angel says. “When the SEC grants an exchange licence, they are putting their reputation on the line. They don’t want something at a new exchange to blow up and embarrass them.”Both sides have accused each other of employing aggressive tactics. “While accusing everyone of lobbying against them, it is IEX’s owners who are aggressively lobbying DC,” says one observer.Some say it is hardly a coincidence that the IEX application is being heard during an election year. Attacks on Wall Street have been a feature of Democratic party debates, and there have been proposals to tax high-frequency trading. IEX supporters say they are up against a system keen not only to protect the status quo but one that would have to admit its past mistakes, raising the stakes for the SEC.Politics may also play another part. There are two unfilled seats on the five-person panel, and its composition may be shaken up after the election.The SEC is scheduled to decide whether to approve IEX’s application within the next fortnight, though it has already extended the deadline once. IEX has been defiant about changes to its structure. “We want to be approved, obviously, but not with compromises that limit our ability to protect investors’ rights to the end,” says Brad Katsuyama, IEX’s chief executive.IEX has made one significant change to accommodate concerns raised during the consultation. It altered a piece of its technology so that all outgoing orders on the exchange will be sent over its speed bump, but argues that the structure still protects investors. It is unclear whether this will be enough to satisfy the US regulator.IEX is clearly hoping to capitalise on its momentum before the public interest begins to wane, putting the SEC on the spot.“I think it will be political suicide for them to oppose it but they need to save face,” says Spencer Mindlin, an analyst at Aite Group, a financial markets consultancy. “[The SEC] has gone through criticism of unintended consequences and now they are on the defensive. If they go against a market-based solution, that, politely, is going to be unsavoury.”Most share deals no longer take place on a trading floor or even a computer screen sitting in an exchange. The closest physical approximation to the floor is a rack of servers housed within high-security data centres, often miles away from corporate headquarters. In the US the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Bats Global Markets each operate out of different data centres all based in New Jersey.IEX says its mission is to level the playing field by slowing down high-speed traders that, it claims, gain an advantage by placing their own servers close to the exchanges. That way, some fast traders learn about deals before unwitting investors.To blunt that edge, IEX has developed its so-called “magic shoebox” — 38 miles of fibre-optic cable coiled into a small box, designed to iron out the inefficiencies in share trading created by both geography and physics.The system has a built-in delay of 350 microseconds — a thousand times faster than the blink of an eye — on trades arriving and leaving its venue. It estimates that timeframe is enough to harmonise the speed on trading information for customers that pay to be near the servers of its rivals. IEX also argues that competitors like NYSE and Nasdaq have practices that are tantamount to a speed bump by other means, a charge they reject.Critics argue that deliberately slowing the dissemination of information jeopardises the validity of prices in the market. It also runs contrary to rules that call for official quotes to be immediate, they say.The other flashpoint in IEX’s filing is its router, a software program that sends trades to other exchanges when it cannot fulfil an entire order in-house. Initially, IEX did not want its router to be subject to the speed bump but after feedback during the consultation period it has since changed its position.Any outgoing orders executed on its market will now use the speed bump, in the hope of hastening its approval as an exchange.
99;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2015-12-30T18:15:41Z;Nasdaq claims to break ground with blockchain-based share sale;Fight for bragging rights to ‘first’ transactions breaks out;Nasdaq claims to have broken new ground on use of blockchain with a share sale on Wednesday that used a system based on the technology.The blockchain is the shared database technology that initially gained notoriety as the platform for bitcoin and other crypto currencies. But many large financial groups are now seeking to use its technology to make payment systems and capital market transactions faster and cheaper.It works as an electronic ledger of digital events that uses cryptography to continuously verify “blocks” of records and then distribute them among parties to the transactions.The enthusiasm around blockchain on Wall Street has been so intense that Nasdaq’s announcement prompted a scuffle over who owns the bragging rights to the first share sale using blockchain.Nasdaq said Chain.com, a privately owned company that itself specialises in blockchain technology, had issued shares to a private investor using the US exchange’s new Linq system that is based on the digital ledger technology.The exchange group said the transaction had created a digital record of share ownership — “significantly reducing settlement time and eliminating the need for paper stock certificates”. It also allowed the issuer and investor to complete and execute share subscription documents online.Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq, said: “We believe this successful transaction marks a major advance in the global financial sector and represents a seminal moment in the application of blockchain technology.”But Symbiont, a start-up backed by trading veterans including Duncan Niederauer, the previous chief executive of the rival New York Stock Exchange, hit back, claiming it issued the first securities using blockchain technology in August.Symbiont issued its own shares using the bitcoin blockchain while a privately held company used Nasdaq’s proprietary blockchain network to sell shares to a private investor.Nasdaq said the blockchain technology could significantly speed up the clearing and settlement of equity trades from the existing standard of three days in the US and two days in Europe to as little as 10 minutes.Supporters of blockchain technology argue that near-instantaneous settlement of transactions can transform the financial system by automating the clunky back offices of banks. This could also free up billions of dollars that banks and others must hold as collateral to insure against things going wrong while a trade is being settled.However, despite a plethora of industry consortiums, no widely used financial product has yet been switched to blockchain technology.Mr Greifeld said: “Through this initial application of blockchain technology, we begin a process that could revolutionise the core of capital markets infrastructure systems. The implications for settlement and outdated administrative functions are profound.”The technology could cut banks’ infrastructure costs for cross-border payments, securities trading and regulatory compliance by $15bn-$20bn a year from 2022, according to a recent report by Spanish bank Santander, management consultancy Oliver Wyman and venture capital investor Anthemis.Other groups are also turning their attention to bitcoin and its technology. The NYSE this year launched the first exchange-calculated and distributed bitcoin index. In January, NYSE made a minority investment in Coinbase, a bitcoin wallet and platform.Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan banker who helped develop the idea behind credit default swaps, has joined a group of trading executives who have set up company called Digital Asset Holdings. It sells software using the underlying blockchain technology to improve the settlement time and cost of transactions for financial institutions and other market participants.**An earlier version of this story misstated the nature of Digital Asset Holdings.
100;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2015-12-16T20:45:18Z;Nasdaq’s Friedman to eye new growth paths;Newly appointed COO says position will allow her to look at exchanges operator in a ‘holistic way’;Adena Friedman has been named to the newly created position of chief operating officer at Nasdaq, in what is likely to rekindle speculation that she is the frontrunner to eventually succeed Bob Greifeld as chief executive of the exchanges operator.As COO, Ms Friedman, 46, will oversee the operations of the entire company.Her new responsibilities include identifying growth opportunities, making day-to-day business decisions and allocating the budget to the various business units.“Our biggest opportunities are to capitalise on each of the businesses we have and make sure we are bringing them together appropriately,” Ms Friedman told the FT in an interview on Wednesday.She said the COO position would allow her to look at Nasdaq in a “holistic way” to find the next avenues for growth.During Mr Greifeld’s tenure since 2003, Nasdaq has expanded from a single equity exchange to include 26 exchanges, three clearing houses, an arm that sells exchange technology to other operators and another that handles investor relations for listed companies. It has a market capitalisation of more than $9bn.Ms Friedman will add the COO role to her present position as president of the group’s corporate, information and technology solutions businesses, which account for more than half of revenue.However, from the outside the move is seen as grooming for the top job at the exchange.Mr Greifeld’s contract expires in 2017, but he has avoided questions about whether he plans to stay on as head.Of Ms Friedman’s appointment, he said: “This is a natural progression for Adena and Nasdaq, given the evolution of our organisation into a global financial technology leader.”Our biggest opportunities are to capitalise on each of the businesses we have and make sure we are bringing them together appropriatelyMr Greifeld added that the new role would enable Nasdaq to better align its businesses and promote collaboration.Ms Friedman would not be drawn on questions about her aspirations, saying only that she was focused on her new job.She began her career as an intern at Nasdaq in 1993 and rose to chief financial officer before leaving in 2011 for three years as CFO at Carlyle, the private equity company.Nasdaq rehired her in 2014 as part of a reshuffling of its senior ranks.Hans-Ole Jochumsen, made head of global trading and market services when Ms Friedman rejoined the company, reports to her in her new role.During her career at Nasdaq, Ms Friedman played an important role in the acquisition of OMX, the Nordic exchange, as well as PHLX, the US options exchange, and INET, the electronic trading platform. A key part of her job as president has been selling Nasdaq’s exchanges technology around the world.If she were to take over from Mr Greifeld she would be the first female CEO of a US exchange operator.
101;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2015-10-22T15:40:35Z;Nasdaq acquires SecondMarket;Exchange operator reports record third-quarter profits;Nasdaq has acquired SecondMarket as it expands its private tender offer services in an effort to get in early with Silicon Valley companies that are increasingly delaying their IPOs.SecondMarket is the most active private tender platform in the US, helping private companies run tender offers in which employees can sell shares.Tech listings have fallen this year to a six-year low, as many of the biggest tech start-ups elect to stay private longer rather than submit to the scrutiny of public markets. This poses a challenge for Nasdaq’s traditional base of tech listings — the number of Nasdaq IPOs declined to 35 in the most recent quarter, from 41 a year ago.The deal will help Nasdaq reach private tech companies earlier in their lives, and New York-based SecondMarket has seen more than $2.5bn in transactions pass through its platform since 2013. Nasdaq has also invested millions in a new “Entrepreneurial Centre” in downtown San Francisco that opened last month.The deal came as Nasdaq reported record third-quarter results driven by increased volatility in equity and derivatives markets, and by grabbing some market share from rival trading venues. Net revenues rose 6 per cent to $529m, while net income for the quarter rose to $138m.Excluding the impact of acquisitions and adverse foreign currency moves, the New York-based exchange reported organic growth of 9 per cent.The acquisition represents an aggressive attempt by Nasdaq to build up a little-developed area of market infrastructure. In the past decade the exchanges operator has diversified away from equities with technology services such as trading surveillance. However, its attempts to break into other established businesses, such as clearing, interest rate futures and US Treasuries trading, have been less successful.Nasdaq had previously launched its own tender offer service, Nasdaq Private Markets, as a joint venture with SharesPost, another private trading platform. However, this never really took off, according to market participants, and on Wednesday Nasdaq said it had bought out SharesPost’s stake.For private tech companies, a tender offer gives employees a chance to sell some of their shares, while the company controls the process and can either choose a buyer or buy back the shares itself.Tender offers have become increasingly popular, partly as a way to prevent employees from selling their shares under the table on less transparent platforms. Square, which filed to go public this month, disclosed that it conducted a tender offer last year in which some board members including Larry Summers sold down their holdings.Bill Siegel, chief executive of SecondMarket, says some private companies are now conducting tender offers twice a year, and he expects some might start them quarterly as soon as next year. Smaller companies are starting their tender offers earlier, he said. “The market is definitely growing,” he said.In a speech in London late on Wednesday, Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive, said the exchange would launch a test pilot in Estonia to use blockchain technology, which underpins bitcoin, as a clearing and settlement mechanism for private markets.“It’s a country that’s very forward looking,” said Mr Greifeld. The country, which has had to develop virtually all of its social infrastructure in the past 20 years, already uses a blockchain technology for networked digital assets and some banks use it to independently verify that their systems and networks have not been hacked.
102;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2015-10-16T17:50:04Z;UK technology company Mimecast spurns UK to list in US;Email security business chooses Nasdaq over London for float that could value it at about $1bn;Mimecast has become the latest UK technology company to spurn a listing on the London Stock Exchange, filing instead for an initial public offering on Nasdaq that could value it at about $1bn.The company, which provides secure email services for businesses, generated revenues of $116m last year, and is seeking to tap the increased sensitivity around cyberthreats.Founded in 2003 by South Africans Peter Bauer and Neil Murray, the company was mostly built in London, where it initially gained popularity among law firms.However, although the UK is still its biggest market by employees, Mimecast plans to list on Nasdaq, where it would trade alongside rival security software developers Proofpoint and Rapid7.That decision is a blow to the LSE, which launched a High Growth Segment in 2013 to attract technology companies. Only one company, Matomy Media, has taken advantage of the listing rules and its shares have fallen 54 per cent this year. Just Eat, the online takeaway service, initially listed on the High Growth Segment, but moved to the main market.Mr Bauer, Mimecast’s chief executive, relocated to Massachusetts in 2011, saying that the US was a “massive growth opportunity”.In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, the company revealed that its revenues rose 31 per cent to $116m in the year to March.No valuation range for the IPO has been announced. Proofpoint and Rapid7 trade at 10-12 times their trailing revenues but Mimecast would likely seek to float at a lower multiple.The company reported a net loss of $2.2m in the quarter ending June 2015, compared with a net profit of $300,000 in the previous 12 months.A $62m funding round in 2012 valued Mimecast at more than $300m. The company has raised a total of $90m from venture capital funds Dawn Capital, Index Ventures and Insight Venture Partners.Goldman Sachs is the lead bookrunner on the flotation.UK technology companies to have listed in the US include King Digital, maker of the computer game Candy Crush Saga.
103;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2015-09-30T11:44:22Z;Incentives in futures markets attract scrutiny;Calls for greater transparency over volume discounts, rebates and payments offered by exchanges;If the energy market was a vast sea, Nasdaq’s new futures exchange would be a puddle: it handles one in 500 US oil futures transactions.Nasdaq wants to improve its status. It is doing so partly through a fee holiday and, for a select group of 20 market-making companies, monthly payments for volume.Such incentives may be the only way to wrest business from established exchanges that enjoy powerful network effects.But incentives in futures markets such as volume discounts, rebates and payments are now attracting scrutiny. Sharon Bowen, a commissioner at the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, recently said exchanges should reveal more about them.Among her concerns: incentives could induce a firm to trade with itself just to rack up exchange payments. The CFTC “should set more concrete restrictions on market maker programmes”, she says in the text of a recent speech in New York.The stakes of the debate are huge. A total of 21.87bn futures and options contracts were traded worldwide in 2014, according to FIA, the industry body — more than double the volume of 10 years before. At exchange operator CME Group, $1,100tn worth of derivatives changed hands last year.“We understand the CFTC will be issuing a new rule designed to further improve transparency, and we look forward to reviewing it and responding,” CME says.Exchanges commonly offer incentives to bring liquidity into a fledgling contract. CME offers them to customers ranging from electronic trading firms to central banks, in products from innovative interest rate “ swap futures” to grain.The existence of incentive programmes highlights the interdependency of exchanges and traders.Exchanges need market makers to provide an attractive “spread” between prices at which they would buy or sell a commodity or financial index. For example, an Intercontinental Exchange programme in US oil futures obliges applicants to show the bid-ask spread they would maintain and commit to trading 20,000 contracts of the product.For market makers, the opportunity to collect incentives comes with a cost. Prices can move violently against them in thin, erratic markets.“Market making is a risky and complex activity that requires significant time, resources and skilled human capital,” says Jim Overdahl, partner at lobbyists Delta Strategy Group and an adviser to the FIA PTG, an industry group of proprietary traders. “Exchange incentive programmes aren’t perks — they are one of a variety of tools that exchanges use to encourage the activity required to build and sustain healthy, successful markets.”Not all activity has been healthy. To capture rebates from ICE, a manager at Chicago-based Gelber Group directed his stock index traders to “trade opposite each other until they reached the necessary volume”, then had an employee create a computer program that automatically matched the two traders’ orders, the CFTC said in 2013. Gelber was fined $750,000 over the so-called “wash sales” and other alleged abuses.“The main concern is that the programmes don’t lead to non-bona fide trading, where there are just people executing trading for the sole purpose of getting the incentive and not really assuming risk,” says Richard Shilts, who was director of CFTC’s Division of Market Oversight between 2004-13.Mr Shilts says commission staff discussed putting out rules or guidance on what might constitute an acceptable incentive programme. “That wasn’t done,” he adds.Participants in exchange incentive programmes are required to comply with exchange rules that prohibit wash sales and other violations. After the Gelber case, ICE imposed mandatory self-trade prevention functionality for proprietary traders.The use of incentives is not limited to new contracts such as the energy futures Nasdaq launched in July to challenge CME and ICE. ICE recently extended two dozen oil market maker and liquidity provider programmes that date as far back as 2006, an exchange notice shows.A proprietary trader says that participants who back nascent contracts will sometimes do so only if incentives are guaranteed for years, so they can reap the benefits if a contract succeeds.Ms Bowen of the CFTC called for more public transparency on exchange incentive programmes. She said exchanges should provide the public with “fairly granular” information including who is and is not eligible.Exchanges already file basic details of programmes to public databases, though they withhold juicier nuggets such as who participates and how well they are compensated.ICE says: “We currently file details for our market making programmes with the CFTC and will work with the commission as they consider any changes to that process.”

Law enforcement agencies have been increasingly co-operating with international counterparts to track down cyber criminals, as they did in the Drinkman case.The efforts to bring Mr Drinkman to justice took about six years, including a three-year extradition fight to bring him to the US from the Netherlands where he was arrested in 2012. He lost the extradition battle in February.He and four co-defendants are accused of hacking into the networks of the Nasdaq, 7-Eleven, JetBlue, Carrefour and other companies that receive and transmit financial data. Three of the co-defendants are from Russia while another is from Ukraine.Mr Drinkman, 34, allegedly specialised in hacking into networks and mining the systems to retrieve valuable data. Stolen US credit card numbers were then sold for $10, while European credit card numbers were sold for $50 each. The users of the stolen credit card data withdrew money from ATMs or made purchases with the information, adding up to hundreds of millions of dollars.He pleaded guilty in a New Jersey federal court to one count of conspiracy to commit unauthorised access of protected computers and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.Mr Drinkman’s attorney did not respond to a request for comment.This hacking ring’s widespread attacks on American companies caused serious harm and more than $300m in losses to people and businesses in the United States“This hacking ring’s widespread attacks on American companies caused serious harm and more than $300m in losses to people and businesses in the United States,” assistant attorney-general Leslie Caldwell said. “Our close co-operation with our international partners makes it more likely every day that we will find and bring to justice cyber criminals who attack America, wherever in the world they may be.”The hacking conspiracy began at least as early as August 2005, according to the indictment against Mr Drinkman and the others. Beginning in May 2007, the group allegedly hacked into Nasdaq to install malware on its network and to steal login credentials, although they are not charged with disrupting trading on the exchange.Mr Drinkman is scheduled to be sentenced in January. A second suspect who was arrested in the Netherlands, Dmitry Smilianets, is in US custody. The three other co-defendants remain at large.

106;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2015-08-24T09:27:36Z;Nasdaq: down but not out;Established stocks dominate the index but more questionable valuations are out there;"That was brief and unsatisfying. It took 15 years for the Nasdaq Composite to get back to 5,000, its level just before the 2000 peak. And four months to fall below it again; last week’s rout and Monday’s rollercoaster ride capped the worst performance for the technology-heavy index in four years.As the tech bubble got bigger, there has been a chorus of voices — mainly from Silicon Valley — explaining why this time is different. It is always easy to be sceptical of such claims. But the Nasdaq of 2015 is not the same as the Nasdaq of 2000.For a start, there are far more proven business models priced at far more attractive valuations than was the case 15 years ago. The top 10 of the Nasdaq-100 in 2000 contained one outright fraud in the form of WorldCom and now-faded telecoms companies such as Ericsson. Those which have endured include Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, Intel and Qualcomm. They have faced challenges in the interim; none looks likely to be incinerated now. In 1999, Microsoft’s forward price/earnings ratio was over 70 before it entered a decade-long decline; in the past few days it has fallen from 18 to 16.5, according to S&P Capital IQ. Hardly feverish. Fifteen years ago, the biggest of today’s companies not to feature was Apple; today, it dominates. Certainly, Apple will suffer from problems in China. The region has powered iPhone sales and should soon be the biggest contributor to revenues. But for all the hype that Apple attracts, it has more than matched it with stronger earnings. After the sell-off, the company’s valuation has fallen from a middling forward p/e of 15 in February to a miserly 11.This does not mean the tech sector as a whole can afford to be smug. For a rough gauge of faddishness, try typing into a search engine “can I buy stock in . . .” and see what people search as the final word. Two different engines come up with the same two results: Uber and Tesla. Uber is private, valued at $50bn, or more than 100 times trailing revenue. Tesla, the searchers will be happy to learn, is public and a minor Nasdaq constituent. Its forward p/e has fallen sharply, but only to 128. Both companies have brought to market a product that has changed the world — although in how large or long-lasting a way is still open for debate.Fearful Nasdaq investors can take heart that there is no Uber and only one Tesla in today’s index.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
107;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2015-07-15T15:22:58Z;European biotechs rush to list on Nasdaq;Easier access to capital in the US lures life science companies;"A $245m fundraising by the French maker of a treatment for peanut allergy has highlighted a rush by European companies to raise money on Nasdaq’s booming biotech market.More than 20 European life science companies have listed in New York over the past two years and several others are preparing to join them in a reflection of the easier access to capital in the US.Paris-based DBV Technologies raised $93m when it floated on Nasdaq last October and it followed up on Wednesday with a further $244.8m in one of the biggest public offerings so far by a European biotech company in the US.Adam Kostyl, head of European listings for Nasdaq OMX, said “seven or eight more” biotech companies from Europe were planning to list on the New York bourse this year.Other companies to have crossed the Atlantic include Adaptimmune of the UK and Galápagos of Belgium, which each raised around $200m in May.They have been attracted by strong US investor demand for risky drug development businesses compared with their European counterparts; the Nasdaq biotech index has more than doubled in value over the past two years.This surge in valuations has raised fears of a bubble but also accelerated the number of biotech companies taking advantage of the easy financing environment before conditions change.DBV’s experience shows how European companies are typically able to secure higher valuations and more capital in New York compared with their home markets.Before filing for a dual-listing on Nasdaq last year, shares in DBV were trading in Paris for around €25. They have since soared to €75 in tandem with the company’s American Depositary Shares, giving it a market capitalisation of €1.3bn.Eye-popping valuations spark caution among some investorsFull storyOthers, such as GW Pharmaceuticals, a UK-based developer of cannabis-based therapies, have seen similar spikes in value after pursuing a New York IPO, while keeping an existing domestic listing.Mr Kostyl said the US Jobs Act in 2012 had increased the attractiveness of Nasdaq to European companies with its loosening of rules governing capital raisings but the main factor was the greater depth of capital and specialist investor knowledge in the biotech sector.“The problem in Europe is not the day of the IPO, it is the lack of ongoing support in terms of liquidity, follow-on fundraising and analyst coverage,” he said.US appetite for biotech is part of the broader hunt for growth assets in an era of low interest rates but it also reflects how scientific breakthroughs are increasing the pace of innovation.This, in turn, has spurred a mergers and acquisitions boom as bigger pharmaceuticals groups compete for the most promising new drugs — many of which are emerging from smaller biotech companies. The latest example of this was Tuesday’s $7.2bn takeover of Receptos by Celgene.DBV’s fundraising provided further evidence of the scramble for assets; the company said the offering was 10 times oversubscribed.Investors were attracted by its potentially first-in-class treatment for peanut allergy, a condition which affects about 1.4 per cent of children in the US. Analysts have tipped the product for $1bn in annual sales if a phase III trial due to start this year is successful.Pierre-Henri Benhamou, DBV chief executive, said US financing had allowed the company to accelerate development but insisted the company would remain firmly rooted in France. “We are still a French company,” he said. “Having access to investors on both sides of the Atlantic suits us very well.”"
108;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2015-07-12T12:18:14Z;Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq: diversification’s dividend;The veteran boss has broadened the exchange operator and survived failures along the way;"Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive, may live in a world of bulls and bears, he told a class from New York University Stern School of Business at their recent graduation, but his passion is for turtles. He collects them.“They are steady, consistent creatures, with a hard shell. They’ve been around since the time of the dinosaurs. They know how to survive and thrive,” he said, nearly 30 years after his own graduation from the same school.It is an odd image for a man who is a runner and works in an industry where speed is king. Even as many others would think about winding down at 57, Mr Greifeld has taken up Muay Thai, a high-energy martial art, and talks enthusiastically about attacking rival exchanges and going into new markets.In other ways, during his 12-year stint at one of the world’s most high-profile exchanges, Mr Greifeld had to develop a hard shell and thick skin to see him through the tough times. And he keeps plodding along as the rival New York Stock Exchange, which suffered a technical glitch last Wednesday, turns over bosses: five during Mr Greifeld’s tenure at Nasdaq.Mr Greifeld says he was drawn to Nasdaq as a disrupter: a market that never had a trading floor and which went straight into the electronic age. But when he took the reins Nasdaq was the one being disrupted, in the ugly aftermath of the dotcom bust. IPOs had dried up and regulatory change opened the door for competition from alternative trading venues and “dark pools”, eroding margins.His solution was to diversify. Mr Greifeld is credited with transforming Nasdaq from a single equity exchange to a multi-faceted technology and services company.The expanded group now comprises 26 exchanges and three clearing houses. It also has an arm that offers services to listed companies and another that sells technology to fellow exchanges and broker dealers.Businesses other than trading represent nearly three quarters of revenue, which has risen from less than $600m in 2003 to an expected $2bn this year. “My job today is entirely different than it was 12 years ago,” Mr Greifeld says.Born in Queens, New York to what he calls a lower middle-class background, Mr Greifeld had “limited aspirations” until a weekend job opened his eyes to other possibilities. In 1981, fresh out of college, he was selling computers for Burroughs Corp, the precursor to Unisys. He took a job on Saturdays delivering packages for FedEx.Born Queens, NYEducation

Track and field, biking, Muay Thai, turtles“Saturday delivery, because what was I going to do, sit around on a Saturday? So I figured, let me make some money doing that,” he says.His deliveries took him to Greenwich and other affluent areas of Fairfield County, Connecticut. That was his first view of a seductively different world from the one in which he grew up, prompting him to think: “OK, what do you do to be successful like that?” His answer to that question was to go to business school, where he wrote a thesis on Nasdaq.Mr Greifeld speaks like he runs his company, stripped down and sparse. He still uses the same chair as when he became chief executive. The arm is worn down with the stuffing falling out of it. The one thing the industry is unanimous on is his ability as a cost cutter.“He is an extraordinarily good operator. Every promise that he has made to the public market about getting synergies he has outperformed,” says Glenn Hutchins, co-founder of Silver Lake, and a Nasdaq board member.Nasdaq stock is trading at about the $50 mark, up from $6 in 2004, its rise powered as much by tight control of costs as top line revenue growth.But running a US exchange with an office on Times Square has its drawbacks. Everyone knows the screw-ups. Was Facebook’s 2012 IPO the worst?“I should say yes so I don’t have to bring up all the low points,” he says.Investors could continue to put in buy or sell orders through the opening of trading for an IPO. On listing day for Facebook, a flood of cancellations of buy orders for shares overwhelmed Nasdaq’s system, delaying the opening and resulting in a $10m regulatory fine.“The Facebook problems didn’t come from incompetence, they came from arrogance in terms of how the software was designed,” he says. Nasdaq has since added a so-called gate to address the issue.The Facebook situation was followed the next year by a problem with the exchange’s data feed for prices that left the market shut for hours. This year, its shareholder services unit accidentally released disappointing earnings from Twitter early. Shares tanked.Of Twitter, Mr Greifeld says such snafus come with the technology and are an opportunity to learn: “We recognise that there will be an error rate with technology.”Bob Greifeld and Chris Concannon, now CEO at Bats Global Markets, started at Nasdaq the same week in 2003. The outlook was grim. Businessweek ran a cover story entitled, “The Crisis at Nasdaq” that also read, “New CEO Bob Greifeld has one tough job ahead.”“I vividly remember the Nasdaq of 2003 when Bob took over at the helm. The $8bn company that Bob built was quite the opposite of what the pundits had predicted,” says Mr Concannon, who spent six years at NasdaqAs a manager, he is exacting — routinely giving pop quizzes to make sure employees know their stuff.“We don’t quite call it that but yes a hallway visit is always an opportunity for a question,” he says.A key part of Nasdaq’s growth under Mr Greifeld has been acquisitions. During a time of consolidation among exchanges, he has not had luck hunting elephants. An attempted takeover of NYSE was thwarted by regulators. Critics say Nasdaq has little dry powder left, or leverage leeway, for a big deal. Mr Greifeld disagrees, pointing to politics as more of a deterrent.“Let’s say you have a set of 10 possible deals that should happen based on pure economics,” he says. “There’ll be one or two that could probably get through the political or the regulatory side.”The 2013 acquisition of eSpeed, a Treasury bond trading platform, has been a challenge, losing market share since Nasdaq bought it at what some say was a full price. Mr Greifeld says it is a matter of getting the technology up to snuff and rolling out new products.So, what are the disrupters now? “Certainly we say there’s going to be a big change in vertical monopolies. Monopolies don’t make it over time, they’re not natural orders of things and it’s our job to aid and abet the movement from a monopoly to a competitive situation, primarily obviously in the futures business,” he says.Nasdaq is launching a low-cost futures exchange challenging the dominance of CME and Intercontinental Exchange.Aiming to stay on technology’s cutting edge, the company is also experimenting with blockchain, the ledger that records transactions in bitcoin.Another thing ripe for change is the very concept of going public. The kind of hot tech companies that would have listed on Nasdaq in the 1990s, such as Uber, Pinterest and Spotify, have instead been able to raise billions of dollars privately at attractive valuations. Nasdaq also has a market for non-listed companies“Right now it’s a little binary; you’re private or you’re not, or you’re public and you’ve got to take everybody in whether you want to or not so I think you’ll see more gradients there in terms of companies choosing what level of public, private, what level of liquidity they want or need for their stock so that would be a big change that you’d see.”Mr Greifeld’s contract at Nasdaq is up in 2017 and he remains defensive about how long he will remain. What about his legacy, whether his job ends in two or 10 years? “After you’re out of the seat, then you can start thinking about it. Before it, we have enough things to keep us busy all day every day,” he says.Additional reporting by Philip Stafford in London"
109;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2015-07-08T19:25:24Z;NYSE resumes after glitch halts trading;Exchange blames ‘technical issue’ rather than cyber attack for rare suspension;The New York Stock Exchange managed to reopen shortly before its closing bell, more than three hours after an “internal technical issue” halted trading in all $28tn worth of stocks listed on the bourse on WednesdayNYSE — owned by Intercontinental Exchange — said there was no reason to suspect that a cyber attack lay behind the highly unusual disruption. Chief executive Tom Farley told CNBC “it’s not a good day”.The bourse, which has a 25 per cent share of the cash US equity market, suspended trading at 11.32am New York time, adding that all open orders would be cancelled. Trading resumed at 3.10pm, slightly after the exchange’s earlier target.The stock exchange said it had chosen to suspend trading because of the “internal technical issue”, and that the halt was not the result of a “cyber breach”, a danger that has concerned security experts in recent years.The exchange later attributed the fault to a “configuration issue” and said NYSE-listed securities had traded on other exchanges during the outage.White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters that President Barack Obama had been informed of the situation but there was “no indication that malicious actors were involved”.Mary Jo White, chair of the Securities Exchange Commission, echoed a Treasury spokesman in saying that the regulator was also “closely monitoring the situation”. The SEC has introduced rules to require exchanges to strengthen critical market systems by November this year.Technical glitches that paralyse entire markets are rare, but Nasdaq, one of NYSE’s main rivals, broke down for more than three hours in 2013, abruptly halting trading in 2,500 US companies including Apple, Google and Microsoft. That was one of the biggest stock market trading disruptions since Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and the September 11 attacks of 2001.$28tnValue of stocks listed on NYSE in September 2014Nasdaq attributed the 2013 halt to a disruption at a feed that disseminates all quotes and prices for stocks listed on its exchange, but it was not immediately clear what had caused Wednesday’s suspension at NYSE. The biggest US exchange also suffered a glitch in 2012 , but that only led to trading in 216 companies’ stocks being suspended for most of the trading day.The NYSE’s market share has tumbled as technology and regulation have allowed competitors into the market. From being the dominant venue for Dow Jones and S&P index components at the turn of the century, it now trades less than a quarter of all US share trading volume.US equity exchanges have proven increasingly prone to technical mishaps in recent years, ranging from the “flash crash” of 2010 to periodic outages, as the technology underpinning stock markets has grown more complex and fragmented.Nevertheless extended technical glitches on the NYSE are rare as it has humans on its floor working to help determine the price of shares. Those traders’ handheld devices take data from banks to the floor.The exchange added that its electronic trading venues, NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex/Arca Options, were unaffected.NYSE’s suspension is far from the first “technical issue” the industry has faced.Continue readingNasdaq and BATS, two other exchange operators, declared self-help against the New York Stock Exchange — a move to direct orders from the respective exchanges to bypass the NYSE to maintain the flow of trading. Nasdaq said its systems were operating normally and were trading all stocks.Frederic Ponzo, chief executive of GreySpark Partners, a financial markets consultancy, said it was still quite exceptional for the NYSE to halt trading in all of its securities.“The matching engines [where trades are executed] at NYSE are split by groups of securities. Normally they’d halt just one of them. The one thing they all have in common is the client gateway that connects all the customers to the market,” he said.In 2013 ICE took over NYSE Euronext in a $13bn deal, including debt, that included the New York Stock Exchange. US cash equities now make up 6 per cent of revenues for the Atlanta-based company, whose main business is in trading and clearing commodity and interest rate derivatives.Rich Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, said: “ICE is known for having top technology and emphasising it as much or more than any other exchange operator.”Mr Repetto said that stock prices had not gyrated after the outage because of the availability of other trading venues, including NYSE’s own Arca exchange.ICE shares had already been under pressure before the NYSE suspension, but were down 2.3 per cent shortly after trading resumed.
110;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2015-05-28T22:47:27Z;Nasdaq sued by Swedish competition watchdog;Competition authority seeks $3.7m in standout antitrust case;The Swedish Competition Authority is taking legal action against Nasdaq, the exchanges operator, alleging that its Stockholm Stock Exchange abused a dominant market position.The move is the first such case since European markets were opened to competition. A 2007 directive from the European Union allowed competition against national exchanges. In spite of this change, former monopolies, such as the Nasdaq Nordic marketplaces, still hold strong market positions.The Swedish authority wants Nasdaq to pay SEK 31m ($3.7m) in penalties and administrative fines.The authority claims that in 2010 Nasdaq OMX prevented Burgundy, a rival electronic trading platform, from using a data centre in Lunda, Stockholm, the home of the matching engine for Nasdaq OMX’s Nordic marketplaces along with the equipment of a large number of traders. Forcing Burgundy to use another data centre weakened its competitive position versus Nasdaq OMX, the Swedish authority said.“To the best of my knowledge, it is the first antitrust case brought against an exchange since [the EU directive], said Per Karlsson, chief legal officer for the Swedish Competition Authority. “It sets an important precedent.”Proximity between trading equipment and trading facilities is a crucial factor for the success of high-frequency trading. In 2012, Oslo Bors, the Norwegian stock exchange, bought Burgundy after the Swedish group had struggled to take meaningful market share.The case against Nasdaq also highlights a nascent market structure issue regarding whether exchanges have been treating data centres in the same protectionist fashion that they have treated access to their clearing houses.A complaint by Burgundy triggered the investigation by the Swedish watchdog.A Nasdaq spokesperson said: “We do not comment on the specifics of an ongoing legal process, but we have been fully engaged with the Swedish Competition Authority in its investigation and will continue to co-operate in this matter.”
111;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2015-05-26T16:15:30Z;Nasdaq to step up blockchain trials;Exchange operator hopes the bitcoin backbone will reshape market plumbing;"Nasdaq, the US exchanges operator, this year plans to increase the number of trials with the decentralised network that underpins bitcoin.The New York group expects to debut three or four trials of the ledger in trade processing in the next 12 months, in a move that Bob Greifeld, the group’s chief executive, hopes could radically reshape some of the US’s sometimes cumbersome and slow-moving market plumbing.This month Nasdaq announced it would test the blockchain ledger with its venue for trading shares in private companies, making it the first high-profile exchange to say it was exploring the use of the blockchain in financial markets.Mr Greifeld told the FT he wanted Nasdaq to be “a leader in the field”. He added the network could potentially revolutionise the time it took to finalise deals on US securities markets from a maximum of three days — known in the industry as “T+3”.As a public, distributed ledger, the blockchain acts as a central repository for details of all bitcoin trades, though it could also be used for other financial assets.Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency transactions are validated based on a mathematical formula running on the computers of volunteers, allowing assets to be transferred without using a centralised agency such as a bank or a clearing house.“I am a big believer in the ability of blockchain technology to effect fundamental change in the infrastructure of the financial services industry. Clearing houses are a wonderful invention, but if you have a public ledger that is trusted, you can evolve back to a bilateral (trading) world but proceed with instantaneous settlement. We currently settle at T+3. Why not settle in 5-10 minutes?”Shortening settlement times for trading could reduce the risk that counterparties would not be paid, while also cutting the amount of collateral, or insurance, used to back trades.As interest in bitcoin increases, US officials are looking into how to regulate, rather than shut down, the virtual currency

Further readingHowever, it could also mean investors may be required to pay for some trades far earlier than they have become accustomed to.For the Nasdaq Private Market, using blockchain means transforming the recording of transactions from paper certificates and spreadsheets to an audited record of the lineage of ownership of private securities.Nasdaq has had other forays with new ventures with mixed results. The exchange has struggled, for example, with a push into the US Treasuries market through the purchase of the eSpeed bond trading platform.Although Nasdaq is exploring its use in post-trade services, other groups are also turning their attention to bitcoin and its technology. Nasdaq’s rival, the New York Stock Exchange, this month said it would launch the first exchange-calculated and distributed bitcoin index. In January, NYSE made a minority investment in Coinbase, a bitcoin wallet and platform.Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan banker who helped develop the idea behind credit default swaps, has joined a group of trading executives setting up a venue that will convert buyers and sellers of financial assets into bitcoins, thus cutting settlement times."
112;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2015-05-11T17:43:36Z;Nasdaq adopts bitcoin backbone for stocks;Blockchain seen as way to streamline many types of transactions;Nasdaq is to start using the technology behind the virtual currency bitcoin to handle transactions on its market, making it what is thought to be the first major financial market to adopt the idea.The blockchain — the backbone on which bitcoin depends — has attracted wide interest in the financial world as a potentially revolutionary way to streamline many different types of transactions, though few alternative applications have yet been tried beyond bitcoin.As a public, distributed ledger, the blockchain currently acts as a central repository for details of all bitcoin trades, though it could also be used for other financial assets. Transactions are validated based on a mathematical formula running on the computers of volunteers, removing the need for banks, clearing houses or other intermediaries.“It brings a level of auditing that’s based on mathematics and not based on trusting a third party,” said David Johnston, chairman of Factom Foundation, a start-up trying to expand the use of the blockchain beyond bitcoin.Nasdaq said it was looking to use the blockchain across its markets. The first application, due later this year, will handle the issuance and transfer of stocks on its Nasdaq Private Market platform, which was set up to handle trades in private company stocks.The technology will “modernise, streamline and secure typically cumbersome administrative functions,” said Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive officer. Private companies in particular struggle with the requirements of keeping share registers manually, he added.In a sign of the growing interest in the blockchain’s potential to disrupt how financial markets operate, Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan executive who helped develop the idea behind credit default swaps, earlier this year joined Digital Asset Holdings, a start-up focused on the area. At the time, she described the task of reducing the costs and inefficiencies in financial transactions as “one of the great challenges of our time.”Besides ending the need for intermediaries like banks or clearing houses, the use of the blockchain could also make the completion of transactions almost instant, compared to the period of days most trades currently take to settle, Mr Johnston said.
113;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2015-05-04T17:34:06Z;Nasdaq: exchange place;Twitter snafu highlights the exchange’s new segments;"The mis-timed release of Twitter’s earnings last week cast light on Nasdaq’s challenge: equity trading is not like it used to be. Five years ago, Nasdaq’s market services comprised two-thirds of gross profits; today they are less than half.Nasdaq has been busy, then, tapping fresh sources of growth. A burst of acquisitions has expanded offerings in areas such as investor relations and new products, including smart beta indices. In fact, Nasdaq’s fastest-growing segment is the one that provides investor relations (which Twitter uses), as well as back-end technology services for roughly 80 exchanges around the world.The company makes money in four ways: market services, which includes things such as cash equity trading, derivative trading, fixed income, and broker services, contribute about half of Nasdaq’s pre-tax operating profit but growth has been elusive. Listing services, which competes with NYSE and other bourses for new listings, has seen revenues flat over the past three years and contributes just a tenth of operating profits. (Nasdaq lost the Twitter IPO to NYSE in 2013.) Information services, such as data products and index licensing, is Nasdaq’s highest-margin business: the area contributes 40 per cent of profits and is growing. And technology services, which provides back-end support for other exchange platforms as well as corporate services, is still small (6 per cent of profits) but growing very fast (profits rose more than 40 per cent in 2015).Diversification through acquisition is expensive, though, and Nasdaq has been trying to balance this with returning cash to shareholders. Net debt stands at $1.8bn, roughly two times operating income. The dividend was increased by two-thirds in the most recent earnings. Nasdaq’s business today is less risky than when the great majority of revenues were transaction-based. But growth may still be elusive.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
114;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2015-05-03T13:48:58Z;Nasdaq tempts energy traders with extended fee holiday;Exchange launches aggressive challenge to win share from rivals CME and ICE;Nasdaq is planning an extended fee holiday to tempt traders to its new energy market, mounting an aggressive challenge to the two reigning oil and gas futures exchanges.The upstart Nasdaq Futures exchange plans to launch 28 energy contracts at midyear as it diversifies beyond stock trading. Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, has argued energy markets are a “monopoly” dominated by CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange.“The exchange will assess no transaction fees for energy products to any market participant during the initial nine months,” Nasdaq disclosed in a regulatory filing. Options Clearing Corporation of Chicago, which will settle the trades, will also suspend clearing fees for nine months, the filing said.According to FIA, the futures industry association, 1.16bn energy futures and options contracts were traded worldwide last year. CME and ICE together generated about $1.2bn in energy revenue last year.Nasdaq’s efforts illustrate the difficulty of grabbing market share from established futures exchanges. Traders tend to flock to the deepest markets where they can enter and exit without moving prices. CME and ICE also require contracts executed on their exchanges to be processed at their own clearinghouses, inhibiting movement across venues.CME and ICE are locked in a battle already in the energy market, both listing identical contracts such as Brent crude, Henry Hub natural gas and gasoline.Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, said of Nasdaq’s venture: “It’s got an uphill battle. You have two strong incumbents in one of the few highly competitive product lines in futures.”A top CME executive told analysts last week he was “absolutely, acutely concerned” about the threat from Nasdaq. But Derek Sammann, CME’s global head of commodities and options, added that Nasdaq was moving into a sector “with two very robust, competitive, dynamic market participants already”. ICE declined to comment.Nasdaq will also pay a stipend to market makers committed to buy and sell energy futures above certain volumes, according to another filing. Exchanges commonly use incentives, such as volume-based rebates, to attract market participants.Energy futures tend to generate higher fees for exchanges than financial futures tracking interest rates and stock indices. The collapse of oil prices in the past year has also spurred airlines, energy companies and hedge funds to add positions. Open interest in ICE’s Brent listing last month topped 2m contracts.When Nasdaq announced its energy futures market in March, Mr Greifeld said he would halve costs for traders. More than a dozen brokers, proprietary trading firms and physical commodity traders including Goldman Sachs and Virtu Financial have signed on to support the exchange.“We certainly believe monopolies are against the natural order of competitive forces,” Mr Greifeld said in March.This article has been amended to correct the spelling of the surname of Derek Sammann.
115;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2015-05-01T16:47:50Z;Exchanges need to balance policing and profitability;The Sarao case highlights problems facing US organisations;Ordinarily, market abuse and manipulation cases take forever.More than five years after UK watchdogs dramatically raided Moore Capital, Deutsche Bank and a series of other London companies, most of the people who were charged following the insider dealing probe have yet to stand trial. Similarly, global investigations of the Libor scandal are still ticking on more than six years after the first information requests were sent out.But, this week, the CME futures exchange may well have set a record for investigative speed. Traders Heet Khara and Nasim Salim were suspended for 60 days for allegedly colluding to move gold futures prices by placing and cancelling huge numbers of orders — an illegal technique known as “layering”. The pair had allegedly misbehaved right up until April 28, just two days before the suspension was imposed.The CME’s rapid response comes at a time when it is under fire for its role in the case of Navinder Singh Sarao, the British trader accused by US prosecutors of contributing to the 2010 flash crash that sent American markets sharply down for 20 minutes.According to the criminal complaint, the CME knew as early as 2009 that Mr Sarao, who is fighting extradition to the US, was placing and cancelling lots of orders. But the exchange appears to have taken no action beyond sending a complaining letter, which happened to arrive on the day of the flash crash. Mr Sarao later emailed his broker that he had called the CME and “told ’em to kiss my ass”, the complaint said.The arrest of Navinder Singh Sarao raises fresh concerns about market regulationFull storyThe Sarao case highlights the potential problems with the current US system of relying on “self-regulatory organisations”, including the exchanges, to do much of the frontline policing of markets. They are supposed to make sure traders abide by the rules and refer serious misbehaviour on to government regulators.This system may have worked when exchanges were owned by their members, but now that they have to generate profits for shareholders, conflicts have emerged. A market that cracks down too hard or too quickly could drive away paying customers. The CME controls the futures market allegedly used by Mr Sarao, but the temptation to go soft could be far greater in areas where trading venues compete.A second problem with the new order was also highlighted this week when shareholder.com, a Nasdaq unit that manages investor relations for public companies, inadvertently released Twitter’s quarterly results early. Though the information was posted on Twitter’s website for just 45 seconds on Wednesday, an independent data gathering company called Selerity found it and put the information on, you guessed it, Twitter.The CME appears to have taken no action [over Navinder Sarao] beyond sending a complaining letter, which happened to arrive on the day of the flash crash. Mr Sarao later emailed his broker that he had called the CME and ‘told ’em to kiss my ass’It showed that the social media platform had missed revenue expectations, so Twitter’s share price tanked. Investors who were trading the shares at the time will want a thorough investigation into what went wrong, and whether anyone profited improperly. In this case, Twitter is listed on the NYSE and the high-profile snafu has caught the attention of federal regulators. But what if the company and the share price fall had been smaller and listed on Nasdaq?JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon often argues that exchanges and other central counterparties are the next big risk to financial stability. That’s definitely the pot calling the kettle black. But the pervasive and sometimes conflicted roles played by the various exchanges deserve greater scrutiny.brooke.masters@ft.com
116;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2015-04-29T18:27:26Z;Nasdaq faces questions over Twitter release;Early posting of messaging platform’s results is latest problem for owner of Shareholder.com;The mood ahead of a big earnings release is typically tense. The anticipation for Twitter’s quarterly results on Tuesday was interrupted by, ironically, a tweet that revealed its results about an hour ahead of schedule. Worse yet, the news was not good. Twitter missed revenue expectations and lowered full-year guidance. It shares fell as much as 26 per cent, shaving more than $6bn from its market capitalisation.The messaging platform quickly pointed a finger at Nasdaq, the equity exchange that owns Shareholder.com, a service that Twitter uses to manage its investor relations website. The Nasdaq unit inadvertently posted Twitter’s earnings release prematurely.Describing how Anthony Noto, Twitter’s chief financial officer, rushed into his office to break the news about the early publication, Dick Costolo, Twitter’s chief executive, said he realised then it was “not particularly fortuitous timing”, given Twitter’s results would have disappointed the market even if they had been released on time.Shares in Twitter continued to fall on Wednesday in New York — dipping 8.9 per cent to $38.49 by close of trading — as analysts cut their expectations for the year.Given Twitter’s disappointing performance and less than rosy outlook, its shares would likely have fallen regardless. But the bungled release threatens to be another black mark for Nasdaq after high-profile problems with its technology in recent years. Those include a delay to the market debut of Facebook and a three hour outage on its own market in 2013.“It is certainly negative for their reputation,” said Paul Gulberg, an analyst at Portales Partners of the Twitter error. He added that Nasdaq “specifically tries to sell itself as an information technology business rather than just an exchange”.Nasdaq admitted that the fault lay in an operational issue that exposed the release on Twitter’s investor relations website for less than a minute. “During those seconds the site was scraped by a third party that publicly disseminated the earnings information,” it said. “We regret the incident and remain fully committed to providing the highest quality investor relations communication product and services to our clients.”The exchange’s push into corporate services has been part of a broader move to diversify beyond its historical business of equities trading and initial public offerings. Rival exchanges and banks with cheaper, faster technology have provided fierce price competition and taken market share, while its longtime rival, the New York Stock Exchange, has also taken a larger number of technology IPOs in recent years.However, that push has been accompanied by missteps in its traditional business. Just last week, the exchange said it had established a $31m loss reserve for litigation arising from the Facebook IPO. It has already agreed to pay $10m — at the time the largest penalty levied against a US exchange — to US regulators over the issue. Also in August 2013, Nasdaq’s public data network that shows the quotes and trades for the exchange was shut down for more than three hours, which halted trading on the Nasdaq.Collectively that has taken a toll. While Nasdaq last year had more IPOs than NYSE, its arch rival scooped some of the coveted deals of late, such as Lending Club and China’s Alibaba and Twitter itself.Investors have nonetheless rewarded the Nasdaq’s strategy in recent years. Nasdaq shares, barely changed on Tuesday, have risen by about a third in the last year and more than doubled in the last five years.The SEC will probably review the earnings release error because US law calls for all investors to be informed about market sensitive information simultaneously, according to people familiar with the matter.The Twitter release comes months after a similar leak occurred at Nasdaq’s Shareholder.com with JPMorgan Chase’s earnings in October.Selerity, which broadcast Twitter’s first-quarter earnings after discovering them on the messaging group’s website, has also ‘leaked’ information early from ADP’s employment report last December, and Microsoft’s quarterly results four years ago.● Oct 1999 Software glitch on Nasdaq’s main stock quotation system forces the delay of IPOs● Jul 2001 Mistaken computer command causes 35 stocks to be incorrectly priced● May 2012 Trading at Facebook launch initially delayed by 20 minutes due to cancelled trades interrupting system● Oct 2012 Technical problems cause shares in Kraft Food to rise nearly 30 per cent. Nasdaq subsequently cancels trades● Aug 2013 System is down for about three-and-a-half hours after a series of erroneous quotes brings trading to a halt● Apr 2015 $6.8bn is wiped off Twitter’s market cap after Nasdaq accidentally publishes the company’s results earlyWhether the early release created an unfair market is a question for investors who may feel disadvantaged if others discovered the results were out first and traded on them before the rest of the market.But Jill Fisch, a law professor and securities expert at the University of Pennsylvania, said premature disclosure of results was not in itself a violation of securities law.Although there are laws prohibiting the selective disclosure of results, and they are by convention released before or after the stock market closes, she said: “There is nothing in the securities law that determines when a company discloses earnings information.”Ms Fisch said another issue for Twitter, Shareholder.com and Nasdaq was whether any contractual obligations had been breached.Companies prefer to release results when the market is closed to give investors time to digest their implications. “Twitter could say ‘we wanted it disclosed after the market closed so investors wouldn’t overreact or panic’. But that seems like contract-type damage,” she said.Reporting by Nicole Bullock, Hannah Kuchler, Philip Stafford, Barney Jopson and Gina Chon
117;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2015-04-29T17:34:39Z;Nasdaq apologises for 45-second Twitter earnings release error;Shareholder.com unit behind second earnings mistake in 7 months;"An “operational” error that lasted only 45 seconds was behind the premature release of Twitter’s disappointing quarterly results on Tuesday, Nasdaq admitted as the social media site’s shares fell sharply for the second day running.Shareholder.com, a Nasdaq unit that manages investor relations for Twitter and other listed companies, made its second earnings release blunder in less than seven months.“The posting was caused by an operational issue that exposed the release on Twitter’s IR website for approximately 45 seconds,” a Nasdaq spokesman said. “During those seconds the site was scraped by a third party that publicly disseminated the earnings information.”“We regret the incident and remain fully committed to providing the highest-quality investor relations communication product and services to our clients,” the spokesman said.Twitter shares were down 8.94 per cent by the close on Wednesday to $38.49, compounding an 18 per cent drop on Tuesday as investors digested the news that the social media site had missed revenue expectations and lowered its guidance.Nasdaq shares were down 0.73 per cent at $48.96.Dick Costolo, Twitter’s chief executive, said the early release of the earnings “wasn’t a particularly pleasant experience” and he wanted to discuss it with Nasdaq.“Whenever you outsource something to a third party, it is because they have competences where you don’t have competences,” he told CNBC. “It is absolutely something we need to talk about.”Investors were also unhappy. “Obviously it’s a bad thing,” said a fund manager who owns a small stake in Twitter. “There’s no doubt about it; this shouldn’t happen. It’s bad for the company and it’s bad for investors, but luckily it doesn’t happen often.”The US Securities and Exchange Commission will probably review the earnings release snafu, but it is too early to say whether the financial regulator will take any additional action, according to people familiar with the matter.The SEC is concerned that the Twitter release comes months after a similar leak occurred at Shareholder.com with JPMorgan Chase’s earnings in October, the people said.Selerity, a company that crawls the web for market-moving data and feeds it to clients, including high speed traders, found the results on Twitter’s investor relations website and tweeted out the figures with the hashtag “BREAKING”.Selerity also “leaked” information early from ADP’s employment report in December 2014, and Microsoft’s quarterly results four years ago.Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research, said the dramatic fall in Twitter’s stock price was “not a surprising reaction” given that the company thoroughly missed analysts’ expectations. But he said the early release, during trading hours, rather than after the US markets closed as planned, might have caused the stock to fall even further.“The fact it came out early doesn’t help as it means significant trading volumes can move and build on the reaction,” he said. “We could well have had that reaction the next day if it had come out as intended but it took away from Twitter’s ability to control the narrative.”"
118;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2015-04-27T09:30:05Z;Nasdaq to eclipse eurozone market value;US index and dollar resurgence puts market in leadership position;"Having reclaimed record territory after an absence of 15 years, the US Nasdaq Composite is close to eclipsing the broad eurozone market in dollar terms for this year.The resurgence has propelled the market decisively beyond 5,000 points over the past week, as investors seek out companies with high growth prospects and pricing power for their products and services.Share prices for the likes of Tesla, Netflix, Amazon and Microsoft have risen sharply of late, helping push the Nasdaq beyond its dotcom era closing record peak and towards the intraday all time peak of 5,132 set in March 2000.A backdrop of recent lacklustre US economic data and the expectation that the Federal Reserve — which is meeting this week to update the market on its policy on Wednesday — remains some way from raising interest rates, has helped the Nasdaq snap out from a period of consolidation that began in late February.Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock, said: “We are still in a slow growth environment and this [tech] is a part of the economy that is seeing a secular wave.”The Nasdaq’s gain of 7 per cent so far this year comfortably eclipses the 3 per cent rise for the broader S&P 500 and reflects how investors are rewarding companies standing at the cutting edge of innovation, such as biotechnology groups.“The minute we see data that suggest the Fed will not raise rates, the market focuses on companies that are deemed growth stories,” said Vadim Zlotnikov, chief market strategist at AllianceBernstein. “The premium people are willing to pay for companies with pricing power; thanks to defendable franchises, innovation and technology will continuing rising.’’The recent acceleration of the Nasdaq into record territory came when US investors began the year seeking exposure to eurozone shares, buoyed by prospects for aggressive easing by the European Central Bank. The ECB’s massive bond buying programme started last month and has helped weaken the euro, while propelling eurozone share markets higher by about 20 per cent this year.The Nasdaq’s rise for the year leaves it within reach of the dollar based gain of 8.4 per cent for the broad FTSE Eurofirst 300 index, given the lower value of the single currency. Moreover, further gains for eurozone shares are seen requiring evidence of economic growth accelerating in the coming months.“The valuation gap between Europe and the US has closed since the start of the year and the only reason for buying eurozone shares is if you believe the region has relatively superior economic growth prospects,’’ said Mr Zlotnikov.The growth prospects for the Nasdaq are also diverse, with healthcare, consumer and financial becoming bigger sectors since technology accounted for two-thirds of the benchmark in 2000, a figure that has now eased to a 42 per cent weighting.“Nasdaq is still predominantly tech, but it is not pure tech,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. “It has come back because it is a mixture.”After falling back below 1,300 during the depths of the financial crisis, the Nasdaq has risen 300 per cent. On an inflation adjusted basis, the benchmark significantly trails its internet boom peak."
119;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2015-04-23T23:00:51Z;The Nasdaq — going nowhere for 15 years;Almost any other equity investment would have been a smarter bet;This was the day that many market-watchers thought they would never live to see: the day the Nasdaq Composite index closed at a new all-time high.The last time it did so was on March 10, 2000, at the top of arguably the single most grotesque bubble in stock market history. Within a month it had fallen by more than a third.The valuations the Nasdaq hit at that point were so extreme that many assumed it could take a lifetime to get back to a new high. This was not unreasonable. US stocks at that point were more overvalued by sensible long-term metrics than at any other point in history.Nasdaq stocks looked more expensive even than industrial stocks had done before the Wall Street Crash in 1929 — and it had taken until 1954 for them to set a new high.In history’s other great bubble, Japanese stocks peaked on New Year’s Eve 1989. A quarter of a century later, Tokyo stocks remain almost 50 per cent below that peak.So the recovery of the Nasdaq is genuinely remarkable and is backed, hearteningly, by truly remarkable corporate performance. Apple, still a year away from the launch of the iPod in March 2000, leads the pack. It appeared in the dotcom era to have decisively lost its war with Microsoft. But since then it has gained 4,200 per cent while the Nasdaq has been flat. Its extraordinary success — achieved with profit multiples that still make it look cheap — is the single biggest factor in Nasdaq’s recovery.But buying the Nasdaq at its last peak would still have been a terrible idea. Scarcely any equity market anywhere has fared worse. Even Argentina’s Merval index, despite the disasters of default and devaluation in the interim, has gained 135 per cent.Those who dared to be contrarian would have trounced those who jumped into the hot stocks of the Nasdaq. According to Bloomberg data, five stocks in the S&P 500 have risen more than 1,000 per cent since then. For those who could not foresee the iPod, iPhone and iPad, and missed out on Apple, there was always the Ball Corporation, which makes cans, VF Corporation, which makes jeans, and CSX Corporation, a railroad. All were industries that appeared to be in terminal decline 15 years ago.
120;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2015-04-23T20:06:43Z;Nasdaq surpasses its dotcom boom record;Tech benchmark completes recovery from October 2002 low;The Nasdaq Composite closed in record territory on Thursday, completing a 15 year recovery from one of the most spectacular equity market busts experienced by investors.The $7.7tn technology bellwether has finally topped its March 2000 dotcom bubble peak of 5,048.62, closing at 5,056.06 and within easy distance of the intraday record of 5,132.52.During the Nasdaq’s long journey back from the bursting of the internet bubble, the composition of the benchmark has altered markedly as US equities have experienced two bull markets and companies generated record profits.While many global equity markets are sitting at all-time or multiyear peaks against the backdrop of aggressive central bank easing, Nasdaq’s push into record territory has been spurred by investor appetite for companies at the forefront of innovation, including a number like Apple with vast amounts of cash.“We are back at 5,000 because the scarcest commodity in capital markets today is fundamental growth,’’ said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at Convergex. “It is very hard to find companies that show revenue growth and it has just gotten worse with the appreciation of the dollar and the slowdown in economy.”“Now, whether or not these companies can live up to their promises is another matter,” he added.Since October, the Nasdaq has risen more than 20 per cent, outpacing the S&P 500’s gain of 14 per cent.Technology shares, led by Apple, the world’s largest company and carrying a 10 per cent weighting in the Nasdaq alone, are benefiting from robust revenue and profit forecasts.The rise of Google and other innovative companies that were not around in 2000, such as Netflix, Tesla, Facebook and LinkedIn, underscores the marked changes in the technology benchmark in the past 15 years.Dotcom favourites, Amazon and Priceline have risen from the ashes of the internet bust and a host of biotechs have also propelled the Nasdaq’s recovery. Tech boom era stalwarts, including Microsoft, Intel and Cisco, remain high profile members of the Nasdaq.In contrast with the dotcom frenzy, valuations for leading Nasdaq members are far more restrained. The present trailing price to earnings ratio for the Nasdaq stands at 26 times, according to FactSet. This measure soared to 72 times during the dotcom fever with the likes of Cisco at 127 times, Oracle at 103 times and Yahoo at 418 times earnings.Given the scale of the late 1990s rally and rocketing valuations, investors, burnt by the subsequent crash, thought any return to the 5,000 threshold would take decades to attain.From late 1998 to early 2000, the Nasdaq surged 250 per cent as internet mania gripped investors, with the benchmark rocketing from 1,400 to an intraday peak of 5,132.52. Stratospheric valuations and earnings multiples well above 100 times were all but ignored as investors focused on the growth potential of the internet.The bust was equally spectacular as many tech companies that generated little or no profit, burnt through their cash and investors dumped shares. By October 2002, the Nasdaq plumbed a low of 1,114.11 and while the broader US market climbed to a new record in 2007, the technology benchmark stalled below 3,000 as the financial crisis dawned.After falling back below 1,300 during the financial crisis, the Nasdaq has risen roughly 300 per cent, however on an inflation adjusted level, the benchmark significantly trails its internet boom peak.
121;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2015-03-16T09:13:23Z;Nasdaq president dismisses tech bubble fears;Main US index ‘fundamentally different’ after 2000 collapse with inclusion of non-tech names;The president of exchange group Nasdaq OMX has dismissed suggestions of a new tech sector bubble, despite a multiyear rally that has returned internet stocks to the highs of the dotcom boom.The Nasdaq Composite index briefly hit 5,000 points last week. It last reached that level 15 years ago at the pinnacle of the tech bubble, collapsing soon after to finish the year 2000 having dropped below 1,500 points.However, Adena Friedman, president of Nasdaq OMX, believes that the exchange’s main US equity index is now “fundamentally different”, and that the addition of companies outside the tech sector has helped make it a “formidable reflection” of the global economy.“I was there in 2000. It was a very, very different index then. If you look at the index today, we now have three of the five largest companies in the world,” said Ms Friedman.While the Nasdaq is best known for hosting technology giants including Apple, Facebook, and Google, it has also attracted a number of businesses from other sectors, such as coffee chain Starbucks, hotel group Marriott International, and food producer Mondelez. Consumer goods, consumer services and healthcare combined now make up more than 40 per cent of the Nasdaq Composite.Tech stocks do still dominate, accounting for 43 per cent of the index. Even so, Ms Friedman sees little cause for concern.“I personally think that tech is in a huge growth phase,” she said. “There is a rationale for the types of valuations that these companies are getting based on the growth opportunity globally for technology and biotech.”A number of emerging tech sector companies have recently turned to private markets for funding, something made possible by rule changes brought in under the Jobs Act— a new law aimed at simplifying rules governing US capital raisings and securities sales. The likes of Airbnb, SpaceX, Lyft, and Snapchat have attained multibillion dollar valuations from private capital raisings, while Xiaomi and Uber have become two of the world’s most highly valued unlisted companies.However, Ms Friedman insists this trend is not a threat to Nasdaq’s listings business, and instead represents an opportunity for the exchange. It set up Nasdaq Private Market last year as a platform designed to help companies raise capital from investors without going public.Speaking on a visit to Hong Kong, Ms Friedman also hailed the launch of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect as a “huge success”, and said Nasdaq hoped to benefit from the cross-border trading link in future by listing more exchange traded funds (ETFs) in the region.ETFs are not currently eligible for the Stock Connect, which allows mainland Chinese investors to trade securities listed in Hong Kong. However, the Hong Kong stock exchange hopes to broaden the scheme to include other asset classes in the future. An ETF tracking the more tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index is already listed in Shanghai.The bulk of Nasdaq’s Asian revenue comes from selling trading software to local exchanges. On Sunday night, it announced that Asia Pacific Stock Exchange (APX), a year-old Sydney-based bourse aimed at Chinese companies, had gone live with a new Nasdaq-supplied trading platform.
122;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2015-01-14T18:37:04Z;Nasdaq plans challenge to energy futures duopoly;Exchange group seeks to undercut CME and ICE fees;Nasdaq OMX plans to break into global oil and gas derivatives markets, invading the turf of established commodity exchanges by offering traders lower fees.The New York exchange group has signed up brokers, trading firms and banks including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley to back a new energy futures venture to launch in 2015, industry executives said.Tentative products would include futures and options on West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude as well as US natural gas.The move would make Nasdaq a third contender in an already fierce fight for energy market share between CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange, which together list the benchmark oil and gas contracts. Despite the dramatic fall in oil prices and wild swings in gas, energy volumes on both exchanges shrank in 2014.Nasdaq has been aggressively trying to spread beyond equities trading, where profits have contracted amid tough competition. Previous initiatives include the $750m purchase of eSpeed, a government bond trading platform, and the launch of NLX, an interest rate derivatives platform in Europe. It also has a European power business.Nasdaq re-registered its US futures exchange last November after a lapse, a regulatory filing shows. In a notice posted online, the exchange said it planned to add “core benchmark products in crude oil, natural gas, and US power” to its offerings, allowing traders to “access liquidity at below current published market rates”.A person familiar with Nasdaq said executives believed current energy trading and clearing fees did not reflect the efficiencies of what is now a largely electronic marketplace. “The pricing is generally wrong. It’s a lack of competition,” the person said.While executed on Nasdaq computers, trades would be guaranteed by the Chicago-based Options Clearing Corporation, whose executive chairman is Craig Donohue, former chief executive of CME.Javier Loya, chief executive of energy broker OTC Global Holdings, said his company will back the new exchange.“I think it’s a good opportunity for a third party to come in and challenge the vertical silos of both CME and ICE with a different market structure,” Mr Loya said. “Ultimately, clients want to see competition. They want to see fee reductions.”An executive at a large energy trading group uninvolved with the venture was sceptical, however. “They don’t have a competitive advantage,” he said. “They’re trying to enter into a market that is largely dominated by two incumbents that do a very good job, CME and ICE.”Nasdaq’s products would be “lookalike” contracts with prices based on futures at CME and ICE.One potential lure for the exchange is looming position limits on energy speculators. By spreading positions across a few exchanges, a trader could maintain larger bets than if all were kept at one exchange, a futures executive said.Nasdaq said it “works closely with customers to understand the demands of the marketplace and opportunities to provide customers with competitive alternatives and greater efficiencies that leverage our technology and expertise”.
123;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2015-01-05T05:02:00Z;Nasdaq buys US index provider for $225m;Purchase of Dorsey Wright is part of push into market for exchange traded funds;Nasdaq is pushing further into indexing and the growing market for exchange traded funds with the purchase of Dorsey Wright, a US index provider and analytics group, as part of a strategy to diversify its business.The exchange expects that the $225m deal, funded with a mix of debt and cash, will help boost growth in the coming years.“We see ourselves as a major player in the index space,” said Adena Friedman, president of global capital access, technology and insights at Nasdaq. “We believe this is a big part of our strategic future.”Many stock exchange indices are close to new highs, but exchange profits from traditional stock trading remain under pressure from competition and a long-term trend that has seen billions of dollars of funds move from active investment management to more passive strategies, such as ETFs.In response, exchanges have been boosting ties to index providers as licensing of data offers new sources of growth. Last year, the London Stock Exchange bought the Russell family of stock indices in a $2.7bn deal.Nasdaq’s latest acquisition is a bet on so-called smart beta strategies, which offer an alternative to traditional market capitalisation weighted indices by shifting the index weightings based on certain factors.Founded in 1987, Dorsey Wright specialises in relative strength indices, which recalibrate based on market performance. They include various asset classes and geographies.The company licenses the indices to ETF providers PowerShares and First Trust, and sells analytics to retail brokers.“Assets under management tracking indices are growing at 13 per cent overall. Smart beta growing is at 24 per cent,” Ms Friedman said. “We want to make sure we continue to build out our presence there. In our opinion, the next phase in index investment will be from straight passive management to smart beta.”The deal will not affect leverage or Nasdaq’s capital return plans. It had suspended share repurchases because of rising debt from acquisitions, but after lowering its leverage, resumed buybacks last year, helping to drive a 21 per cent increase in the stock price.Asked about some of the larger auctions for index assets, such as the Russell deal, Ms Friedman said a combination of factors including pricing meant that one did not meet Nasdaq’s return profile.The Dorsey Wright purchase is “very easy to digest, very easy to integrate,” she said.Nasdaq has $40bn of assets linked to smart beta indices or a 10 per cent share of the market, now primarily in dividend strategies. Dorsey Wright will add about $5bn of licensed ETF assets and Nasdaq hopes to use its reach and relationships to grow that further.Dorsey Wright is being sold by Falfurrias Capital Partners, a private equity firm.
124;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2014-11-19T16:04:32Z;Fresh SEC crackdown on ‘flash crashes’;Trading firms and exchanges face new rules;Trading firms and exchanges will face heavier scrutiny from US regulators aimed at preventing glitches like those that have triggered market chaos and seen investors lose hundreds of millions of dollars in a matter of minutes.The Securities and Exchange Commission announced rules requiring certain market participants – including the Nasdaq and New York stock exchanges – to ensure their technology meets specific criteria, to conduct routine testing of systems and to notify authorities in the event of market disruptions.The decision came as regulators grapple with the issue of how to formulate rules to prevent glitches of the kind that have shaken confidence in financial markets, which are increasingly dominated by computerised high-frequency trading.“Investors deserve better,” said SEC chairwoman Mary Jo White. “Failures must be minimised and, when they occur, they must be remediated as quickly as possible and promptly reported to the commission.“Investors should expect no less of the world’s premier securities markets – indeed, investor confidence depends on it.”In one of the most high-profile mishaps so far, Nasdaq was hit last year with the largest fine yet imposed on an exchange, paying $10m for the botched Facebook IPO. Its system had been overwhelmed by the number of orders, which delayed opening trades and caused investors to lose hundreds of millions of dollars.But smaller market events have roiled markets. In 2012 trading firm Knight Capital said it lost $440m in 30 minutes because of software glitches, which also sparked chaos in the markets.The regulation, known as Regulation SCI, came a day after Home Depot became the latest flash crash victim in the US equity market. On Tuesday the New York Stock Exchange cancelled trades in the company’s shares after the stock fell sharply, briefly wiping more than $12bn off its value.The final decision by the SEC came after a delayed vote in October following criticism from Democrat commissioners that the rules did not go far enough to control markets – in particular for failing to include brokers that deal with retail investors.While the rules passed unanimously, with support from both Republican and Democrat commissioners, Ms White said the SEC would now consider whether similar regulation should apply to broker-dealers and others.Wall Street participants, including the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, have fought against expanding the proposal to include brokers, arguing that this would increase costs for investors.The rules will be enforceable by the authorities and replace a voluntary compliance system. They are set to apply to stock exchanges, trading venues for options, certain dark pools, registered clearing agencies and other “significant” alternative trading systems.
125;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2014-10-27T15:52:13Z;Nasdaq presses on with plan to clear forex derivatives in Europe;US-Nordic group has filed an application with regulators to clear non-deliverable forwards;Nasdaq is to press ahead with its long-touted plans to clear some foreign exchange instruments in Europe as local regulators finalise mandatory rules for trading off-exchange derivatives.The US-Nordic group has lodged an application in recent weeks with European regulators for approval to clear a range of non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) and options, according to two people familiar with the application. Nasdaq declined to comment.The move illustrates how the foreign exchange market is rapidly changing in the wake of G20 reforms to the global financial markets, intended to monitor risk and bolster against systemic weakness.It is also being seen as a test case as it would be the first time a clearing house that has been authorised to clear under new incoming rules has sought to extend its licence. European authorities are currently assessing all European clearing houses and have approved 13 venues. Nasdaq was the first but was mandated only to clear equity, interest rate and commodity derivatives.Policy makers have sought to have more types of derivatives backed by collateral and traded through clearing houses. Historically, the forex market has been conducted privately between banks, with little insurance posted between counterparties to back their trades.Nasdaq had been openly discussing the move for more than a year with banks and institutional investors, its main customers. However, market participants have been more focused on preparations to clear interest rate and credit default swaps before the European mandate next year.While politicians have exempted certain kinds of FX trading from the clearing mandate, US regulators included other types of trades, notably non-deliverable forwards and options. Global regulators have been slower to issue mandates to clear foreign exchange derivatives amid concerns over how it would affect the world’s largest and most liquid market.Non-deliverable forwards trading accounted for about $127bn of the $5.3tn traded daily on global currency markets in 2013, although volumes have grown rapidly in recent years.The European Securities and Markets Authority, the pan-European regulator, issued its market consultation to discuss draft technical standards for clearing forex NDFs at the start of October, some three months after other off-exchange asset classes. The discussion period closes on November 6.If its application is successful, Nasdaq would enter a clearing market dominated by the LCH.Clearnet and also face competition from CME Group’s European operation.
126;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2014-10-24T12:30:38Z;Nasdaq lifts share buyback limit by $500m;US exchange set to resume share repurchases after meeting leverage targets;Nasdaq, the US exchanges operator, has raised the total amount of stock it can buy back by a further $500m after meeting a target this year to pay down debt.In its third-quarter results on Friday, the New York group also further pared back the funding it gives to new projects.Its move came after it published a steady set of earnings, which covers what is traditionally the slowest part of the trading year. For the quarter to September 30, revenues were down 2 per cent year on year to $497m, while earnings increased 9 per cent to 72 cents a share. Organic revenue growth in the period fell 1 per cent.It also raised estimates on cost savings for the year to about $1.205bn-$1.225bn, compared with a previous forecast of $1.220bn-$1.250bn.In part Nasdaq will spend less than forecast on its four-year old programme for new initiatives, which have fostered ventures in the German power market and NLX, its 18-month-old London-based interest rate derivatives platform.In February Nasdaq estimated it would spend $35m-$50m this year on the programme, but on Friday the company said the range would be about $30-$35m.Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq, said the funding for new projects would likely remain steady. “We are reaching a point where we have more great concepts . . . than funding,” he said. “It’s going to be harder for internal projects to meet our rates of return.”Mr Greifeld also told analysts that he was “pleased with the progress of NLX, which has taken market share of about 15 per cent of derivatives trading. “I’d also say that NLX has now achieved a certain level of credibility where you see certain significant new players wanting to become involved with the efforts. Good execution in the quarter, we understand that progress in this new initiative is not linear but so far, so good,” he added.Nasdaq is also likely to extend its share repurchase programme after its board authorised the limit for spending to be raised from $60m to $560m. The two-year-old scheme had been briefly halted while it paid down $100m of debt and met internal leverage targets. Nasdaq reached its goal in the early summer.Although Nasdaq lost out to the New York Stock Exchange for the listing of Alibaba, the Chinese ecommerce company, in September, Nasdaq said it won 62 per cent of all US initial public offerings in the third quarter. Its IPO count of 140 by the end of September is more than any other exchange, it added.Shares in Nasdaq were down 2.2 per cent at $40.37 in morning trade in New York.
127;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2014-09-29T16:56:19Z;New York widens global lead for IPOs;;The US has strengthened its position as the preferred destination for initial public offerings, and is set to rank as the top country for new equity fundraisings for the fourth straight year, following the recent blockbuster listing of Chinese e-commerce group Alibaba.In the year to date, companies have raised $77bn through listings on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, according to data from Dealogic – twice as much as the amount raised in London and Hong Kong combined.IPOs on US exchanges have accounted for two out of every five dollars raised so far in 2014, the figures show. Some $25bn of the US total has come from Alibaba, which earlier this month completed the largest IPO ever.This surge in US listings has accompanied quickening US economic activity and near record highs for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average. Global listings in New York are running at the fastest pace by deal value since 2000 – lifted in part, bankers and lawyers say, by the sheer number of US investors.“There is a depth of liquidity [in the US] . . . that kind of depth of potential investment is just not available on other exchanges,” said Nick Kronfeld, a partner at Davis Polk. “[Listing in the US] opens to companies a whole range of institutions that aren’t there in other markets.”While New York and Hong Kong remain neck and neck in terms of number of cross border deals this year, foreign-domiciled companies have raised far more money through IPOs in New York.Excluding Alibaba, international companies raised $11.4bn through US listings, led by Chinese internet, and Israeli and British technology groups, according to Ipreo, the market data firm. Foreign companies listing in Hong Kong, in contrast, raised $3bn.In May, JD.com, the Chinese internet company, raised $2bn through a Nasdaq-listed IPO, which was followed a month later by the debut of Markit, the London-based financial data company, on the same exchange. Proceeds from Markit’s offering eclipsed $1.4bn.Flexibility around governance provisions and the reputation for US capital markets as a whole – that environment has made the NYSE a premier place to list“Flexibility around governance provisions and the reputation for US capital markets as a whole – that environment has made the NYSE a premier place to list,” said Stephen Roti, head of equity capital markets at Nomura.Hong Kong had dominated the global IPO market in both 2009 and 2010, thanks to a wave of major listings from Chinese state-owned enterprises, principally banks. Before Alibaba, the two largest ever flotations were from Chinese state lenders – ICBC and Agricultural Bank of China.But that flood has since turned to a trickle, with most of the biggest and best of China’s state-owned companies now listed, and few privately-run companies yet ready to pick up the slack.The one exception was Alibaba, but its decision to leave board nominations in the hands of a small group of company executives failed to satisfy Hong Kong listing rules.The fall down the league tables meant that Alibaba’s decision to list in New York – rather than alter its management structure – sparked a fierce debate within Hong Kong’s financial establishment about whether to relax its listing rules.But now the city is gripped by the excitement of an entirely different venture – the Hong Kong-Shanghai stock connect.The scheme – due to launch next month – will allow mainland Chinese investors to buy Hong Kong shares directly, and give global fund managers far easier access to Shanghai-listed stocks.“Clearly there will be a benefit to having a real onshore, domestic presence in Shanghai, and certainly the exchange will benefit,” Mr Roti says. “But is that really going to be a definitive factor for people, my guess is no.”In the US, bankers expect a busy autumn and winter as companies who waited for Alibaba to complete its listing file plans to offer shares.Additional reporting by Nicole Bullock in New York
128;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2014-09-15T20:09:08Z;Nasdaq Composite eyes return to dotcom bubble level;Tech index’s comeback on stronger foundations than 2000 record;There are plenty of comeback stories on Wall Street. Many are watching whether the Nasdaq Composite can complete what the once unthinkable: a return to the technology bubble closing peak of 5,048.62 attained more than 14 years ago.Currently the Nasdaq sits 10 per cent below that record of March 2000, having staged a remarkable comeback for an index that tumbled 80 per cent to a nadir of 1,114.11 in October 2002.“I can’t tell you how many people have told me down the years that we would never see Nasdaq 5,000,” says Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. “We will see 5,000 and this feels a lot more sustainable this time as during the late 1990s we had upstart companies that had no real businesses driving up the market.”The implosion of technology stocks – which had propelled the Nasdaq to global prominence among investors and the financial media during the late 1990s – left deep scars and a lasting belief among many investors that revisiting such a peak would take decades.History, at least, bears that out. Following the stock market crash of 1929, a generation unfolded before the Dow Jones Industrial Average fully rebounded from a slump of 90 per cent by 1932 to its pre-Great Depression high in late 1954.Indeed, while the Dow and S&P 500 eclipsed their peaks at the turn of the century in 2007, and have subsequently moved well into record territory in the past year, the idea of the Nasdaq joining the club remained remote until now.“To even be as close as we are now [to the former peak], it is sort of shocking especially if you wind back the clock to the early 2000s and the utter collapse we were dealing with then,” says Josh Spencer, a portfolio manager at T Rowe Price.”The other indexes certainly have come back to their all time highs,” says Ray Nolte, chief investment officer at SkyBridge Capital. “It has been well over a decade.”The listing of Google in 2004 and the rise of Apple helped the early stages of the Nasdaq’s recovery. By market capitalisation Apple leads the way as the Nasdaq’s most valuable member, while back in 2000, the maker of iWatches, iPads and iPhones was not even on the top 20 list as Steve Jobs had only recently assumed control.Dotcom darlings, Amazon and Priceline rose from the ashes of 2000 and 2001, and a host of biotechs and start-ups such as Tesla, Netflix and Facebook have propelled the Nasdaq’s recovery. Meanwhile, stalwarts from the tech boom era, including the likes of Microsoft, Intel, Cisco and Qualcomm remain high profile members of the Nasdaq.“In the last few years, all aspects of the market have fired at once,” says Mr Spencer. “The mainstays of modern technology – Apple, Google, Priceline – have risen. And in the last 12-18 months, some of the past giants – Microsoft, Intel, Cisco – have started to act well.”Over the past 14 years, the make-up of the market has changed in many ways. By the end of 2013 the index had about half the components that it did in 1999 – about 2,500 versus 4,700 – according to figures from Nasdaq. But the members of the index are about twice the size on average.“The world has grown considerably and the marketplace is different [from 2000],” says Mr Nolte. “I am not even sure that you can draw direct comparisons between Nasdaq then and now.”At 38 per cent, information technology companies remain a major component of the index, but account for a much lower percentage of market capitalisation than their 57 per cent share seen at the end of 1999, Nasdaq says.Another key difference is how today’s Nasdaq has become split between old giants that producing hefty revenues and cash flow – Microsoft, Oracle, Intel and Cisco – and new companies at the cutting edge of innovation, such as Facebook, Tesla, Netflix and numerous biotechs.“Tech is now an animal it has never been before in that we still have companies at the leading edge of new ideas, but we also see a host of almost utility-like tech giants that are generating lots of cash, while no longer innovating,” says Mr Paulsen. “Now we have a solid mix of old and new tech that is innovative leading the Nasdaq higher.”One message, then, from investors is that the Nasdaq’s pending test of 5,000 does not mean it is in bubble territory, not yet at least. “I am not that optimistic about the broad market today basically because of the levels, but I am not worried about bubbles,” says Mr Spencer.
129;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2014-08-14T22:49:00Z;Nasdaq breakdown causes ‘stuck’ orders;Latest in string of system issues;Nasdaq suffered a technological breakdown* on Thursday, which caused its flagship US equities exchange to fail to properly route trades with some investment firms.The company said it had resolved an issue with “stuck orders”, or those buy or sell orders that fail to make their way through the exchange’s infrastructure due to a technical problem.A person familiar with the matter, which affected the exchange from 14:01:06 to 14:03:24, blamed an issue with some gateways, the systems investment firms use to connect to the Nasdaq. The outage impacted a “small subset of orders”, Nasdaq said in statement.After identifying the problem, the exchange said new orders were “not impacted and trading has been continuous”.Stuck orders occur from time to time. In this instance, a person familiar with the situation said the problem involved roughly 5 per cent of the gateways where traders connect to Nasdaq’s data centre in Carteret, New Jersey, to match and process US orders.Typically the exchange maintains a brokerage account that it uses to help orders get through the system in the event of problems. It is unclear if that was employed in this case.The failure is the latest in a string of technological issues for Nasdaq, which suffered an unprecedented three-hour halt in August last year that saw trading suspended in some of the most well known and closely held US-listed companies.*The original article cited a hardware problem as the source of the issue, however Nasdaq has since said it has yet to determine the cause.
130;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2014-07-24T21:37:01Z;Nasdaq earnings boosted by acquisitions;;Nasdaq OMX reported double-digit earnings and revenue growth for the second quarter in spite of low trading volumes as acquisitions helped boost its results.Net revenues rose 16 per cent year-over-year to $523m, while earnings increased 13 per cent to 59 cents a share. Organic revenue growth was 4 per cent. On an adjusted basis, excluding acquisition-related costs, earnings were 70 cents a share, also up 13 per cent and 2 cents better than analysts’ expectations.Revenue from equities trading, which accounts for 11 per cent of the total, rose 12 per cent as increases in market share offset lower industry volumes.Nasdaq shares, which rose 2.6 per cent on Thursday to $42.22, have returned 7 per cent so far this year, lagging the overall stock market.Its shares fell sharply in April around the time of the publication of Flash Boys by Michael Lewis, which alleged that the stock market was rigged. The stock has rebounded by nearly a quarter from this year’s low.While the long-term implications remain unclear, some analysts believe that the heightened regulatory scrutiny that has followed the book – at least initially – could benefit the exchanges if near-term focus on stricter rules falls on dark pools, forcing volumes back to exchanges.Asked about market structure in a conference call with investors, Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, said: “There are many opportunities for us to continue to move forward with how we run our business today where we can see gains in share and/or capture . . . I think you’ll see some positive impact on our businesses in the near term.”With trading volumes low, the company cut expenses in the second half of the year, reducing its full-year operating expense target to $1.22bn to $1.25bn from $1.25bn to $1.285bn.Nasdaq recently lost out to the New York Stock Exchange for the listing of Alibaba, the Chinese ecommerce company that is expected to be one of the largest ever listings, but Nasdaq said it won 59 per cent of initial public offerings in the second quarter.As competitors such as NYSE and BATS Global Markets have turned to consolidation in recent years, Nasdaq has sought diversification from equity trading with acquisitions, purchasing the eSpeed bond trading platform from BGC Partners last year and Thomson Reuters’ investor relations unit.The exchange said it paid down $100m of debt, enabling it to meet internal leverage targets and resume shares buybacks. It bought back $93m in the period.Mr Greifeld has not ruled out further acquisitions, but has cautioned recently about valuations. He told the Financial Times on Thursday that Nasdaq would be “an interested party” in the sale of Barclays’ index business, but reiterated that “certain valuations are somewhat frothy”.
131;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
132;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2014-06-26T21:40:56Z;NYSE beats Nasdaq to clinch Alibaba listing;;The New York Stock Exchange has won the coveted listing of Alibaba, which could be the largest ever, representing a high-profile victory over arch rival Nasdaq.The Chinese internet company said in a regulatory filing that is would seek to list on NYSE, ending a lengthy battle between the exchanges that involved senior executives taking part in the pitch process. The company is expected to wrap up its initial public offering in August or September.Alibaba’s listing is expected to raise about $20bn, putting it within range of the world’s largest IPO. For bragging rights it must surpass Agricultural Bank of China’s $22.1bn deal from July 2010.The victory came down to NYSE demonstrating that it knew Alibaba better, said one person familiar with the situation. The company declined to comment.“It is a big win for NYSE,” said Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill, “but the listings go back and forth.”Last year, NYSE also beat Nasdaq for Twitter’s IPO. That choice came after the start of trading in Facebook shares, listed on Nasdaq, was mired by problems with the exchange’s systems in an embarrassing misstep.So far this year, 92 companies have opted to list on Nasdaq against 56 on NYSE, according to Dealogic. But NYSE has lured six of the top 10 largest deals, including IPOs for Ally Financial and Santander Consumer USA, the US car loans arm of the Spanish banking group. Nasdaq’s notable deals include Alibaba competitor JD.com. Nasdaq’s stronghold on technology IPOs has loosened in recent years, however. The exchange dominated these listings until 2010 when NYSE began to take market share. Both in 2013 and in the year to date, NYSE has led in the number of tech IPOs, Dealogic data show.There are many reasons why companies choose one exchange over another. Nasdaq offers lower fees, a testament to its focus on emerging companies, whereas some founders and executives are drawn by the chance to ring the opening bell at NYSE.Winning or losing any one listing, even a prominent one, does not carry big financial implications for an exchange. But it does count as a matter of prestige.In its filing, Alibaba said that as a foreign company, it would be exempt from some of the corporate governance standards that apply to domestic US groups listing on NYSE. Among other exemptions, it will not be required to have a board with a majority of independent directors nor a corporate governance committee consisting of only independent directors.After Alibaba’s listing, 27 partners will retain control of the majority of future board nominations. That corporate governance structure was an important factor in Alibaba’s decision to seek a listing in the US over Hong Kong, where such structures are not allowed.
133;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2014-05-12T09:08:50Z;Nasdaq OMX rehires former finance chief Adena Friedman;;Nasdaq OMX has rehired its former chief financial officer Adena Friedman from Carlyle as the transatlantic exchanges operator looks to ease shareholder pressure by restructuring its senior management team.Ms Friedman will rejoin the transatlantic exchanges operator next month as president of the group’s Corporate, Information, & Technology Solutions units after three years as chief financial officer at Carlyle, the private equity group.She will oversee strategy and be given financial responsibility for the units, which account for around half of Nasdaq’s total revenues. Her return is part of a senior executive reshuffle in which Hans-Ole Jochumsen, made head of markets services operations less than two months ago, is promoted to president, Global Trading & Market Services.Ms Friedman’s return is likely to rekindle speculation over the tenure of long-time chief executive Robert Greifeld, whose contract expires in 2017. She is likely to be seen as a frontrunner to succeed Mr Greifeld, who has held his position for a decade but has come under pressure from shareholders in the wake of a series of high-profile technology outages involving the exchange in the last two years.Although Nasdaq reported record revenues and earnings, and moved into new markets like fixed income trading, in the last five years, a string of senior executives seen as possible successors to Mr Greifeld have also departed. They included Ms Friedman and Eric Noll, who left to join Convergex.Ms Friedman, who has spent most of her career at Nasdaq, had risen from intern to chief financial officer and played a critical role in Nasdaq’s acquisition of OMX, the Nordic exchange, as well as PHLX, the US options exchange, and INET, the electronic trading platform.Her departure in 2011 was viewed as a blow to the exchange, as it came when Nasdaq was facing an increasingly competitive landscape. She will begin her role on June 12.Mr Jochumsen is responsible for all of the group’s US and European markets businesses, including its high-profile US stock exchange, its eSpeed US Treasuries platform bought last year from interdealer broker BGC Partners, and NLX, a start-up European futures trading venue. Both Ms Friedman and Mr Jochumsen will both report to Mr Greifeld.“I am thrilled to be back at Nasdaq OMX, working for one of the most interesting and innovative companies in financial services,” Ms Friedman said on Monday. “Under Bob’s leadership, Nasdaq OMX has built an extremely effective and diversified business that is delivering record performance.
134;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Asia and Europe feel the pain as US tech rout spreads;;Technology stocks in Europe and Asia felt the pain on Friday morning as a rout in the US spread across both regions.Biotechnology companies on Thursday suffered their biggest one-day share price drop in 30 months as investors dumped some of the US market’s most speculative stocks following an extended bull run.The Nasdaq biotechnology index fell 5.6 per cent, putting the sector at the forefront of a market correction that has rocked shares across the technology landscape in recent weeks.The broader Nasdaq Composite index dropped 3.1 per cent – its largest fall since November 2011 – as shares in the more established tech companies suffered from weakening confidence in valuations of high-growth companies. Amazon, Netflix, Facebook and Google all closed down 4 per cent or more.In Europe on Friday morning, the regional FTSE Eurofirst 300 index opened down 0.9 per cent as technology hardware stocks, particularly chipmakers, joined the sell-off.French defence electronics group Thales fell 4.5 per cent to €45.69, undermined also by a downgrade to neutral from JPMorgan. UK chip designer Arm Holdings, which has been at the vanguard of other recent tech sell-offs, fell 4 per cent to 964p, while German chipmaker Infineon Technologies lost 2.8 per cent to €8.15. ASML Holding, the Dutch maker of chip manufacturing equipment, shed 2.2 per cent to €64.34.In Hong Kong on Friday morning, Tencent shed 6 per cent to HK$48.96 and software maker Kingsoft lost 5.7 per cent to HK$29.15, while newly listed BAIOO Family Interactive tumbled as much as 14 per cent. South Korea’s Naver, which owns chat app Line, dropped 3.1 per cent to Won741,000 while Japanese game developer GungHo slid 4.4 per cent to Y520.“Up until now, we were cutting fat. But now we are cutting muscle,” said Geoffrey Porges, senior biotech analyst at AllianceBernstein. “I have every expectation that this sell-off will last at least for a quarter or two.”The average fall for Asian internet stocks in the past month has now topped 20 per cent.However, analysts at Credit Suisse wrote in a report: “We see the current share price weakness as a short-term correction, rather than the ‘burst of bubble’.”Traders said they expected the US market to rebound on Friday.After hitting a record this month, the S&P 500 has fallen 3.3 per cent, indicating that investors are not getting out of equities but deserting higher-growth companies in favour of more established stocks.Biotech’s multiyear rally had been among the most scrutinised aspects of the US market’s bull run since companies in the sector are experimenting with treatments they hope will become medical breakthroughs. But those experiments often have binary outcomes, leaving investors vulnerable to sudden swings in a company’s fortunes.Biotech stocks soared into record territory in late February, notching up gains of more than 20 per cent for 2014. Thursday’s fall took the year-to-date decline for the sector's index to 2.2 per cent.The sell-off was most severe among small-to-mid-cap biotechs, which had ridden a wave of investor enthusiasm that help fuelled large capital inflows.Pharmacyclics, a clinical-stage drug company working on cancer treatments, lost 9.6 per cent to $93.26. Larger companies in the sector, however, also fell sharply. Gilead Sciences, whose pricing of a breakthrough hepatitis C drug has faced scrutiny from politicians and health organisations, declined 7.3 per cent to $65.48.Investors pointed to aggressive short selling of the iShares exchange traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq Biotech index for exacerbating daily volatility.Michael Kastner, principal at Halyard Asset Management, said the growth potential for biotechs remained promising but the sector had become expensive.“In terms of investment stories, it's good for investors but prices have run up so much that I think we are seeing some aggressive traders pushing it around.”Heavy selling pressure is expected to take a toll on biotechs hoping to raise capital in the coming weeks. Analysts said it was likely that many would be forced to delay offerings.Mr Porges said: “What I am looking for now is mergers and acquisitions to start again in the sector because business development teams at pharmaceutical companies are a lot more excited.”Additional reporting by Josh Noble in Hong Kong and Neil Dennis in London
135;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Nasdaq setbacks test shareholder patience;;Seven months after an embarrassing outage on Nasdaq ground US stock markets to an unprecedented three-hour halt, Robert Greifeld and his executive team stood confidently in front of shareholders at the company’s annual investor day.His management team rattled off an impressive set of achievements for Nasdaq OMX, its parent company, at the event two weeks ago, such as last year’s record revenues and earnings, a 60 per cent climb in its share price and ambitious leaps into new markets and services.The pitch nearly had the effect of wiping away the searing memory of the August meltdown. That was until an unfortunate glitch with PowerPoint forced executives to suspend their presentation and call an early coffee break. The irony was not lost on the audience.For the past two years Nasdaq has struggled to repair a public image that has been damaged by hiccups such as the August breakdown and the botched Facebook IPO in 2012. Now, an investigation by Eric Schneiderman, the New York Attorney General, over the relationship between US stock exchanges and high-frequency trading firms threatens to be its latest hitch.The setbacks have proved a distraction for Mr Greifeld, who is in his 11th year as chief executive. Setting aside the company’s reputational damage he has tried to convince investors that Nasdaq is less reliant on a stock transactions business whose industry volumes are in structural decline.Mr Greifeld has emphasised a realignment of Nasdaq into four units in an effort to demonstrate that almost three-quarters of the company’s $1.9bn annual turnover comes from recurring services.“You could argue they are no longer an exchange because of their revenue mix but some investors see them as a pioneer in electronic markets and therefore they are the most exposed,” says one analyst.Since Mr Schneiderman announced his inquiry on March 18, Nasdaq shares have dropped by almost 9 per cent. Analysts estimate that as much as $190m of Nasdaq’s annual turnover comes from services to high-frequency trading companies that are now in the crosshairs of both regulators and the investing public.While Mr Greifeld dismisses the likelihood of any serious consequences from the scrutiny, the inquiry has served as yet another reason for him to draw attention to his latest endeavours.The exchange’s boldest push has been into the US Treasury market with the purchase of the eSpeed bond trading platform for $750m from BGC Partners last year. But investor concerns that Nasdaq had overpaid knocked its shares at first, and resistance from powerful banks and broker-dealers have since kept Nasdaq from meeting its target of raising eSpeed’s market share.Robert Greifeld has narrowed the group’s focus and in the process developed a reputation as an aggressive cost cutterRead moreA $390m purchase of Thomson Reuters’ investor relations unit and the launch of a London-based interest rate futures platform, NLX, have fared slightly better. But a highly-touted partnership with Amazon to offer back-office services foundered and a new market to attract share trading in companies before they go public remains in its infancy.The mixed results help explain why investors at the annual meeting paid close attention to the company’s comments on its plans to return capital to them. “Shareholders want to see the debt paid down, stock repurchases to resume and more revenue growth,” says Rich Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill. “I think investors also want to see an improvement in their share price multiple because it is trading at the lowest of any of the US exchanges.”Nasdaq’s chief executive still has the support of board members. That includes directors such as Glenn Hutchins, the co-founder of Silver Lake Partners, and Börje Ekholm, the Investor AB chief executive who chairs Nasdaq’s board.He also has the support of some of the company’s largest investors. One says: “The stock is cheap because investors are not focusing on the very strong free cash flow, they are not focusing on the diversification progress and they are overly concerned about management’s dealmaking prospects.”I think investors also want to see an improvement in their share price multiple because it is trading at the lowest of any of the US exchangesEarlier this year the company bid unsuccessfully for the index business of Russell Investments, the asset manager, according to people familiar with the matter. Nasdaq declined to comment.Mr Greifeld insists that Nasdaq is focused on initiatives it has already announced rather than on any new ventures: “We’ve done our acquisitions, and now we have a lot of work to do on them. Right now, it’s about execution.”Mr Greifeld will have to accomplish that without the benefit of several of his former top lieutenants. A string of senior executive departures over the past five years include Adena Friedman, now Carlyle Group’s chief financial officer, and Magnus Böcker, now CEO of Singapore Exchange.Current and former insiders say those and other exits are the result of a working environment where employees are expected “to squeeze blood from rocks”.The executive turnover has further entrenched Mr Greifeld’s position. But as the technology failures over the past two years have shown, such strain can lead to incidents that end up drowning out his message.
136;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2014-03-24T13:17:27Z;Nasdaq OMX restructures markets services business;;Nasdaq OMX is to restructure its key markets services operations into a new unit aimed at developing its cash and derivatives business around the world.The exchange operator will combine its US and European transaction, clearing and settlement services into one business, called Global Market Services.It is intended to develop cash securities and derivatives business for equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities and will be led by Hans-Ole Jochumsen, head of the group’s Nordic business. He will report directly to Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq OMX chief executive.It means the 55-year old Dane will oversee all of the group’s US and European markets businesses, including its high-profile US stock exchange, its eSpeed US Treasuries platform it bought last year from interdealer broker BGC Partners, and NLX, a start-up European futures trading venue.While Nasdaq has in recent years made several purchases to reduce its reliance on equities, a substantial minority of its revenues are still dependent on the fiercely-competitive equities market.“As markets have become increasingly global in asset classes like fixed income, currency and commodities and in the over-the-counter clearing space, we believe it is an opportune time to structure our transaction business in such a way that takes advantage of these opportunities,” said Mr Greifeld.Mr Jochumsen has spearheaded Nasdaq OMX’s push into power trading in Europe’s commodities and energy markets, putting its venues head to head with Deutsche Börse and Intercontinental­Exchange. He will also take on the role that was previously held by Eric Noll, the former senior Nasdaq executive who unexpectedly quit for ConvergEX late last year.The 55-year old Dane said the reshaping had been “very much customer-driven” as investors increasingly traded across asset classes.It comes days after Nasdaq OMX became the first market infrastructure owner to receive approval for its clearing house to operate under tougher new European regulations designed to tighten oversight of derivatives markets.Qualifying clearing houses are subject to tougher risk models and stress testing as well as higher standards on protecting customer assets. In return for accepting higher standards, clearing houses can offer customers greater financial incentives than for uncleared trades, or unqualified clearing houses.Mr Jochumsen suggested that clearing house could take on a larger role within Nasdaq. “The clearing aspect plays an even more important role than a few years ago,” he told FT Trading Room. “We will look at what to do with futures in the US.” “One possibility is to extend the clearing licence in the US with a Derivatives Clearing Organisation (DCO) licence.”
137;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2014-03-23T22:11:07Z;Nasdaq OMX builds up technology sales in Asia;;Nasdaq OMX has agreed to sell its trading systems to the Bangladesh bourse in a sign that the US group is ramping up technology sales to exchanges in Asia as they modernise to boost turnover.The deal brings to 18 the number of exchanges in Asia that use Nasdaq technology, either for equities and derivatives trading or for clearing, or for both.Asia’s exchanges, long used to offering mostly equities trading, are starting to diversify into derivatives as demand grows among local and foreign traders for more sophisticated products.Bursa Malaysia and the Stock Exchange of Thailand have been promoting equities and futures trading to locals, while upgrading systems to attract foreign traders, including so-called high-frequency traders.The Malaysian exchange in December started using a new Nasdaq trading system for equities, fixed income and exchange traded funds. The Singapore and Australian exchanges already use Nasdaq trading systems.Nasdaq’s latest deal is to provide the Dhaka Stock Exchange with a faster trading system “to further increase regional and international investor demand”, the Bangladesh bourse said.Nasdaq OMX is known in the US for operating the third largest stock market after the New York Stock Exchange and a combined BATS and Direct Edge.But in revenue terms it is more of a seller of trading and risk management technology and so-called corporate services, which includes the software that powers web-based corporate earnings presentations.This accounts for 29 per cent of group revenues, compared with 10 per cent for pure stock trading, through fees charged every time a trade is done.Robert Fröjd, Nasdaq’s Singapore-based regional manager for South Asia, Southeast Asia and the Pacific, said the group would now try to sell corporate services to emerging exchanges in Asia where it already had a relationship by providing them with trading systems.“We are looking to see if we can leverage our relationships with exchanges locally and whether they can provide those services to the companies they serve,” he said in an interview with the Financial Times.Last month Nasdaq opened an office in Manila to provide software and IT support for its corporate solutions business globally.Deutsche Börse in January took a 5 per cent stake in Taifex, the Taiwan’s futures exchange, and later said it planned to build an Asian clearing house in Singapore. Atlanta-based IntercontinentalExchange is working on the relaunch of the Singapore Mercantile Exchange, a commodity bourse it bought in November for $150m.
138;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2014-03-23T17:36:06Z;Nasdaq rethinks FinQloud partnership with Amazon;Exchange could sell, close or change deal with online retailer;Nasdaq is re-evaluating a venture based on Amazon’s cloud computing services after a landmark partnership to offer back-office data storage to banks and brokers failed to gain traction with customers.The exchange operator is now restructuring the service, known as FinQloud, following the departure of top executives and others associated with the project, people familiar with Nasdaq’s thinking said.The options for FinQloud now include a sale, shutting it down entirely or – most likely – a renegotiation of the agreement with Amazon. That could see Nasdaq extend its current arrangement or invest further in the unit, one person close to the company said.Nasdaq said in a statement: “We are always looking at growth opportunities with Amazon Web Services and ways to continue to leverage our cloud technology offering for the financial services industry.”Any scaling back of the partnership would represent a blow to both companies. FinQloud enables banks and brokers to use Amazon’s servers to store the sensitive data that regulators require them to keep, at a lower cost than building and maintaining their own data storage facilities.Amazon unveiled the Nasdaq partnership with much fanfare in September 2012 as it sought to market cloud computing services to financial services companies and other businesses.The online retailer wants to turn its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, into an important revenue stream and a pillar of its service business.At the time of the launch, Andy Jassy, the head of AWS and a close ally of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, said it was “a possibility” that real-time stock trading could eventually take place in Amazon’s cloud.Amazon declined to comment on FinQloud, but said AWS had other financial services clients including S&P Capital IQ, Tradeworx, a US financial technology company, Bankinter of Spain, and National Australia Bank. Clients in other industries include Netflix, News Corp, Unilever and LinkedIn.Nasdaq is seeking to expand its services to generate revenues beyond its core business, but some former employees have questioned its ability to offer customised services.“The brokerage services unit wants to provide services to customers but really struggles to get outside the exchange mindset”, said one former Nasdaq insider.The setback for Nasdaq comes as it prepares for an investor day this week where Robert Greifeld, its long-time chief executive, is likely to face questions over a recent investigation launched by Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney-general, into the relationship between high-frequency trading firms and stock exchanges.Key executives have also left the group. Eric Noll, Nasdaq’s former executive vice-president for transaction services, quit unexpectedly last November to become the chief executive of struggling brokerage ConvergEx.
139;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2014-02-09T13:35:58Z;US Biotech IPO fever stokes bubble fears;;The fastest start to a year for US biotech initial public offerings is stoking fears of a bubble amid concerns investors are taking risks on companies at the earliest stage of medical research.Another eight biotech companies raised a combined $502m in US listings last week, setting a weekly record for the sector and continuing a boom that has seen the Nasdaq biotech index rise more than two-thirds in the past year.However, fears of overheating are growing as companies come to market at an early stage of drug development when failures are high – and in one case without the usual restrictions that bar existing owners from making a quick profit on IPOs.The recent listing of Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, which raised $90m in late January and saw its shares surge 207 per cent on its first day of trading, is becoming a focal point for concerns.The Massachusetts-based company has yet to enter clinical trials for the liver disease and cancers it seeks to treat, which typically means it has a less than 5 per cent chance of one day getting a drug to market, according to industry analysts.In its prospectus, the company said that it would not make majority shareholders agree to long-term restrictions on their entire holdings. But in most IPOs, these so-called “lock-ups” are a common feature, designed to align the interests of existing and new investors.“I’ve never seen an IPO in my career where the existing [majority] shareholders . . . were not subject to a lock-up,” said one senior capital markets expert, who added that other companies planning IPOs have since inquired about following Dicerna’s example.Michael Zeidel, a partner at Skadden Arps, said: “A 180-day lock-up is one of those check-the-box provisions for investors.”Shares in Dicerna have dropped 30 per cent from its first-day closing price though it is not clear if its main investors, including the venture capital arm of GlaxoSmithKline, have sold eligible portions of their holdings.The prospectus warned that about 7 per cent of existing shares could be immediately sold and 93 per cent within 90 days. “The sale of a significant number of our shares may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly,” it said.A person close to the transaction, which was underwritten by Jefferies, Baird and Stifel, defended the arrangement: “What makes this situation unique is that insiders ended up buying about 50 per cent of the offering, so there was a real shortage of stock to go around and we figured not having a lock-up would facilitate after-market liquidity.”Investors have been attracted to the biotech sector by a fresh wave of scientific innovation and hopes that some of the latest market entrants can emulate the success of companies such as Biogen Idec, Gilead and Amgen, which have grown into multibillion-dollar drugmakers.May 2013: Biotech stocks have performed well in the US.But while new IPOs have kept coming at a ferocious pace, there are signs that investor appetite may be weakening. Of the 14 companies to list this year, six are currently trading below their issue price. “I think the IPOs are a little stretched,” said Brian Skorney, an analyst at Baird.John Carroll, editor of industry newsletter FierceBiotech, said: “The investment community still has enough appetite for risk to send a select group of these new IPOs over the range, but . . . they’re getting choosy.“Inevitably, you’ll see more high-risk IPOs without a good story to tell come along to see if they can make it through this window, and it will get harder. When the inevitable crunch comes, it will be painful.”The boom has so far been concentrated in the US, with several European companies, including Oxford Immunotec and GW Pharmaceuticals of the UK, crossing the Atlantic to join Nasdaq. UniQure, a Dutch gene therapy specialist, was among last week’s crop of US IPOs, raising $81.9m.However, European markets could be about to catch the biotech bug. Circassia, a UK company developing allergy cures, last week announced London’s biggest IPO in the sector for years.
140;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2014-02-05T13:21:11Z;Acquisitions boost Nasdaq earnings;;Nasdaq OMX struggled to expand its core transaction and listings business in the fourth quarter but recent acquisitions helped carry the exchange operator to record quarterly sales and earnings.The 10 per cent rise in net income to $119m was better than forecast, as Nasdaq faces a complicated landscape with its main rivals in US stock trading merging over the past three months amid erratic volumes and fierce competition for sales from dozens of trading platforms.Acquisitions helped Nasdaq’s revenues jump to $520m in the final three months of last year, up 23 per cent from the same time a year before. Adjusted earnings of 69 cents a share were 5 cents higher.But organic sales growth was just 5 per cent from a year ago, and none of the gains came from the transaction businesses including US and European stock trading as well as some derivatives and clearing units.Revenues from new company listings ticked slightly higher, but came as the New York Stock Exchange scored more technology IPOs for the first time in two decades.Nasdaq also faces concerns that it is failing to gain traction in US Treasury markets, where its eSpeed bond trading platform has struggled to grow its share of volume despite expanding its offerings and upgrading the technology. Transaction revenues on eSpeed fell by $1m to $17m from its previous quarter, and the company did not break out its market share.Robert Greifeld, chief executive, said the unit was a “work in progress”. “We’re doing everything right with eSpeed, it hasn’t shown up yet but it will.”August 22 2013: An afternoon outage wreaked havoc on Nasdaq and raised questions about technology and the marketsNasdaq said it was on track to lower its debt ratio to 2.5 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation by the end of the second quarter of this year.This could allow it to pursue another round of acquisitions after it spent $750m on eSpeed and $390m on a Thomson Reuters corporate services unit last year.Mr Greifeld added that the company was well positioned to gain from a pick-up in global business activity. As rivals at NYSE Euronext, BATS Global Markets and Direct Edge have either been acquired or merged, Mr Greifeld has focused on diversifying Nasdaq’s business away from a heavy reliance on trading volumes.Rich Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, said: “I think they did a decent job integrating all these different units into the business this quarter.”Shares in Nasdaq have outpaced the broader US equity market over the past 12 months, and were 0.5 per cent lower at $37.62 in mid-morning trading.
141;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2014-01-15T18:40:09Z;A SIP that turned bitter;;Five months on from a crippling technical breakdown that brought trading on Nasdaq to a three-hour halt, the piece of market infrastructure that was central to the outage remains in flux.Nasdaq OMX on Tuesday revealed it no longer wanted to administer the technology, a stock market feed that consolidates all quotes and trades for shares listed on its exchange.The events that led the exchange operator to walk away are further evidence of weak oversight and self-interest in the highly-fragmented US market, where 13 exchanges and dozens of alternative trading venues compete for business.Nasdaq’s move has created considerable uncertainty and is hardly a vote of confidence in the US stock market infrastructure.First, some background. The technology in question is a market feed that consolidates all the trade data for Nasdaq-listed stocks from the various places they trade, known as the UTP Securities Information Process, or UTP SIP.It is administered by Nasdaq, but run by a committee of exchanges including the New York Stock Exchange, BATS and Direct Edge and regulators. The committee shares the revenues from selling the quote and trade data to distributors, brokers and investors. It also must unanimously approve all technology changes and share in the costs of such changes. Nice in theory, but it fell apart when stressed.When the SIP suffered an outage in August, it created a situation where certain traders (read: high-frequency trading firms) who pay Nasdaq directly for the data would continue to receive information while everyone else who relies on the SIP struggled on. Such a scenario would violate the principles of fairness for stock trading enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission, thus forcing Nasdaq’s halt.The freeze effectively paused all US stock trading for a whole afternoon, giving global investors a front-row seat into just how fragile the plumbing that underpins the US stock market really is.The mishap marked the first high-profile market structure conflict that Mary Jo White faced in her role as SEC chairman. She responded by summoning exchange leaders to Washington and demanding they work together to ensure such an embarrassing breakdown wouldn’t happen again. As it stands, the SEC has little to show for such calls thus far. It also has yet to find a permanent head for the Division of Trading and Markets, which has sat vacant for more than a year. Once again, it seems market structure has fallen behind a host of more pressing financial concerns facing the chief US market regulator.In the aftermath, Nasdaq proposed a series of ten fixes and a governance change, hoping it would be passed swiftly to ensure the SIP’s resiliency.But rather than move quickly, the SIP committee said it needed to review the Nasdaq proposal. Its message to Nasdaq amounted to something along the lines of: “After all, you are a competitor recommending a series of changes and your intentions must be understood before we move forward.” The committee decided to have a smaller group review the Nasdaq proposal. Pushing it into a bureaucratic jungle appears to have prompted Nasdaq to issue notice on administering the SIP.The exchange operator has a two-year notice period, meaning there is still room for a resolution.The review of Nasdaq’s proposals has been taking place, people familiar with the discussions have said, and there is a still a chance of a resolution. But it’s also true that the subcommittee has its concerns over Nasdaq’s stewardship.In particular, some are concerned that the time-delays, or latencies, on Nasdaq’s UTP SIP are longer than on a similar product administered by NYSE for stocks listed on its exchanges.That could already be creating the millisecond advantages that speed traders can take advantage of, the worry goes. Nasdaq argues its governance change would make it akin to the SIP of its great rival.This stand-off may be of scant regard to investors. In the absence of an upgrade, the industry’s attitude at this point feels like: “Well, at least it hasn’t happened again.”They may have escaped thus far but it cannot be acceptable in the long term. The episode highlights the difficulties of having so many conflicting agendas and a rather hands-off SEC.
142;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2014-01-15T01:03:55Z;Nasdaq to end ‘glitch’ data feed contract;;Nasdaq OMX has terminated its long-term stewardship of a critical piece of US stock market infrastructure that suffered a high-profile glitch in August, crippling share trading for three hours.According to letters obtained by the Financial Times, Nasdaq said that it would not renew a contract that allowed it to administer and distribute data for a stock market feed that consolidates all quotes and trades for shares listed on its exchange.Nasdaq faced sharp criticism from investors when the feed, known as the UTP Securities Information Processor, failed in August and created a situation where traders were no longer receiving fresh stock prices. It also faced regulatory pressure to improve the feed’s resilience.Technology changes to the SIP, which is operated by committee, must be unanimously approved by regulators and a group of US exchanges that share in the revenue generated from selling the market data to brokers and distributors such as Bloomberg. Committee members include representatives from the New York Stock Exchange, CBOE, DirectEdge, BATS and other exchanges.Nasdaq’s decision to terminate its role as administrator came after frustration at what it felt was reluctance by other members of the committee to take up suggested upgrades and proposed changes to the SIP’s governance model. The tensions highlight the fractured nature of US equity markets, where 13 exchanges and 50 alternative trading venues compete for trading volumes.Five months on from the August outage significant improvements have yet to be made to ensure the feed’s resilience.Nasdaq said it requested “rapid, constructive action” from the committee on 10 technical modifications and a new governance model for the SIP at a meeting in early November.“Without these recommendations being implemented it is impossible for us to represent to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the UTP Committee or the public that the SIP technology is world-class in resiliency and performance,” Nasdaq said in the letter dated November 11.The committee instead decided to have a smaller group of officials weigh up the proposals.Under the terms of its contract, Nasdaq must continue to administer and distribute the SIP until late November 2015. The group reviewing Nasdaq’s proposals has continued to meet and its findings are expected to come up at the next meeting of the SIP committee in Florida next month. It could elect to negotiate a new agreement with Nasdaq or open the administration of the SIP to bidders, people familiar with its thinking said.NYSE, which is now a unit of IntercontinentalExchange, administers and distributes stock data for two feeds – also operated by a committee – that consolidate stock trading data on its exchanges.Nasdaq, NYSE and CBOE declined to comment.
143;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-12-31T15:19:32Z;Turkey economy chief blames corruption probe for market fall;;"The minister in charge of Turkey’s economy has labelled the corruption probe that has shaken the country a “mini coup”, blaming it for a $49bn dive in the Turkish equity market on a day that the national stock exchange announced a long-awaited tie-up with Nasdaq OMX.Ali Babacan, deputy prime minister responsible for the economy, said the investigation, which has targeted a number of figures close to the government, had prompted the fall in the market capitalisation of publicly listed Turkish companies to $221bn over the past two weeks.“We created this political and economic stability with our own strength,” said Mr Babacan, one of the government’s most internationally respected figures. “We will not just allow someone to come and take it away.”Ruling party officials say the probe is a vendetta by the movement led by Fethullah Gulen, a self-exiled Islamic preacher with a large following in the police and prosecution service.But some analysts and investors say they are deeply concerned by the response of the government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, prime minister, as it has sought to increase control of the legal authorities and has lashed out at alleged international conspiracies. With a low savings rate and a high current account deficit, the Turkish economy is dependent on large inflows of foreign funds.In a possible indication of the further spillover of the crisis into the corporate sector, shares in Koza Altin, a gold mining group whose owners are close to the Gulen movement, fell 7 per cent on Tuesday when the company said a permit to operate in the province of Izmir had been revoked even though it had provided “all necessary documentation”.The leading index on the Borsa Istanbul edged down by 1 per cent during mid-afternoon trading and the Turkish lira weakened to TL2.14 to the dollar after both had recovered the previous day. During 2013, the exchange has suffered from a combination of political instability and the prospect of US Federal Reserve tapering; in recent days it has fallen to about 30 per cent below its peak in dollar terms.The exchange, which has in effect been taken under government control, has big ambitions to expand, with Ibrahim Turhan, chairman and chief executive, calling for a significant increase in Turkish companies listing as well as a push to become a regional hub.Under the deal with Nasdaq, which is worth about $100m, Borsa Istanbul will use Nasdaq technology to reduce trading bottlenecks in pursuit of such aims, while Nasdaq will take a 5 per cent stake in the exchange, with an option to increase that to 7 per cent.Speaking of the deal, which has been under discussion for months, Lars Ottersgard, Nasdaq’s head of market technology, described Turkey as a “very transparent, trustworthy growth market for international investors.”But some business figures and investors say they are concerned about the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law after the government reaction to the probe, which has involved the transfer of hundreds of police officers, moves to impose new controls on investigators and warnings to individual prosecutors and a top judicial and prosecutorial council.In the fifth resignation from the ranks of ruling party MPs since the scandal exploded on December 17, Hasan Hami Yildirim, a legislator from the province of Burdur, said such pressure was unacceptable. “This cannot be considered as legitimate under the rule of law,” he added. “An investigation is being hampered before the whole world’s eyes.”"
144;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-12-10T17:38:50Z;Incentives boost growth at Nasdaq OMX’s new London venue;;The new London derivatives trading venue of Nasdaq OMX has dramatically increased its trading volumes in recent weeks, helped by an incentive scheme that pays participants up to $1.5m for market share.NLX, which has been in operation for six months, has struggled to attract much volume to its flagship products but has seen a leap in trading since mid-November.More than half a million lots of sterling and euro-denominated interest rate contracts were traded in the final week of November, equivalent to about a fifth of the trading that took place on the Liffe, the market leader.However, trading has been lumpy with large blocks frequently accounting for the majority of trades. Open interest also remains low, with only 21,000 contracts on its 3-month euribor interest rate contract that have not been closed, liquidated or delivered, according to Bloomberg data.Its parent, Nasdaq OMX, sunk just over $50m into the venue, including regulatory capital requirements, to compete in listed fixed income trading with Deutsche Börse’s Eurex and Liffe, the London derivatives exchange now owned by IntercontinentalExchange.The move has in part been due to an incentive scheme brought in at its debut that shares out $300,000 on a monthly basis between market participants if they take a market share of up to 2 per cent.A sliding scale tops out with participants sharing up $1.5m between them for a market share greater than 5 per cent, according to two people familiar with the scheme.Many venues and exchanges offer incentive schemes to encourage participation but they are often based on market making – NLX’s scheme is based on market share.Charlotte Crosswell, chief executive, said NLX had doubled the amount of active market participants on the platform in October and November to 25.“We will continue to evolve. People are willing to support us. The mindset has changed in the listed world. It has allowed us to broaden the participant base,” she said.Those ranks are likely to be swelled in coming weeks when Trading Technologies, one of the world’s largest derivatives trading software providers, connects to NLX.The technology group counts as its customers 19 of the top 20 futures commission merchants in the US, including Goldman Sachs, UBS and Newedge.NLX, which also trades contracts on German government debt, is in advanced discussions with customers about developing a listed futures contract that mimics the economic properties of a swaps contract.The products, known as swap futures, are being touted as a way for investors and brokers to comply with mandatory clearing of derivatives trades under new global legislation but without incurring extra cost.Other venues, such as Deutsche Börse and US duo CME Group and Eris Exchange, are also planning to launch swap futures.www.ft.com/tradingroom
145;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-11-26T19:23:20Z;Noll’s Nasdaq departure shocks insiders;;"Welcome to the rough and tumble world of working at Nasdaq OMX. For the second time in three years a highly regarded executive at the US exchanges operator has quit unexpectedly.On Monday, Eric Noll, who led transaction services for Nasdaq’s US and UK businesses for the past four years, left to become chief executive at brokerage ConvergEx.His move has shocked insiders and caught many industry watchers off-guard. He had emerged as the top internal candidate to succeed Robert Greifeld, whose decade-long tenure makes him one of the industry’s longest-serving chief executives.It comes just two years after Adena Friedman, chief financial officer and Nasdaq’s chief strategist, left to take on the same role at the Carlyle Group.Tom Wittman, another senior vice-president and head of Nasdaq’s Philadelphia exchange options trading business, is a likely replacement for Mr Noll, some people have said.Mr Noll spearheaded two of Nasdaq’s main initiatives this year; a push into the fixed-income market with the $750m purchase of eSpeed and the launch of fixed-income derivatives venue NLX in London.He had also been the main defence to occasional criticism over the depth of management below Mr Greifeld. Throughout, he remained an active voice in contentious equity market structure debates and helped to relieve pressure on Mr Greifeld as Nasdaq dealt with the fallout from recent technology problems – the Facebook IPO and the August trading halt – that have brought scrutiny over its US equities.After building a steady reputation across the industry, for his expertise in equity markets and leading the diversification push, why depart now?Mr Noll, who had been executive vice-president since 2009, was clear enough. “I wanted to be a CEO,” he said in an interview.His departure to ConvergEx will take him out of the limelight that comes with working for the second-largest US stock exchange operator. ConvergEx is privately controlled by buyout group GTCR and Bank of New York Mellon.However, the spotlight will not be too far away as he will have to deal with settlement talks between ConvergEx and US authorities who are pressing ahead with civil and criminal charges against the broker for allegedly overcharging clients.Some former and current employees have suggested that the move may have been driven by the difficulties of working in Nasdaq’s corporate culture. Some former executives have said that Mr Greifeld’s style of management is to keep the company’s top brass in constant competition, allowing him to “rule the roost”.Turnover of top executives has been high in recent years. Ms Friedman had risen through the ranks over an 18-year period before her unexpected departure. Others such as Chris Concannon, who held Mr Noll’s position before leaving for high-frequency trading firm Virtu in 2009, and David Warren who was chief financial officer before Ms Friedman, also departed unexpectedly. Mr Warren has since become the chief financial officer at the London Stock Exchange.But was Mr Noll ever in line for the top job? Others have suggested that Mr Noll may have lacked the management abilities to take over from Mr Greifeld, and as Nasdaq’s board weighs its options his name may have slipped down the list. For Mr Noll, the ConvergEx job is an opportunity to disprove that.Another suggestion is that the board is more minded to look externally for a successor to Mr Greifeld, who once again finds himself without a leading voice by his side.He has managed to steer Nasdaq for the past decade, and has the support of his board and a contract to 2017. And in spite of recent problems, he can point to a healthy share performance this year."
146;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-11-25T20:52:35Z;Top Nasdaq executive quits for ConvergEx;;Eric Noll, an executive at Nasdaq OMX who had been tipped as a frontrunner to one day replace Robert Greifeld, has unexpectedly quit the exchange operator to become chief executive of brokerage firm ConvergEx.Nasdaq said on Monday the move was effective immediately and it would seek a replacement for Mr Noll, who oversaw its trading businesses in the US and western Europe, by the end of March 2014.Mr Noll said in a statement that he welcomed the opportunity to lead privately-held ConvergEx, which provides transaction services to pension funds and institutional investors but is considered to be much less influential and smaller than Nasdaq.“One of my top priorities will be to demonstrate to our customers that we are a company that stands for strong values, transparency and, above all, putting customers’ interests first,” he said.In October, the FT reported that the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission were preparing to bring civil and criminal charges against ConvergEx for allegedly overcharging its clients.People familiar with the situation said Mr Noll’s departure was not linked to recent systems problems at Nasdaq that have put its technological shortcomings under the spotlight .Mr Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq, said: “We benefited greatly from Eric’s leadership and judgment in driving the diversification of the trading products and solutions we offer customers today.”Since he joined Nasdaq in 2009 from Susquehanna Investment Group, Mr Noll has led its transaction services unit where he oversaw its stock, options, exchange-traded products, futures and fixed-income trading venues.Mr Noll spearheaded Nasdaq’s efforts in diversifying away from a reliance on equities and was central to its $750m purchase of the eSpeed bond trading platform from interdealer broker BGC Partners in April. He also oversaw t he launch of Nasdaq NLX, a new derivatives platform for trading interest rate products in May.Rich Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, said: “Eric was an outstanding performer and well respected in the industry.”According to people familiar with Nasdaq’s thinking, Mr Greifeld still enjoys the support of the board despite several high-profile glitches since last May when it bungled the Facebook initial public offering, which led to a messy and delayed start to trading for the social networking site’s shares.In August, US equity markets were crippled by a problem with a data feed administered by Nasdaq that caused stock trading to halt for more than three hours.The problems with its stock business have come at a difficult time across the industry where share trading volumes have plunged since 2009.The exchange’s board has been weighing a variety of strategic options since its main competitor NYSE Euronext, operator of the New York Stock Exchange, was acquired by IntercontinentalExchange in a deal that closed this month. Its smaller rivals in the US equities business, BATS Global Markets and DirectEdge, are also in the process of merging.Mr Noll’s departure was first reported by Fox Business Network.Nasdaq shares fell 0.8 per cent to $39.30 but are trading near their highest levels since 2008, having climbed 57 per cent so far this year.Additional reporting by Kara Scannell
147;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-11-21T14:19:55Z;US banks and exchanges discuss limit to ‘dark pool’ trading;;US exchanges and banks are discussing a new proposal to limit trading in controversial off-exchange venues such as “dark pools” as part of an effort to reduce tensions over the control of share trading.The proposal would require brokers to offer public markets their best available price to buy or sell a stock before they could trade that price at off-exchange venues, people familiar with the talks said.These people added the idea had yet to gain broad support among exchanges, banks or the Securities and Exchange Commission, which would have to approve any such rule, but that it would be brought up as an alternative to a proposal put forward earlier this year by exchanges that failed to gain traction.So-called dark pools– off-exchange facilities that allow trading of large blocks of shares, with prices posted publicly only after trades are done – are perceived by many as offering an advantage over exchanges.Tensions between exchanges and brokers have escalated in recent years as trading outside public markets has crept up to record levels and put further strains on the once-dominant share trading institutions such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.Rosenblatt Securities estimates that more than 37 per cent of all US stock trades are now executed at off-exchange venues run by brokers. Exchanges and some large investors argue that the increased trading away from the public markets has diminished the value of publicly quoted prices.Andy Brooks, head of US equity trading at T Rowe Price, said: “We have long advocated for trying to experiment with pilot programmes to facilitate the price discovery process and increase transparency. The fact that the off-exchange trading volumes are approaching 40 per cent seems somewhat dysfunctional to us.” Mr Brooks declined to comment on the proposal.June 2013: Regulators look to tighten regulation around dark pools. Seth Merrin, chief executive of Liquidnet, the world’s largest dark pool operator, tells FT Trading Room’s Philip Stafford that better rules could make dark pools work as originally envisaged.People familiar with the proposal said that it was expected to be on the agenda at a private meeting early next month with high level officials from exchanges, regulatory agencies, large institutional investors and brokers.The potential rule was discussed at a closed-door meeting at Citigroup in October where exchange executives, regulatory officials and brokers were present, according to one person. Citi declined to comment.The December discussion will be hosted by Investment Company Institute, an influential trade body for large institutional investors, which has been trying to build co-operation among the parties to address the myriad of market structure disputes within the securities industry. ICI declined to comment.“The ICI meetings are part of an effort to have a constructive market structure debate between the industry outside of the public purview,” a person familiar with them said. This person doubted the new proposal would gain much traction: “The notion of broadcasting any indication of trading is not likely to be welcome by the buyside.”Under existing regulations, brokers can trade at the best price but are free to do so where they choose and do not have to display their prices until after the trade is executed away from the public markets.Large institutional investors are split on whether the off-exchange trading has harmed the quality of the US market, with some echoing regulators’ view that it has brought more competition and lowered trading costs.
148;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-11-06T09:22:41Z;Trading Technologies ends eSpeed dispute;;Trading Technologies, the world’s largest technology provider for futures trading, is to connect its customers to eSpeed, the US electronic bond trading platform, in a move that brings an end a decade-long dispute between the two parties.The deal, announced on Wednesday, comes only four months after eSpeed was bought by Nasdaq OMX from BGC Partners, the interdealer broker.It ends the feud between Chicago-based TT and eSpeed over a technology patent dispute more than six years ago. Trading Technologies originally won the suit, over the use of front-end user interface screens in 2007 and again prevailed on appeal in 2010. The two did not resume their business relationship.Mike Burns, executive vice-president of business development at TT, said discussions between eSpeed and Trading Technologies “really kicked into high gear” after Nasdaq acquired eSpeed for $1.2bn earlier this year.Nasdaq has bet on both an increase in electronic trading in fixed-income markets and on a pick-up in Treasury transactions once the Federal Reserve ends its quantitative easing policy of purchasing bonds and suppressing interest rates.Customers, including banks and trading groups focused on fixed income, had expressed their desire for a connection to eSpeed because it is one of the most liquid venues for cash Treasuries trading, said Mr Burns. Trading Technologies counts among its customers 19 of the 20 top futures commission merchants.For Nasdaq, the move would help it expand its customer base beyond the Wall Street dealers that dominate the Treasury market and take on ICAP’s BrokerTec platform.Eric Noll, executive vice-president of transaction services at Nasdaq OMX. “Our deep relationship with Trading Technologies will significantly expand the opportunity set for the fixed income community across the globe.”The connection to eSpeed will take place in the first quarter next year and Mr Burns said it would “round out” its fixed income offering, which includes connections to BrokerTec and GovEx, by linking customers to the liquidity of eSpeed’s US Treasuries platform.Upon the launch of connectivity early next year, Nasdaq will become the 39th market available through Trading Technologies. Another suit that is still going on between TT and BGC has no relation to the current version of eSpeed and is related to liabilities and technologies that remained with BCG, according to Trading Technologies.
149;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-10-23T12:08:18Z;Nasdaq profits boosted by acquisitions;;Nasdaq said net sales and profits were stronger than expected in its third-quarter, as the exchange operator’s results were lifted by the integration of the corporate services unit from Thomson Reuters and a bond-trading platform from BGC Partners.Revenues increased to $506m, up 22.8 per cent on the same three-month period to September 30 a year ago. Stripping out the gains from the acquisitions, the company said organic sales growth was 4 per cent. Net profit jumped almost 27 per cent to $113m, with earnings of 66 cents a share 14 cents better than a year ago.The better than expected results came even as the exchange faced scrutiny in the quarter following a problem with a data feed it administers that knocked out trading in nearly all US stocks for three hours on August 22. Nasdaq also recently lost out to rival NYSE Euronext for the Twitter initial public offering.Consensus forecasts from analysts had estimated sales of $503m and earnings of 62 cents per share for the period, which had seen weaker equity trading volumes and volatility for long portions of the summer months.Revenues from equity trading fell slightly in the quarter, while its US listings business was flat. Operating costs rose to $304m from $231m a year ago, primarily due to a pick-up in compensation and benefits payments.The quarterly results provided the first full look at Nasdaq’s recent acquisitions, which were made as the company had said it was looking to balance its equity trading business with other units.In fixed-income trading, the company reported sales of $18m from eSpeed, which it acquired for $750m. “Higher industry-wide volumes for electronically-traded, on-the-run US Treasury securities were offset by somewhat lower market share compared to the prior period, a function of market share changes before Nasdaq OMX’s ownership,” it said.The moves for eSpeed and the Thomson Reuters unit, which boosted sales in its technology services unit, were made as a larger deal has eluded Nasdaq.Its main rival, NYSE Euronext, is closing its takeover by IntercontinentalExchange early next month, while BATS Global Markets and Direct Edge announced plans to tie up in August in a deal that would see the combined entity have a greater share of US equity trading than Nasdaq.Shares in Nasdaq have climbed 34.4 per cent from the start of the year, but were down slightly in the quarter.
150;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-10-06T17:47:12Z;Twitter: Nasdaq or NYSE?;If Nasdaq wins it will show the Facebook fiasco is in the past;"Location is everything, as property brokers never tire of reminding. But while the exchange that Twitter chooses for its $1bn share float will mean something to Nasdaq and NYSE, it will mean less to the company, and little to investors.The offering will be the biggest, in size and in hype, for an internet company since Facebook’s launch on Nasdaq. Technical difficulties made a hash (not to say hashtag) of the first day of trading. Barring another catastrophically embarrassing stumble, investors will not care about the venue. After a company lists and opens, trading can occur on any exchange, dark pool or back alley, and the price will find its level.For the company though, there is the cost. Nasdaq’s listing fees are less than those charged by NYSE, but this matters more for small start-ups than for Twitter, which had $254m of revenue in the first half of 2013. Fees are non-negotiable, but exchanges can woo companies with other services. There is inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 index, which was said to be part of Facebook’s thinking. And there is access to other exchange members that could be partners or clients.Nasdaq has traditionally been linked with tech and NYSE with industrials, but that is changing. This year, 15 tech companies have listed on Nasdaq, 14 on NYSE. That raises the stakes for Nasdaq to win Twitter. Listing services, for instance, make up about 13 per cent of both its revenue and operating profit; market services, which include equity and derivatives trading, are more than 40 per cent of each. An exchange will trade a bit more of its own listings. Still the financial impact of losing one of them is not that great. But it would be more evidence of Nasdaq losing its grip on its core client base, and a coup for NYSE. The best way for Nasdaq to put the Facebook fiasco in the past is a successful Twitter listing – if only Twitter will play along.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
151;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-10-04T17:39:16Z;US exchanges fight for Twitter’s listing;;Twitter has yet to disclose where it will list shares in its $1bn initial public offering, leaving open the question of whether it will choose the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq for the high-profile flotation.While fees generated from an individual listing are not crucial for either exchange, the reputational implications of Twitter’s decision carries important weight, especially as Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce group, has chosen New York over Hong Kong for its forthcoming $60bn-plus public offering.People familiar with Twitter’s plans have said that it is leaning towards listing with NYSE. But a host of Nasdaq executives, including chief executive Robert Greifeld, were seen by reporters heading into Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters on Friday as the exchange operator attempted to win its business.Both NYSE and Nasdaq declined to comment.The microblogging site’s market debut is the most anticipated technology IPO since Facebook’s, which suffered from technical glitches on Nasdaq that marred its opening day of trading.The fallout from the Facebook offering brought negative attention on Nasdaq, which moved to settle with regulators and compensate brokers, who said that they suffered large losses owing to problems on its exchange that day.“NYSE’s pitch is that they are more reliable, which is code for we won’t let what happened at Nasdaq with Facebook happen to you,” said Patrick Healy, chief executive of Issuer Advisory Group.He said: “Nasdaq’s counter is what happened at Facebook was a once in a lifetime event and could never happen again. Those are really the duelling arguments here.”Twitter’s decision comes as Nasdaq faces greater competition from NYSE for technology listings.Through the first dotcom boom, Nasdaq was the dominant venue for most technology and internet listings but NYSE has closed that gap in recent years, gaining the business of LinkedIn, Yelp and Pandora. So far this year, the two exchanges are nearly even with 15 tech or internet companies listing on Nasdaq versus 14 on the NYSE, according to data from Dealogic.
152;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-09-20T17:12:36Z;Twitter IPO would quieten Nasdaq critics;;Some 16 months ago Robert Greifeld, chief of Nasdaq OMX, stood shivering in a grey T-shirt behind Mark Zuckerberg as the Facebook founder rang the opening trading bell from a stage in northern California.Mr Greifeld donned the T-shirt to match those worn by hundreds of the social network’s employees at the company’s stock market debut. But in the chilly May morning air many opted for warmer clothing, leaving Mr Greifeld awkwardly attired.Nasdaq’s public image has been equally uncomfortable since. Minutes later a technical glitch disrupted the start of trading in Facebook shares, kicking off a series of embarrassments that has undermined the exchange’s status as a technology-savvy venue and raised questions over how long Mr Greifeld’s 10-year tenure will be extended.Mr Greifeld now has an opportunity to quieten critics if he can convince Twitter to bring its IPO to Nasdaq.Doing so “would certainly help heal the exchange’s brand meaningfully after the recent problems,” says Rich Repetto, principal at Sandler O’Neill. “It would silence some of the doubters who believe the mishaps are having a material impact on the company.”Twitter has yet to indicate which US exchange it will use, with Nasdaq vying with its great rival, the New York Stock Exchange, for the business. Nasdaq declined to comment.Mr Greifeld’s pitch will depend on measures Nasdaq has taken to ensure what happened with the Facebook IPO will not be repeated. Facebook’s debut was marred by Nasdaq’s inability to absorb the overwhelming volumes of orders, and then failed to calculate an opening price for the stock.In subsequent months, Nasdaq spent countless hours repairing its relationship with Facebook executives and paid $10m to settle with US regulators over its poor systems and decision-making that day. Although not legally liable, it also sought to make amends by offering £62m to a collection of Wall Street brokers who claimed they suffered massive losses in the confusion.Internally it made technical changes to the way it runs IPO auctions and moved Anna Ewing, chief information officer at the time, to a new role.One glitch may have been shrugged off but critics of the company have been out in force over the summer. First, a federal indictment in New York revealed that a Russian hacker had gained access for two years to its servers.Then the exchange suffered a three-hour outage in August. The problem was traced to the exchange’s inability to cope with a Nasdaq-administered industry data feed that distributes all quotes and prices for stocks.At the same time NYSE has moved aggressively to lure tech listings. According to Dealogic, it has had the same number of technology IPOs on its exchange so far this year, raising the possibility that it could have a higher share of tech listings for the first time in nearly two decades.“Obviously Twitter is a brand name IPO and it is one that we want to be a part of. I certainly don’t know if they’ve made a decision,” says Scott Cutler, head of NYSE’s listings business.The problems at Nasdaq have once more reignited gossip about Mr Greifeld’s future. In the past he has discussed taking a dual role as chairman, with many interpreting it as a prelude to him taking a more senior role. Eric Noll, the group’s executive vice-president of transaction services in the US and a key player in the group’s $750m April purchase of eSpeed, has been mentioned as a possible successor.In spite of Nasdaq’s recent missteps and irrespective of Twitter’s forthcoming decision, the board has continued to back Mr Greifeld. He was rewarded with the largest compensation package among US exchange heads in 2012.“If you look at the developments of Nasdaq over a longer period of time, I think the company is in a stronger and better position than we have been,” a person familiar with the thinking of Nasdaq’s board says. “I guess it is natural you get those speculations [over his future with the company] but the reality is that he has done a good job,” the person added.Investors have sent Nasdaq shares up by more than 410 per cent since Mr Greifeld took control of the company in May 2003, outpacing a 211 per cent rise in NYSE’s shares and a 83 per cent increase in the S & P 500 in that time.But with Twitter’s decision expected in the coming weeks, Mr Greifeld is hoping not to once again be left out in the cold.
153;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-09-12T20:08:00Z;SEC calls for plan to beat exchange failures;;The top US securities regulator has called on leading stock and options exchanges to identify specific steps that can be taken to improve the structural foundation of the US market following high-profile outages.Mary Jo White, Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, has asked the heads of exchange groups including NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX to provide assessments on the robustness and resilience of US market infrastructure.“I stressed the need for all market participants to work collaboratively – together and with the commission – to strengthen critical market infrastructure and improve its resilience when technology falls short,” Ms White said in a statement after the closed-door session on Thursday.The meeting was held in response to a three-hour trading outage on the Nasdaq last month, which halted trading in some of the country’s largest companies and raised concerns about the potential fragility of market systems.Nasdaq blamed the outage on problems with a data feed known as the Securities Information Processor, or SIP, which it administers on behalf of all exchanges and consolidates stock quotes and prices.That outage came days after Goldman Sachs suffered an embarrassing computer glitch that saw its systems inadvertently accumulate thousands of options contracts in minutes, putting exchanges in a tricky position of having to determine which trades to cancel.Both incidents shed light on the speed and complexity of the US equity market, where companies rely on sophisticated technology to trade at millisecond speeds across 13 exchanges and dozens of alternative trading venues.William Brodsky, executive chairman of the CBOE, said the discussions focused on how the exchange industry adapts to challenges that have arisen with the technological transformation of the US equity and options markets over the past two decades. He said: “We were given a bunch of tasks to do and given a 60-day timeframe to get back with a bunch of deliverables.”The SEC asked those attending to take on tasks that included setting up testing and disclosure standards aimed at establishing a resilient system for the SIP and considering changes in how regulatory trading halts are administered.The exchanges should also review rules relating to how trades are cancelled following glitches such as those suffered by Goldman and how trading is reopened after an outage, the SEC said.The exchange and trading industry has pushed back on proposals this year by the SEC to formalise compliance programmes under a regulation known as Reg SCI, which was designed to maintain the integrity of important trading infrastructure.Robert Greifeld, chief executive at Nasdaq, said Thursday’s meeting was an “important and constructive step forward to address the soundness and reliability of the critical infrastructure underpinning the US capital markets”.
154;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-09-10T11:06:38Z;Nasdaq OMX agrees Stuttgart tech deal;;Nasdaq OMX, the transatlantic exchanges group, has agreed a deal to license its technology to Börse Stuttgart, Germany’s second-largest stock exchange.The operator will provide its Genium Inet platform for trading all of Borse Stuttgart’s services, products and asset classes. It will commence in 2015, the groups said in a joint statement.Lars Ottersgard, senior vice-president of market technology at Nasdaq OMX, said it would “support Börse Stuttgart’s focus of bringing private investors to the same level as institutional investors”. Börse Stuttgart is Europe’s ninth-largest exchange by market volume.The deal comes weeks after a three-hour shutdown on Nasdaq’s US market, which has raised questions about its technology.Nasdaq supplies technology to many exchanges worldwide and in July agreed a deal with Borsa Istanbul, the exchange operator in Turkey, to improve its technology as part of an ambitious long-term goal of transforming Turkish capital markets.Nasdaq’s technology is recognised by the industry as one of the most advanced for trading in the world and the company supplies trading tools to other exchanges around the world. Nevertheless, it was badly caught out by the outage and a glitch when Facebook floated on the market.Stuttgart’s exchange is one of seven regional stock exchanges regulated in Germany, although the bulk of trading in German shares are done over the Frankfurt Xetra exchange or alternative pan-European platforms such as Chi-X.
155;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-08-29T18:21:51Z;Nasdaq blames software flaw for trading outage;;Nasdaq OMX has blamed a software flaw and more than 26 times the normal amount of data coming from rival NYSE Euronext in “a confluence of unprecedented events” that caused the technical glitch behind the longest trading halt in Nasdaq’s history.The exchange said on Thursday that it planned to finish a thorough forensic analysis of the glitch in the next 30 days as it sought to provide investors and other market participants with more details on last week’s three-and-a-half hour outage.It also unveiled plans to use Twitter and other social media to distribute critical exchange information in a wide-ranging plan to improve its communication with the market.US authorities are examining the events of last week, which Nasdaq has traced back to the failure at a data processor known as the Securities Information Processor. An industry initiative operated by Nasdaq, the SIP consolidates all the data from the 13 exchanges and oversees the National Best Bid and Offer system, which rewards traders who register quotes closest to the best price.Some market participants, like banks and high-frequency traders, were able to bypass the problem and take information from other sources, but others were disadvantaged, forcing Nasdaq to call a halt to trading.Nasdaq released further details of the breakdown, saying that, in testing, the system was capable of handling around 500,000 messages per second containing trades and quotes.However, in practice, Nasdaq said repeated attempts to connect to the SIP by NYSE Arca, a rival electronic trading platform, and streams of erroneous quotes from its rival eroded the system’s capacity in a manner similar to a distributed denial of service attack.Whereas the SIP had a capacity of 10,000 messages per data port, per second, it was overwhelmed by up to more than 26,000 messages per port, per second.That showed up a flaw in the software code that prevented the start of a back-up system, Nasdaq said.However, Bob Greifeld, chief executive, did not blame NYSE and said the two exchanges were working on a joint analysis of the problems. “We are responsible, we regret them, and intend to take all steps necessary to address them to enhance stability and functionality of markets,” he said.“Other issues contributing to the halt are more endemic to technology issues across today’s complex markets and will require a broader industry-wide effort to resolve,” the exchange added.The initiatives Nasdaq unveiled included an open conference line for executives of listed companies, greater use of social media for updates and a key contact for every issuer, responsible for providing daily market information and timely trading analysis, it added.www.ft.com/tradingroom
156;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
157;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-08-25T21:48:29Z;Nasdaq: reputation risk;Concern after high-profile snafu;"Nasdaq OMX boss Robert Greifeld said on Friday that his company’s systems work 99.99 per cent of the time. But when they do not, it is a huge deal. Last week’s outage raised concerns about growing market complexity – and whether Mr Greifeld should be sacked.Nasdaq’s own investors are not too worried. When the market reopened, the exchange’s shares ended down just 3 per cent. This makes sense in as much as the direct financial impact of losing half of day of trading is minuscule. The real damage is reputational. This is not the exchange’s first big stumble. Bungling Facebook’s listing led to a regulatory fine and Nasdaq agreed to pay $62m to brokers; so far, no comparable hit is expected this time. Still, a humiliated Nasdaq could lose listings, which make up 13 per cent of operating profit.All this comes at a time when competition may increase – BATS Global Markets and Direct Edge are in talks over a merger that would unseat Nasdaq as the second-largest US share trading venue. Nasdaq’s latest problem also happened after glitches elsewhere in recent weeks, which should spur renewed efforts on reliability. That is needed, but would cost Nasdaq in human and financial resources.Under Mr Greifeld, Nasdaq has had successes. But he also has these high-profile snafus on his watch. And he proved to be a poor communicator in an industry in which failures are public and reputation is crucial. The exchange remained tight-lipped toward the public during the outage. (The Nasdaq chief told Bloomberg Television they were busy fixing things and communicated to regulators and within the industry.) The pace of change in global markets may make these occasional system failures inevitable. If that is the case, though, a key test of exchange leaders will be their ability to reassure markets when blackouts happen.

158;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-08-23T18:05:10Z;Nasdaq halt puts pressure on Greifeld;;"Nasdaq OMX faced a barrage of criticism on Friday as the operator of the second-largest US stock exchange defended its handling of the longest technical trading outage in its 40-year history.The three-hour disruption a day earlier spooked US investors and prevented trading in household names such as Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft.The outage threatens to be a serious blow to the exchange’s prestige. Pioneering reliable technology has been a central part of its identity since its formation in 1971. However, the glitch comes just over a year after technology failures marred the debut of Facebook, one of the US’s largest and most eagerly awaited listings, and has put the spotlight on both Nasdaq and Robert Greifeld, the industry’s highest-paid chief executive.Mr Greifeld described himself as “deeply disappointed with what happened yesterday” but suggested the problem lay in the highly fragmented US equity market in which 13 exchanges and more than 50 trading venues compete for business.He said: “Back when the market was a monopoly, starting it up was like starting a car. Now, in a fragmented landscape, it’s like starting a jet engine.”The problem, as Mr Greifeld acknowledged, was a failure at a little-known but critical part of the US equity market, known as the Securities Information Processor. This centralised hub consolidates all the data from the 13 exchanges and oversees the National Best Bid and Offer system, which rewards traders who register quotes closest to the best price. The SIP was agreed on by all leading market exchanges and authorities, but there is only one central hub – and it is operated by Nasdaq. While it took 30 minutes to resolve the IT issue, the rest of the time was devoted to preparing the market for resumption of trading.Mr Greifeld said the exchange bore no liability for the outage, but market participants have begun to question the management’s handling of Nasdaq’s operating systems.One person familiar with the company’s leadership reckoned it was time for a change of management. The person said: “Time after time there is a problem at Nasdaq; they need new leaders. Bob has been there for 10 years and has been a great cost-cutter, but the core focus has not been on investing in the technology. He’s been looking for a high event to leave on, but the May [Facebook] events from last year hampered that and this makes it worse.”Mr Greifeld said the closure was partly for the benefit of retail investors who didn’t have the same access to information as professional traders.Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, said Nasdaq failed to see the bigger picture as it dealt with the breakdown.“They have been strong in saying that they didn’t need to speak to media, but their role as the second-largest marketplace in the US is to keep retail investors informed,” he said. “If you let three hours go by, it’s going to impact retail investors and if there are negative flows into equity funds, it’s going to impact everyone.”Mr Greifeld said: “We stand by our record over the long period of time. And we are definitely going through good times at Nasdaq OMX. Our stock is up 20 per cent for the year. We have more good things going on now than at any other time in my tenure.”www.ft.com/tradingroom"
159;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-08-23T17:52:51Z;Nasdaq glitch underscores push for harmonised rules;Markets have tackled outages with moderate effectiveness;"It has not been a good week to be a computer.First, a computer error at Everbright Securities was blamed for a $3.8bn flood of orders on the Shanghai market. Then Goldman Sachs unleashed a rogue algorithm that caused chaos through the options market. And the coup de grâce came when a technical glitch caused Nasdaq to shut for more than three hours.Little wonder that one commentator on public radio on Friday was pining for the days when the stock markets were simple enough to be run by “schoolboys with chalk boards”.Glitches – that ubiquitous word – bring out the Luddites and the Nasdaq “flash freeze” comes with all the usual fake fulminations about exchange incompetence and executives keeping the trading public in the dark.The real story, it appears, is that Nasdaq quickly identified what went wrong, did the right thing by halting trading when its price data system threatened to disadvantage some users and worked diligently to prepare for an orderly restart to trading. No one got hurt.It is tempting to weave all these incidents – and the Knight Capital blow-up, the Facebook flotation debacle and the flash crash before them – into a single narrative of computers gone wild.Certainly, financial markets rely more heavily on technology than they ever have before, overwhelmingly to the benefit of investors, who can trade more easily and with lower costs than at any point in the past.It is true that the over-fragmentation of the current market structure increases the complexity of the computer interactions needed to trade, which in turn increases the risk of errors and of cascading problems.But trading outages are hardly a recent phenomenon. The London Stock Exchange, for example, went dark for almost a whole trading day in 2000 and again in 2008.The striking thing about the high-profile hiccups in the US is how few innocent victims there are.Knight was the victim of Knight’s catastrophic error; it swallowed $440m in losses when it flooded the market with unwanted trades, had to be rescued by its trading partners and is now owned by Getco.Everbright was the victim of Everbright’s error and its president paid with his job this week.The only potential victim of Nasdaq’s outage is Nasdaq, whose reputation as a safe place for a company to list its shares could take another blow, depending on how forthcoming it is about what went wrong on Thursday.This is not always the case, however. When Nasdaq bungled the initial public offering of Facebook in May 2012, brokers were stuffed with orders that they believed were cancelled and they claim that the debacle cost them $500m in all.Nasdaq’s rules as a self-regulatory organisation protect it from having to make users whole, although it offered $62m in compensation through a plan approved by regulators.The situation at Goldman this week also led to confusion and arguments with exchanges over the right way to deal with its flood of at least 800,000 options trades, hundreds of times the usual volume of trading in just 17 minutes on Tuesday morning.Different options exchanges have different procedures for dealing with problem trades; some forced Goldman to honour them, at adjusted prices, but most of the trades were cancelled, to the chagrin of the bank’s trading partners.These post-disaster procedures are the ones that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission need to update and to harmonise, so that there are clearer rules of the road for identifying and eliminating erroneous trades.It is also time to review the structure of markets to identify if there are ways to reduce the number of venues and volume of electronic message traffic to limit, at the margin, the number of points where glitches could spread through the system.Instead, the SEC’s current efforts are focused on new regulations that will require, among other things, that a trading firm or exchange “establish policies and procedures to ensure its systems operate in the manner intended”.After all these debacles, firms are hardly under any illusion about the life-threatening effects of getting their code wrong, so are unlikely to be cavalier about systems implementation in the first place.The main effect of the new regulations, currently out for comment among a sceptical industry, will be to provide a lucrative harvest of new fines for the SEC when ”stuff happens”.The main question is, do we have a market that is robust enough to deal with outages and erroneous prices calmly and fairly – and on that it is scoring moderate to well.As for getting it right 100 per cent of the time, well, computers will be computers."
160;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-08-22T22:23:39Z;US markets crippled by Nasdaq outage;;US equity markets were crippled by a technical breakdown on Nasdaq on Thursday that brought stock trading on the country’s second-largest exchange to a halt for more than three hours.Trading in 2,500 US-listed companies, including Apple, Google and Microsoft, eventually resumed just over thirty minutes before the normal market close, allowing frustrated investors and traders an opportunity to ensure their portfolios were fully accounted for before the day’s end.The suspension marked the longest period of time that trades on the Nasdaq were halted due to a technical outage in its history, market observers said, and ranked among the biggest disruptions to normal trading since Hurricane Sandy last year and before that September 11, 2001.Investors said they could not recall a similar wholesale suspension of a US stock exchange with the halt weighing heavily on activity during what was already a seasonally quiet trading day.Nasdaq attributed the halt to a disruption at a feed that disseminates all quotes and prices for stocks listed on its exchange. By 12.14pm local time it said it would halt all trading in those shares.Other leading equity and options exchanges at NYSE Euronext, BATS Global Markets and elsewhere moved to also halt trading in those shares.The outage is the latest in a series of embarrassments for US exchanges and the securities industry and came 15 months after a technical mishap hit Facebook shares on their opening day of trading on Nasdaq.It sparked immediate concerns about the plumbing which underpins the US market, days after Goldman Sachs suffered a high-profile trading glitch involving its computerised trading systems.US markets have been criticised for their high degree of fragmentation, where trading firms swap shares at millisecond speeds across 13 equity exchanges and almost 50 alternative trading platforms.“These types of things happen, but it seems they happen a lot more than they used to,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group. “You’d think with technology you’d have less of this occurring.“It’s positive that the market was actually up, [I] can’t imagine what would have happened if this was [Wednesday] when the Fed minutes came out.”A managing director at a large Wall Street trading firm said: “The Nasdaq is such a huge part of stocks that are listed and the overall volume. If you can’t trade a Nasdaq listed stock or an ETF linked to it, you are losing such huge part of the overall equity market,” he said.Nasdaq-listed securities resumed trading at 3:25pm with shares in Nasdaq OMX, parent company of the exchange, falling sharply before closing 3.4 per cent lower.Additional reporting by Jason Abbruzzese and James Politi
161;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-08-08T13:39:03Z;Cash lure to stop firms deserting ETFs in times of stress;Managers can pay market makers to ensure good behaviour;On Wall Street, it seems money talks. Three years after the “flash crash” that sent prices of exchange traded funds reeling, US stock exchanges say they have worked out a way to motivate the financial firms that are supposed to ensure smooth trading in ETFs: pay them more.Two of the biggest venues for trading US ETFs are readying pilot programmes that they hope will encourage better behaviour from the top “market-makers” of the funds – financial firms such as Goldman Sachs and KCG.These lead market-makers are supposed to quote bid and offer prices for ETF shares even in times of market stress. But on May 6, 2010 – the day of the flash crash – they were nowhere to be found. A report by US regulators later said the funds were affected by the day’s abrupt events much more than traditional equities.Investors of all different stripes have flocked to ETFs, which typically track indices and trade on exchanges like stocks, as a way of gaining quick and easy access to assets that might otherwise have only been available to sophisticated investors. But as the sector has expanded, some critics are asking whether the funds suffer from structural vulnerabilities that flare up in moments of market stress, such as the flash crash.“Machines [used by market-makers] are programmed to pull away when things are not perfect,” says Eric Hunsader, founder of trade research firm Nanex. “The degree of disruption during the flash crash affected more market-making systems than normal but events like that happen daily – just to a less severe level.”Critics say ETFs may be more susceptible to bouts of volatility because they rely on a wide cast of market-making characters to sustain them and make sure they accurately track their underlying securities. In addition to the lead market-makers charged with ensuring smooth trading of an ETF’s stock, the funds also have “authorised participants” that help to create ETF shares and make sure they match the basket of securities the fund is meant to be replicating.APs make their money from arbitraging small differences between an ETF’s underlying securities and the share price of the fund itself. Lead market-makers, however, are paid according to how many shares of the ETF change hands.“If they don’t trade a lot, the lead market maker doesn’t get paid a whole lot,” says Laura Morrison, who heads US exchange traded products listing and trading at the New York Stock Exchange. Under the NYSE’s pilot programme, ETF issuers will be able to pay financial firms a set retainer to act as lead market-makers for their many funds.The programme highlights an interesting development in the ETF market. While the number of exchange traded products in existence has jumped from 105 at the turn of the century to almost 5,000 now, the funds are closing in record numbers as many of the new offerings fail to attract enough investors – and market-makers – to keep going.“It’s up to the issuer to secure that lead market-maker, and lead market-makers have become more and more selective of the products they’re willing to sign up for,” says Ms Morrison. “A lot of that has to do with the fact that there are just so many more products out there.”The NYSE’s incentive programme, expected to start in the coming months, will allow ETF issuers to pay lead market-makers $10,000 to $40,000 per ETF per year, regardless of how much the fund is traded. At Nasdaq, ETF issuers are looking to offer $50,000-$100,00 to top market-makers in a product if certain quoting requirements are met.The programme “gives the LMM the confidence they will receive this dollar amount as long as they meet their obligations”, says Ms Morrison. The NYSE is also hoping the pilot effort will encourage new firms to sign on to make markets in ETF shares.Companies that run ETFs, such as BlackRock, have said that despite the additional money they may have to shell out, they welcome the exchanges’ experiments to encourage market-makers to stay committed to the funds. Three years on from the flash crash, the NYSE says only rarely does it flag lead market-makers for bad behaviour, despite the general impulse for them to pull back from ETFs in difficult moments.“The ability of the exchanges to offer proper incentives to market-makers who support new or less frequently traded ETPs …benefits all investors,” BlackRock executives said in a comment letter sent to US regulators last year.
162;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-07-24T16:07:53Z;Nasdaq earnings disappoint on higher expenses;;Nasdaq OMX’s second-quarter results were dragged down by a continued loss of market share for US equity transactions and increased operating expenses incurred in attempts to diversify into data and fixed income trading.The transatlantic exchange operator said its adjusted earnings per share declined to 62 cents in the three months to the end of June, 2 cents below a year ago and shy of analysts’ forecasts.On a GAAP basis, net profits fell 5.3 per cent to $88m, or 52 cents a share.The weaker earnings came as revenues grew 5.6 per cent to $451m, aided by gains from closing on its $390m acquisition of the investor and public relations services unit of Thomson Reuters in early June. Stripping out gains from the acquisition, sales increased just 1 per cent.“What you have seen in the last several years is us evolving in plain sight,” said chief executive Bob Greifeld. “What Nasdaq is today is different from what it was two to three years ago and I’m sure it will change further if we are successful.”Operating expenses jumped $40m to $292m year on year as the company closed on the purchase of the unit from Thomson Reuters and a $750m acquisition of the eSpeed bond trading platform from BGC Partners, an interdealer broker.Both moves came after the company’s largest rival, NYSE Euronext, was acquired by IntercontinentalExchange, in a deal now worth more than $10bn. Mr Greifeld said the company was not in “acquisition mode” after the purchases and that it remained focused on the integration of the new units.Rich Repetto, principal at Sandler O’Neill, said: “The good part was that the Nasdaq moved up the accretion targets for its two major acquisitions, but the market is looking at the fact they missed on earnings and expenses in the quarter.”In US equity trading, the company said lower volatility drove brokers to route orders away from the exchange. Nasdaq’s market share fell 3.1 percentage points from a year ago to 19.1 per cent, but it did improve from the previous quarter. Overall, equity trading sales, including its European business, fell by a fifth to $51m.Shares in the company, which had reached their best levels since 2008 earlier this month, finished 3 per cent lower to $32.81.
163;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Nasdaq to reinforce monitoring with performance metrics tool;;Nasdaq OMX is reinforcing real-time monitoring of the billions of trades processed across its US trading platforms, amid a crackdown by US authorities on exchanges’ supervision of the markets they operate.The transatlantic exchanges operator is to roll out across all of its US equity and options trading platforms a performance metrics tool developed by Corvil, an Irish trading technology provider.The tool will alert Nasdaq and its member firms in real-time of potential anomalies in trading and processing, as well as potential network and software performance issues. Nasdaq estimates its six US electronic platforms collectively process around 1m transactions per second on average.Its move to reinforce its systems comes as US regulators increasingly clamp down on exchanges’ operations of their platforms after a rash of high-profile technical glitches in the past 18 months. Among them were rogue algorithm trading stocks for Knight Capital and the failure of Bats Global Markets’ own IPO.Last year NYSE Euronext became the first exchange to be fined after it paid $5m to settle allegations from the Securities and Exchange Commission that some customers were getting data ahead of others. Nasdaq itself was fined $10m last week for failures relating to the flotation of Facebook while the Chicago Board Options Exchange has set aside $10m to cover an ongoing Federal investigation into how it monitors its systems.The fines levied mark a significant departure from established practice by the SEC. Most of the largest US trading venues are designated as self-regulatory organisations, a status that gives them a quasi-governmental role. They can write rules for their markets and police trades to stamp out possible insider dealing and market manipulation.Executives point out that fragmentation of US equity trading in the last decade across more than 50 venues has made monitoring performance much more difficult and contributed to the high-profile tech issues.“There is a need for greater visibility to deal with competitive and regulatory forces that shape operations,” said Eric Noll, executive vice-president of transaction services US and UK at Nasdaq OMX.Nasdaq’s technology is recognised as one of the most advanced in the world and the company supplies trading tools to other exchanges around the world. Nevertheless, it was badly caught out by glitches in the Facebook IPO, although it rapidly diagnosed the problem.Mr Noll said the introduction of the Corvil technology was partly to reassure customers. “The Corvil software is a diagnostic and monitoring tool and allows you to monitor your performance,” he told FT Trading Room.Corvil’s technology will track all outbound data feeds to member firms and the microchips that process securities information.Donal Byrne, chief executive of Corvil, said many monitoring tools struggled to deal with the high volume, variety and speed of data being sent across the world’s biggest exchanges. “We’re moving from a game of speed. It’s about predictability of performance and the ability to detect and fix it,” he said. “The whole game has changed quite substantially.”
164;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Nasdaq to launch interest rates platform in futures market push;;Nasdaq OMX is preparing to unveil a new derivatives platform for trading interest rate products this week as part of an effort to position itself as a global futures market.The company’s London-based NLX exchange will allow investors to trade short-and-long term interest contracts, making it an alternative to dominant platforms run by Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext in Europe and CME Group in the US.The effort comes as Nasdaq seeks to broaden its reach into the futures market, diversifying from its traditional business of cash equity transactions, which has faced a multiyear slowdown in trading volumes.Nasdaq is preparing to close on the $750m acquisition of eSpeed, the electronic government bond trading platform of interdealer broker BGC Partners.The launch of NLX is seen as a complementary move to the acquisition as the company looks to develop a foothold in the future market and challenge longstanding incumbents.Nasdaq is looking to shore up commitments from dealers to trade on the platform in the run-up to NLX’s launch tomorrow, after receiving regulatory clearance from British authorities.“It’s going to be an uphill battle for Nasdaq,” said Rich Repetto, principal at Sandler O’Neill. “Among futures exchanges, you haven’t seen an upstart or new platform have much success over the last decade. The barriers to entry are high and the incumbents service their customers well.”The company is also planning to extend trading of electricity derivatives in Germany, while introducing gas and coal forward contracts in the UK, Germany and the Nordic region.The moves into the region’s market for trading power are also seen as an effort to challenge an area dominated by IntercontinentalExchange and Deutsche Börse.Products that will trade on the NLX platform include three-month euribor, 3-month Sterling, long-term Gilt and 10-year Bund.All trades on NLX will be cleared through LCH.Clearnet, the transatlantic clearing house in which Nasdaq holds a 5 per cent stake.
165;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-05-29T17:45:14Z;SEC fines Nasdaq $10m for Facebook failure;Largest ever penalty levied against a US exchange;Nasdaq OMX has agreed to pay $10m, the largest penalty levied against a US exchange, to settle regulatory charges that its “poor systems and decision-making” led to dramatic disruptions in the launch of Facebook’s $16bn initial public offering.The fine marks the most aggressive action taken by the Securities and Exchange Commission against a US market operator.The regulator said Nasdaq’s systems suffered from a design limitation that hampered its ability to match buy and sell orders before trading began, despite knowing the Facebook IPO would draw widespread investor interest as one of the largest capital raisings in its history. “Nasdaq then made a series of ill-fated decisions that led to rule violations,” the SEC said.The action comes as US regulators intensify the pressure on for-profit exchanges, which are granted certain regulatory privileges, as they battle each other for business.The settlement is double the $5m paid by NYSE Euronext last year to settle regulatory infractions. It is only the second fine levied against an exchange and reflects the tougher stance being taken by US officials. Nasdaq did not admit or deny any wrongdoing in the settlement. Facebook declined to comment.Daniel Hawke, chief of the SEC’s market abuse unit, said too often “systems disruptions are written off as mere technical ‘glitches’, when it’s the design of the systems and the response of exchange officials that cause us the most concern.”The SEC has also become concerned that exchanges are not properly managing conflicts of interest. One specific concern of SEC officials is whether exchanges are putting profit growth ahead of their obligations to ensure technologies are properly tested before they are implemented.In a message to other exchanges, the SEC noted that it had decided against imposing limitations on Nasdaq’s operations as part of the settlement.Robert Greifeld, chief executive, responded to the settlement with a letter to exchange constituents giving his assurances that Nasdaq had learnt from the incident and had taken steps to ensure its technology was strengthened.Nasdaq has previously paid $10.8m in profits it made from the IPO to investors, as part of voluntarily $62m payment to brokers who had collectively claimed losses of up to $500m.Morgan Stanley, which acted as the lead bank on Facebook’s botched IPO, has also come under fire for its pricing of $38 a share, well beyond the original range of between $28 to $35 a share. Facebook stock slumped to $28.84 in the 10 days following the initial share sale. It traded at $23.58 in New York on Wednesday.The bank has already been fined $5m by a Massachusetts regulator, which said its investment bankers exerted “improper influence” over the research analysts who covered Facebook at the time of the IPO.Additional reporting by Tracy Alloway and April Dembosky
166;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-05-15T20:51:47Z;Nasdaq eyes European derivatives push;;Nasdaq OMX is to connect its new European derivatives platform with one of the world’s largest trading software companies, raising the US exchange’s ability to pose serious competition to dominant players NYSE Liffe and Deutsche Börse’s Eurex.Trading Technologies will connect its popular X_Trader software platform to NLX, Nasdaq’s new London venue for trading European fixed income derivatives, the companies announced on Wednesday.Chicago-based Trading Technologies counts 19 of the top 20 futures commission merchants in the US as its customers, including Goldman Sachs, UBS and Newedge.The entrance of NLX, expected in coming weeks, is expected to further heighten competition in derivatives trading and clearing in Europe. The move comes as global regulators have pushed to move derivatives trading on to exchanges and processed through clearing houses.The European market has been dominated by Eurex and Liffe, and analysts expect IntercontinentalExchange to increase competition in the market if its planned bid for NYSE Euronext is approved by European regulators.NLX will trade short and long-term interest rate euro and sterling-based derivatives. While NYSE and Eurex own both the execution platform and exchange, NLX will separate the two, clearing contracts through LCH.Clearnet, the transatlantic clearing house.However, the venue has yet to receive UK regulatory approval as authorities examine the clearing arrangements.X_Trader is used across Wall Street desks and in the pits of Chicago exchanges, and includes the Algo Design Lab platform, or ADL, which allows traders visually to assemble automated trading engines and quickly launch them.The algorithms, or “algos”, that traders have increasingly come to rely on have come under scrutiny, particularly in equity markets, and taken blame for causing exchange outages and flash crashes. Their use is growing widely in the futures industry in Chicago, which has long been known for its financial innovation.NLX is part of a two-pronged attack by Nasdaq on the fixed income market. Last month it agreed to buy eSpeed from BGC Partners for $750m to give it access to trading US Treasuries.
167;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-04-24T16:06:55Z;Nasdaq prepares for $10m SEC fine over botched Facebook IPO;;Nasdaq OMX is preparing to pay a fine of up to $10m to US regulators for its handling of the botched Facebook initial public offering in what would be the largest penalty paid by a US exchange operator.The transatlantic exchange group disclosed the potential fine as it said net profits halved to $42m in its latest quarter, partly driven by poor results from its US cash equities business. Adjusted earnings of 64 cents a share were 3 cents better than the same quarter last year and slightly ahead of analysts’ forecasts.News of the possible $10m fine comes as the exchange is set to pay up to $62m to aggrieved brokers, who have claimed large losses because of system failures on Nasdaq during the Facebook IPO last May.A fine of $10m would mark the biggest financial penalty levied by the Securities and Exchange Commission on a US exchange as the regulator has intensified its scrutiny of for-profit exchanges.The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange paid $5m to settle charges of preferential data distribution between paying clients last year.The Chicago Board Options Exchange this year said it had set aside up to $10m as the derivatives bourse also faces fines over a yet-to-be disclosed issue.In addition to the funds set aside for penalties relating to Facebook, Nasdaq claimed $27m in one-time costs. Those included charges relating to its $390m purchase of Thomson Reuters’ investor relations unit in December and its $1.2bn acquisition of a US Treasury trading platform from BGC Partners.Those moves came as Nasdaq seeks to diversify its business away from transaction volumes and also in response to the pending $8.2bn takeover of its main rival, NYSE Euronext, by the IntercontinentalExchange, the global derivatives bourse.Robert Greifeld, chief executive, said almost three-quarters of Nasdaq’s overall sales, which grew 1 per cent to $418m in the period, came from non-transaction related businesses.Follow the latest developments in global IPO activityBut its US cash equities business continued to suffer as its market share fell to 18 per cent, down 3 per cent in the quarter.The drop came despite loss-leader efforts to offer higher rebates to attract brokers to use the exchange again.“The pricing move did not work, that’s why we’ve moved on from it,” said Mr Greifeld. “We’ve had to recalibrate and we’ve taken different steps in April and will take different steps in May . . . Clearly, it was a difficult quarter.”Rich Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, said Nasdaq earned a record low amount from its US equity business. “Declining industry volumes, falling market share and slimmer capture due to inverted pricing drove the soft results.”Shares in Nasdaq had lost 1 per cent to $28.20 by the close in New York and have slightly underperformed the broader US market over the past year.
168;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Nasdaq set for Europe energy trades push;;Nasdaq OMX is preparing a push into Europe’s commodities and energy markets, which will put it head to head with Deutsche Börse and Intercontinental­Exchange in the region’s emerging market for trading power.In the coming months the transatlantic exchanges operator will extend trading of electricity derivatives into Germany, and plans to introduce gas and coal forward contracts in the UK, Germany and the Nordic region.Nasdaq’s rapid expansion into European commodities trading is part of a three-pronged move in which the exchange aims to break out of trading equities in the US and Nordic region, where profits have shrunk dramatically amid fierce competition.In recent months it has paid $390m for two corporate services businesses from Thomson Reuters, and $750m for eSpeed, the electronic government bond trading platform of interdealer broker BGC Partners. It is also putting the final touches to the launch of an interest rate derivatives venue in Europe called NLX, which is likely to launch next month.Hans-Ole Jochumsen, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX’s European business, told the Financial Times that the group would begin by offering electricity futures contracts in Germany from May. “We will be active in Nordic region, the UK and Germany,” he said. “The next step will be to move into gas and coal. They’re very correlated in the UK.”He added that the contracts would be cleared through Nasdaq OMX’s own clearing house.This market is also being eyed by Deutsche Börse, via its European Energy Exchange subsidiary, while IntercontinentalExchange, the US derivatives group, earlier this month won regulatory approval for ICE Endex, an exchange to trade European natural gas.They are looking to exploit sweeping change in global derivatives markets. Incoming rules under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, is pushing to have more of the vast over-the-counter derivatives market processed through clearing houses.A clearing house stands between two parties in a deal, guaranteeing the trade in the event of a default.Brokers and their ­customers, such as big power companies, use derivatives such as swaps to offset risks from trading, but swaths of such activity will be caught under the new rules.Tighter capital requirements imposed on banks by Basel III may also make it harder for them to provide the industry with the credit and swaps trades they have done in the past.As it stands, around three-quarters of Europe’s gas and power derivatives trading is uncleared.Nasdaq, like ICE and Deutsche Börse, will let customers clear through its own clearing house, aiming to exploit the savings customers can make from netting the margin they have to put up to trade derivatives.
169;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-04-16T20:43:32Z;US exchanges call for new dark pool rules;;New rules must be adopted to repair the quality of US capital markets and stem the rise of share trading away from public venues, the country’s three biggest stock exchange operators have told the Securities and Exchange Commission and lawmakers.The chief executives of NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX and BATS Global Markets argued for regulators to introduce rules permitting transactions to only take place away from a public exchange if a customer is getting a much-improved price.The exchanges specifically pointed to similar steps taken by Canadian and Australian regulators to combat the rise of off-exchange trading, highlighting improvements to market quality after new rules were introduced.The meeting with the SEC, which took place last week and was disclosed in a filing on Tuesday, marks the boldest attempt yet by exchanges to join forces and take on changes in the equity market. The exchange officials also met with Capitol Hill lawmakers to express their concerns, people familiar with the meetings said.It comes as trading at off-exchange venues, such as dark pools and private “internalisation” platforms run by brokers and banks, have eaten into exchange profits.They also repeated a long held belief that the current rules guiding share trading incentivise transactions to move off the public market to a private venue, where transactions are subject to less stringent regulations.Regulators were told that inaction has meant higher costs for investors in the form of wider spreads on trades and more volatile markets as the percentage of off-exchange trading has climbed to record levels.Specifically, the exchanges said less than 30 per cent of all shares traded away from public markets were transacted at materially better price, which they defined as a 10 per cent price improvement.In statements on Tuesday, the exchanges reiterated their “collective concern” about the rise of private platforms.But the arguments also highlight the complications of seeking reform to the US market, where some of the exchange’s most important customers are also their biggest competitors.The biggest dark pools by volume were run by brokers at Credit Suisse, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Knight Capital, according to market data from Tabb Group.Off-exchange trading accounts have grown to make up almost 40 per cent of all stock transactions on any given day, according to data provided by the exchanges to regulators.The companies have responded by attempting to diversify their businesses away from equity transactions, moving into other markets. Nasdaq OMX, for instance, relies on US equity trades for less than 15 per cent of its overall revenues.
170;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-04-12T00:21:25Z;Greifeld bonus cut over botched Facebook IPO;;Nasdaq’s botched handling of Facebook’s initial public offering cost chief executive Robert Greifeld a $542,100 cut to his bonus for 2012.The exchange operator’s board said in a securities filing on Thursday that it had considered the Facebook IPO in making the decision to reduce Mr Greifeld’s incentive pay.Some of Wall Street’s biggest brokers claimed they suffered about a total of $500m in losses due to technical glitches during the social networking site’s debut on the US stock exchange in May.The delays were widely seen as a blow to investor confidence in the country’s securities industry.Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved a $62m compensation offer from Nasdaq to aggrieved brokers.Nasdaq is also discussing a separate settlement with the US regulator over its handling of the IPO, people familiar with the situation have previously said.The Nasdaq board said Mr Greifeld’s bonus for 2012 fell by 62 per cent to $1.35m compared with the year before. “The committee and board explicitly considered the Facebook IPO in connection with their review and determination of these reduced payouts,” it said.Mr Greifeld’s total pay package, including a $5.6m stock award, rose almost 18 per cent to $8.9m, making him one of the highest-paid exchange chief executives globally.In December, the company appointed Börje Ekholm, president of Investor AB, the Swedish investment company controlled by the Wallenberg family, as chairman. Many industry insiders speculated that Mr Greifeld, who has run the company since 2003, had coveted the position.Nasdaq’s shares have risen by 14 per cent over the past year and in line with the broader US market.Anna Ewing, head of global technology solutions, was the only other Nasdaq executive to face a cut due to the Facebook IPO. Her bonus was docked $263,625.The company said no executive received an increase in base salary for 2012, since its financial performance lagged behind that of the previous year.
171;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-04-08T23:09:22Z;Citi files Nasdaq claim over Facebook IPO;;Citigroup has filed a claim with Nasdaq OMX for compensation for losses from the exchange operator’s botched handling of Facebook’s initial public offering, people familiar with the situation said on Monday.The bank has not ruled out taking further legal action against Nasdaq, one of the people said.Trading companies have claimed about $500m in cumulative losses from the first day of trading in last May’s much anticipated IPO, which was marred by system failures on the US’s second-largest equity exchange.The move comes after the Securities and Exchange Commission last month approved an amended $62m offer by Nasdaq, which won the support of brokers Knight Capital and Citadel.Monday marked the last day for brokers to register claims with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the agency overseeing the claims process. Citi and Nasdaq declined to comment.Citi has criticised the Nasdaq offer and has said it should be entitled to recover all its losses from the debut. The bank suffered about $20m in losses from the Facebook IPO, people familiar with the situation have said.UBS, the Swiss bank, said last month that it would continue to fight for a larger payout, saying Nasdaq’s offer amounted to a small portion of the SFr349m it lost.News of the Citi move was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
172;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-04-02T20:22:00Z;Nasdaq opens new front in fixed income;;For Nasdaq OMX, home to Microsoft, Google and Apple, the game is no longer solely about equities.The transatlantic exchange operator has its eyes on the fixed income market and US Treasuries, one of the world’s largest cash markets, with its $750m deal to buy eSpeed, the electronic bond trading venue owned by BGC Partners, the interdealer broker.The price, which could rise to $1.2bn based on potential share-based payments, equated to more than BGC’s equity capital, sending its share price up 48.6 per cent in New York on Tuesday.“Nasdaq is trying to diversify its business, and going after the electronic fixed income market is a smart move,” says Sang Lee, managing partner at financial services consultancy Aite Group. “Electronic trading in fixed income is the last frontier.”Nasdaq is betting on both an increase in electronic trading in that market and a pick-up in Treasury transactions once the US Federal Reserve ends its quantitative easing policy of purchasing bonds and suppressing interest rates.For BGC, the sale delivered a handsome return for a subsidiary that generated $100m in turnover last year, less than 6 per cent of its total revenues.Howard Lutnick, chief executive of BGC, says the price Nasdaq is paying meant the market was “clearly undervaluing the assets of the company”. “We will also have the financial wherewithal to maintain our dividend for the foreseeable future,” he says. Last year, BGC earned $183.4m and paid dividends to shareholders and limited partners of $182.9m.For Nasdaq, the deal represents its boldest move to push beyond its core business of equities trading, as weak investment appetite and fierce competition have cut into industry profits.Most of its efforts have focused on ancillary services such as trading technology and market surveillance, hosting and corporate services. Last December it bought two units from Thomson Reuters for $390m, meaning about 70 per cent of its revenues would come from “non-transaction” services.The acquisition of eSpeed – what Nasdaq chief executive Bob Greifeld on Monday called “a significant milestone . . . and one that uniquely enhances our trading offering and positions us for future growth” – will mark a two-pronged attack on fixed income trading.Nasdaq plans to step up competition in Europe with Deutsche Börse’s Eurex and NYSE Liffe by launching a fixed income derivatives trading platform, NLX.Since its launch in the mid-1990s, eSpeed has been at the fore of the move to electronic trading in the most liquid US government securities, but it has lost its leading market position to BrokerTec, run by ICAP.“On the run” issues form 40 per cent of the cash US Treasuries market, which trades $500bn a day. Cash equities markets trade $150bn per day.Both have similarities – eSpeed uses an exchange-like central limit order book system and relies on constant investment to maintain trading hardware and software. “The parallels between the US Treasury market and the equities market are significant. Both are highly electronic efficient marketplaces,” says Mr Greifeld.Questions remain about when and how Nasdaq can make headway in this market. Demand for Treasuries has been depressed while the Fed acts as the marketplace’s largest and persistent buyer. Volumes in rates at eSpeed had dropped by a quarter last year.Investors have been unsettled by Nasdaq’s growing debt profile, which is estimated to grow by $1bn to finance the two big acquisitions, and knocked 12.8 per cent off its market capitalisation on Tuesday. Most of eSpeed’s volume has come from other BGC businesses. Under the deal, BGC can return to the market in three years’ time.Mr Greifeld is well-known as a cost-cutter, often moving acquired targets on to the exchange’s superior technology. However, he plans to use eSpeed technology and only move the data centre operations.Nasdaq hopes to attract those banks on BrokerTec but not using eSpeed. Mr Lee says: “It’s an open question if Nasdaq’s technology can attract more flow and restore the eSpeed platform to a dominant position.”
173;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-04-01T21:30:21Z;Nasdaq OMX in $1.2bn deal to buy eSpeed;;Nasdaq OMX made an aggressive foray into the market for benchmark US Treasury bonds on Monday, offering as much as $1.2bn in cash and deferred stock for a leading electronic trading platform from BGC Partners, an interdealer broker.The transatlantic exchange operator is buying a unit of the eSpeed platform that deals only in the most liquid Treasury securities – so-called “on-the-run” issues – hoping to attract high-speed traders who are spreading into other markets as their equity returns decline.Nasdaq is betting on both an increase in electronic trading in fixed-income markets and on a pick-up in Treasury transactions once the Federal Reserve ends its quantitative easing policy of purchasing bonds and suppressing interest rates“It’s important to recognise that the US Treasury market is the most similar to the US equity market in its construction and operation,” said Bob Greifeld, chief executive officer at Nasdaq OMX. “The under-pining of technology is something we are familiar with and we believe is in our power zone.”BGC, which was spun off from Cantor Fitzgerald, will continue to operate a unit of eSpeed that deals in less liquid Treasury notes and bonds. In three years’ time, BGC can also return to the on-the-run market under the proposed offer.The purchase consideration includes $750m in cash and as much as $484m in stock, to be dispersed over 15 years, subject to various conditions. At current prices, BGC would receive 15m shares. Nasdaq said it will receive a tax benefit, which will offset the value of the stock portion of the deal.The deal is Nasdaq’s second large acquisition since IntercontinentalExchange made an $8.2bn offer for its main competitor, NYSE Euronext. In December, Nasdaq agreed to a $390m purchase of the investor and public relations services unit of Thomson Reuters as part of its efforts to expand beyond equities.In bond trading, Nasdaq will face competition from Icap’s BrokerTec system, which holds roughly a 60 per cent market share in the electronic Treasury trading market.Examine the state of the bond market and whether the bull run is sustainable“We have great respect for what Icap has accomplished and I certainly think it will be a good competitive dynamic between the two market places,” said Mr Greifeld.Shares in Nasdaq, which are up 28 per cent on the year, fell slightly in after-hours trading in New York. Moody’s also placed Nasdaq’s credit rating on review for a downgrade as the company said it would suspend guidance on its $30m share repurchase programme. In contrast BGC jumped 41 per cent to $5.43 in extended hours trading.Howard Lutnick, BGC chairman and chief executive, said the deal “clearly demonstrates that this process ultimately leads to enormous value for our stockholders.” He added that the $1.23bn deal was approximately equal to BGC’s current market capitalisation.Deutsche Bank advised Nasdaq on the transaction and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom provided legal assistance. Cantor Fitzgerald acted as financial adviser and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz acted a legal adviser to BGC Partners.
174;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-03-25T17:28:12Z;Regulators approve Facebook IPO payout;;US regulators have approved a proposal by Nasdaq OMX to pay out $62m to compensate broker-dealers who lost out from the exchange operator’s botched handling of the Facebook initial public offering last year.UBS, though, vowed to continue to fight for a larger payout, saying Nasdaq’s offer is a fraction of the SFr349m in losses it suffered. It said it would seek arbitration.The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday passed a proposed rule-change by Nasdaq, which will allow the exchange to raise the total it was able to offer brokers.However, brokers said the glitches left them with combined losses of $500m. The much-anticipated IPO last May was marred by a series of system failures on the US’s second-largest equity exchange. Nasdaq said later that a 20-minute delay to the start of trading of Facebook’s $16bn debut had been caused by a millisecond systems blip due to the largest IPO auction “in the history of mankind”.Nasdaq’s legal status as a self-regulatory organisation meant it was restricted to offering compensation of $3m for technical issues. Payouts under the Nasdaq proposal will be evaluated and processed via the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (Finra), the SEC added.“While the accommodation proposal is not designed to, and would not, compensate all claims of loss suffered by market participants relating to Nasdaq’s system difficulties with the Cross [technology that matches orders], [it] would create a means of providing significantly more compensation for eligible claims, outside of litigation, than would otherwise be available under existing Nasdaq [rules],” the SEC said in a statement.UBS said the Nasdaq offer was “inadequate and insufficient, and the SEC’s approval of the plan does not change our opinion. Moreover, UBS has already filed an arbitration demand against Nasdaq for the full extent of our losses over Nasdaq’s …substantial failures to perform its duties.”The SEC agreed that Nasdaq was not liable for any losses or damages. However, the larger payout underlines how Nasdaq has sought to repair relations with traders and reassure the market on the reliability of its technology.“We are pleased that the Securities and Exchange Commission has approved our accommodation plan, which will enable our customers, members and market participants to receive appropriate restitution as Finra promptly begins processing claims,” Nasdaq said in a statement.The SEC had come under pressure from Citigroup and UBS to reject the plan. Others such as Knight Capital and Citadel urged the SEC to approve the plan after Nasdaq improved its initial offer.Meanwhile Marcie Vu, one of the top advisers on the Facebook IPO, has left Morgan Stanley to join Qatalyst, the Silicon Valley investment banking boutique set up by star tech banker Frank Quattrone. Ms Vu had been in charge of advising consumer internet companies at Morgan Stanley, working on deals like the sale of Zappos to Amazon and Admob to Google, as well as the IPOs of Google and LinkedIn.The Morgan Stanley team on the Facebook share sale, led by investment banker Michael Grimes, drew criticism from other banks for keeping closer control over the sale process than is usual on such a large transaction and found its work under the spotlight as the stock price quickly slumped.Additional reporting by Richard Waters in San Francisco
175;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-03-13T20:34:56Z;Vital LCH role in Nasdaq’s Europe plans;;Nasdaq OMX, the transatlantic exchanges operator, on Wednesday described its greater involvement in the running of LCH.Clearnet, the clearing house, as a key part of its plans to attack incumbent derivatives exchanges in Europe.Last week Nasdaq said it would increase its stake in LCH from 3.7 per cent to 5 per cent and Bob Greifeld, the group’s chief executive, would take a seat on the board as LCH finalised the terms of a deal with the London Stock Exchange. The LSE is set to take a controlling stake of just under 60 per cent.Clearing houses are becoming key infrastructure in financial markets as global regulation pushes for more derivatives trades to be processed through the risk management houses.Many clearing houses are owned by exchanges, forcing traders of derivatives contracts to clear the trade within the same company. LCH, the LSE and Nasdaq are in the vanguard of those arguing dealers, mainly banks, should have greater choice over where they clear their trades.“The board seat is important. LCH.Clearnet representation is one of the building blocks in coming at the vertical silos in an intelligent way. We wanted to be part of that strategy,” he said at the annual Futures Industry Association conference at Boca Raton, Florida.Trading of derivatives in Europe is dominated by two venues, NYSE Liffe and Eurex, owned by Deutsche Börse. The two were prevented from merging last year by European regulators.Last week Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the LSE, described the open access for other exchanges as “ the superior economic model for the operator” as it encouraged other venues to connect, and would allow users to offset the margin posted for trading in different asset classes.The move is part of a three-pronged assault Nasdaq plans in coming months on the derivatives market. In coming months it will launch NLX, a platform trading both short-term and long-term interest rate derivatives. Approval from UK regulators “is coming soon,” Mr Griefeld added.It is also putting greater resources behind The Order Machine (Tom), a Dutch option trading platform, in which it took a majority stake in December.In recent weeks Tom has raised the market share in the derivatives it trades in Amsterdam. Daily index options have risen to as high as 42 per cent, while the number of trades customers use has also risen rapidly. After taking nearly a year to trade 1m options contracts, the group said last week it had traded its fourth million in just five weeks.It clears the contracts at the Holland Clearing House but Mr Greifeld said there would be no imminent switchover to LCH.Clearnet. “We can’t make the commitment now as the clearing landscape is that 2013 will be year for Emir compliance. In 2014 will the year to discuss that,” he said.Rules around the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir) are set to come into force later this week in Europe.
176;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-03-06T13:22:20Z;Nasdaq launches index for private groups;;Nasdaq OMX is joining the race to attract share trading in budding, fast-growing technology companies by forging a joint venture with one of the pioneers of the private secondary markets in the US.The agreement with SharesPost will see Nasdaq venture for the first time into the market for private companies, tapping into a form of trading that led to soaring valuations on companies such as Facebook, Groupon and Zynga before their initial public offerings.The agreement with the Silicon Valley-based company reflects growing competition to create new ways to trade shares in private companies following last year’s Jobs Act, which was designed to make it easier for promising young companies to raise capital in the US.The move comes as Nasdaq has faced increased competition from its main rival, the New York Stock Exchange, in the battle for coveted new technology listings.The new platform could help it secure the business of technology companies and provide a stepping-stone into the public markets, bolstering its high-margin listings business.Nasdaq listed 20 technology and internet-related companies on its exchange last year compared with 17 on NYSE, according to data from market research group Dealogic. That marked the second year in a row where NYSE nearly overtook Nasdaq in the tech listing business.Nasdaq has indicated that it is looking for opportunities to poach business away from NYSE Euronext, parent company of its main rival, as it focuses on its impending $8.2bn merger with the IntercontinentalExchange.SharesPost, founded in 2009, acts as a marketplace and source of information for private company stocks, as well as a broker-dealer that handles trades for investors.The agreement will see the company’s marketplace operations move into a new joint venture called the Nasdaq Private Market, while the broker-dealer business will remain independent, the two companies said.Greg Brogger, founder and chief executive of SharesPost, has been named head of the joint venture.“We’re trying to bring a solution that allows companies to bring liquidity to their early investors and employees,” said Bruce Aust, executive vice-president at Nasdaq.The Jobs Act rule change that has raised the limit on the number of shareholders in a private company from 500 to 2,000 has made it possible for companies to tap into a wider shareholder base without going public, Mr Aust said.The 500-shareholder rule was instrumental in prompting Facebook to move ahead with its IPO last year. Before that, though, Facebook had drawn widespread attention to private marketplaces such as SharesPost almost single-handedly, reaching a valuation of more than $80bn even before it moved to a full public listing.The high volatility caused by thin trading in private company shares, along with regulatory warnings about the potential for abuse, have contributed to a controversial start to life for the new private markets. The lack of trading volume has been blamed for producing a share-price bubble in Facebook, Groupon and Zynga while they were still private, leaving investors drawn to the stocks shortly before their IPOs nursing big losses.The Securities and Exchange Commission carried out its own investigation into private trading, resulting in penalties last year for two firms that had used the huge interest in Facebook ahead of its IPO to suck in investors.SharesPost was caught up in the regulatory scrutiny, with both the company and Mr Brogger settling a claim from the SEC that it should have applied for a broker-dealer licence at an earlier stage in its life.Mr Aust claimed that Nasdaq’s entry would help to bring greater maturity to the fledgling markets, given its record in running regulated marketplaces in other areas. Trading is also restricted to people who meet the SEC’s test of being “accredited investors”, he added, requiring them to have a net worth of $1m excluding their primary residence or an annual income of at least $200,000.Trading in the private markets fell off abruptly following Facebook’s IPO last May, Mr Brogger said, adding that trading volumes had started to pick up again and that a wider group of companies had expressed interest in tapping the market.Besides making it possible for companies to stay private longer while still allowing their early investors to cash in, the Jobs Act was intended to end the IPO drought in US markets by encouraging more companies to go public. Public listings have remained scarce, however.“The number of companies in the IPO pipeline is huge right now,” Mr Aust said. Many of the companies that had been targeting an IPO for late this year were now bringing those plans forward to the second quarter, he said.The Jobs Act has been one factor in prompting the NYSE Euronext to investigate setting up a rival marketplace for entrepreneurs in Europe. Bill Hambrecht, a veteran Silicon Valley financier and champion of using auctions to help young companies go public, has also proposed a new exchange aimed at emerging growth companies.SecondMarket, a competitor to SharesPost, said the deal was a “telling admission that companies increasingly wish to avoid the casino-like atmosphere of the US public markets”.
177;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-03-03T16:53:31Z;Nasdaq executing trades at a loss;;Nasdaq OMX, the transatlantic exchange operator, is executing some US stock trades at an operating loss in what analysts are calling an aggressive act to regain market share.The US’s second-largest exchange said it had been employing the classic loss-leader strategy since February and is expanding the scheme this month, betting that the knock-on effect will bolster its overall transaction levels.The effort comes as Nasdaq and its rival, the New York Stock Exchange, both already facing an industry-wide downturn in trading levels, have steadily been losing market share of what’s left to competing exchanges and alternative trading platforms run by banks, brokers and others.The move appears to have worked last month for Nasdaq, as February market share data show the exchange gained about 1.5 percentage points of overall volumes back. Analysts at brokerage Rosenblatt Securities said the gains came primarily at the expense of other exchanges, such as NYSE.Nasdaq said in a statement to the FT that it was committed to offering its members diverse investment strategies aimed at increasing transaction volumes.In recent weeks, Nasdaq has been looking to poach business away from NYSE as its rival focuses on its impending $8.2bn merger with the IntercontinentalExchange. Industry insiders also speculated whether Nasdaq might also be trying to boost market share with a view towards looking for merger opportunities. Nasdaq held failed early-stage talks with buyout firm Carlyle Group earlier this year over a deal that would have seen the exchange operator taken private.With the programmes, the exchange is specifically targeting price-sensitive brokers that transact on behalf of retail investors, including UBS, Citigroup, Knight Capital and Citadel, and offering them rebates larger than the amount they take in for executing the trade. People familiar with the scheme confirmed the trades were lossmaking.NYSE has executed similar schemes in what people familiar with its policies said were run at break-even or slightly lossmaking rates since August. The people said the NYSE’s programme, which is offered on its Arca exchange, was significantly smaller than Nasdaq’s, but that it was considering a move to increase the size of those rebates in response.“I don’t think it’s healthy for the business or the market for us to create a price war in a negative margin area,” said one of these people. “It’s not a sign of health. It’s a desperate situation.”Exchanges often tinker with the rebates they pay brokers each month in what is a common practice on the fragmented US equity market, which is made up of 13 stock exchanges and about 50 alternate trading venues vying for transactions.According to analysts, however, while exchanges sometimes offer rebates at a loss, Nasdaq’s move is the most extreme to date.
178;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-02-27T19:59:12Z;LCH.Clearnet names Weisbrod for US unit;;LCH.Clearnet, the transatlantic clearing house, has appointed David Weisbrod from JPMorgan to run its US business as it prepares for incoming rules around derivatives trading.Mr Weisbrod, who has been at JPMorgan for more than 40 years, will lead strategy in the US, one of the world’s largest locations for off-exchange derivatives trading.Global regulators want more of the vast over-the-counter derivatives market to be processed through clearing houses. A clearing house stands between two parties, guaranteeing a trade in the event of a default.LCH is the world’s largest clearing house, dwarfing rival services from CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange. It clears nearly half of the world’s $400tn global interest rate swap market and is the second-largest clearer of bonds and repos in the world.Ian Axe, chief executive, has led a two-year transformation to turn the Anglo-French group into a more global business and give it a more commercial focus.Mr Axe has agreed to sell a majority stake in the group to the London Stock Exchange, and last year bought the International Derivatives Clearing Group from Nasdaq OMX to expand its business.LCH is also in talks to sell a stake in the business to SGX, the Singapore exchange.Mr Weisbrod’s last role at JPMorgan was vice-chairman for risk management. He also chaired its exchange & clearing house steering committee. He has also been a member of committees on the New York Federal Reserve and served on the board of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp, a bank-owned clearing house. He is also on the board of CLS, the foreign exchange settlement service.“I am delighted David is joining our team. He has vast risk management expertise, clearing knowledge and experience working with US regulators, and he joins the group at a critical stage of our US growth,” said Mr Axe.
179;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-02-11T19:02:06Z;Nasdaq held buyout talks with Carlyle;;Nasdaq OMX held early-stage talks with buyout firm Carlyle Group last month about leaving the public markets but they fell apart over a failure to agree a valuation for the stock exchange operator.The discussions, which came weeks after its main rival NYSE Euronext was acquired for $8.2bn, are no longer taking place, according to one person familiar with the talks.Adena Friedman, who was chief financial officer of Nasdaq before taking up the same role at Carlyle in 2011, introduced her former employers to the technology investment team at Carlyle. “They got to step three in a 100-step process,” added the person.Shares in Nasdaq jumped as much as 9 per cent in midday trading on Monday, reaching a 52-week high, as investors reacted to the reports, which were first reported by Fox Business Network. They later eased for a gain of 3.1 per cent on the day.Carlyle Group, which is listed on Nasdaq following its initial public offering last May, declined to comment while Nasdaq said it did not comment on market rumours.“You look at it because it is there and probably cheap,” said the head of private equity at one big buyout group. “There’s been a big cyclical decline in trading volumes and initial public offerings. The bet would be on a cyclical rebound, but increasingly exchanges are being disintermediated by dark pools and ETF platforms, and fees are under pressure.”News of the talks comes two months after IntercontinentalExchange announced plans to acquire the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange.Nasdaq shares have risen a fifth since the ICE-NYSE deal was announced. However, Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive, said after the NYSE Euronext takeover that the deal had not fundamentally changed the outlook for his business.That deal came as a surprise to Nasdaq, which only a year earlier had a hostile bid with ICE to acquire and break up NYSE Euronext, but abandoned the deal after US competition regulators threatened to sue to block the deal.In the time since, the exchange operator has sought to expand beyond a reliance on transactions, moving closer to an information and technology services company. Most recently, Nasdaq acquired the investor and public relations services unit of Thomson Reuters for $390m.Ms Friedman, who also was head of strategy at Nasdaq, played a leading role in the company’s $3.7bn acquisition in 2008 for OMX, the Scandinavian exchanges operator, according to a person familiar. The combined company’s capitalisation is just over $5bn.“We think private equity would potentially be very interested in a Nasdaq buyout given its strong cash flow characteristics and diversification away from trading,” said Chris Harris, exchange analyst at Wells Fargo Securities.“For its part, we think Nasdaq is likely frustrated with its valuation with the stock trading well below other exchange peers and financial technology companies.”
180;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-02-06T02:05:58Z;Nasdaq in talks on botched Facebook debut;;Nasdaq OMX is in early-stage talks with US regulators over a potential settlement stemming from the exchange operator’s botched handling of the Facebook public offering, people close to the situation said.System failures on Nasdaq last May left brokers angry and investors bewildered after the highly anticipated start to the trading of shares in the social networking site was plagued by errors.The exchange said later that a 20-minute delay in the trading of Facebook’s $16bn offering had been caused by a millisecond systems blip due to the largest IPO auction “in the history of mankind”.Since then Nasdaq has sought to repair relations with traders and reassure the market on the reliability of its technology.A potential settlement comes as the Securities and Exchange Commission has stepped up scrutiny of exchanges.Settlement discussions are at a preliminary stage, the people familiar with the situation said. A possible resolution, which could include a financial penalty, could be months away.The company is separately seeking approval from the SEC to proceed with $62m in voluntary payments to brokers who suffered losses on specific Facebook trades because of system failures.The SEC said last month that it would need until the end of March to decide on whether it would approve or deny that move by the exchange.“We’re working closely with the SEC to resolve issues that arose from the events on May 18,” Nasdaq said. “We continue to believe we acted appropriately and in the best interests of investors.” The SEC declined to comment.Brokers, including those at banks such as UBS and Citigroup, have claimed a total of $500m in damages related to Nasdaq’s handling of the Facebook debut. Some have also not ruled out legal challenges.News of the talks was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal.The SEC levied its first fine against an exchange last September, when it charged NYSE Euronext $5m to settle allegations that the bourse operator gave certain customers an advance look at trading information.
181;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-01-31T17:19:58Z;Nasdaq OMX boosted by stronger earnings;;Nasdaq OMX said it would increase spending on new initiatives this year as the transatlantic bourse operator looks to further develop its services and technology business against a backdrop of soft equity volumes.The company added that the planned $8.2bn takeover of its principal rival, NYSE Euronext, which operates the New York Stock Exchange, by the IntercontinentalExchange will not alter the competitive landscape it faces and validated moves taken in recent years to broaden its business.The statements came as the company said growth from its non-transaction based operations helped it report stronger-than-expected net profits for the fourth quarter.Nasdaq raised its forecasts for 2013 operating expenses to $990m, saying that an extra $50m-$60m would be needed “in incremental new initiative spending”.The company has sought to invest in and expand its services and technology-based business amid a steady fall in equity volumes that has weakened profits for exchanges.Those profits have been further hit by a shift in equity trading away from US public exchanges and moved on to alternative trading venues, which has continued so far this year.“We’re not at our level of comfort with respect to market share [in equities],” said Bob Greifeld, chief executive, who added that he was encouraged by signs of improvement in trading volumes and recent inflows into US equity mutual funds.Addressing the planned takeover of NYSE Euronext, Mr Greifeld said: “As we digested the ICE acquisition, the management team and the board really gained a sense of comfort with respect to the strategy that we’ve executed over last number of years.”As part of its efforts to move away from a reliance on equity volumes, the company added to its services business by acquiring the investor and public relations units of Thomson Reuters for $390m last month.Nasdaq has also taken steps in recent weeks to streamline internal units related to its services and information technology businesses, reassigning senior executives to focus on building those parts.“There were definitely positive on the revenue side, but the expense uptick in new initiatives will weigh on estimates going forward,” said Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill.Overall, the company reported total sales of $419m for the three months to December 31, down $1m from the same period a year earlier, ahead of market consensus forecasts. Revenues were boosted by a pick-up in Nasdaq’s corporate solutions business, where sales jumped to $31m, up $11m from a year ago.Net income rose to $85m, on earnings of 50 cents a share, up from $82m, on earnings of 45 cents a share a year ago. After adjusting for a tax benefit, legal expenses and other restructuring costs in the quarter, earnings of 64 cents a share were 3 cents better than analysts’ forecasts.Revenues from cash equities fell $47m, down 20 per cent from a year ago and accounted for just 11 per cent of the company’s total sales in the quarter.In the quarter, the company named Börje Ekholm, president of Investor AB, Nasdaq’s second-largest shareholder, chairman of the board and ended speculation that Bob Greifeld might shift into the role after leading the company for nearly a decade.The company’s $62m plan to compensate brokers suffered losses from Nasdaq’s botched handling of the Facebook public offering last May remains hung-up with regulators. The US Securities and Exchange Commission extended a deadline for a judgment, which was expected by the end of January, to March 29.Nasdaq shares lost 1.5 per cent to $27.56 by midday in New York.
182;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
183;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-01-29T15:02:05Z;Nasdaq OMX continues streamlining efforts;;Nasdaq OMX will combine its global data products and index businesses in a second round of internal streamlining as the group looks to build upon units that extend beyond purely matching trades on its exchange.The transatlantic bourse operator said on Tuesday that the move was intended to enable it to broaden its efforts to become a leading information provider for the financial services sector.It also comes two weeks after the company said it would combine its market technology and corporate services businesses, which followed its $390m acquisition of the investor and public relations parts of Thomson Reuters last month.Both efforts this month highlight the group’s attempts to diversify away from a dependence on transaction levels, which have slumped over the past four years and put pressure on its longstanding business model.“We’re called an exchange, but in reality what we do is quite different,” Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq, said in an interview with the Financial Times this month. “We are trying to build a balanced portfolio of businesses.”The company said the merged units, which will be called Global Information Services from this month, account for about a fifth of its overall revenues.John Jacobs, the company’s chief marketing officer and head of its global index business since 2003, will run the unit.The company said Mr Jacobs would step down from his role as chief marketing officer as part of the move and named Jeremy Skule to the position.Mr Skule, a former head of investor relations at MF Global, joined Nasdaq three months ago as head of global marketing and communications.Nasdaq is set to report its results for the fourth quarter of last year on Thursday.
184;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-01-24T20:59:58Z;Nasdaq’s Facebook settlement delayed again;;US regulators have once again delayed a decision on Nasdaq’s plan to compensate brokers for the exchange’s botched handling of the Facebook public offering last May.The US Securities and Exchange Commission said it will require an additional two months before it weighs in on Nasdaq’s $62m offer.It said in a filing that a new deadline of March 29 had been set for its decision, which had been expected later this month.The SEC said the extra time would let it better scrutinise Nasdaq’s proposal, which was first submitted last July.People familiar with the situation have said that they thought a delay was likely because the SEC has been restaffing senior positions. On Thursday, the Obama administration named Mary Jo White as the new head of the agency.The delays follows a similar move last October when regulators requested a three-month extension and said they had concerns about whether the proposal would promote equity principles of trade and protect investors.Regulators have faced pressure from brokers, including UBS and Citigroup, who claim they lost around $500m from the exchange’s mishandling of the Facebook IPO.The agency said it had received six new comment letters and a response letter from Nasdaq since the October extension.In a November letter to regulators, UBS said Nasdaq should boost the size of its compensation offer to better reflect the “massive damage [the exchange] caused to market participants through its gross handling of the Facebook IPO”.Nasdaq, in a December response, wrote: “The proposal is not designed . . . to address specific members’ individual problems, or to compensate members for losses not directly attributable to the Nasdaq system issues.”
185;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-01-17T21:31:21Z;Nasdaq merges units to broaden appeal;;Nasdaq OMX will merge its market technology and newly expanded corporate services business in a move that underlines the group’s diversification beyond purely matching trades on its exchanges.The transatlantic bourses operator said on Thursday it would focus on driving growth from its technology business, which has become a critical source of revenue as trading volumes have plummeted over the past four years.The move will combine Nasdaq’s $390m acquisition of the investor and public relations units of Thomson Reuters last month, a purchase which reinforced its extensive two-year push into a relatively new area it calls “market services”.These services are designed to exploit the growing use of computers for trading. They include a suite of businesses involved in trading on equity markets such as pre-trade risk management, “real time” market surveillance, and co-location, which allows traders to place their computers next to an exchange’s matching system to cut trading times.The corporate solutions business sells market intelligence and software which allows corporate board members to access confidential documents. Nasdaq has estimated that the acquisition of the Thomson Reuters businesses will take non-transaction revenue to around 74 per cent of its total revenue.The merged units – to be called Global Technology Solutions – will be led by long-time chief information officer Anna Ewing.“We intend to continue to build this leading franchise into one of the top technology organisations in the world and this reorganisation reflects our focus and commitment to this exciting and growing segment of our business,” said Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive.The group has also hired Bradley Peterson from Charles Schwab as chief information officer. Mr Peterson, who held a similar role at the retail broker, will join on February 6 and report to Ms Ewing.Nasdaq, which is set to deliver its fourth-quarter results in two weeks, said it would break out the combined units as a separate segment effective from the start of this year.Shares in the company rose 0.7 per cent, slightly ahead of the broader market, to $27.04 in New York.
186;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2013-01-14T23:46:08Z;SEC in landmark ruling on Nasdaq plan;;The Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected a move by Nasdaq OMX to provide brokerages with a certain type of new stock order, marking the first time the market regulator has disapproved of such computerised trading tools.The unprecedented decision by the SEC points to the growing regulatory scrutiny of exchanges amid an industry outcry over conflicts of interest in the share trading business.For months, Nasdaq had sought approval to offer a set of widely used computer algorithms that are usually provided to traders by large broker-dealers to engage in a computer-driven trading strategy.Facing pressure from declining US equity trading activity, senior Nasdaq officials said they wanted to offer the new services to drive down costs for smaller trading firms that must rent the proprietary products from larger firms.A source familiar with the SEC’s decision, which was outlined in a filing on Friday, said this was the first instance in which the regulator had disapproved of an exchange order-type proposal.In its decision, the SEC focused its concerns on guidelines that allow exchanges regulatory immunity, whereby they are protected from liability for problems that may arise from the use of certain orders.The SEC said Nasdaq failed to respond with “any substantive analysis on whether regulatory immunity . . . would impose an undue burden on competition”. A spokesman for Nasdaq declined to comment.The issue of exchange immunity came into focus last year after brokers said they suffered $500m in losses from the bungled Facebook public offering on Nasdaq. The exchange is awaiting a decision from the SEC on a $62m voluntary compensation plan for brokers that is expected in the coming weeks, but has stressed that it was not legally compelled to seek such a large payout.Analysts on Monday said disagreements over order-type proposals were often resolved through extensive contact between the SEC and an exchange, during which the public was invited to submit comments. In most instances, a proposal that is unlikely to be approved is withdrawn by the exchange before the SEC makes a ruling.“This is a precedent-setting event in that it may encourage more comments and debate on different issues, especially knowing that the SEC will take those views into consideration,” said Christopher Nagy, a US-based consultant to exchanges and broker-dealers.“Up until now, the industry view has been that the SEC typically bends over backwards for exchanges when they file for the right to offer new order-types,” he said.The ruling was greeted with relief by the wider industry as Nasdaq’s efforts were met with criticism from Sifma, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, which among others represents the interests of large brokerages.“It would be an incongruous result if Nasdaq were permitted to use regulatory immunity as a shield against liability, while competing algorithm providers offering the same services may assume unlimited liability,” Sifma said in an October letter.In October, an SEC commissioner said at the Sifma conference that provisions that allowed US stock exchanges to write their own rules, given they were now for-profit entities, were outdated and needed to be reviewed.
187;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-12-21T05:23:21Z;Guest post: Do western exchanges lead the way? Perhaps not;;"By Ulf Carlsson of NASDAQ OMXThere are clear signs that high frequency trading has reached the Asia-Pacific region, and not simply based on the flurry of recent industry conferences on the subject. Order-to-trade ratios in the markets have grown steadily over the last five years as an increasing number of hedge funds and market making firms have set up business in the region. Most regional exchanges are showing a greater focus on speed and are offering first class co-location facilities to their client trading firms. At the same time, software vendors are flying in from London and New York to offer their high speed services to potential Asia-Pacific customers. We also experienced our first flash crash this past October at the NSE in India.Regulators across the region are struggling to keep up with these changes; they’re also initiating market consultations and closely monitoring the major European Union and US regulatory proposals, such as Dodd-Frank, ESMA, and MiFID II.All this activity in the west raises the question of whether Asia-Pacific markets should follow suit. Does the west always lead the way when it comes to electronic trading and implementing risk protection measures to prevent flash crashes, fat finger incidents and alike? Is the west right to go east preaching HFT lessons learned? Should eastern markets even look west for solutions to avoid future electronic market catastrophes? Perhaps not.History has shown that Asia-Pacific markets were early adopters of electronic trading, well before many developed markets in the west. Markets in Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and Taiwan were already starting to trade electronically in the early 1990s, at a time when most US markets still considered physical trading floors the only places to trade.During this period many Asia-Pacific markets were addressing important concerns such as the impact of faulty orders on their markets and the consequences of position limits being breached. Japan’s stock market, for instance, introduced a type of single stock circuit breaker called a “special quotation” to prevent heavy market fluctuations. In China, pre-trade risk controls are prerequisites for all trading. Individual investor accounts are checked for position limits before orders can reach the order book. In India, real-time collateral checks are performed. Such advanced risk controls are still being tackled and debated in the west.Asia-Pacific has also had its fair share of trading mishaps, one example being the J-Com fat finger incident in Japan back in 2005, when a dealer mistakenly offered to sell 610,000 shares for one yen each in recruiting company J-Com, instead of one share for Y610,000, which highlighted the vulnerability and lack of pre-trade risk controls.Further, one can argue that although many Asia-Pacific markets were early adopters of electronic trading, the region hasn’t innovated often enough. Most Asia-Pacific markets are trading based on rules and practices that have generally not been updated in more than 20 years.Yet I believe the west can learn from the east’s experience in developing robust risk controls, and the east could benefit from the west when it comes to market innovation and deregulation, which has created deeper liquidity and fairer markets.The east should not wait for new regulations from the west before considering the needs of its markets. Rather, Asia-Pacific markets should contribute their experience and knowledge to the international discussion and actively participate in the development of new global standards for electronic trading that will help create safer, fairer and more liquid markets everywhere.When we all share, beyond boundaries, one unified voice – and accept each other’s strengths and weaknesses – we all win.Ulf Carlsson is head of north Asia and Japan, NASDAQ OMXRelated reading:

188;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-12-14T00:42:52Z;Nasdaq OMX appoints Ekholm as chairman;;Nasdaq OMX appointed Börje Ekholm, president of Investor AB, the Swedish investment company controlled by the Wallenberg family, as chairman of the transatlantic exchange operator.The move, announced late on Thursday, put to an end market speculation that the Nasdaq chief executive, Robert Greifeld, might shift into the chairman role after leading the company for nearly a decade.Mr Ekholm became interim chairman of Nasdaq OMX in May after the retirement of H. Furlong Baldwin, which came soon after technical problems at the exchange delayed the start to trading of Facebook’s high-profile $16.1bn initial public offering.Just days before his resignation, the outgoing chairman defended Mr Greifeld’s leadership of the company at an investor meeting even as controversy swirled around its handling of the social networking site’s listing.Investor AB, which Mr Ekholm has run since 2005, is the second-largest shareholder in Nasdaq, with a stake of 11.7 per cent.“This is an exciting time to be at Nasdaq OMX, and I am humbled by the confidence expressed in me by the board of directors,” Mr. Ekholm said. “So much has been accomplished by this board and under the leadership of Bob Greifeld and his team, and still there remain ample opportunities to continue to improve and expand the business profitably.’’Last week, Mr Greifeld took steps to reduce his personal holding in Nasdaq through the exercise of up to 1m in stock options.Nasdaq is still awaiting guidance from US securities regulators on whether it can proceed with its proposed $62m voluntary compensation offer over certain bungled Facebook trades. Some brokers, who claim to have suffered up to $500m in damages as a result of Nasdaq errors are seeking to reclaim all of their losses.Earlier on Thursday, Nasdaq cancelled dozens of trades in nine of Wall Street’s biggest stocks, including Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Hewlett-Packard, after shares in the companies fluctuated wildly in the minute before the market opened.
189;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-12-13T23:56:50Z;Nasdaq cancels trades in major stocks;Nine of Wall Street’s biggest companies caught in glitch;Nasdaq cancelled dozens of trades in nine of Wall Street’s biggest stocks, including Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Hewlett-Packard, after shares in the companies fluctuated wildly in the minute before the market opened on Thursday.The exchange operator said it would cancel all trades in the stocks that were at a variation of more than 10 per cent from the previous day’s closing price.According to trading data analysis from Nanex, a market research company, the cancellations related to $2.2m worth of transactions. Hundreds of other trades which traded within a 10 per cent band of variation, which included a handful of other stocks, were not rescinded.The cancellation highlights what has become a feature of fragmented US markets which are increasingly dominated by high-frequency traders using complex order models that transact in microseconds.The cancelled trades included 12 deals in Goldman Sachs shares executed at $94.01 during the 60-second window before the market opened, according to trading data. The Goldman stock later traded at around $118.50 during market hours in New York on Thursday.More than 50 transactions in Hewlett-Packard shares at $3.06, some 80 per cent below their price on Thursday, were also cancelled, as were trades in shares of Wells Fargo, AT&T, Kroger Co, Ventas Inc, Western Union and Sprint Nextel.Under the guidelines used by the self-regulating exchanges, a trading firm can request a cancellation of certain trades if it can demonstrate an error has taken place.The decision by Nasdaq to cancel certain trades followed an early alert it issued that it was investigating “potentially erroneous transactions” in 16 stocks.Nasdaq declined to comment beyond the trade alerts which it issued. A person familiar with the situation said: “Member firms, their trading strategies or volumes involved in a given clearly erroneous filing cannot be disclosed as its material information that can effect trading and the integrity of the overall marketplace.”Another person familiar with talks to review the trades said the orders originated from a single large broker, but declined to name the company on the grounds that it was an exchange client. This person added: “There was a customer this morning that had market data issues, which resulted in a bunch of erroneous trades.”The Securities and Exchanges Commission has said it believes that the self-regulatory framework governing the activities of the exchanges must be reviewed.Nasdaq has faced scrutiny related to a variety of problems during the year, led by the botched Facebook initial public offering in May. Brokers are still seeking to recover $500m from losses which they claim as a result of the float.Transactions deemed erroneous that first occurred on Nasdaq in October forced it to cancel trades in Kraft Foods, just as it was celebrating the move of its listing from the New York Stock Exchange.
190;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-12-12T14:52:19Z;Nasdaq OMX buys Thomson Reuters units;;Nasdaq OMX is to buy the investor and public relations units of Thomson Reuters in a $390m cash deal as the transatlantic exchanges operator seeks to generate more earnings away from trading.The businesses, which offer online information, multimedia and tools for investor relations and public relations professionals, will extend Nasdaq’s push into services for corporations.The purchase of the Thomson Reuters divisions also represents Nasdaq’s largest deal to date in corporate services. In recent months it has made small bolt-on acquisitions such as Glide Technologies and BWise of the Netherlands. About 70 per cent of Nasdaq’s total revenues comes from “non-transaction” services, such as surveillance and sales of trading technology.The bourse estimated the purchases of the Thomson Reuters business would take revenues in Corporate Services from nearly $100m this year to $331m. It would also generating operating synergies of $35m within three years, Nasdaq added.Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, said: “In one acquisition, we accelerate and achieve our corporate solutions long-term objectives, while maintaining our balanced strategy of delivering value to shareholders.”Thomson Reuters has faced soft markets for trading and extensive job cuts in the financial services industry. The division is one of several non-core businesses that Thomson Reuters is considering divesting as the financial and professional data group seeks to stem falling operating profits. It has also faced intense competition from rivals Bloomberg and FactSet.Mr Greifeld said the deal would add more value to shareholders in the long term than other options to improve shareholder returns, such as a share buyback programme. Shares in Nasdaq rose 4.2 per cent to $22.4 in morning trade in New York.Turnover at Nasdaq OMX’s six-year-old corporate services business rose more than a third to $24m in the third quarter compared with last year, but the unit represents less than 10 per cent of the group’s total net revenues. It said the deal would allow it to increase the turnover from its corporate services businesses outside the US.Nasdaq OMX’s corporate services business was the subject of an attempted hacking in early 2011. The hackers targeted its Directors Desk unit, which stores data for Fortune 500 companies, looking for confidential data to trade.The deal for the Thomson Reuters business is expected to close in the first half of next year. Nasdaq has made a binding offer but it will not become definitive until both companies talk to employee representatives.www.ft.com/tradingroom
191;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-12-10T22:03:17Z;Nasdaq OMX targets European derivatives trades;;Nasdaq OMX is to build a pan-European equity derivatives business to compete with rivals NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse after buying a stake in a Dutch equity derivatives broker.The transatlantic exchanges operator will buy a 25 per cent stake in The Order Machine, a start-up backed by banks and brokers, which has carved out a 15 per cent market share in the Netherlands, Europe’s second-largest options market.Nasdaq OMX also has a five-year option to acquire another 25.1 per cent stake to give it majority control, and will take seats on the Tom supervisory and management boards. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.The move underlines how Nasdaq OMX is pushing to grab market share in European derivatives trading as incoming rules push more of the over-the-counter market on to transparent trading venues.In the next year, the Amsterdam-based group is aiming to double its local market share but longer term, Nasdaq and Tom are looking to take on NYSE Liffe and Eurex, the dominant local market operators.In doing so, Nasdaq and Tom are looking to reshape equity options trading in Europe in the same manner as Chi-X Europe has in cash equities markets. Today, most of Europe’s incumbent exchanges trade only 60-70 per cent of the equities listed on their bourses. Nasdaq OMX is also developing a separate derivatives venue trading fixed-income contracts, called NLX.“It’s not just a Dutch play. It’s about our quest to create a pan-European platform,” said Hans-Ole Jochumsen, executive vice-president, global data products and transaction services Nordics, Nasdaq OMX.Nasdaq OMX has tried to build pan-European trading platforms in the past, but Neuro, a share trading venture, and Easdaq, failed to make headway. Consultants have argued that Europe’s listed options markets have stagnated in comparison to their US counterparts in the past decade.Tom has been backed by two of Europe’s largest electronic market makers, Optiver and IMC Financial Markets, retail bank BinckBank and ABN Amro Clearing Bank. Nasdaq will also become a market maker for Tom and will provide a London-based based trading platform. The current shareholders will reduce their stakes pro rata to accommodate Nasdaq OMX.Last month, Tom executed its millionth trade, just 10 months after launching and has further plans to extend the numbers of contracts it can trade. By comparison, NYSE trades an average of 3.5m contracts per day. Nevertheless, last month Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE, called Tom “an initiative that needs to be taken seriously”.“First we want to get the Dutch market share up to 30-40 per cent. That’s our target for next year,” said Willem Meijer, chief executive of Tom. “We will work on going pan-European but it’s part of a longer-term plan.”Traders in Amsterdam have welcomed the competition Tom has brought to the market but warned that clearing remained an issue, as contracts bought on one exchange cannot be sold on another.
192;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-12-05T19:55:03Z;Nasdaq bungles WhiteHorse IPO;;Nasdaq OMX, the exchange operator that botched the Facebook public float, was caught at the centre of another troubled attempt to list an initial public offering on Wednesday.The exchange was forced to postpone a planned $100m listing of WhiteHorse Finance, a business-development company that originates and invests in loans to small companies, after what it described as a human error.People familiar with the situation said WhiteHorse and its underwriters had chosen to extend the start time for trading by five minutes and in its effort to communicate the decision, Nasdaq inadvertently said the listing had been cancelled.In May, a systems error at Nasdaq delayed and plagued the opening hours of this year’s largest IPO, Facebook’s $16.1bn float, that left the market for new share issues rattled for weeks.On Wednesday, Nasdaq insisted that the error was caused by its MarketWatch division, which is in charge of communicating IPO launches, and was not due to its technology.The exchange said it then cancelled the queue of pending orders in WhiteHorse, adding that no positions had been taken and no losses were suffered by investors.“Due to a Nasdaq human error, the initial public offering of WhiteHorse Finance has been rescheduled,” the company said in an alert to traders at 1:41pm.Nasdaq said it rescheduled the IPO for later in the afternoon and the listing occurred without any further issues.WhiteHorse closed 7.3 per cent lower to $13.90 after having offered 6.7m shares a day earlier at a price of $15 per share. Shares in Nasdaq OMX closed 2 per cent lower, with most of its losses on the day coming after the mishap.Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Barclays were listed as lead underwriters of the offering. All declined to comment. Nasdaq declined to comment beyond the trade alerts. WhiteHorse did not respond to a request for comment.Nasdaq’s listings business has faced scrutiny since the high-profile botch of the Facebook float as brokers look to recoup some $500m in losses they say were suffered as a result.The exchange has offered a $62m voluntary compensation plan, which is awaiting regulatory approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Some, including Citigroup, have not ruled out a lawsuit to recoup their full losses from the Facebook IPO.
193;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-11-14T08:36:22Z;Guest post: Latin America’s capital markets need a group effort;;"On Wednesday, the FT publishes a special report on Latin American capital markets. Here, Lars Ottersgård of NASDAQ OMX argues that the region’s bourses should adopt a single brand.When your country houses the third largest securities exchange in the world as Brazil does, you’re not technically emerging anymore, are you? Indeed, recent numbers on BM&FBovespa’s derivatives market alone show an increase of 25m contracts in the first eight months of 2012 compared to the same period in 2011. Those are impressive numbers that show solid growth despite a global economy that continues to be riddled with low investor confidence and constant revisions to the regulatory landscape.But Brazil is simply the largest country in a vastly diverse and complex region of the world. Indeed, a recent third quarter report from BBVA shows lingering doubts about the sustainability of Brazil’s growth model, particularly when contrasted with Mexico’s competitive gains. A growing, foreseeable risk is the possibility of Latin America being severely impacted if the Brazilian economy does not continue with its impressive recent growth rate.This is both a blessing and curse. The diversity and depth is certainly something to embrace as it shows a prime opportunity for growth from all directions with the stronger markets off-setting the weaker ones as demand waxes and wanes over time. Countries in the region boast stronger financial positions, with higher international reserves, better fiscal balances and a shock absorber through flexible exchange rates. Yet simultaneously, getting one unified regional voice from a group of countries with unwavering national pride and competitiveness with each other is a challenge unto itself. But if Latin America wants to compete for investors on the same playing field as Europe or North America, these sovereign assets, these national exchanges, should consider playing on the same team and sharing a single voice and brand.Take the Nordic marketplace, for example.As the European exchange landscape heavily swayed towards Continental Europe and Britain, the Nordic markets were too small to seriously compete. To bolster the region’s competitiveness within the broader European landscape and enjoy the spoils of a wider customer base, the Nordic markets needed to cooperate together. So, they built a common business and technical framework with one access, one platform and one set of rules and regulations.The Nordic integration process started in 1997 when the Danish and Swedish Exchanges started NOREX (Nordic Exchange Alliance), a cooperation designed to create a joint marketplace. In 2003, NASDAQ OMX (then OM) bought HEX, owner of the Finnish, Estonian and Latvian Exchanges. In 2004, OM bought the Lithuanian Exchange and in the following year it snapped up the Copenhagen Stock Exchange.The ensuing migration and integration projects in 2005 resulted in one common technical platform where 70 members, three exchanges and 30 market data vendors were integrated into a single technical platform that also included common information distribution and market surveillance systems. On the business side, one shared set of Nordic market rules were put into effect, opening hours were harmonized and one set of member application and trader registration processes were developed. The migration also resulted in common indices, statistical reports and a shared brand.Today, the successful integration in the Nordics has created a single point of entry for members to reach several countries and asset classes on a joined platform, despite the different cultures, languages and currencies of each individual market. The member rules, the processes for onboarding and the interfaces at the exchanges are all the same. This harmonization of IT (access) and trading rules has created a successful common region for financial transactions that has attracted both local and international investment.Currently, Latin America provides a solid example of regionalization in action through MILA (Mercado Integrado Latinoamericano), which has integrated the exchanges and central securities depositories of Colombia, Perú and Chile. The goal was to develop the capital markets through the integration of the three marketplaces, thus giving investors a greater supply of securities, issuers, and also larger sources of funding. Another potential benefit for the MILA exchanges is greater income based on larger transaction volumes. Indeed, the collaboration can be seen as a strong competitor for both IPOs and DFI. Yet, MILA hasn’t had the tremendous debut it hoped when it launched last year.One of the biggest challenges for MILA has been cross-border taxation. As globalization continues on the regional level, there needs to be dialogue among the various regulators and tax authorities. Tax treaties, in particular, are a significant issue. Creation of a tax-neutral, level playing field for cross-border transactions would allow investment decisions to be based on investment fundamentals rather than taxation.There are obvious benefits for other Latin American exchanges to join the MILA alliance, small and large players alike. Bolsa Mexicana de Valores has expressed its intention to seek MILA membership which, based on a number of statistics, would rank MILA as a very strong second place behind BM&FBOVESPA. And the blueprint for success exists. The region, however, needs to take into consideration the best practices that worked not only in the Nordics but also for the three European exchanges that formed Euronext in 2000 and, ironically, the three Colombian stock markets that joined to create the Bolsa de Valores de Colombia (BVC) in 2001.As foreign investors continue to mine the globe for both short- and long-term growth markets, it’s hard to find a region as richly unique as Latin America; a region that is so distinctly tapped into its local pride but also identifies itself as an international player. Creating a packaged regional offering would simplify foreign investment, and streamline communication and technological integration between national exchanges that need to work hand in glove with one another. In other words, growing the Latin American market is a group effort.Lars Ottersgård is senior vice president and head of market technology, NASDAQ OMXRelated reading:
Latin American Capital Markets 2012, FT special report"
194;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-10-30T01:50:49Z;SEC delays decision on IPO compensation;;US regulators have delayed a decision on Nasdaq’s plan to compensate brokers for the exchange’s botched handling of the Facebook public offering in May.The Securities and Exchange Commission said that it needed further time to review concerns put forward in eight comment letters received after Nasdaq filed its $62m accommodation offer.“The concerns articulated by commenters …raise questions about whether the accommodation proposal would promote just and equitable principles of trade, protect investors and the public interest, and not be designed to permit unfair discrimination between market participants,” the SEC said in an update posted to its website on Monday.Regulators have faced pressure to reject the offer from some brokers, including Citigroup and UBS, which are seeking to recover their entire losses from the glitch-ridden flotation and have previously said they may pursue legal action against the exchange. In all, brokers say they have lost about $500m from the event.Others such as Knight Capital and Citadel have urged the SEC to approve the plan after Nasdaq amended and improved the terms of the compensation offer.The SEC now has until early next year to approve the planned offer. Nasdaq declined to comment.
195;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-10-24T12:49:25Z;Lower trading volumes hamper Nasdaq;US equity revenues drop to $47m;Nasdaq OMX said net profits at the global exchange operator slipped in the third quarter, blaming a less volatile trading climate for a decline in sales at its core US equity business.The parent company of the Nasdaq Stock Market said that, unlike in the previous quarter, it was not able to overcome the gloom in the wider industry, which had faced pressure to adapt to an environment where US equity volumes were set to decline for a fourth consecutive year.US equity revenues dropped to $47m, down $20m from the same three-month period last year. The company said the fall was due to a highly active third quarter a year ago when the European debt crisis and US debt ceiling negotiations gripped markets.Net income fell 19.1 per cent to $89m in the three months to September 30, with earnings of 52 cents a share down from 61 cents the same time a year ago. Net revenues declined to $409m, compared with $436m the year before.Robert Greifeld, chief executive, said the company’s result were aided by efforts to diversify business away from a reliance on equity volumes, which fell more than 30 per cent year on year.Christopher Harris, analyst at Wells Fargo, said the results benefited from a reduced guidance for full-year expenses, which Nasdaq said would be about 1.5 per cent lower.The company made no direct mention of its $62m voluntary accommodation plan for brokers, who say they suffered some $500m from the botched flotation of the Facebook public offering on the US exchange in May. Later, on a call with analysts, Mr Greifeld said that $4m in legal expenses related to the fallout from the Facebook debacle.That offer has received mixed reactions, with some still insisting they will seek to recover their entire losses. Last month, Nasdaq OMX fired back at banks such as Citigroup and UBS, who have criticised the offer, saying it “goes well beyond what is required”.Nasdaq’s third quarter was also marked by another embarrassing episode. It and other stock exchanges were forced to cancel trades in Kraft Foods after an error, blamed on a “clearly erroneous trade” originating at a member firm, sent its shares up almost 30 per cent in the opening minutes of trading.The glitch took place while the exchange was hosting officials from the company to celebrate the split group’s recent switch to Nasdaq. Responding to analysts who raised the incident as an ongoing concern of investors, Mr Greifeld said that extending circuit breakers designed to limit the impact of such errors to the full trading day would be a “very good evolution of the market”.Shares in Nadsaq fell 0.6 per cent to $23.99 just before midday in New York.
196;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-10-03T22:09:05Z;Nasdaq suffers fresh high-profile gaffe;Glitch blamed for spike in Kraft shares;Nasdaq suffered its second high-profile embarrassment in six months when it was forced to cancel trades in Kraft Foods after a trading glitch caused the company’s shares to soar nearly 30 per cent.The error marred the completion of the recently split group’s switch to Nasdaq and evoked memories of the exchange’s botched handling of the Facebook flotation in May.The trading error and cancellation came a day after US regulators met to address concerns about the impact of technology on market stability. Weeks after Nasdaq’s bungled handling of Facebook’s public offering, a software error at Knight Capital caused the electronic trading and brokerage company to suffer a $440m loss, sending it to the brink of bankruptcy.Kraft shares, which together with Mondelez, the global snacks group created in the split, switched their listing from the New York Stock Exchange to Nasdaq, surged as much as 28.9 per cent to $58.54 in the first minute of trading seconds after Irene Rosenfeld, the company’s former chief executive, rang the market’s opening bell.Within an hour, Nasdaq and other stock exchanges conducted a review of the processed trades, deemed them erroneous and cancelled them.Initial investigations suggested the erroneous trades were the result of a faulty trading algorithm. The episode highlights concerns among some market participants that the speed of transactions, driven by technical advances, often leaves the market susceptible to potentially hazardous errors.“That’s the problem with our market structure today, there is no room for any type of error,” said Sal Arnuk, co-head of Themis Trading and a critic of high-frequency trading. “These electronic trading systems and the HFT market-makers are set up to inflict the maximum amount of pain on any mistake.”Kraft’s shares quickly retreated after the trades were cancelled and closed down 1.2 per cent to $44.87.“Participants should review their trading activity for potentially erroneous trades and request adjudication through the ‘Clearly Erroneous’ process within the applicable timeframe for filing pursuant to the rule,” Nasdaq said in a statement.Kraft said the company was looking into the situation but declined to comment further.“Trading in Kraft was affected by a broker error that impacted multiple stock exchanges,” Nasdaq said. “Nasdaq’s systems performed normally and the industry’s process for handling these issues worked as intended.” The exchange declined to name the company where the trading error originated.Eric Hunsader, chief executive of Nanex, a market data company, said the problem appeared to be an algorithm that was trying to buy 30,000 shares in Kraft but did not want to skew the market by buying them all at once. “The trades were spread out by milliseconds and look to have executed at 11 different trading venues,” Mr Hunsader said.Ms Rosenfeld decided last year to separate Kraft into a US grocery business, which would maintain its name, and an international snacks business to be called Mondelez, which she would lead.Kraft said last June that both companies would be listed on the Nasdaq, dealing a blow to the NYSE. The move surprised some after glitches occurred during the opening minutes of trading for Facebook but Kraft said it was confident in Nasdaq and that it had been drawn to the exchange’s liquidity and cost effectiveness.
197;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-09-25T04:01:09Z;Nasdaq markets space in Amazon’s cloud;;Nasdaq OMX is offering Wall Street brokers a chance to store key regulatory data on Amazon’s “cloud” computers, marking the ecommerce conglomerate’s boldest incursion into the financial services sector.The move taps into the desire of banks and brokers to cut costs in the face of thinner trading volumes and new regulations. Some have settled on outsourcing expensive back-office technology infrastructure as one solution.Amazon has already revolutionised businesses ranging from bookselling to warehousing with its combination of low prices and high technology.Nasdaq OMX’s service will enable brokers to store information such as trading records or customer emails on Amazon’s servers. Regulators require companies to hold such information for a period of seven years and many companies do so on costly internal systems.“Storing and retrieving data can be done quickly, easily and inexpensively,” said Andy Jassy, a senior vice president at Amazon Web Services. “With the scalability, cost-effectiveness and flexibility of the cloud, customers can quickly conduct analysis and reporting regardless of the amount of data.”Thousands of companies already run parts of their business using Amazon’s cloud service, which has grown rapidly in its six-year history.Asked if real-time stock trading could eventually take place on Amazon’s cloud, Mr Jassy said: “It is a possibility.”Some observers, however, warned that Wall Street may be hesitant to embrace external data storage services due to potential risks.“Reliability, security, accessibility and performance are the key drivers for capital markets and the most well-known cloud services are not known for being able to deliver their level of expectations,” Mark Palmer, chief executive of Streambase, a US trading software group.Nasdaq said records compiled by FinQloud will be kept at an Amazon data centre in Virginia, but would pass through its own data centre to receive additional security encryption. Amazon data centres suffered three outages in the past 18 months.The partnership with Amazon comes as Nasdaq has sought to offset a decline in its trading revenues by selling more data services.Eric Noll, executive vice president at Nasdaq, said brokerage companies could save up to 80 per cent from their storage costs by switching to FinQloud, which will initially be available only to US traders but may be adopted for other markets.Rick Lane, chief technology officer for Trading Technologies, a US financial software business, said: “The industry is trending in this direction. Firms are realising that building their own big-data solutions within a cloud is expensive to create, difficult to maintain and costly to access.”The financial industry is preparing for increased oversight by regulators and Nasdaq said FinQloud may help brokers to manage the demand.Earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved a plan to require exchanges to establish a tracking database for single orders, a large-scale surveillance system proposed in the aftermath of the 2010 “flash crash”.Additional reporting by Tracy Alloway in New York.
198;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-09-19T22:18:51Z;Nasdaq answers Facebook settlement critics;;Nasdaq OMX fired back at critics of its proposed plan to compensate its members for the glitch-ridden debut of Facebook on its stock exchange.The exchange operator, in a charged letter posted by regulators on Wednesday, defended its voluntary $62m accommodation offer saying it “goes well beyond what is required” under current rules and “specifically prioritises the compensation of investors”.Citigroup and UBS, in letters filed last month, urged regulators to reject the exchange’s proposal on the grounds that it was insufficient in size and are seeking full reimbursement for their losses.The response comes as the Securities and Exchange Commission must weigh in on the exchange’s proposal, amid increasing pressure from some of Nasdaq’s most important members to reject the plan.The banks have previously said their losses from the bungled trades, which took place after errors by Nasdaq delayed the start to trading of Facebook shares in May, amounted to $20m and SFr349m, respectively.In the letter, Nasdaq defended its plan to cover four specific trading losses during a specific timeframe, which it said “should have been ample time for a reasonably diligent member to identify any unexpected losses or unanticipated positions”.Citigroup and UBS are considering legal action against Nasdaq OMX, people close the situation have said.The exchange operator also warned if the plan is not approved by regulators that it would limit its liability to $500,000, the maximum liability it faces under its rules.UBS and Knight Capital, an electronic trading company, have also challenged Nasdaq’s requirement for participants who subscribe to the settlement to release the company from all other claims related to the Facebook IPO. Nasdaq said that the use of a release is routine and that it is “not willing to subsidise the costs of future litigation against itself”.The SEC declined to comment but is expected to weigh on the matter by the end of next month.Nasdaq highlighted that its settlement has won the support of Knight Capital and Citadel, some of its largest market-making clients, who have urged regulators to approve the offer.
199;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-08-22T18:31:09Z;Exchanges hit again by trading error;;The Nasdaq Stock Market and other exchanges cancelled trades in a security on Wednesday after erroneous orders triggered a steep rise in its share price in a matter of seconds.The cancellation highlights what is becoming a frequent feature of trading on stock exchanges as the rise of automated and high-frequency trading has increased the likelihood that mistaken orders take place.Next month, the Securities and Exchange Commission is holding a roundtable to discuss concerns over software glitches and other trading errors after Knight Capital, a leading broker and market maker, lost $440m this month.Shares in Peet’s Coffee and Tea jumped nearly 5 per cent on unusually high volume just after the electronic stock exchange opened in New York.Nasdaq said in an alert that it would cancel all trades at or above $76.11 executed between 9.31am and 9.32am in shares of the coffee retailing chain that is traded on its exchange.The company’s shares – which opened at $73.89 – jumped to as high as $77.47 in the opening two minutes of trading, according to Bloomberg data.Citing guidelines, Nasdaq said it could not name the firm or firms from where the trading error might have occurred.Earlier this month, a faulty software trading programme nearly sent Knight Capital Group, one of the largest market makers in the US, into bankruptcy.Knight was hit by a $440m loss when the programme, commonly referred to as a trading algorithm, unleashed unintended orders in dozens of stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. The exchange cancelled just 6 of the 148 stocks it reviewed in the aftermath, leaving Knight Capital with a significant capital shortfall.Knight was rescued by a consortium of investors who took a 70 per cent stake in the company in exchange for the much-needed funding. The episode at Knight left many market participants recalling a string of trading glitches that have plagued US markets since the so-called “flash crash” in May 2010, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted hundreds of points in a matter of minutes.Nasdaq was criticised this year when a delay caused by an error on its systems hit the debut of trading in shares of Facebook.The exchange has volunteered to reimburse its members, who say they have had hundreds of millions of dollars in loss, with a cash amount of $62m.“Today’s modern high-frequency trading market makers are so efficient . . . meaning errors made in the marketplace that may have just been a simple landmine all of a sudden can become an atom bomb,” said Sal Arnuk, a high-frequency trading critic and co-head of Themis Trading.Confidence in US equity market structures is at an all-time low following the glitches that hit Knight Capital, according to a report released this week by Tabb Group, the US capital market consultancy.
200;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-07-25T15:14:57Z;Nasdaq defies trading gloom;;Growth in Nasdaq OMX’s non-trading business helped the global exchange operator report a 1.1 per cent rise in profit for the second quarter, which was dominated by scrutiny of the glitch-ridden Facebook debut.The parent company of the Nasdaq Stock Market defied wider industry gloom in a low volume trading environment to report results that beat analysts’ forecasts.Net income rose to $92m, up $1m from the same quarter a year ago. Earnings of 64 cents a share were 2 cents improved and 4 cents ahead of analysts’ expectations for the quarter ending June 30.The gains from its non-core trading business, including market data and broker services, helped limit a 3.7 per cent decline in revenues from its core US equity cash trading business, which fell to $373m. Overall, net revenues fell 1.6 per cent to $688m.Robert Greifeld, chief executive, said that the quarter showed that Nasdaq could grow its business in spite of the trading environment, which has put increased strain on exchanges to find new streams of revenues.“The second quarter saw a continuation of solid growth in our recurring and subscription-based businesses,” he said.Shares in Nasdaq OMX outpaced the overall market and closed 4.8 per cent higher to $22.87.Mr Greifeld added that Nasdaq has prepared “significant legal defences” in the event of litigation by its customers – brokers who say they have lost hundreds of millions of dollars from the bungled start to trading of Facebook on May 18.The social networking site’s debut was delayed by glitches that left traders and retail investors confused about their actual holdings. The fallout has been widely cited as hurting investor confidence at time when volume on equity markets has dropped to multiyear lows.Mr Greifeld said he expected regulators to open a 21-day comment period on Nasdaq’s revised $62m all-cash accommodation plan within the next week.The company said the payout would likely take place in the fourth quarter of this year if approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.Rich Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, said: “Nasdaq was cautious about the accommodation plan and it appears it has the support of a few large market makers.”“The cash earnings that Nasdaq generates should adequately provide for the cash payment, if its approved by the SEC, without disrupting other uses of their cash.”In June, Nasdaq paid its first quarterly cash dividend of 13 cents a share. The company repurchased $125m of its stock over the quarter.Net debt fell 6.1 per cent to $1.5bn, even as it said it had cash holdings of $491m, down from $506m a year ago. The company used $57m of its cash to acquire a majority stake in BWise, a software provider.
201;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-07-20T23:17:09Z;Nasdaq lifts Facebook payout offer;;Nasdaq has offered to pay $62m to aggrieved brokers who have said they lost hundreds of millions of dollars from the glitch-ridden Facebook debut on the stock exchange in May.The new compensation programme represents a 50 per cent increase from a plan spelt out in June by Nasdaq OMX Group, parent company of the Nasdaq Stock Market.Brokers also will now be compensated entirely in cash. The initial plan included $13.7m in cash payments and the remainder consisting of future trading subsidies.Those subsidies were criticised by rival exchanges and other market participants as being potentially anti-competitive, but Nasdaq said the reason for the switch was to simplify the process.Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, said: “Nasdaq’s plan is improved, especially the cash component. We’ll have to see whether it satisfies the market participants that were impacted.”Facebook’s debut was marred by technical glitches on Nasdaq that left brokers and investors unclear of their actual holdings for hours and in some cases days. The botched start to trading has been cited as further eroding public confidence in the stock market following the flash crash in May 2010 and the global financial crisis.“We deeply regret the problems encountered during the initial public offering of Facebook,” said Robert Greifeld, chief executive officer of Nasdaq OMX. “We failed to meet our own high standards. We have learnt from this experience and we will continue to improve our trading platforms.”Nasdaq said it would file the plan later on Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will then begin a period of public consultation. Once approved, brokers would have seven days to file for accommodation, Nasdaq said.The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a market regulator, will evaluate the claims submitted by brokers, who were alerted of the new plan and given instructions on how to file late on Friday.The company, which is due to report its second-quarter results next week, plans to make the payout from “existing cash resources”, according to a person familiar with the plan.The person said priority payments would be given to those members whose customers were retail investors and those who had already reimbursed customers.Among the wholesale trading firms that suffered losses as a result of the Facebook offering were Knight Capital, Citadel and units of Citigroup and UBS that trade on behalf of retail brokerages.
202;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-06-18T19:57:11Z;Nasdaq joins environmental disclosure push;;Nasdaq OMX has joined forces with four other stock exchange groups to encourage companies listing with them to disclose more about their environmental and social performance.The five, including Brazil’s BM&FBovespa and the Johannesburg, Istanbul and Egyptian stock exchanges, jointly list more than 4,600 companies in developed and emerging markets.In a statement unveiled at a business conference in Rio de Janeiro ahead of this week’s UN Rio+20 sustainable development summit, they said they wanted to promote “long-term sustainable investment and improved environmental, social and corporate governance disclosure and performance among companies listed on their exchange”.Sandy Frucher, Nasdaq vice-chairman, said the move would not have any immediate impact on companies listed on the US exchange, which had no intention of going it alone to make such disclosure a condition of listing.“Theoretically you could do it but it would not be very effective, in fact it would be counterproductive,” he told the FT, noting that exchanges operated in a globally competitive market. “If we took a position, perhaps someone at this conference would stand up and call it heroic, but all kinds of companies that did not want to have that as part of a mandatory reporting requirement would list on our competitors [so] it would not be particularly effective.”Mr Frucher said Nasdaq and the four other exchanges were keen to work with regulators and their trade group, the World Federation of Exchanges, to try to develop global standards that all exchanges could use to promote sustainable investment.The announcement was welcomed by corporate sustainability campaigners at the Rio conference, who said Nasdaq was the first exchange in the US or Europe to make such a commitment.“What Nasdaq is doing is outstanding,” said Steve Waygood of Aviva Investors, which has been a leading backer of pushing companies to disclose more about their sustainability actions and strategies.James Gifford, executive director of the Principles for Responsible Investment group, said: “Nasdaq OMX’s announcement is a huge step forward for the sustainable stock exchange agenda and is a clear indication that exchanges worldwide understand the crucial role they have to play in building more sustainable capital markets.“We know that the majority of exchanges are interested in promoting greater corporate transparency and responsibility on sustainability issues and this will really move the needle for them to do more.”
203;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-06-16T10:48:11Z;Facebook lays out its defence;;Facebook laid out its defence against the 40-plus shareholder lawsuits in a legal filing that blamed Nasdaq and the technical glitches for helping cause its falling share price.The social network and its lead underwriters have rallied together against the stock exchange, filing a motion in a federal court in New York on Friday to consolidate all the shareholder lawsuits into one proceeding.The same day, Facebook announced the departure of Bret Taylor, its chief technical officer, who plans to leave in a few months to work on another start-up.Mr Taylor’s resignation could signal a need for Facebook to do more to retain talent, as many engineers are expected to take their stock payouts in the next year to pursue their own entrepreneurial projects – a common trend facing companies after a public offering.Facebook’s 24-page legal document is its first public statement on the debacle surrounding its IPO and early days of trading. The company attempts to steer attention away from conversations its underwriters had with select investors about revenue projections and back to Nasdaq’s technical failings.Nasdaq declined to comment.“The commencement of trading in Facebook shares was delayed as a result of problems with Nasdaq’s software systems, which impaired the orderly execution of trades and price levels,” Facebook wrote.Facebook’s legal outline sets up an argument that Nasdaq’s actions sparked psychological reactions to market dynamics, suggesting that when Nasdaq resolved its technical issues later in the first day of trading and confirmed a slew of trades at once, it appeared like a massive sell-off that triggered algorithms, and human traders, to sell.Nasdaq’s promise the following Monday to compensate investors who lost money because of the glitches caused even more sell-offs, Facebook argued.Facebook defended the conversations its underwriters had with potential investors before the IPO about the company’s revenues, saying they “followed customary practices and did not violate any rules”. It cited a list of press articles that warned of the challenges Facebook faces in making money from its mobile users as evidence that the content of such conversations were widely publicised.But some shareholders and analysts are not ready to let Facebook off the hook.“This is Facebook’s responsibility,” said Sam Hamadeh, a former banker and chief executive of PrivCo, a boutique research company. “They clearly overvalued the offering, they over supplied it and they thought they could get away with that while telling the underwriters to take down their estimates in the final days.”Facebook’s shares closed at $30.01 on Friday, 10 per cent up for the week, but still 21 per cent below its offering price of $38.Additional reporting by Arash Massoudi
204;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-06-12T23:02:28Z;LSE hire could Pac a punch against Nasdaq;Warren would know where the weak points were;You do not need to be much of a conspiracy theorist to concoct a hypothesis from London Stock Exchange’s appointment of David Warren as chief financial officer, a post he held for nine years at Nasdaq OMX. Last decade the New York-based exchanges group fought a protracted and ultimately unsuccessful battle to take over the LSE. If the UK bourse was considering turning the tables on its erstwhile pursuer – the so-called Pac-man defence – Mr Warren would know where Nasdaq OMX’s weak points were.The timing could be worse. The credibility of the tech-friendly business has been damaged by the glitches that marred the underwhelming flotation of Facebook. Nasdaq OMX shares have dropped about 20 per cent since March. That has left the group’s capitalisation at a shade below a figure of £2.6bn for the LSE, whose shares have risen 22 per cent this year.Of course, LSE boss Xavier Rolet would also need financial assistance from the hyper-intelligent alien that he abstracted from the Roswell UFO crash site and keeps in his filing cabinet. The purchase of a majority stake in clearer LCH.Clearnet for €463m has helped raise a key gearing ratio – net debt to underlying earnings – to just over two times. That is as high as appears prudent in these risk-averse times. And Nasdaq investors would surely prefer cash to the good intentions of an all-share offer.Mr Warren’s deployment therefore looks more of a piece with a post-deal spring clean at Gorgonzola Hall, as the stock exchange was known to Victorian brokers. This includes ex-regulator “JJ” Justham taking over compliance and post-trade head Kevin Milne stepping down. However, debt can be paid off and protectionism tends to attenuate as economies rally. So it would not do for Nasdaq OMX to become too complacent.Channel Isle OneOpting out of a European banking union would turn the UK into a “Greater Guernsey”, according to a German official quoted by the Financial Times’ Philip Stephens. The jibe would be more effective if fewer suburban Britons of a eurosceptic bent did not fancy living on the sedate Channel Island. The weather is good, wages are high and crime is low. An official at the States of Guernsey, the dependency’s government, blunted the German barb by describing it as “a compliment”.The morphing of Great Britain into an offshore centre could have advantages for the City as well as crypto-Ukippers. Banks and investors might escape irksome regulation while retaining the benefits of a European timezone and well-developed links with the continent. There would be opportunities to flex tax rates to attract business, albeit that catering to tax dodgers is no longer a strategy a reputable government can pursue.The open question is just how hostile core EU states would be to a Greater Guernsey. They might, for example, try to extend centralised banking regulation to the City, triggering a referendum and UK secession from the single market. Trade barriers might then drag a chunk of trading and advisory business back to eurozone home markets.Spare a thought, meanwhile, for Lesser Guernsey, as the smaller island must be dubbed. If the UK usurped its role as an offshore feeder jurisdiction for EU-earmarked funds, it might have to fall back on tourism and flower growing.Secret SantaAuditors who rated banks as going concerns not long before they collapsed have been implicitly let off the hook by Lord Sharman. The Aviva chairman, charged with examining the issue by the Financial Reporting Council, a disclosure watchdog, concluded that bean counters have no automatic duty to wave a warning flag if a bank is struggling but has confidential access to state support.This is hard cheese on equity investors, who might, if quick enough, sell out. But forestalling bank runs is more important. And if the credit crunch has taught us anything it is that the state rather than stock market investors bears the brunt of bank failures. Meanwhile, one should not overstate the role of reckless abacus rattlers in starting depositor panics. That, after all, is Robert Peston’s job.Precipitate actionA communiqué from Lydia Ramsey, a US business etiquette coach, urges the organisers of company barbecues to “have a rain plan”. Oh to reside in sunny Savannah, Georgia, like Ms Ramsey (who we imagine skipping down the steps of an antebellum mansion). In aqueous Albion, the best rain plan is not to organise a company barbecue in the first place.jonathan.guthrie@ft.com
205;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-06-08T17:29:55Z;Kraft to move NYSE listing to Nasdaq;;Kraft Foods delivered a blow to the New York Stock Exchange as the global snack group said it would relocate its listing to the Nasdaq, the electronic exchange that was recently humbled by problems with the Facebook public offering.The decision on Friday makes Kraft, a constituent of the important Dow Jones Industrial Average, the largest US company by market capitalisation, at $68bn, ever to move its listing.Kraft has traded on the NYSE since 2001, when the company was spun off from Philip Morris, the tobacco company now called Altria. The food group announced last year that it would split in two, separating its US grocery business from its fast-growing international snacks brands.Mike Mitchell, a Kraft spokesman, said that the company had been in discussions with both exchanges during the past several months and that the split gave it the opportunity to make the switch. He said that Nasdaq did not offer any special incentives to Kraft but the listing offered more exposure, via advertising in Times Square where the exchange is located, at a better price.“In the end, we were impressed with Nasdaq as being a better fit in terms of cost effectiveness, liquidity, execution of trading platform and brand building,” Mr Mitchell said.Nasdaq’s problems with the Facebook public offering did not faze Kraft.“Facebook was an IPO, not a spin-off, so the underlying process is different there,” Mr Mitchell said. “We’re confident the listing transfer and spin-off will be successful.”The announcement comes as brokers have sought compensation from Nasdaq for losses they incurred due to software glitches on the exchange in the opening minutes of trading in shares of Facebook at its debut last month.This week Robert Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX Group, laid out the company’s plans to reimburse aggrieved brokers. But the $40m compensation plan has faced a barrage of criticism from rival exchanges.Kraft will become the fourth member of the blue-chip heavy Dow to trade on the Nasdaq exchange as it joins Intel, Microsoft and Cisco.Kraft shares will begin trading on the Nasdaq on June 26 using its current symbol “KFT”. After the company splits later this year, Mondelez common stock will trade under the “MDLZ” symbol, while Kraft Foods Group will use “KRFT”.Annual listing fees on the Nasdaq run at up to $99,500 a year but are far lower than those on the NYSE, which can run up to nearly $500,000 annually.
206;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Nasdaq defends Facebook compensation offer;;Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, has stood firm against a barrage of criticism of his plan to pay $40m in compensation to traders affected by the stock exchange group’s software glitch that hampered the Facebook public offering.Nasdaq’s plan to offer trading credits to affected brokerages as part of its remedies, in addition to paying cash, was vigorously opposed by rival exchange executives at an industry conference in New York on Thursday.Executives from Direct Edge and BATS Global Markets took their turns blasting the resolution, which they said could alter the competitive landscape by giving an incentive to continue trading with Nasdaq despite its high-profile software glitch. The compensation pla n has also been criticised for being much smaller than the losses suffered by traders on the Facebook IPO.Mr Greifeld, speaking at the Sandler O’Neill exchanges conference, said the “vast majority” of customers would be compensated via the $13.7m in cash that Nasdaq would pay. The sum is much larger than any US exchange has recently offered for a trading glitch.He said that for wholesale brokerages such as Knight Capital, Citadel and units of UBS and Citigroup, which lost some $100m from Nasdaq’s glitch, “we want to retain our relationship”, but that earning the other $27m in credits over six months “would not require any additional market share” from them.The glitch, which delayed the opening of Facebook stock by 25 minutes on May 18, also prevented many traders from knowing whether or not their requests to buy or sell in the IPO’s first trades were honoured. This uncertainty hung over trading for several days, and may have led some brokerages or investors to sell shares more aggressively.Nasdaq is one party being blamed and investigated for its role in Facebook’s historic tumble which generated a loss of more than $30bn for investors in only three weeks. That is a record amount for a new issue in its first month of trading, according to Dealogic. Facebook’s underwriting banks, led by Morgan Stanley, have also drawn ire for pricing the deal too aggressively in the eyes of some investors.Knight Capital reiterated its opposition to Nasdaq’s remedies at the conference. “It’s underwhelming at best,” said Thomas Joyce, chief executive. Knight has said it lost as much as $35m due to the glitch.William O’Brien, chief executive of Direct Edge, called for the Securities and Exchange Commission to review Nasdaq’s proposal. The SEC has not said yet whether it will make Nasdaq’s plans immediately active once they are formally filed, or will ask for industry comment in a full review.“We’re in constant dialogue with regulators,” he said. “I would certainly say it’s a controversial plan.”NYSE Euronext said on Wednesday it would oppose the plan. “This is tantamount to forcing the industry to subsidise Nasdaq’s missteps,” NYSE said.Mark Hemsley, head of BATS’s European markets, said that his own exchange’s botched IPO was handled differently. BATS was forced to make an embarrassing withdrawal of its own share offering earlier this year after a software problem on its market affected trading of its stock.“I have never seen a crisis when the right approach is not to stop things from getting worse. You must sort the problem out to move on quickly. That hasn’t happened here,” he said.However, one analyst on Thursday said that Nasdaq’s plan was a positive for the company. Nasdaq shares are down just 3.9 per cent since Facebook’s IPO began trading and were down 0.6 per cent on Thursday to $22.11.“While brokers aren’t going to be happy with the amount being offered, complaints by competitors suggests that the plan is clever,” said Rob Rutschow, analyst at CLSA in New York. “Nasdaq could see increased rebate costs partially offset by increased market share. As a result, the financial impact may not be that big.”Mr Rutschow added that it was unlikely brokers could block the plan or take other action against Nasdaq. “Knight would need to prove gross negligence on the part of Nasdaq, which would seem to be a high hurdle,” he said.
207;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
208;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-06-06T21:58:29Z;Nasdaq offers $40m over Facebook losses;;Nasdaq OMX has offered to pay up to $40m to cover broker losses stemming from a software glitch during the Facebook public offering, in part by forgoing Facebook-related revenues but also by cutting trading costs.The rare move by an exchange to volunteer such a large sum in compensation failed to mollify one of the largest wholesale trading firms, Knight Capital. The firm claims it lost up to $35m as a result of not receiving trading confirmations when Nasdaq suffered technical problems in handling the first trades in Facebook stock. Total claims from brokers, including lead underwriter Morgan Stanley, are said to mount to more than $100m.“[Nasdaq’s] proposed solution to this problem is simply unacceptable. As previously stated, the company is evaluating all remedies available under law,” Knight said in a statement.NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq’s chief rival, also took issue with the compensation proposal, arguing that Nasdaq should not be allowed to offer discounts to customers that might have the effect of boosting its market share.“We intend to strongly press our views that Nasdaq’s proposal cannot be allowed to permit an unjust and anti-competitive situation,” NYSE said in a statement.The plan is to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, but it is not known whether the SEC will allow Nasdaq to implement the remedies without first seeking industry comment as part of a review.The impact of Nasdaq’s trading glitch on investor confidence in Facebook is at the centre of a series of inquiries into the $16bn offering. The SEC is reviewing Nasdaq’s decision to open trading on the morning of Facebook’s debut.Investors have seen a $31bn fall in Facebook’s market value since its May 18 float, a record amount for a new issue in its first month. The stock closed Wednesday at $26.81, down 29 per cent from its $38 initial offer price.The wholesale trading firms among the offering’s casualties included Knight Capital, Citadel and units of Citigroup and UBS which trade on behalf of retail brokerages.Morgan Stanley, which was Facebook’s lead underwriter, may also pursue a claim against Nasdaq, citing problems that its brokers had in settling client trades. “We’ve rectified those trades, but incurred expenses doing so. We will assess Nasdaq’s proposal,” said a bank spokesperson.In its plan announced on Wednesday, Nasdaq offered to pay $13.7m in cash pending SEC approval. It has also offered to pay another $7m, which represents the revenue it would gain from Facebook’s listing over the next five years, plus an additional $20m.That additional $27m would be paid in the form of credits “to members to reduce trading costs, with all benefits expected to be achieved within six months for the vast majority of firms”, Nasdaq said.“We apologise to the industry,” Bob Greifeld, chief executive, told CNBC television on Wednesday.In the immediate aftermath of the IPO, Nasdaq had offered to make available for remedy its standard $3m fund for trading losses related to glitches, as well as $10.7m that it collected in the exchange’s “error account” because of trades it was forced to make to complete Facebook’s first-day auction.Mr Greifeld responded to NYSE’s concerns about the compensation plan by saying that rival exchanges were opposed because the extent of the remedies goes “above and beyond anything another exchange has done before”.Other US exchanges have as little as $500,000 set aside to cover technical-related trading losses. Direct Edge, another US exchanges operator, said it had “several significant concerns” with the Nasdaq plan which it would “aggressively voice”.Mr Greifeld also stressed that only losses related to Nasdaq’s errors, and not “decisions they made to make their customers whole”, would qualify for compensation.Nasdaq said it had agreed a standard with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Traders must show they were directly disadvantaged before 11.30am, when Facebook trading began 25 minutes late, and had “uncertainty” regarding their IPO auction trades.
209;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-05-24T23:58:04Z;Broker losses on Facebook put at $100m;;Wholesale brokerages including Knight Capital and Citadel suffered trading losses that could top $100m as a result of computer glitches in Nasdaq OMX’s software on the morning of Facebook’s trading debut last Friday.Problems with the exchange’s trading software meant the brokers were unable to calculate their precise shareholdings in the social network through more than two hours of share trading, people close to the firms said.When they later discovered they had larger Facebook holdings than originally thought, many rushed to offload excess holdings, sparking a tumble in Facebook’s shares in the following trading days.“From the traders’ perspective, they could not ascertain their positions, orders were cancelled and the system failed them,” said James Angel, a professor of finance at Georgetown University, who watched Friday’s trading from a brokerage desk. “We saw this during the flash crash and now with Facebook.”The computer glitch helped mar one of the largest IPOs in US history when Facebook last week raised $16bn by selling shares at $38 apiece, valuing the company at $104bn. The shares closed 3 per cent higher on Thursday at $33.03, 13 per cent down on the issue price.Facebook’s shares briefly touched $45 in the first minutes of trading when they debuted on Friday.A record 580m shares in the company changed hands on Friday, a volume which compounded the trading difficulties.The Securities and Exchange Commission is examining Nasdaq’s decision to open trading despite its computer glitch. Nasdaq is also being sued by a group of Facebook investors.Nasdaq’s problems also hit the clients of 17,200 financial advisers working with Morgan Stanley, which was the lead underwriter for Facebook’s IPO.On Thursday the bank held a conference call with many of those advisers to update them on adjustments to client trades affected by Friday’s delay. Morgan said it had agreed to adjust about 1,000 trades because some may have been executed at an incorrect price due to market confusion, according to a person close to the bank.However, it will only honour trades up to $43, according to that person.Knight said this week it had it lost up to $35m on Facebook stock and the execution services arm of Citadel may have lost the same, according to a person close to the group. Citigroup’s and UBS’s wholesale units lost around $20m each, industry sources said. The banks declined to comment.Nasdaq has apologised to customers for the computer glitch, which it attributed to a “design flaw”. It has struck a deal with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to review customer claims and potential compensation.Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, said the glitch “didn’t have any impact on the stock price”, arguing that prices continued to fall once trade confirmations were disseminated and trading proceeded as normal.
210;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-05-24T00:18:28Z;Knight puts Facebook glitch loss at $35m;;Knight Capital has told investors it lost as much as $35m as a result of the software glitch at Nasdaq OMX in the opening moments of Facebook share trading, the first official statement of what is expected to be a flood of customer claims against the exchange.The announcement comes a day after it was revealed by the Financial Times that the Securities and Exchange Commission was reviewing what Nasdaq may have known about its IPO software before Friday and how it decided to continue trading despite the confusion its glitch generated.In addition, Nasdaq and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority have agreed a process to adjudicate and compensate customer claims, Nasdaq has told investors on a client call. That process could lead to larger losses for Nasdaq, analysts said.Finra, the private industry regulator, will canvas investors and determine legitimate claims. It will then present that figure to Nasdaq’s board of directors, who will have discretion over what Nasdaq will pay. The process is still subject to SEC approval.Under the exchange’s rules, which are filed with the SEC, its liability for losses related to technical problems is $3m. Nasdaq previously pledged $10m generated by liquidation trades it was forced to make in Facebook stock on Friday.Nasdaq is facing the ire of some of its largest customers, such as Knight, which makes quotes in thousands of stocks on behalf of retail customers, and could face pressure to pay out more than what it has set aside.Thomas Joyce, chief executive of Knight, this week estimated industrywide losses at $100m. Knight said on Wednesday that it was “evaluating all remedies available under law” beyond the Nasdaq-Finra process.That possibility prompted the first Nasdaq stock downgrade by an analyst in reaction to the IPO problems. Patrick O’Shaughnessy of Raymond James reduced his rating from “outperform” to “market perform”.“We now anticipate that Nasdaq’s board may be willing to provide substantially more compensation to harmed parties,” Mr O’Shaughnessy wrote.Meanwhile, regulators at the SEC, including staff from the trading and markets, examination and enforcement units, are concerned that Nasdaq forced the IPO to open to avoid the bad publicity experienced by BATS Global Markets after it pulled its own IPO after a software problem, according to a person familiar with its thinking.Another person who has spoken to the agency said that the concern was whether Nasdaq had a “reasonable basis to believe they could operate a fair and orderly market” and whether trading should have been halted after the IPO to address continuing issues.Eric Noll, executive vice-president at Nasdaq, told clients on Tuesday that Nasdaq would not have gone through with the IPO if it had known the extent of the software glitch, which delayed the opening by 25 minutes and delayed confirmations of some trades by more than three hours.“We believed we had a good solution in place and that if we had known that our solution was inadequate, we would have fixed the issue with the right solution before going forward,” Mr Noll said.The SEC and Nasdaq both declined to comment on the review.
211;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-05-22T23:25:24Z;Morgan Stanley subpoenaed over IPO;;The top securities regulator in Massachusetts has issued a subpoena to Morgan Stanley as part of an investigation into whether its analysts communicated revisions of Facebook’s revenue forecasts broadly to all clients ahead of last week’s initial public offering.In spite of cutting forecasts for Facebook’s revenue growth after the social network group revised its prospectus, the underwriting banks, led by Morgan Stanley, soon afterwards increased the size of the offer by 25 per cent and priced the shares at $38, at the top of a new range of $34-$38.Analysts at JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs also alerted clients of Facebook’s lower growth forecasts in the days before its IPO, people familiar with the process said.The subpoena from the US state comes as Facebook shares lifted from their lows on Wednesday in New York.The shares closed at $32 at market close, up 3.2 per cent on the day but still down about 15 per cent on the $38 offer price.Scrutiny of the botched IPO intensified, including software problems on Nasdaq as well as the role of the underwriting banks.Small investors have already begun to file lawsuits seeking class action status against Facebook, its underwriters and Nasdaq. Such opportunistic suits are common following large downward moves in the share price of public companies.In a statement released late on Tuesday, Morgan Stanley said it followed the same procedures for the Facebook offering that it followed for all IPOs.“After Facebook released a revised S-1 [IPO] filing on May 9 providing additional guidance with respect to business trends, a copy of the amendment was forwarded to all of MS’s institutional and retail investors and the amendment was widely publicised in the press at the time,” Morgan Stanley said.It added: “In response to the information about business trends, a significant number of research analysts in the syndicate who were participating in investor education reduced their earnings views to reflect their estimate of the impact of the new information. These revised views were taken into account in the pricing of the IPO.“Analysts cannot publish research about a company when their banks are providing underwriting services but they are allowed have verbal discussions with clients in the period leading up to an IPO.The head of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a private market regulator, also warned that selective communication could be “a matter of regulatory concern to Finra and the SEC”.The US Securities and Exchange Commission is also reviewing Nasdaq OMX’s handling of the opening trade in Facebook’s initial public offering, after a software glitch delayed the market debut and caused confusion among traders.SEC staff are trying to better understand what Nasdaq officials knew about the IPO auction software problems in the hours before trading began on Friday, and how it decided to move forward with the IPO, according to a person with knowledge of the review.A spokesperson for the SEC would not confirm the Nasdaq inquiry.Nasdaq also declined to comment. It has previously acknowledged that “poor design” delayed the IPO auction by 25 minutes, and has removed the relevant process from its software.
212;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-05-22T18:22:44Z;Nasdaq investors still support Greifeld;;Nasdaq’s annual meeting on Tuesday was brief and to the point: the US exchange’s investors remain in support of Bob Greifeld, its chief executive, while controversy continues to swirl around the company’s handling of the Facebook initial public offering.H. Furlong Baldwin, the company’s chairman, told investors: “This is a far stronger and better company than when he started.”Mr Greifeld, who has served as chief since 2003, again acknowledged “mistakes” in the design of the software that handled Facebook’s auction – but insisted on looking forward, touting the fact that Nasdaq had just won the listing of Western Digital, the computer hardware group, from its cross-town rival NYSE Euronext.Western Digital’s $9bn in market capitalisation pales in comparison with the $104bn black eye that Nasdaq is now sporting after Facebook’s spluttering trading debut.Trading in Facebook stock did not open for 25 minutes after market-making firms had requested a brief pause from its 11am scheduled open, and reports of trade confusion throughout the session have plunged Nasdaq into a public fight with some of its biggest customers, as well as casting a pall over a coming wave of internet company IPOs.“The Nasdaq events from Friday have put a negative light on the space,” says Christopher Baggini, portfolio manager at Turner Investments and a Facebook IPO investor.For Nasdaq’s own business, the fizzling debut – for which it shares the blame with Facebook itself and Morgan Stanley, who raised the price and size of the offering at a late stage – calls into question not only its ability to win future listings from its rival in New York, and its global competitors in London, Hong Kong and Frankfurt, but also the technology business that has become the core of its value proposition at a time when trading volumes are falling sharply.“Nasdaq’s record stands for itself: They have diversified their revenues, and as big as Facebook was, it is still equal to every other company in terms of revenue,” says Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill. “But from a reputational standpoint, in terms of their command of tech IPOs, will it be shaken?”Nasdaq shares were down only 1.4 per cent from where they began on Friday, at $22.69 as of midday on Tuesday.The danger is that it will not only harm relations between Nasdaq and banks, who are privately furious with Nasdaq for the way it handled Facebook’s opening, it also allows NYSE to promote its own “hybrid” market that combines software with floor traders who can monitor a company’s initial listing. NYSE and Nasdaq have competed heavily for tech listings– LinkedIn and Yelp chose NYSE, while Zynga and Facebook chose Nasdaq.“Why wouldn’t this 21st century internet revolutionary company [Facebook] want to have human beings helping to trade,” wrote Kenneth Polcari, a veteran NYSE floor trader and managing director at ICAP, in a note to clients. “It’s exactly this human connection that ensures the strength of the NYSE.”The particular Facebook problem, an unexpected software occurrence in which high-frequency order cancellations interrupted the millisecond process of producing an opening IPO trade, will also shed a spotlight on Nasdaq’s market technology.This is at a time when it is investing even more heavily in that business, at the expense of other efforts. Nasdaq recently entered talks to sell its stake in a swaps clearing house that would have seen it join the global race to enter the over-the-counter trading market amid a global regulatory push.Instead, Nasdaq is increasing its focus on its “beyond the match” strategy of providing services such as market surveillance, trading risk checks, trading algorithms that compete with broker services and an array of services to public companies.In part, that explains why the group is sticking with Mr Greifeld, who is a former technology executive with SunGard, and also loves the combat of doing deals and cutting costs.However, the situation remains in flux: Mr Greifeld was not named chairman at the annual meeting, a move the company has been considering for the past several months, the Financial Times previously reported.Nasdaq is not alone in struggling in the exchange business, especially when it comes to technology. BATS Global Markets, for example, recently pulled its own IPO on its opening day because its pricing auction code failed to work properly.However, the Facebook IPO situation fuels the perception of potential conflicts between some of Nasdaq’s best customers, high-frequency trading firms and market-makers, and its move to expand into listings and regulatory surveillance services.“It continues to erode confidence. The retail investor says ‘Oh God, more shenanigans. I got an IPO allocation and I’m still losing money’,” says Joe Saluzzi of Themis Trading, a frequent critic of exchanges and market structure. “The whole thing stinks.”…Traders seek compensationNasdaq OMX is set to be embroiled in a difficult dispute with some of its biggest customers over the extent of its exposure to claims for trading problems related to the Facebook initial public offering, writes Telis Demos.Under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, exchanges face limited liability for traders who experience losses due to technology problems, but Nasdaq faces intense pressure to be more generous in order to maintain customer loyalty in the intensively competitive US equity trading market.The dispute gathered pace on Monday, when Thomas Joyce, chief executive of Knight Capital, a market-making firm, publicly stated that brokers got “punched in the nose” and estimated that brokers made losses of $80m-$100m.Nasdaq said over the weekend that it would make $10m available to customers. The money comes from proceeds generated by its own trading of Facebook shares as it attempted to get the IPO under way after the failure of the automated process.That is in addition to its usual $3m customer compensation fund, which was expanded last year from $500,000. Nasdaq last year agreed to compensate customers such as Citigroup when the exchange’s automated market-making software produced incorrect quotes, according to people familiar with the discussions.The SEC must agree to allow Nasdaq to use the $10m fund, and Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq chief, said he would “petition aggressively” for the permission.Customers had until noon on Monday to file claims against Nasdaq. Nasdaq has engaged the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, led by Richard Ketchum, a former rival of Mr Greifeld’s at Nasdaq, to adjudicate the claims.But discussions between Finra, the SEC, customers and Nasdaq about whether its findings would form the basis of compensation are still in the early stages, according to participants.One customer said they estimated the losses at a lower level than Mr Joyce – closer to $40m – and would press for Finra to be the arbiter. “Nasdaq has a lot of angry clients,” the person said.
213;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-05-21T00:29:52Z;‘Raindrops’ raise questions after Facebook IPO;Why was the market’s technology infrastructure so vulnerable to a momentary lapse?;"What can you do in the moments between raindrops? Because the equity markets can cause a thunderous upheaval in that amount of time.A trader’s click arguably sparked a 20-minute period in which the major US stock indices swung 6 per cent during the May 6 “flash crash” just over two years ago.And it was one quote cancellation sneaking into a five-millisecond window that caused about 20 painful minutes, watched live by the world on CNBC television, of the delay to the opening of Facebook’s initial public offering on Nasdaq’s US market.As there were two years ago, there will be many questions about why the market’s technology infrastructure was so vulnerable to a momentary lapse. In this case, a millisecond blip interacting with cancelled trades in such a way as to temporarily derail investors’ ability to swaps shares in the third-biggest US IPO ever.Nasdaq OMX – which fought hard to win Facebook’s IPO from its rival NYSE Euronext – this weekend laid out the details of the delay, which pushed back the launch from a stated 11.05am to 11.30am on Friday.In brief, the problem was that the system took two extra milliseconds to calculate the opening price. Because of a decision before to allow continuous order placement during IPOs, cancellations kept “fitting in between the raindrops”, in the words of Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive, in the five milliseconds it was taking to determine a price.As a result, Nasdaq had to manually override the process, which took up those 20 minutes. But the manual process meant that individual order confirmations were not sent out until almost 1.50pm, hours after the 11.30am opening print. Confusion reigned, and many blamed it for dampening demand for Facebook stock.Ignoring that last point for now – Mr Greifeld says that this conclusion is not supported by the trading charts – the incident’s details do touch upon some crucial ongoing disputes with regards to modern market structure.Namely, critics will say this proves that it is at the millisecond level in which the real work of stock markets, as well as some futures and foreign exchange markets, is done, making it much more difficult for all but automated trading algorithms to compete.It will also raise the specific complaints about the cancellations of quotes by those algorithms.Electronic market-makers say that cancelling quotes is essential to making prices – that spreads would widen if they were forced to let quotes hang out in the market longer, because the risk of the market moving in an unexpected way would grow.But some academics and brokerages say that cancellations are adding costs to trading by requiring that all traders be equipped with the pipelines to handle the massage data traffic that thousands of messages per seconds requires.The question now will be: was Nasdaq the victim of catering to its best customers, the high-frequency dealers who provide the liquidity that attracts investors to the market, who wanted to keep cancelling quotes at millisecond increments during IPOs?The rationale for the design of Nasdaq’s IPO cross system was that IPOs, unlike normal opening and closing auctions, have no pre- or after-market trading. Therefore, IPO prices could fail to reflect where the market really stands, and add risk to market-makers.The irony here is that Nasdaq has also been among the exchanges leading the charge to try to damp down excessive cancellations, in cases when there are more than 100 quotes per actual trade executed.In the case of cancellations, it is traders’ software – their algorithms that make trading decisions – that is in question; whether poor design makes them wasteful with their trading messages.However, Nasdaq itself has not helped the perception of traders’ ability to code. Mr Greifeld said that Nasdaq tested 100 scenarios and 1bn shares traded; just not the “magic” combination of cancellations and milliseconds that unfolded on Friday.That is also what BATS Global Markets said in explaining its IPO failure. BATS’s specific problem was different, with its IPO auction software failing to roll over into live trading. Nasdaq had no such problem. However, the broader issue is the same: do financial programmers, under pressure to roll out algos in real-time to capture fleeting market opportunities, put their software under rigorous enough scenario testing?Facebook’s stock price may leave this all behind and go on a Google-like surge in the months to come. But the larger market structure questions will certainly linger – for far longer than any raindrops."
214;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-05-18T23:40:48Z;Network confusion links Facebook and Nasdaq;;A series of technical issues delayed the opening trades in Facebook’s stock and caused confusion throughout the session, potentially helping to tamp down the stock’s first-day gains.The glitches may damage the social network’s reputation among individual investors who were heavy users of the site and had hoped for first-day gains although trading stabilised in part due to buying by the initial public offering’s underwriters.The confusion also hit Nasdaq OMX’s own stock amid worries that its status as a leading listings market for high-tech companies could be dented.Scrutiny on exchanges’ role in the IPO auction process has been heightened by the recent botched IPO of BATS Global Markets, when the exchange operator experienced technical glitches during its self-listing that forced it to withdraw the IPO.Nasdaq may face ire from traders and market-making firms who could not determine their positions, though some traders were satisfied with the overall process. The exchange held a call an hour after the market closed to discuss traders’ reports of bad trades and the Securities and Exchange Commission said it was reviewing the day’s events.“The biggest issue for Nasdaq is possible reputational damage from these events as it attempts to win future listings business,” said Christopher Harris, exchanges analyst at Wells Fargo.Nasdaq’s shares tumbled more than 2 per cent during the half-hour delay to Facebook’s opening and closed the session down 4.4 per cent at $21.99.During the tense period between 11.05am, when the stock was meant to open, and 11:30am, when it did, traders said that it was apparent that a series of small technical glitches had delayed Nasdaq’s auction process.According to multiple trading firms, there were disconnections from the exchange during the auction process, which resulted in quotes being cancelled.There was also a failure in confirmations of whether or not orders to buy or sell shares at the opening auction price were executed. Nasdaq worked to resolve the issue, but as the minutes ticked by with the world watching a live feed of the pricing on CNBC, it decided to open trading without a solution, according to a person briefed on the process.The shares opened at $42.05 and rose as high as $45 for an instant. But those trades were based on stale quotes, according to a trader at a market-making group. After a few moments around that level, the price began to drop.The decline in the share price ended when the IPO price of $38 was reached. Traders and people close to the process said that underwriters stepped in to prevent the shares from falling below that level. Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriter, declined to comment.This drew in other buyers, said Steven Spencer of SMB Capital who was trading in Facebook shares. “You could see the resistance and it traded right back up to $40,” he said.Trading proceeded from there in an orderly manner. Facebook’s shares changed hands an enormous 83m times in the first minute of trading and ended the day with a record volume for an IPO of 557m shares traded.But many traders in the auction still had not received confirmation reports by late in the day. Nasdaq said it was “investigating an issue in delivering trade execution messages from the IPO cross in symbol FB”.When the problem was resolved just before 2pm, Nasdaq said: “Trade execution messages for the Facebook …IPO Cross have been electronically disseminated.”However, according to multiple traders, when the confirmations were returned, some traders were surprised by the prices they received. Some of them received worse prices than they had anticipated or had their trades cancelled.Nasdaq has not commented on this, but said it a statement it would attempt to resolve issues via a telephone hotline after the market close.Trading into the close was tepid, with the shares closing at $38.23.Reaction to the day among traders was mixed.Active traders enjoyed the session, profiting from the gyrating prices between institutions who were looking to sell above $40, a price representing a valuation of nearly 60 times next year’s forecast earnings, and retail traders who wanted to increase their stake in Facebook.“Some people made a lot of money picking lows and highs,” said Steve Ehrlich, chief executive of Lightspeed Financal, which caters to professional day traders.RT Leuchtkafer, a private investor, did not believe that Nasdaq had managed the process poorly overall. “I think Nasdaq acquitted itself fairly well [amid] a big IPO and unprecedented retail interest,” he said.However, Randy Warren, a financial adviser for wealthy individuals and small businesses, said the lack of a “pop” was “a major disappointment for buyers”, especially retail traders who were also users of Facebook.Several market participants said the poor trading was due to institutions not buying at the rich valuation level of the pricing. But David Weild, president of Capital Markets Advisory Partners, said that the glitches kept some buyers out of the market.“As a trader, you also have in the back of your mind the whole thing that happened to BATS,” said Mr Weild. “The glitches might have precipitated more selling, and the stock likely traded worse than it should have.”Additional reporting by Arash Massoudi
215;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-05-05T00:11:29Z;Nasdaq to launch third options exchange;;Nasdaq OMX is bringing equity market strategies to the options market, launching a third options exchange aimed at trading by individual investors.The number of exchanges has been growing, especially in the US and Europe, where new markets have been using different pricing structures to incentivise certain types of trades to come to their exchanges. Exchanges say this has helped keep down the cost of trading, but critics say it has created unnecessary complexity.Nasdaq hopes that its new exchange will add to its market share by drawing retail trading away from markets such as those run by BATS Global Markets, Boston Options Exchange and Nasdaq’s own PHLX, which pay for order flow from retail brokerages.The New York-based exchange operator is the leader in US options, but has seen declining market share in PHLX, its biggest options market, since last year. PHLX’s share declined from around 20 per cent in December to 17 per cent in April, according to figures from analysts at Raymond James. Meanwhile, its NOM options exchange has grown share from 5 per cent to closer to 7 per cent.The new market, called BX Options, will offer a different kind of pricing structure. Customers will be paid to trade against orders posted to the market, rather than paying a fee to do so. The fees will be paid by those who place orders.This reverses the typical market structure, in which those who place orders – known as liquidity makers – are paid rebates, while those who trade against those orders – known as liquidity takers – are charged fees. Hence the model is called “taker-maker”. It is currently used in some equities markets, but not options.Nasdaq’s belief is that most takers of liquidity are retail traders, who will flock to the new market because they are being paid to trade.“The incentive for retail traders will be a certainty and clarity about the rewards they will get for trading here,” said Eric Noll, executive vice president at Nasdaq.Liquidity providers, such as options market-makers including Citadel, Knight Capital and Goldman Sachs, will be drawn to the retail flow on BX Options because it is uncorrelated with professional trading, Mr Noll said.The launch comes a few days after a group called the Miami International Exchange filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch an options market in September, to be called the MIAX Options Exchange.The proliferation of venues is a concern, according to Christopher Nagy, managing director of order routing and market data strategy at TD Ameritrade.“More exchanges does not necessarily help retail investors,” said Mr Nagy. “I’m not sure we have the right balance where adding more exchanges will bring benefits, rather than confusion and more costs.”
216;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-05-03T15:08:49Z;Nasdaq buys compliance group BWise;;Nasdaq OMX has acquired BWise, a Netherlands-based compliance and risk management group, to expand its corporate services offering, part of a long-term plan to grow the part of its business that serves the companies listed on its markets.The New York-based US-European exchange operator has acquired a series of corporate services groups over the past few years, including Glide Technologies, which measures media coverage, and Directors Desk, which allows corporate board members to access documents.Through these corporate services, Nasdaq hopes to draw companies to list on its market, but also to generate non-trading revenues. It has taken a different approach from NYSE Euronext, which does not own corporate services for its listed companies, but does provide rebate to purchase them.Many exchanges have been struggling with the pressure of intense competition on trading fees and continually falling trading volumes, and are seeking to increase revenues in technology and other non-trading units, though that process has been slow.Corporate services is still a small slice of Nasdaq’s turnover, at $20m in the first quarter, up from $18m the year before. That is just less than 5 per cent of its total net revenues. Nasdaq’s aim is to have corporate services equal the turnover from listings fees, which were $56m in the quarter, from the US and Europe.BWise sells software to corporate boards that measures a company’s progress on complying with regulators, such as the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III. Its largest user base is European insurance groups, but it also has clients globally in oil and gas, banking and retail.BWise, which was founded in 1994, does not disclose financial results. The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.In addition to selling BWise to Nasdaq- and OMX-listed companies, Nasdaq hopes to sell services to BWise clients. It also aims to sell BWise’s platform to customers of Smarts, the market surveillance group that Nasdaq acquired last year.”This deepens our relationships in Europe,” said Bruce Aust, executive vice-president and head of listings at Nasdaq.Mr Aust added that this is not likely to be the last deal of its kind, following the acquisition of UK-based Glide last year. He said that Nasdaq hoped to draw more European listings to its US market, such as Edwards Group, an industrial vacuum maker, expected to list this year.“We’re making strategic acquisitions in Europe, as we’re looking to expand our listings in Europe,” he said.Last year, Nasdaq announced that the Singapore Exchange would be partnering with its corporate services businesses.
217;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-04-25T13:42:10Z;Nasdaq reports 18% fall in quarterly profit;Trading volumes at lowest level in five years;Nasdaq OMX declared its first ever dividend and announced a cost-cutting programme as it continued to cope with a low volume trading environment, which resulted in an 18 per cent decline in first-quarter profit.The global exchange operator said it would pay 13 cents a share for the quarter, or some $22m, and said it would achieve annual cost reductions of $50m over the next two years, including $25m by the end of this year.The moves come amid trading volumes that were the lowest in five years, and as investors look for exchange groups to demonstrate new ways to grow their top and bottom line after a series of global mergers were blocked by shareholders and regulators last year, including Nasdaq’s move to acquire part of its rival NYSE Euronext.Nasdaq’s net income fell 18 per cent to $85m from the first quarter a year ago, against a drop in revenue of 2 per cent, to $666m for the quarter. The group’s expenses grew 4 per cent from a year ago.“If volumes continue to be weak, we will continue to focus on the things we can control, most importantly costs,” said Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive.The company also said it repurchased another $50m in shares from investors, bringing the tally to $950m over the past three years.However, the exchange also saw additional income and revenues from its growing technology businesses. Its access services unit, which sells pre-trade risk management services to banks and brokerages, saw an increase of 8 per cent from a year ago, to $62m. Last year Nasdaq acquired FTEN, a software firm.It also saw an increase in market technology revenues of 5 per cent, to $45m, and a 7 per cent increase in revenues from market data, to $87m. Nasdaq’s SMARTS unit, which helps exchanges monitor trading activity, signed China’s emerging securities market as a client. It also said it signed Tokyo Commodities Exchange to a new five-year technology contract.Mr Greifeld said that Nasdaq’s earnings of 61 cents per share compared with 38 cents per share the last time volumes were this low, in 2007, demonstrated the value of adding new revenues outside of the exchange’s core trading platform access fees.The additional costs were in part related to these new businesses, including the build-out of its “co-location” facility, where traders and brokerages can connect directly to the exchange to trade and receive market data. There was also an increase in $9m in restructuring costs, related to the cost-cutting programme.The new cost cuts would come from “technology savings, facility savings, other infrastructure and headcount”, said Mr Greifeld. “Cost reduction ensures we have the best business infrastructure in place, and positions us well when the business returns to normal growth,” he said.Nasdaq also continues to spend to build out its trading beyond stocks and options, announcing an acquisition of NOS Clearing, a freight clearing service, from Imarex. The terms were not disclosed.It also said this week that it entered into talks to sell its stake in the International Derivatives and Clearing Group to LCH.Clearnet, the Anglo-French clearing house, in exchange for shares in LCH. Mr Greifeld said as a shareholder, Nasdaq would “work with LCH to lever [the horizontal clearing approach] into different asset classes”.Revenues fell most sharply in its volume-based businesses, cash equities and derivatives trading in the US and Europe. Revenues in derivatives, which is primarily options, fell 7.5 per cent to $74m, on lower volumes and a dip in US market share.Equities revenues fell 14.5 per cent to $53m, in part because Nasdaq was offering discounted trading prices in the US via its “investor services programme”, which added volumes but lowered fees. Mr Greifeld said the exchange would revisit ISP pricing in May.
218;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-04-11T14:08:06Z;EMCF to process trades for Turquoise;;European Multilateral Trading Facility (EMCF) has agreed to process trades for Turquoise, the trading venue owned by the London Stock Exchange, in a sign that Europe’s largest equities clearing house is preparing to fight back for lost market share.The move marks the first time that EMCF has been selected by an alternative trading venue to offer so-called interoperable services, a development that reshaping the equities clearing landscape in Europe.In the last year regulators have approved arrangements by several alternative trading venues to allow access to other clearing houses in the cash equities market, a move known as “interoperability”.A clearing house sit in the middle of a trade, guaranteeing the deal if one party defaults. Europe has more than 20 such clearing houses, all requiring capital for collateral to back trades. Supporters argue that capital can be saved by netting and cross-margin trades between venues.The Dutch group clears for nine exchanges and trading venues and has lost market share in recent months to rivals LCH.Clearnet, x-Clear of Switzerland and EuroCCP, owned by the Depository Trust & clearing Corporation, a US post-trade group.EMCF clears cash equities for BATS Chi-X Europe, Europe’s largest share trading venue, and Nasdaq OMX, a 22 per cent shareholder in EMCF but EuroCCP has estimated it has taken a 40 per cent market share in BATS Chi-X Europe since the start of the year.Jan Booij, chief executive, of EMCF, said the agreement with Turquoise, which has a 4.4 per cent market share of pan-European equities trading, was a “significant” milestone.“We hope this will be first of many more platforms that look to offer its customers the full range of services clearing houses such as EMCF have to offer,” he said.However interoperability has yet to take hold fully in Europe. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse, two of the region’s largest share trading platforms, do not offer interoperability for cash equities clearing. Nasdaq OMX Nordic, which operates bourses in Scandinavia, last month delayed plans to offer customers a choice of clearing house, blaming regulatory uncertainty over the derivatives markets. The group said it would offer customers a choice of EMCF, EuroCCP and x-Clear.European regulators have pushed interoperability for five years but its rollout has been delayed as regulators have also sought to ensure, post-financial crisis, that new clearing arrangements would not lead to a potential systemic risk. Arrangements to allow customers a choice when using BATS Global Markets, Chi-X Europe, Turquoise and UBS MTF have been approved.EMCF cleared more than one billion transactions last year, with a gross value of more than 5.4 tn. Customers on Turquoise will be able to choose between LCH.Clearnet, in which the LSE is set to take a majority stake, EuroCCP, EMCF and x-Clear.
219;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-04-10T19:26:46Z;HFT slows down in US ahead of exchange action;;Fewer messages are being blasted at US stock exchanges by high-speed traders ahead of pending rule changes that penalise some automated trading activities.The practice of electronically sending thousands of quotes each second to the stock market has come under scrutiny over the past two years, following the May 2010 “flash crash” and regulators’ concerns about whether trading in milliseconds is detrimental to some investors.Such trading is seen as necessary by many traders and academics, who say that it dampens wild market swings and allows market-makers to offer better prices to investors.But it is viewed as costly by other participants and some regulators, who say investors are forced to spend more on technology to accommodate the bandwidth necessary to record the millions of quotes generated per day.Three US exchanges are in the process of adopting policies that would penalise traders for exceeding set ratios of quotes per trade, such as more than 100 quotes per trade, in the hopes of cutting down on wasteful activity.Nasdaq and Direct Edge are considering them for equities, while the IntercontinentalExchange has begun rolling them out in its futures markets. Ahead of such changes, fresh figures suggest the volume of tradeless quotes may be declining as traders adjust their strategies, although declining price volatility and trading activity may also be having an impact.Steve Hammer, founder of HFT Alert, a service that collates market data, analyses and resells it to traders, found that the average daily level of quotes with no trades dropped to 3m per day over the past two weeks of March from average levels of 11.7m quotes over the past year.“Since the Securities and Exchange Commission and many exchanges have announced their intention to more closely scrutinise such practices in early March, this has had a dramatic and very noticeable change in quote traffic,” said Mr Hammer.Direct Edge said it was not yet seeing any changes in quoting patterns on its market.Nasdaq said it could not comment on any trends, as it is awaiting approval of its penalties for excessive messaging by the SEC, which has asked for public comment on the rules.There are also other factors at work, such as a broad decline in market volatility, which necessitates fewer price changes by market-makers. The Vix implied volatility index has dropped by 50 per cent since August.Analysts at Credit Suisse have seen a steady decline in the number of changes in the best quotes to buy and sell individual stocks since that time. The daily number of changes has fallen from a peak above 400m in August to hover at about 150m since January.
220;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-04-09T19:06:45Z;Rise of the paperless meeting;;Once upon a time, Gerhard Roggeman would have disagreed with the saying that it is better to travel than to arrive. As a director on the board of a clutch of international companies, he spends much of his work life travelling and much of that travel time weighed down by thousands of pages of board meeting paperwork.His burden will be a familiar one for many executives and company secretaries – one London-listed company recently even had to helicopter documents to a director located on an island off the coast of Australia.Since Apple’s iPad ushered in the age of the tablet in 2010, however, it has become easier to convince board members – many of whom are barely acquainted with a laptop, to consider a portable digital.“It is a huge progress in technology,” says Mr Roggeman, who now uses his iPad for board meetings at Resolution, the insurance consolidation vehicle, and Deutsche Börse. “It really facilitates my job.”As directors begin to swap wads of documents for tablet devices, stuffy boardrooms stacked with papers are turning into scenes more akin to science-fiction films. According to Diligent, a digital solutions business, its clients include 20 FTSE 100 that now use iPads in their board meetings – including Barclays, retailer Kingfisher and Weir Group, a pumps and valves manufacturer. The tablets are mainly used with apps that allow companies to consolidate boardroom documents into “virtual boardbooks”.Edis-Bates Associates, a consultancy, found that 40 per cent of 150 London-listed companies surveyed last year were using electronic means to distribute board meeting documents. “It is all changing at a tremendous pace,” says Jon Edis-Bates, the company’s principal consultant.“The iPad was the real trigger,” says Paul McKenna, company secretary at insurance company Standard Life, which has been using virtual iPad boardbooks since September. Its adoption for board meetings was recommended by one of its directors, William Black, who had already been using his own iPad for board meetings at the Bank of Canada. Since then, Standard Life has equipped four of its boards and 43 committees across the world with the devices.Lonmin, a FTSE 250 platinum producer, first began looking at digital solutions in 2006. But it was not until last year that the board made the switch to using digital boardbooks at meetings. “There was a hell of a lot more room on the table,” says Rob Bellman, Lonmin’s company secretary as he recounts the first fully digital board meeting. “There just aren’t the piles of paper there used to be.”Others argue that any tablet-enabled boardroom revolution should be about more than saving space and eliminating paperwork. “The potential is there for the technology to help give the board better knowledge of the company,” says Didier Cossin, professor of finance at IMD. The devices, he says, are currently being used in a static way rather than a tool for managing and exploiting information. “It’s just posting documents, which I don’t think is the best use for the technology.”David Yoffie, professor at Harvard Business School, is equally sceptical about whether adoption of tablet devices and virtual boardbooks has fundamentally changed the way boards operate. “[Change] may come as people find ways to take advantage of the technology, but today it’s just an ereader and, at least on the boards that I sit on, if it’s just an ereader it doesn’t really change the underlying dynamics going on in the boardroom.”Boards will have to wait for that shift to happen. “I had some board members who used the iPad during a meeting to take pictures – one who took a picture of the guy in front of him who was angry,” recalls Prof Cossin, who sees such initiatives as having the potential to make the board room more transparent.He also points out a possible drawback: board documents compiled for digital consumption can tend to be lengthier than those compiled on paper with a mind to the constraints of space and weight.“With new iPads coming in, people are swamped with documents which can be highly inefficient in terms of governance because you can overwhelm them with documents,” he says.A growing number of companies have cropped up to offer digital solutions for boardroom meetings. These include California-based BoardVantage, Diligent, and Projectplace.The advent of iPads is something many directors enthuse about but they are largely still being used as ereaders only.While the technology is still fairly basic, there are applications designed to make their working lives easier. These range from the basic, such as sticky notes, alerts and book tabs, to more inventive functions, such as private annotations, the ability to circle text in red and a briefcase that allows users to organise documents.Win Chime, deputy company secretary at Network Rail, says these tools have produced one unexpected change in the boardroom dynamic. “There is often a bit of competition [between directors] now about who has the best features,” she says.Several companies and institutions have also introduced virtual boardroom applications for their clients, such as Nasdaq OMX, Computershare, the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, Perivan and Thomson Reuters.Diligent, which provides an iPad app and software to help companies compile virtual boardbooks, saw licence revenues for digital software increase to $6m in the fourth quarter of 2011, from $500,000 in 2008. “We reached that tipping point in the second half of last year in the UK,” says Simon Small, a company executive. “It became more of a conversation in the corporate community driven by the fact that iPads had been out for a year.”Directors Desk, a US company that was bought by Nasdaq OMX in 2007, now has 20,000 users. It offers an online platform for Nasdaq-listed companies to upload documents to share with board members and executives.…However, it has not all been smooth sailing for the company, which last year was the target of hacking that compromised a handful of Fortune 500 companies. The attacks, which are being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency, underline a major vulnerability for companies who choose to place market sensitive information on digital platforms and devices.Tom Kellermann, vice president at cybersecurity company Trend Micro, says that just because these products are encrypted, it does not mean that they are safe.“It shows arrogance on the part of the world’s corporate elite to assume they will build an infrastructure that other individuals cannot break into,” he says. “They are rushing to create this efficiency and access to capabilities without doing their due diligence on securing that infrastructure,” he adds.One headhunter notes how, in an effort to strengthen security, some companies have equipped directors with iPads that they can use only for that particular board. As a result, directors sitting on the boards of different companies can face a high-tech variant of the original problem – but instead of clutching a pile of papers they have to carry a stack of different iPads.
221;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-04-05T22:39:29Z;Facebook to list shares on Nasdaq;;"Facebook has chosen the Nasdaq to list its shares, under the symbol “FB”, when it launches its initial public offering later this year, according to a person familiar with the decision.The choice will be a disappointment to the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq’s chief rival and home to social media companies such as LinkedIn and Yelp, but will not ultimately have a big impact on Facebook’s trading, experts say.Facebook’s planned issuance of $5bn worth of stock would be the largest US IPO ever on Nasdaq, according to figures from S&P Capital IQ.

Nasdaq OMX, Facebook and NYSE Euronext declined to comment.Facebook is looking to begin its roadshow to investors in May, people familiar with its thinking have said, which could ready it for listing as soon as May or June. It recently halted its share-trading in private markets in anticipation of its final push.While Nasdaq has historically been the listing home of young technology companies, NYSE has made up considerable ground since opening a Silicon Valley office two years ago. NYSE was the top listings market globally in the first quarter.In the past year NYSE and Nasdaq have split the market for money raised in US technology company IPOs, according to S&P Capital IQ. NYSE last year won listings for Pandora, the streaming music service; Renren, the Chinese network; and Fusion-io, which provides cloud data storage to Facebook. But Nasdaq ended 2011 strongly, winning Groupon and Zynga’s listings.Despite the fierce competition to win listings, which generate steady annual revenues for exchanges, as well as marketing points, stocks in the US can trade on any exchange, or any off-exchange venue such as a dark pool.“The listings choice has no bearing on what price you trade at or what investors you have,” Tim Quast, managing director at ModernIR, said.The exchanges compete primarily through marketing and investor services. NYSE can offer the bell ringing ceremony seen daily on CNBC television. Nasdaq owns space on Times Square billboards.Bankers typically allow companies to make that decision, with the chief executive or venture capital investors typically having the final word.Bo Brustkern, managing director of Arcstone Partners, an independent research firm, said: “I don’t see [Nasdaq and NYSE] as highly differentiated. It was a much bigger deal when Apple and Microsoft chose exchanges.”

222;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-04-03T20:05:47Z;Quick View: Let the de-consolidation begin;;Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext chief executive, enjoyed a small self-deprecating laugh at Monday’s investor meeting: “Our next greatest idea is not a complicated cross border mega-transformational merger.”With that oblique reference to the ill-fated Deutsche Börse merger, so begins NYSE Euronext’s global “de-consolidation”, in which transformation is taking a back seat to new technologies and new product ideas.To be sure, Mr Niederauer said the Deutsche Börse experience “has not left us with scars that would suggest if something else presents itself where we think it’s added up in the company, we’re going to shy away from it because we had a tough experience”.This could include a move to expand its 25 per cent stake in Fixnetix, the UK trading technology firm, into full control, an option it retains until 2015 and could exercise sooner, or other “tuck-in” deals to move its tech business to its $1bn revenue marker by 2015.But as far as taking over other exchanges, the list of potential exits discussed at Monday’s meeting was longer than potential entries.It included a 5 per cent stake in MCX, the Multi Commodity Exchange of India, which went public last year and whose lock-up expires later this year, and a 20 per cent stake in the Qatar Stock Exchange. NYSE is holding “discussions” to reduce its stake in the latter.Garry Jones, the London-based head of global derivatives at NYSE Euronext, put it bluntly: “You can’t just walk into Asia and buy exchanges. It’s hard enough to merge exchanges in the West, right? So you think you’re going to go into Asia and start buying the national assets of the country? It’s not going to work.”There also is the possible sale of NYSE Euronext’s 9 per cent stake in LCH.Clearnet, as NYSE looks to expand its clearing business. While LCH.Clearnet finalises its combination with the London Stock Exchange, “we may reduce our stake somewhat in this entity as well”, NYSE executives said.NYSE Euronext is also “retesting the hypothesis”, in Mr Niederauer’s words, of the global climate market. It is selling its 70 per cent stake in APX, an environmental risk consultancy, which is its partner in NYSE Blue. It will retain its 60 per cent stake in Bluenext, an EU carbon trading market, it owns with Caisse des Depots – for now.Together, the exits are one part of a two-year $250m cost cutting programme dubbed “Project 14”. It gives something to the critics who want NYSE to simply slash costs and return more money to shareholders.But it also frees up cash for spending on organic projects, such as $11m spent on launching a spreadbetting retail market in the UK and Europe, $85m on expanding its UK clearing house and unstated amounts creating a repo futures contract in the US.In a way, it hearkens to Nasdaq OMX’s strategy shift. Pushed off its own track of globe-trotting deals a few years earlier – aside from an ill-fated attempt to block NYSE Euronext’s Deutsche deal – Nasdaq has been scooping up tech groups such as Smarts and FTEN, and talking about becoming a global leader in market surveillance.Investors may yet see NYSE Euronext snap up an attractive asset, especially if an opportunity presents itself in an attractive market. But given the low likelihood of somewhere like Brazil auctioning its markets, technology and organic innovation will look to be the best remaining path for growth. More likely would seem to be technological alliances, such as those which have seen NYSE build systems in Hong Kong, Singapore and Brazil.A day after the investor meeting, NYSE Euronext formalised its hiring as global CIO of Peter Leukert, a former banker - as chief information officer at Commerzbank - and former consultant - McKinsey. It could prove to the best acquisition it announces this year.
223;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-04-02T20:05:42Z;NYSE Euronext to start UK spread bets market;;NYSE Euronext announced it is launching a contract-for-difference derivatives market in the UK and Europe next year, part of a series of initiatives announced as the exchange looks past its scrapped merger with Deutsche Börse.Duncan Niederauer, chief executive, also said the company would launch a new cost-cutting programme expected to slash $250m in annual expenses by 2014, or 15 per cent of its expected 2015 cost base.NYSE has already laid out a return to a previous strategy of building a clearing house in Europe, and has said it will continue to invest in new products in its nascent US futures market. Yet among tepid trading volumes, investors have been focused on capital return and cost cutting to generate income.But at Monday’s investor meeting, Mr Niederauer defended the potential of his group to continue to grow. “We really think there are opportunities to grow the top line,” he said.Mr Niederauer also said that NYSE Euronext would continue to pursue “tuck-under” and “strategic” mergers, adding that European regulators’ rejection of the Deutsche Börse deal “has not left us with scars”.One new initiative is the expected launch of a CFD market in the first quarter of 2013. It has been in development for nine months, at a cost of $11m, and is expected to be profitable by 2014.The $8bn CFD market has grown rapidly in the UK and Europe. CFDs are designed to profit from the difference in price of two securities, and are marketed primarily to retail investors and day traders.CFDs benefit from advantageous tax treatment in UK, where the stamp duty does not apply, since no physical securities are swapped. But such trading is not allowed in the US, where the Securities and Exchange Commission has restricted spread betting. It is also mired in controversy at the moment, following the collapse of the brokers MF Global and Worldspreads.The offering will differ from existing CFD markets in that NYSE Euronext will not act as a counterparty. It will instead enlist market-making firms and professional traders to take the other side of trades with retail customers in a multilateral trading facility, or MTF. The MTF will allow contracts on securities and products listed on any exchange.“This is very exciting. The size of this market is massive, and we’ll have first-mover advantage in the sense that we will not be trading against our clients,” said Garry Jones, NYSE Euronext’s head of global derivatives.NYSE Euronext also announced its cost cuts, to be called “Project 2014”. This will include technology initiatives and shrinking its real estate footprint.The company has been under pressure from analysts to bring its margins more in-line with peers. Its 38 per cent operating margin in 2011 trailed that of Nasdaq OMX, at 46 per cent, and BATS Global Markets, at 54 per cent. CME Group sits at the top, at 63 per cent, according to the analysts Raymond James.
224;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-04-01T16:26:00Z;NYSE Euronext moves on after failed merger;;NYSE Euronext begins the next phase of its life on Monday, as it holds its first investor meeting since its failed Deutsche Börse merger amid questions about how it now plans to grow its clearing and technology revenues.Since a series of proposed global exchange mergers last year were blocked by shareholders and regulators, NYSE Euronext and its peers have been fighting the perception that they have become more utilities, which are now expected to pay dividends rather than expand their companies.Many incumbent exchanges continue to lose market share to start-up electronic markets and bank-owned pools. NYSE Euronext saw its share of US stock trading fall to less than 24 per cent in the first quarter, according to analysts at Sandler O’Neill.“Given the soft volume environment, we are very interested in what they have to say about cost-cutting, the capital return programme and what they’re doing to grow new businesses,” said Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill.NYSE Euronext has said it expects to use the $550m remaining on a share buyback programme from last year, and could authorise more. But its 16 per cent share price decline in 2012 has outpaced rivals such as Nasdaq OMX, CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange.On Monday, Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext’s chief executive, is expected to delve deeper into its post-merger strategy. He has already identified clearing as a “key focus”, which had also been a central rationale for the Deutsche Börse deal.Clearing houses stand between buyers and sellers in a trade, and are expected to see sharply rising revenues as G20 countries urge more complex derivatives to be centrally cleared.The group recently announced an $85m revival of a two-year-old plan to expand its London-based derivatives clearing house and sever some of its existing ties with LCH.Clearnet. It has also hinted at further investment in its US futures trading and clearing effort, and submitted a bid for the London Metal Exchange, the commodities bourse.But analysts say the larger opportunity lies in clearing over-the-counter swaps trades for customers, and LCH.Clearnet is the global leader in clearing interest-rate swap trades between banks.Attention will also be focused on NYSE Technologies, the group’s fastest growing business. Turnover last year rose 10 per cent to $490m, but that fell short of targets, and is still halfway to its target of $1bn by 2015.
225;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-03-27T23:13:27Z;Sign of the times;The regulatory climate is becoming tougher as companies focus on consolidation;"Deals are announced with much fanfare. Busy executives carve out copious amounts of time to talk to investors and the media; behind the scenes, advisers espouse the benefits of the combination; teams of people try to ensure that employees, shareholders and the press get the right information, in the right way, at the right time.Fast forward – sometimes many months – and the completion of the deal can slip by with little ceremony. Yet the time between hopeful announcement and eventual completion is littered with obstacles that have felled several high-profile transactions in the past year.In particular, antitrust issues are looming large in the minds of would-be buyers. Last year, US regulators opposed the $39bn purchase of T-Mobile USA, the mobile phone operator, by AT&T, the US telecommunications group, and Nasdaq OMX’s bid for NYSE Euronext – eventually spelling the end of both combinations. The latter was not the only exchanges deal to fall foul of competition authorities, with European opposition forcing Deutsche Börse and NYSE to abandon their tie-up.The authorities showed that headline-grabbing megadeals are not their sole focus, as they sought to block or force change to smaller deals such as the purchase of TaxAct by H&R Block, the tax preparer, for $287.5m, and Omnicare’s $441m bid for fellow pharmaceutical supplier PharMerica.Dealmakers argue that companies have always weighed the likelihood carefully that antitrust watchdogs will examine or oppose a transaction. But there is little doubt that, after what seemed a benign period for competition enforcement, antitrust scrutiny has moved up the agenda – and looks set to stay there.“In a [US] election year, the antitrust antennas are up,” says Paul Parker, head of global mergers and acquisitions at Barclays Capital, the bank’s investment banking arm. “But the high-profile transactions that have been challenged or withdrawn for antitrust reasons were fairly calculated. People appreciated that there was a reasonably high degree of risk attached to those deals.”Consolidation among the top four US telecommunications companies was, notably, something that many industry experts believed would struggle to win approval. Nasdaq’s proposed combination with the NYSE, which aimed to consolidate a two-company market to just one player, also immediately set antitrust bells ringing.“The agencies have expressed a policy of moving towards vigorous antitrust enforcement and people have taken note,” says David Gelfand, partner at Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, the law firm. “But it is not a dramatic shift. The economic issues are ones that have been looked at for years.”Christine Varney, who last year quit as head of the US Department of Justice’s antitrust division to return to private practise at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, the Wall Street law firm, says the message has been about predictable, transparent enforcement. “What you’re seeing now is a constancy, so that when business people think about possible acquisitions, they know that a horizontal transaction leading to serious levels of consolidation will raise antitrust issues,” he says.With dealmakers predicting a focus on in-industry consolidation and cost-cutting to help support earnings as revenue growth falters, the perceived change in the regulatory climate will mean more time spent discussing potential pitfalls.“In deals where you would be testing the limits, the dialogue and investigation of antitrust issues is now much higher,” says Mr Parker. “But I do not think that two or three high-profile deals getting pulled changes the overall dynamic of the market in terms of bread-and-butter deals and the impetus for M&A.”One lesson of the past year is that regulators are co-operating more closely.“CEOs and global counsels expressed the need for international co-operation, particularly with the Europeans,” says Ms Varney of her arrival at the justice department. “I set out very systematically to build a framework whereby the US and the EU could closely collaborate on a review and reach the right conclusion for each jurisdiction.”Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic worked together in analysing the exchanges deals, say practitioners.The $12.5bn bid by Google, the search engine business, to buy Motorola Mobility, the phone maker, was also pored over in the US and Europe. The deal touched on a new focus of enforcement – control of patents – that is expected to create more controversy as companies aim to shore up ownership of crucial technology.“Intellectual property and the aggregation of patented technology will be among the biggest issues to emerge in the next few years, both in terms of reviews of transactions and industry conduct,” says Ms Varney. “We’re only in the early stages of understanding how the acquisition of patents might deter innovation.”Applying well-worn economic theories to new, emerging areas is one challenge for the competition watchdogs – and for those who are trying to predict how deals will fare.“Think about the remedy,” advises Ms Varney, after overseeing a period during which the justice department was seen as welcoming creative proposals to mitigate concerns about deals. “If a transaction is likely to generate an antitrust objection, understand the issues involved and think about whether you are willing to remedy it, either through conduct commitments or divestitures.”“The question is whether the government is able to be forward-looking and keep up with developments such as the impact of disruptive technology within industries,” adds Mr Parker. “Mergers that prove impossible today [due to antitrust concerns] may be possible in five years’ time.”"
226;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-03-26T19:59:02Z;Nasdaq OMX delays Euro clearing plan;;Nasdaq OMX delayed a plan on Monday to offer customers trading on their European exchange a choice over where their equity trades are to be cleared, blaming regulatory uncertainty over the derivatives markets for the decision.The group’s Nordic business, based in Stockholm, said it would postpone the introduction of so-called interoperability for clearing Nordic cash equities beyond its plan of April.Freeing up access to other clearing houses in the cash equities market, known as “interoperability”, is intended to allow market participants to net and cross-margin trades between venues, thus cutting costs. Traders have hitherto had little choice over where their trades were cleared and critics have argued that the proliferation of more than 20 clearing houses in Europe has tied up capital in collateral for backing trades.Although Europe’s clearing houses have committed to implementing interoperability, its rollout has been delayed as regulators sought to ensure, post-financial crisis, that new clearing arrangements would not lead to a potential systemic risk.However, European regulators have steadily been giving their blessing to arrangements proposed by various trading platforms in the last nine months, including BATS Global Markets, Chi-X Europe, Turquoise and UBS MTF. Nasdaq OMX Nordic, which first announced plans to introduce cash equities clearing in 2009, planned to unveil its service in April.The availability of the service was also conditional on Nasdaq OMX Nordic receiving approvals from the regulators of its exchanges and the clearing houses it was planning to use. However Nasdaq said it had received the necessary approvals.Nasdaq OMX Nordic said it would offer customers a choice of EMCF, the Dutch clearing house in which Nasdaq OMX has a 22 per cent stake, EuroCCP and x-Clear.Hans-Ole Jochumsen, president of Nasdaq OMX Nordic, said there was still uncertainty regarding the detailed requirements for interoperability in Europe, even though policy makers had agreed the political text for the European Markets Infrastructure Regulation (Emir), which will overhaul the region’s over-the-counter derivatives markets.“There needs to be clarity and a level playing field in this area before we can introduce interoperability,” Mr Jochumsen said in a statement. Nasdaq OMX Nordic did not give a date for the introduction for the service.The flagship reform of Emir will require derivatives traded off-exchange to be processed through clearing houses to protect the financial system against the potentially catastrophic effects of a big default. The rules are Europe’s equivalent of the Dodd-Frank act in the US.The group also said work was ongoing to update standards for clearing houses from the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and the Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (CPSS-IOSCO).
227;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-03-23T23:48:14Z;BATS undone by its own technological curveball;;When BATS Global Markets was a young start-up known only within the exchange industry, it sent baseball bats to traders and journalists in the US to raise its profile. Cricket bats were later sent when it launched in the UK.But as BATS stood on the verge of becoming a public company on Friday, it served up a curveball, or googly, in the form of a broken initial public offering. The collapse of the exchange’s debut resulted from a freak technological glitch and an unfortunately coincidental erroneous trade in Apple, perhaps the world’s most highly followed stock.“Technology is their business, and BATS stands for ‘better alternative trading systems’. Just not today,” said Larry Tabb, chief executive of the Tabb Group, a financial industry consultancy.It is ironic that BATS’s technology would fail them at the moment it was entering the public spotlight. It was the exchange’s revolutionary technology that had marked an era of sweeping change for US and global stock markets.But this incident only serves to highlight the concerns of US and European regulators, shared by many market participants, that market technology is fallible, and can produce unexpected consequences, such as the “flash crash” in 2010, for even the most sophisticated operators.Founded in 2005 with just a handful of traders and a few servers in a suburb of Kansas City, BATS used super high-speed systems and connections to high-frequency trading firms to steal market share from the traditional giants of stock trading. BATS touted its near-perfect record of systems reliability, such as an “up time” percentage of 99.94 per cent or better each of the last three years, in its offering prospectus.“Unlike traditional market operators, we are a technology company at our core,” BATS said in its prospectus.In recent months, as its IPO neared, BATS had begun to flex the muscles it had developed gaining some 10 per cent of US and European equity market share. It acquired Chi-X Europe, an electronic exchange in the UK, bringing its total European share to 25 per cent. It had also recently expanded into US listings. That is the business that sustains incumbent exchanges such as NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX and the London Stock Exchange, by generating steady revenue. BATS itself was meant to be the first company to list on its own market.But problems with the software that powers auctions of stocks, which is how IPO opening prices are set, derailed that. It also served to highlight the difficulty BATS will face growing from here in an intensely competitive, and complex, business.“Listings is a branding business, and you have to offer that strong name to attract listed companies. The question is whether BATS will have that,” said Diego Perfumo, analyst at Equity Research Desk.All is not lost yet for BATS. People close to the exchange said that Joe Ratterman, chief executive, is not likely to lose his job. These people said that although the exchange will have to regroup and deal with inevitable regulatory scrutiny, its strategy will not change.“The future for BATS is going back to what they do best and to start building another record and get past what happened,” Mr Tabb said.Though the IPO would give the company an acquisition currency and public profile, it was a small float, and few shareholders were sellers. BATS itself was not raising any money. The biggest beneficiary was set to be the creditors of Lehman Brothers, the defunct investment bank, which had been an early investor but now was raising cash to repay creditors.
228;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-03-23T15:30:21Z;European MP calls for holding period in HFT;;Anyone sending computerised orders into exchanges and other trading systems should be subject to a “minimum holding period” in stocks and derivatives to slow down ultra-fast dealing, a top European parliamentarian has said.It is the latest sign that regulators are coming up with concrete proposals for tackling the growth of high-frequency trading, where traders use computers to drive trading in and out of stocks, futures and foreign exchange in the blink of an eye.The call comes in a report by Markus Ferber, German member of the European Parliament charged with shepherding key market structure reforms through the next stage of approval in Europe.It has been keenly awaited by traders, exchanges and brokers since it will influence how lawmakers vote on a revised version of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid), which includes Europe’s proposals for curbing HFT.Mr Ferber proposed a minimum holding period for contracts before they can be cancelled. Traders using automated systems often send huge numbers of messages– which contain buy or sell instructions – only to cancel them after market sentiment changes.Exchanges have recently started taking action against orders that clog up their systems without actually resulting in trades, while Mary Schapiro, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has expressed concern that excessive cancellations might disrupt markets.Mr Ferber said action was necessary. “Only then will we get a grip on high-frequency trading and the business of ultra-fast transactions will lose its appeal,” he said.HFT already faces the prospect of the application in Europe of some kind of financial transactions tax, which is designed partly to slow down HFT.Mr Ferber said that if a certain percentage of orders ended up being cancelled and thereby unfulfilled, and that this was done in order to drive prices up, then extra fees should be slapped on traders.However, he did not explain how such a practice would drive prices up, nor discussed what should happen if prices were being depressed by such action.Exchanges such as Nasdaq OMX, Direct Edge, Deutsche Börse and Borsa Italiana have all this month unveiled fees they say are designed to discourage excessive message traffic and order cancellations.The biggest HFT firms, which include Getco and Citadel of the US, and Optiver and IMC in the Netherlands, said they were “concerned” by minimum resting periods.The European Principal Traders Association, a recently formed lobby group representing 21 such firms, said they would be concerned “by any proposals that could undo the good work to date on regulatory reforms – such as the introduction of minimum resting periods”.It said this “could result in a decrease in liquidity by hampering effective risk management”.
229;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-03-23T02:04:29Z;Getco fined $450,000 for supervisory faults;;The broker-dealer arm of Getco, the global electronic trading and market-making firm, has been fined $450,000 by a US market regulator for failing to adequately supervise algorithmic and high-frequency trading.The broker-dealer, called Octeg, agreed earlier this month to pay the fine to Nasdaq OMX’s market regulator and appoint an independent consultant, but it did not admit any wrongdoing, and there was no accusation that any trading had gone awry.The examination was one of many regulatory investigations begun after the “flash crash” in May 2010, which sparked a wave of concern about risk controls in the US equity markets. This is the first fine disclosed by Nasdaq to result from those inquiries.Nasdaq, which contracted out the investigation to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, found that Octeg “failed to establish and maintain a reasonable supervisory system, including but not limited to its written supervisory procedures and supervisory and operational risk control systems related to the oversight and operation of high-frequency trading and algorithmic trading” from the period of May 7 2010, until December 2011.The consultant, to be appointed within 60 days from March 8, will review “operational risk controls for the oversight and operation of algorithms used for the firm’s market making activities”, including “levels of message traffic and wash sales and other improper trading activity”. Octeg will have to implement any recommendations within 90 days, or suggest an alternative deemed suitable by the consultant.Sophie Sohn, Getco spokesperson, said in a statement: “We are pleased to have resolved this matter. While the settlement did not find that there was any harm caused to the market or participants, we are always looking for ways to further enhance our policies, procedures and controls.”The charge follows a $10,000 settlement in 2010 with Nasdaq for failing to have adequate procedures related to erroneous trades. At that time, Octeg agreed to undertake a review of its written standards and procedures, though it admitted no wrongdoing.That year, the UK’s Financial Services Authority fined Getco Europe £1.4m for failing to report accurate data for 46.3m trades as part of a series of fines on banks and trading firms related to trade reporting.The latest charges relate to Getco’s proprietary trading activities, such as high-frequency market-making, which pass through its broker-dealer before going to the market.Getco, founded in 1999, is one of the largest trading firms in the world. It is in the midst of expanding beyond its original business of trading for its own account, having recently named a new chief executive and becoming the second largest designated market-maker on the New York Stock Exchange. It has also begun selling some of its trading algorithms to outside clients.
230;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-03-23T00:53:16Z;BATS IPO prices at bottom of range;;BATS Global Markets, operator of securities exchanges in the US and Europe, priced its initial public offering at the bottom of its expected range amid a series of concerns about capital markets.At $16 a share, the offering on Thursday night raised $100m and valued the company at around $760m. BATS had projected a price as high as $18. It could raise an additional $16m if underwriters exercise an overallotment clause.The exchange has faced tepid global equity trading volumes, despite a surge in share prices, that have weighed on valuations across the exchange sector. It also faces stiff competition and high hurdles as it seeks to expand into listings and grow its market share.But the fact that BATS is pricing at all is a sign of the exchange’s rapid expansion to a critical market intermediary. Founded just in 2005 with a handful of employees by a proprietary trading firm in Kansas, it has attracted investment by the world’s largest banks and now trades roughy 11 per cent of daily US equity volume, 25 per cent of European equities and 3 per cent of US options.Other trading groups, such as Liquidnet, which facilitates trading of large blocks of shares, and ConvergEx, an agency electronic brokerage, have withdrawn IPOs in recent years. BATS’ offering would be the first by a US exchange since CBOE, the options market, made a public debut in 2010.“While BATS is a strong company, having played David to the NYSE and Nasdaq’s Goliath, it’s going to need more cash to grow, so institutions have the leverage to name the price they want,” said Scott Sweet, senior managing partner at IPO Boutique, an investor advisory.BATS recently expanded its footprint in Europe, last year buying the London-based Chi-X Europe multilateral trading facility, an electronic stock market. It also started a primary listings market in the US and will make itself the first listing of an operating company, under the ticker symbol “BATS”. It takes on established giants Nasdaq and NYSE.However, the industry as a whole has suffered from weak equity volumes, off 10 per cent so far this year in the US versus last year. Retail investors and mutual funds have largely sat out the rally and intense competition has seen profits on trades narrow to only fractions of a cent.BATS, like other exchanges, is also in the midst of a broad inquiry by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which is concerned about practices such as specialised order types and co-location with exchange servers that may disadvantage some customers.Shares of NYSE Euronext, parent of the New York Stock Exchange, are up 14 per cent this year, and Nasdaq OMX is up 8.9 per cent. They have lagged behind the broader securities sector, as the KBW Capital Markets index is up 23 per cent.BATS’s expected share price implies significant growth, at between 16 and 18 times earnings, despite the challenging environment. That compares to 9.8 times for NYSE Euronext and 8.7 times for Nasdaq, according to Diego Perfumo, analyst at Equity Research Desk. BATS’ net profits last were $23.5m, up from $19.8m in 2010.“We see limited upside from the IPO price level,” said Mr Perfumo. He cited concern that BATS’s early investors may not send as much activity to the exchange, though it may be able to raise access fees on its former owners, he said.The offering did not see BATS itself raise any cash to fund its growth. The largest sellers were the remnants Lehman Brothers, the defunct investment bank, and Getco, the electronic trading firm. Both were early investors in BATS before it became a licensed stock exchange. BATS also paid a $100m dividend to its owners just before the IPO.
231;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
232;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-03-12T13:39:51Z;D Börse tops European data charts;;Deutsche Börse is home to the consistently highest volumes of electronic orders in Europe but Chi-X Europe often sees the highest peaks, a new service that provides a snapshot of the region’s trading flows has indicated.Exegy, a US market data processing company, has teamed up with the Financial Information Forum and MarketPrizm, a trading technology company owned by Colt, a UK telecoms provider, to create a service that tracks the data messages that pass through each of the region’s exchanges and trading platforms. It is due to go into beta testing on Monday.The service provides the first insight into the practical impact of high-speed electronic and automated trading in Europe. Data messages – quotes or orders – serve as the global market’s red blood cells, carrying information on trades. Most of the high-frequency quoting takes place on futures and equities exchanges and the growth of algorithmic trading means they are being sent around the world in ever greater quantities, often in rapid bursts.Data rates in the US have been doubling annually in recent years, according to Exegy, and hit a high point in early October when around 6.65m messages per second were sent across American trading platforms at one point.The European service builds on an established US version called marketdatapeaks.com. It shows that the European market typically deals with about 300,000 messages per day, usually appearing in very sudden and fast bursts and dips.So far this month, Eurex, the derivatives platform of Deutsche Börse, hit a peak of about 61,000 messages per second while Chi-X Europe, the region’s largest share trading platform owned by BATS Global Markets, hit 67,000. The London Stock Exchange reached 25,000 messages per second and NYSE Euronext’s UTP platform 9,000.However, those figures only include quoted prices and trades and not cancelled quotes. Regulators and exchanges on both sides of the Atlantic have grown worried about the levels of messaging, concerned about the capacity of exchanges to cope and their ability to police markets and prevent big market swings, as happened in 20 minutes of trading in the “flash crash” of 2010.Deutsche Börse said two weeks ago it would issue punitive charges to traders if they sent too many orders into the exchange that do not result in deals. Such trades do not contribute value but are simply using system capacity, it said.The statistics also highlight that messaging volumes in Europe are far lower than in the US, which typically sees around 3m-4m messages per day from activity on the largest US exchanges such as CME Group, NYSE Euronext, BAT Global Markets, Nasdaq OMX and Direct Edge. Jeff Wells, vice-president of product marketing at Exegy, said it highlighted that the majority of messaging flow was from derivatives exchanges and the maturer US market has 10 options exchanges.“It’s not about being behind the US. It’s a market structure issue in Europe. The market is more fragmented with 23 exchanges, although trading is actually concentrated in fewer exchanges as the products aren’t fungible,” said Tanuja Randery, chief executive of MarketPrizm.
233;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-03-09T16:03:14Z;London Stock Exchange;After several false moves, LSE finally nails an important strategic move;"The London Stock Exchange used to be its competitors’ plaything. Subject to numerous takeover approaches and consistently outflanked by NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq and Deutsche Börse in consolidating the securities trading landscape, it hid crippling indecision behind a veil of aloofness. When LSE finally stirred, in 2007, it (over)paid for Borsa Italiana. On Friday, however, it finally nailed an important strategic move, buying control of LCH.Clearnet for €463m. From plaything to playmaker, at least in the London market.LSE chief executive Xavier Rolet has been forced to pay handsomely to secure a last-minute seat at the consolidation table. The price is equivalent to over 21 times LCH.Clearnet’s 2011 net profit, and the LSE is buying a maximum 60 per cent stake. This arrangement keeps the clearing house’s customers – the big banks and brokerages – in the tent. LCH.Clearnet is basically a risk management business; its customers like to have a degree of control.Mr Rolet has a mixed record so far in turning the strategic fortunes of the LSE around since becoming chief executive in 2009. Last year, his most audacious move – to merge the LSE with the Toronto stock exchange – was scuppered by Canadian opposition. Buying LCH.Clearnet is less headline-grabbing. But it chimes with the LSE’s long-held view that the integration of trading and post-trading should not create monopoly clearing houses – which is starting to find regulatory favour.The question is whether Mr Rolet has left it too late for the LSE to play a decisive role in exchange consolidation. Shares in LSE soared 10 per cent on confirmation that the LCH.Clearnet deal had been secured, indicating that investors expect big synergies from it. Either that, or they believe that, armed at last with a substantial clearing business, the LSE has now become an even more attractive plaything.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
234;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-03-08T23:17:52Z;Stock exchanges: Merger of markets may foreshadow expansion overseas;Ben McLannahan explains why Tokyo and Osaka are joining forces;The union of Japan’s largest exchange groups has been a long time coming. Years after big exchanges in other jurisdictions started combining, or at least trying to, Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Osaka Securities Exchange should merge into a single entity by 2013.As TSE chief executive Atsushi Saito told the Nikkei newspaper in January: “The Japanese market needs to be of a certain size and offer unique services in order not to be left behind by global developments.”In theory at least, the merged company – tentatively named “ Japan Exchange Group” – should be a more attractive place to do business than the TSE or OSE in isolation.Tokyo will acquire a majority of the Osaka bourse, form a holding company, maintain the OSE’s public listing and create four business units: cash equity market, futures trading, regulatory and clearing. That will give it both scale and solidity.In equities, JEG should overtake the London Stock Exchange to become the world’s third-largest market after NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq, based on the total value of listings. In derivatives, Osaka has built an apparently cycle-proof business trading futures and options on the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.“You’d have to figure that this deal has more obvious benefits than a cross-border deal,” says Lee Porter, Hong Kong-based head of Asia-Pacific at Liquidnet, operator of an off-exchange platform for institutions.“If you’re a broker with two sets of connectivity and two sets of relationships with two separate exchanges, removing one set will make your life cheaper and easier. And for the exchanges themselves, there have to be economies of scale, which should get passed on to users.”Analysts note that bigger synergies than the advertised Y7bn ($87m) a year look possible, given the history of other in-country deals between stock and derivatives groups, such as the merger of Australia’s ASX and the Sydney Futures Exchange six years ago. And the deal could spur further domestic consolidation. The newly merged JEG could go on to purchase the Tokyo Commodity Exchange and the Tokyo Grain Exchange, says Stephen Barker, an analyst at Credit Suisse.Overseas, too, JEG could do deals. The transaction is, effectively, a backdoor listing for the TSE, giving the 134-year-old exchange a currency with which to enter the global exchange-acquisition game.The big question, however, is whether JEG can win back influence on the global stage, after years of thumb-twiddling. The TSE was demutualised 11 years ago, converting from a not-for-profit association of stockbrokers into a for-profit public limited company: Osaka demutualised and listed in April 2004.While other exchanges around the world have used that process as a catalyst to seek growth overseas, neither the TSE nor the OSE has done much outside Japan.Take Tokyo AIM, a joint venture between the TSE (51 per cent) and the London Stock Exchange (49 per cent), targeted at fast-growing companies. Three years on from its much-trumpeted launch, it has one listed company and one more pending.Japan has lost ground in other ways, too. Only two non-Japanese companies have listed on the TSE since the beginning of 2010, for example. Now, just 11 of the 2,276 companies listed in Tokyo are foreign, from a peak of 127 in 1991.By contrast, the number of foreign companies listed in Hong Kong has more than doubled to 24 in the past 10 years. “Offerings in Hong Kong can be expedited much better: the exchange turns things round much more quickly,” says one head of equity capital markets in Tokyo.Internally, too, the picture is not entirely encouraging. Along with many incumbent exchange groups around the world, the TSE and OSE are facing the threat of alternative trading platforms eating into their market share.In 2011, the combined equity-trading shares of SBI Japannext and Chi-X, the two leading alternative domestic platforms, doubled to about 3 per cent. On some days, they account for about a fifth of trading in the most liquid and recognisable stocks.Rivals point out that the playing field is not exactly level. For example, margin traders are banned from alternative venues altogether.But regulatory protections for the main exchanges could be on their way out.Following a technical glitch last month which halted trading in hundreds of TSE stocks, the Japan Securities Dealers Association is drawing up guidelines stating that in principle, off-board trading should remain online when a bourse suffers a system glitch.The TSE and the OSE “see the writing on the wall”, says Neil Katkov, a Tokyo-based financial consultant at Celent. “In the long run, they see the trend towards liquidity moving to other venues.”That should increase the pressure to seek growth overseas. In October 2010, remarking on merger discussions between Australia’s ASX and Singapore’s SGX (of which the TSE holds 5 per cent) Mr Saito warned of the consequences of Japan becoming “isolated on the international stage”.The reality is that, during the most recent rounds of talks between the world’s leading exchange groups, the Japanese were largely bystanders.Creating a bigger, leaner, more outward-looking JEG looks a step in the right direction.
235;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-03-07T23:55:18Z;US bourses to fine HFT data-cloggers;;Two of the biggest US stock exchanges are set to impose penalties on high-frequency traders who clog the markets’ data pipes with unnecessary messages that do not result in trades.This move comes as Mary Schapiro, head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, recently expressed worries that such activity might be disruptive to markets.Nasdaq and Direct Edge on Wednesday announced schemes designed to promote more efficient trading by automated traders using sophisticated algorithms. Such “algos” send bursts of quotes that are then cancelled or replaced with new quotes in milliseconds once they figure out the market’s direction.This follows similar moves earlier this month by European stock exchange groups Deutsche Börse and Borsa Italiana.The other big US exchanges, New York Stock Exchange and BATS, have incentives in place for efficient trading in stocks listed on their markets, but do not yet have similar penalties.The new proposals must be reviewed by the SEC before becoming active.Though rapid quote cancelling is seen as a way for marketmakers to minimise the risks of offering prices to other traders, keeping trading costs low, there is growing concern that a portion of such traffic is inefficient and raises costs to other investors who must invest in greater data bandwidth.Nasdaq’s measures will penalise traders that send over 1m messages per day – which will include quotes, cancellations and replacements – but generate fewer than 1 trade per 100 messages.The penalties will initially range from 0.01 cents to 1 cent per trade, with higher charges for messages further from the market price. This is called the weighted order-to-trade ratio. The charges could change, however, if they prove not be effective at curbing messaging.“We don’t expect there to be a large number of customers affected, but it should cause people to focus on efficient quoting behaviour,” said Eric Noll, executive vice president at Nasdaq OMX. “In an ideal world, no one would pay anything.”Direct Edge’s message efficiency incentive programme will target any customers whose trade-to-message ratio is less than 1-to-100. Those who exceed the ratio will receive lower rebates to place quotes in the market, down from 0.34 cents to 0.33 cents per share.Critics have argued since the “flash crash” in 2010 that excessive messaging could destabilise markets. A panel of academics convened by regulators recommended message traffic fees.“It’s a win for the industry that the major exchanges have acknowledged excessive cancellation rates are a problem,” Joseph Saluzzi of Themis Trading, an institutional brokerage.But he also said it was too soon to judge the effectiveness. “One hundred-to-one is still a very high ratio, and the penalties could be stiffer,” he said.Both exchanges’ proposals exclude market-making firms that buy and sell shares throughout the session. “It’s not a compliance sanction,” said Bill O’Brien, Direct Edge chief executive. “This is an economic incentive for more people to become marketmakers.”The US Securities and Exchange Commission has been urging a shift toward stiffer requirements for market making since the “flash crash” in 2010, when some traders stopped trading, causing wild price swings.
236;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-03-07T18:00:51Z;Direct Edge addresses tradeless quotes;;Direct Edge, the US electronic stock exchange, is adopting new measures to combat high rates of quotes that do not result in trades, following measures by several other US and European groups to address the costs of such trading.Like many exchanges, Direct Edge has seen an explosion of message traffic resulting from the increasing speed and use of high-frequency trading algorithms, many of which will quote and then cancel trades once they detect how the market is moving.Though the practice is viewed by many as necessary to providing liquidity at low risk, enabling tight trading spreads, there is a growing belief that a portion of such traffic is inefficient, and possibly abusive as well.It also drives up costs to many traders who do not trade in millisecond increments but must pay for such data feeds. Nanex, the market data firm, has said that many high-volume US trading days can produce nearly 1 terabyte, or a million megabytes, of data.“These changes have had a profound impact on how our market operates, how resources are used, and the nature of responsible market participation,” said Bryan Harkins, chief operating officer, in a letter to clients.To combat this, Direct Edge told clients on Wednesday it will start paying lower rebates on excessive volumes of messages, termed the Message Efficiency Incentive Program.It will pay full rebates to eligible traders only if their average monthly ratio of messages-to-trades is at or less than 100 to 1. If they exceed that level, traders will receive $0.0001, or 1 mil, less per share in rebates.“The objective of the [programme] is to continue to provide members with order-management flexibility, while acknowledging the benefits to the market that come with more efficient participation,” Mr Harkins wrote.The flat approach is in keeping with moves at Deutsche Börse and Borsa Italiana, who have announced similar measures in recent weeks.They were responding in part to regulatory concern. In Europe, several countries are considering transaction taxes that would affect all trading, but most dramatically high-speed strategies that produce tiny margins across thousands of trades.The US is not looking at such blunt measures, but the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission have both said they were still reviewing automated trading strategies. The CFTC cited “potential market disruptions”.Some exchanges are focused on narrower excesses. Last week, the IntercontinentalExchange announced a year-long pilot programme that penalised high cancellation rates, but only when quotes were far away from the current market price.It said that violations of its limits fell by 97 per cent, as firms adjusted their automated algorithms.Other exchanges have also been tweaking their approaches to such traffic. The London Stock Exchange has operated a similar tariff, which it calls an “order management surcharge” since 2005 and revised it in 2010. Euronext, which comprises the Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon markets, has operated one since 2007.Nasdaq OMX last year instituted rules requiring the minimum life for a quote on its PSX market. BATS recently adopted a market-making programme for shares that go public on its nascent listings market, whereby traders will be rewarded for effective quote rates.
237;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-03-02T16:45:07Z;Beware betting on the Nasdaq bull;;"It has taken more than 11 years for the headlines of “Nasdaq 3,000” to stage a return and, after a long absence, the symbol of the dotcom implosion is once more leading the US equity market.By virtue of being at the cutting edge of innovation, technology-based companies have always intoxicated the most optimistic investors. Here, returns are measured not by the dull but reliable payment of steadily rising dividends but by eye-popping share price surges; the performance of Apple shares are a vivid example.This year the Nasdaq has registered a gain of more than 14 per cent, with the benchmark briefly topping 3,000 on Wednesday, a threshold not seen since November of 2000, some eight months after the dotcom peak of 5,048.In 2012 to date, the Nasdaq has beaten the S&P 500’s rise of 8.9 per cent. It has also outshone many high dividend-paying stocks that were big winners last year and have been touted by some investment managers as the new fixed income in an era of artificially low Treasury yields courtesy of the Federal Reserve’s bond buying. For example, telecoms operator Verizon, whose shares sport a very attractive dividend yield of 5.2 per cent, languish 3.6 per cent lower in 2012.Valued at 15.8 times estimated earnings, the valuation case for Nasdaq on the surface looks appealing and raises the question as to whether the 3,000 threshold will be a stepping stone to greater riches?So far this year, technology is hot – very hot.After lagging the latest bull run that got going in October, the S&P tech sector has leapfrogged financials, materials, energy and industrials to lead the way in 2012. The Nasdaq is also close to eclipsing the gains of the S&P Dividend Aristocrats, the big blue-chips that pay ever-increasing dividends to shareholders.Taking a contrarian view, one could regard last year’s crowded trade of buying high dividend-paying stocks as akin to buying Nasdaq in early 2000 at the height of dotcom froth.A bet on the Nasdaq maintaining its 2012 pace, however, is no sure thing.For starters, Apple accounts for a hefty 11 per cent of the composite and the tech cheerleader remains in a league of its own when compared with its struggling and, in many cases, more expensively valued rivals.Yet being at the forefront of technological innovation is intensely competitive and today’s winner can swiftly be eclipsed. And the outsized success of Apple is a specific company story, not a buy signal for the Nasdaq.“Our issue with Apple is not Apple per se but rather the enthusiasm regarding tech overall and the fact that two technicians who have missed the boat are now suggesting that we have a new bull market in tech,” Birinyi Associates wrote this week.Another red flag for the Nasdaq is the nascent evidence that equity mutual fund flows look close to reversing last year’s hefty outflows. Historically, the return of so-called “dumb money” has been eagerly greeted by the professionals intent on selling out of the market.“Just when retail investors commit to equity investments in size, the market often turns against them,” says Neal Soss of Credit Suisse. “Evidence abounds of households buying high and selling low.”Perhaps the biggest argument against technology is the fact that it’s a bet on the economy gaining escape velocity this year and not repeating the sluggish stop and go cycle of recent years. That’s a big call when oil prices are surging and house prices continue falling.Should the economy fully recover this year, buying financials and not tech is the real bet to make. Banks remain cheap and would rally the hardest in a properly functioning economy.The alternative scenario of below-trend growth favours those presently maligned dividend-paying stocks and not tech. It is worth recalling that no matter how expensive dividend payers looked in Japan during the post bubble period, they remained a bastion for investors as the economy and the stock market continued to falter.Nasdaq 3,000 may sound like a milestone for technology bulls, but it could well be a millstone later this year.michael.mackenzie@ft.com"
238;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-02-27T19:08:42Z;NYSE Euronext launches gold and silver options;;NYSE Euronext’s upstart US futures market has launched gold and silver options, the latest in a series of exchange moves to tap burgeoning retail and hedge fund demand for metals trades.While commercial gold trading is primarily a physical market, with most financial speculators and small investors accessing it via exchange-traded funds that own gold, exchanges are widening the options for derivatives contracts on the precious metal seen by some as a long-term hedge against inflation.Last month, Nasdaq OMX announced it would launch spot gold futures contracts, meant to simulate the owning of physical gold. CME Group has long offered gold futures via its Comex market and more recently has begun to offer similar “micro” contracts with smaller lots.NYSE Liffe US announced on Monday that it had started offering options on its “mini” futures contracts, represent a delivery of 33.2 ounces of gold or 1,000 ounces of silver.“Customers’ ability to manage risk will be enhanced and they will also be able to take positions based on volatility,” said Jennifer Ropiak, head of precious metals marketing at NYSE Liffe US.CME previously offered “mini” futures, but delisted them in favour of “micro” futures of just 10 ounces last year. Nasdaq’s new spot contracts are also for 10 ounces.Gold futures on CME have open interest of 262,000 contracts, versus some 3,400 open contracts for Liffe US “mini” futures and 2,700 for CME “micro” futures.Both NYSE Euronext and CME Group are among the companies bidding to take over the London Metals Exchange, which they believe would bolster their financial instruments tracking gold. The LME lacks the clearing house services offered by CME and NYSE Liffe.The LME offers post-trade services on over-the-counter gold trades in the London bullion market and also publishes a forward contract curve and prices for gold interest rate swaps.
239;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-02-25T02:17:58Z;Maple group extends TMX offer deadline;;The Canadian consortium of banks and funds bidding to buy TMX Group, Canada’s largest exchange operator, has extended the deadline on its offer as it continues to fight for regulatory approval of the deal.The Maple group has bid C$3.8bn to buy TMX, of which it is the sole suitor after shareholders of the exchange rejected a rival bid by the London Stock Exchange on the grounds that Canadian authorities would likely block a foreign buyer.But regulators have also expressed serious reservations about the plan to consolidate Canada’s largest public marketplace with some of the country’s largest banks. The banks’ bid is partly in cash, but they would contribute their ownership stakes in CDS, the country’s largest clearing utility, and in Alpha, the biggest off-exchange trading venue.The offer to TMX shareholders was originally set to expire at the end of this month, but has been extended to the end of March, in anticipation of a final regulatory decision in that time. A condition of the offer is that regulators approve it without changes that would be of “material detriment”. TMX’s board has already recommended the deal.In late January, Maple put forward remedies to Melanie Aitken, commissioner of competition, to address concerns about potential monopolisation of equities trading and clearing and settlement.The deal must also be approved by provincial securities regulators in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia.The group proposed a pricing schedule for clearing and offered guarantees that combining the largest equity market and its biggest electronic competitor would not result in higher access fees, believing these moves would be sufficient to secure approval. Discussions are ongoing, Maple said.“We wouldn’t be extending if there wasn’t light at the end of the tunnel,” said Peter Block, a spokesperson for the Maple group. “We are doing so only because we are confident of approval.”The banks may have other motives to delay, however. Diego Perfumo, exchanges analyst at ER Desk, said that the banks are in no hurry to finalise the deal because Canada had already set the precedent that it would not likely allow a foreign acquirer to take control of TMX.“There’s no incentive for the banks to commit money now and potentially waste time and money if the transaction does not happen,” he said.He added, however, that Maple would not likely ultimately withdraw its offer unless regulators blocked it or added onerous conditions, “because otherwise next time there is a threat the market won’t see them as a credible alternative”.Exchange consolidation has proved extremely difficult despite a rash of proposed combinations. EU authorities rejected a merger of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext and US antitrust regulators said Nasdaq OMX could not submit a rival bid for NYSE. Australia last year turned down a bid by the Singapore Exchange to acquire its national bourse.
240;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-02-24T16:05:12Z;BATS plans European listings venue;;BATS Global Markets, operator of the third-largest US stock exchange, is to open up a new front in its challenge to Europe’s incumbent bourses after it confirmed it was looking to set up as a listings venue in the region.Regulatory filings for the Kansas City-based group also showed that its costs for last year’s purchase of Chi-X Europe, the region’s largest share trading platform, have totalled more than $16m.The US group’s plans to offer an alternative listings platform, mostly likely from London, represent a potential new threat to traditional venues such as the London Stock Exchange, Nasdaq OMX and NYSE Euronext, who are able to charge lucrative fees to float on their markets. BATS, along with Chi-X Europe, has grabbed large slices of bourses’ traditional equities trading in recent years with faster technology and cheaper trading fees.BATS said its $305m deal for Chi-X gave it “additional opportunities to influence European market structure developments for the benefit of our customers, including through registering as an exchange, which we intend to pursue in 2012”.Its comments are the first indications of BATS’ plans for Europe since the Chi-X deal completed in November last year. It has been in a closed period as it prepares for an initial public offering in the US this year.The filing also indicated how costs for the deal had risen sharply after UK competition authorities launched a deeper investigation of the deal. It was passed in November after the Competition Commission said customers of both venues, like brokers, had the power to prevent the merged company from exploiting its position by taking business elsewhere or creating a rival.BATS incurred costs of $11.4m last year in fees to investment bankers, lawyers, accountants and other professional advisers related to the deal, the filing said. It added it expected to incur further costs of around $5.1m in 2012 related to severance and retention payments for Chi-X Europe employees. The group had originally forecast costs of around $9m.As an independent company, Chi-X Europe also racked up merger expenses, paying out $13.4m in fees to professional advisers. The costs pushed Chi-X to a net loss of $9.4m for the year to December 31 compared to a profit of $1.2m a year ago. Revenues in the period rose from $65.1m in 2010 to $72.8m.Chi-X Europe was the most successful of a raft of new trading platforms that emerged after Mifid, the European Commission’s financial markets directive, encouraged competition to incumbent exchanges in the share trading market. BATS Europe followed, launching in October 2008.BATS has carved out a market share of around 10 per cent in the US, and 6 per cent in Europe. Chi-X has taken a market share of around 20 per cent.
241;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-02-24T02:14:34Z;BATS to pay dividend before IPO;;"The current shareholders of BATS Global Markets will receive a $100m dividend the day before its anticipated public debut.BATS is owned primarily by a consortium of major banks and trading firms. The group includes founder Dave Cummings and his firm Tradebot, plus Getco, Lime Brokerage, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Wedbush Morgan and the Lehman Brothers estate.These shareholders have not yet disclosed how much of their stakes they plan to sell in the initial public offering. The dividend, which will not be paid to purchasers at the IPO, was approved by the board of directors, which includes executives from several of those banks.BATS said in a revised S-1 filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it did not expect to pay any additional dividends: “We currently plan to retain any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and to fund future growth; therefore, we do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.”Most of the owners acquired stakes during BATS’s early stages as a US alternative trading system before it was granted public exchange status in 2008. It has since expanded into options and launched a market in the UK. Last year BATS acquired competitor Chi-X Europe.BATS’s US stock exchange, based in Kansas City, trades between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of US equity trading volumes each month, making it the third or fourth largest stock exchange alongside Direct Edge.The IPO is expected to be launched in the next two months, people familiar with the exchange’s thinking have said, though market conditions will be considered. BATS declined to comment on the timing.It will be the first public debut of a US stock exchange since Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange transitioned to public companies before the financial crisis. The Chicago Board Options Exchange staged a successful initial public offering last year.It will also possibly mark the first posting of an operating company to BATS’s nascent listings market. BATS is likely keen to go public in order to begin marketing its new marketplace.BATS has already attracted the listing of several exchange-traded funds managed by BlackRock. It also recently announced that it would forgo annual listing fees for companies that traded in very high volumes."
242;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-02-23T20:49:45Z;LSE draws fire over Borsa synergies;;The London Stock Exchange’s takeover of the Milan bourse five years ago “has not fulfilled expectations either in Italy or London” in terms of stimulating cross-border capital flows or increased investment in Italian companies, the Italian securities regulator has claimed.Guiseppe Vegas, head of Consob, said “the merger of the LSE and Borsa Italiana could be a good thing but it has not yet demonstrated good effects”. The purchase of the Borsa by the LSE for €1.64bn was hailed at the time as creating “attractive cross-market access opportunities”, enlarging the liquidity pool available to listed companies and “accelerating the development of the [small and medium-sized] market place”.It was the UK bourse’s first big strategic move after spending almost two years fending off a hostile approach from Nasdaq, the US exchange, and a takeover bid by Deutsche Börse.Mr Vegas said: “There are not many capital flows from Britain to Italy and from Italy to Britain. If I have the terrain and you have the seeds, you must give the seeds to me.”His comments, in separate interviews in Milan and London, appeared to apply mostly to equities trading and capital-raising on the Borsa’s junior board, Aim Italia. Like the larger Aim market in the UK and other small-cap boards, it has struggled to attract new listings since the 2008 crisis.Mr Vegas’s remarks come as the LSE is benefiting from strong performance at the Borsa’s MTS bond trading platform and as its Italian clearing house is delivering record earnings to the UK group.The LSE pointed out that the Borsa’s revenues were 30 per cent higher in absolute terms since the acquisition, and that the number of listed companies had declined by 3 per cent in Italy since then, compared with a 19 per cent fall in the UK. Raffaele Jerusalmi, the Borsa’s chief executive, said: “Despite a turbulent macro environment since the merger between Borsa Italiana and LSE, Borsa Italiana has thrived. Across our whole business we have seen benefits from our partnership, with new skills, and clients brought to both our businesses.”Italy is to let its ban on short selling lapse on Saturday. Consob plans to announce a series of simplifications in the next few weeks, including stripping back some national rules that supplement European Union directives, known as gold-plating.
243;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-02-21T10:57:06Z;Sweden finds HFT effects ‘limited’;;The emergence of high-frequency trading has a limited effect on equity markets but increased the potential for market abuse while supervision is “insufficient”, an investigation by Swedish regulators has concluded.A report by Finansinspektionen (FI), the Swedish markets authority, into high-frequency and automated trading found that the controversial practice “contributes to – but is not responsible for – changes in trading”.“The negative effects related to high-frequency and algorithmic trading are limited,” it said, but warned that there was “considerable concern that the market will be subject to greater abuse”.The study was begun in response to growing concern in Sweden about the potential effects on equity markets of high-speed trading, which has transformed dealing on many US and European markets in recent years. Last year high-frequency companies doubled their market share on Nasdaq OMX’s Nordic markets – of which Sweden is the dominant market – to more than 10 per cent.Fast communications networks and cheap, efficient computing power has enabled traders, via algorithms, to buy and sell shares in thousandths of seconds. Analysts have estimated that around a third of trading on European markets is automated dealing.However, its rise and the role of algorithms in the May 2010 “flash crash” in the US has concerned investors and regulators and sparked investigations into the practice. Besides Sweden, the UK and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the US regulator, are also examining the effects of computerised trading. France has favoured tougher regulation of HFT.In recent years automated trading companies have carved out a niche within Nordic markets, with companies such as Citadel Securities, part of Citadel, the Chicago-based hedge fund, Getco Europe, Spire Europe and Virtu Financial all active in the market.The FI report concluded that: “While trading had undergone a transformation, and some aspects of liquidity have deteriorated – and that the market has become more volatile – most parties believe that this is due to multiple factors and not just faster, more computerised trading techniques.”Niklas Johansson, the independent investigator, said that the risk to financial stability was limited as many HFT companies do not carry any financial risk in their balance sheets. However, he warned that there were greater risks to the market from poorly-designed algorithms.He also found that the majority of companies expressed concern that a large portion of high-frequency trading was being used to manipulate the market.“There are clear apprehensions that market abuse has become more extensive and difficult to identify as a result of the sharp increase in the number of orders and trades,” he said.FI said that marketplaces must focus on expanding their systems that monitor trading in real time and improving co-ordination between each other to identify any market abuse. Nasdaq OMX and BATS Chi-X Europe are the two largest markets in Sweden, accounting for more than 90 per cent of trading.
244;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-02-14T22:21:43Z;US exchange websites attacked;Trading systems continue to operate;The public web sites of some US securities exchanges experienced outages after cyber-attacks on Monday and Tuesday, but their trading systems were unaffected.Web sites operated by Nasdaq OMX, BATS Trading and the Chicago Board Options Exchange were targeted, though none of the groups reported any attempts to extract data or target their trading systems, which are separate from their web sites.Nasdaq described the disruption as “an attempt to block access”, rather than designed to retrieve information. The action affected Nasdaq.com and Nasdaqtrader.com, a public market data site.“Over the past day, we’ve experienced intermittent service disruptions on our corporate website. We are working with the internet service providers to resolve these issues,” said a Nasdaq spokesperson.BATS Trading said it experienced an “external distributed denial of service” on its public site on Monday, but also said that its trading systems were unaffected. It said its site was quickly returned to normal operation after working with its service provider.A spokesperson said in a statement: “Our web site is used to display general information about our market activity for the casual user, and there are no critical functions supported through our general public site…. Our trading systems continue to operate normally today.”A CBOE spokesperson said it experienced a “directed denial of service” on Monday that affected its public web site but no trading data or systems. Such attacks involve flooding the web site with messages, overwhelming it and causing outages.Three people briefed on the disruptions said they appeared to be the work of a group identifying itself as “the 99 per cent”, a reference to a slogan used by protesters who associate with the Occupy Wall Street movement, but there was no direct confirmation.Exchange web sites are popular targets for disruption. Last year, the hacker group Anonymous said in a statement that it would target the New York Stock Exchange’s public web site in support of Occupy Wall Street.An NYSE spokesperson said it was experiencing no outages.Nasdaq OMX also in 2010 experienced an attack on the web site of one of its corporate services that stores company documents in a “cloud” server, but it reported no thefts of data. The attack was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Following that incident, US lawmakers called upon exchanges to bolster their defences and reporting of attacks. The Securities and Exchange Commission also issued guidance that companies should report cybercrime incidents in their financial reports. The SEC declined to comment on Tuesday about the latest outages.
245;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-02-14T00:51:07Z;Equities trading costs under pressure;;Costs for finalising equities trades are coming under renewed pressure after one of the region’s at-cost clearing houses said its market share had grown due to brokers keen to cut overall trading costs.EuroCCP, a London-based clearing house largely governed by its users, said it had cleared an average 3m sides per day in January, which would equal to around 25 per cent of Europe’s daily average volume.That is compared with a market share of around six per cent last year, based on statistics from the Federation of European Securities Exchanges.Its rising market share has come in the wake of new clearing arrangements a month ago from Chi-X Europe, the region’s largest share trading platform.A clearing house, also known as a central counterparty (CCP), stands between two parties to guarantee a trade is completed if one party defaults. Chi-X Europe has allowed users a choice of clearing house, and EuroCCP says it has taken 40 per cent of the venue’s volume.The dramatic shift in market share for clearing equities in the last month has illustrated the extent to which banks and brokers, facing lower profitability and tougher capital rules, are looking at costs by analysing all aspects of trading.Critics have argued that clearing and settlement costs in Europe have been kept high by more than 20 clearing houses, few of which allowed access to rivals.Chi-X Europe, owned by US group BATS Global Markets, has been the largest of several of Europe’s alternative trading venues pushing to free-up access to other clearing houses, a push known as “interoperability”. By keeping their trading flow in one CCP, investors can cut costs.Shifting market shares among clearing houses also sets up the prospect of a price war on fees, which have remained more static even as the emergence of alternative trading venues has slashed costs for trading and clearing. European Multilateral Clearing Facility, Europe’s largest cash equity clearing house, is planning to cut settlement charges in Dutch, French, Swiss, UK and Irish markets from March.BofA Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and Nomura are among banks to have switched their flow to EuroCCP, which is owned by Depository Trust & Clearing Corp of the US.“Firms that move are making a statement on their preferred market structure,” said Diana Chan, chief executive of EuroCCP. “They are showing the choice [of clearing house] they want to have available in the future.”National regulators blessed the first interoperability agreements last year, allowing a host of European trading venues and clearing houses to press ahead. Among the other institutions signing up to the push include BATS Global Markets, Nasdaq OMX, Turquoise and UBS MTF, x-Clear of Switzerland and the UK’s LCH. Clearnet.
246;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-02-12T20:42:54Z;Activists challenge Osaka bourse;;Investors in the Osaka Securities Exchange are challenging management to push for better merger terms from the Tokyo Stock Exchange, in a rare outbreak of shareholder activism in Japan.The move threatens to derail a tie-up that would create the world’s third-biggest exchange group by market capitalisation of listed companies, after NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX.Japan has come under pressure to consolidate its 11 stock, derivatives and commodity exchanges as other large economies have built up big, “multi-asset” bourses with global reach. In addition Japan, long the undisputed largest and most liquid capital market in Asia, faces a long-term threat from China and its maturing exchanges.Under the two sides’ agreed merger, announced last November and due to proceed this summer, the unlisted TSE is valued at about 1.7 times the listed OSE. A number of shareholders in the Osaka-based group, predominantly non-Japanese institutions, are now urging chief executive Michio Yoneda to improve terms in the OSE’s favour, according to people familiar with the situation.If the terms are not revised, investors say they may vote against the re-election of OSE directors at the annual shareholders’ meeting in June – a move that would most likely scuttle the deal.The OSE’s top shareholders include Fidelity, JO Hambro Capital Management, Northern Trust and State Street, according to Bloomberg data.Neither the OSE nor the TSE were available to comment.Forced renegotiations are unusual in Japan. Ten years ago shareholders in Chugai, a drugmaker, succeeded in forcing Rocheof Switzerland to raise its initial agreed offer by almost a third. In 2007 Citigroup improved an agreed offer for brokerage Nikko Cordial by a quarter after investors balked.In the most recent example of investor activism, Japan Tobacco raised its dividend and is poised to buy back shares after a challenge from UK-based activist hedge fund The Children’s Investment Fund over inefficient use of capital.The merger is due to complete in two stages. First, the TSE will make a tender offer for two-thirds of the OSE’s outstanding shares at Y480,000 ($6,182) a share, a 14 per cent premium to the last traded price before the announcement. Then the TSE will effectively inject itself into the listed company by swapping one new share in the OSE for every five shares held in the TSE. OSE, the surviving entity, will be renamed Japan Exchange Group.A 20 per cent increase in the tender offer price would push the TSE’s implied valuation closer to 1.4 times the OSE and the share-swap ratio to 1:6. Investors say that would be a fairer reflection of the combination of Tokyo’s scale with Osaka’s consistent profitability, thanks largely to OSE’s derivatives business, including its flagship Nikkei 225 index futures contract.But people on both sides say the deal is unlikely to unravel, given the political momentum for exchange convergence.www.ft.com/tradingroom
247;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-02-10T11:19:33Z;LCH.Clearnet/LSE talks near endgame;;LCH.Clearnet is expected to make an announcement “shortly” on months of talks with the London Stock Exchange that could see the UK bourse taking a controlling stake, the Anglo-French clearing house’s chief executive said on Friday.The LSE already uses LCH.Clearnet as clearer for UK shares and its fledgling futures business but four months ago entered exclusive talks about taking a 51 per cent stake in it as a way of securing its own clearing infrastructure.Asked about the state of talks, Ian Axe, LCH.Clearnet’s chief executive since April last year, said: “We hope to announce something shortly.” However, he declined to comment on the likelihood of a deal, or what a deal might involve.LCH.Clearnet later said: “There can be no certainty that the discussions will result in any transaction.”If a deal were consummated, it would be the first large-scale transaction to be completed in more than a year of failed exchange consolidation.This month, European regulators blocked a proposed combination of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse. That would have intensified competition for the LSE and LCH.Clearnet.People familiar with the matter have said the LSE has offered up to €20 a share for LCH.Clearnet, valuing it at about €1bn. The LSE beat Markit, a market data company, to exclusive talks status with LCH.Clearnet in September. Market had offered €11 a share.Markit’s approach had at one point included NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX, both LSE rivals.LCH.Clearnet is one of the most prized assets in market infrastructures given a focus by G20 regulators on pushing swaths of over-the-counter derivatives on to clearing houses to help safeguard the financial system against the fallout from another Lehman-style default.On Thursday, European regulators reached a milestone in achieving that G20 commitment by agreeing on a new regulation that would require the clearing of OTC derivatives in Europe.A clearing house stands between two parties to a trade, ensuring a deal goes ahead if one side defaults.Mr Axe’s comments come as speculation swirls around the future of LCH.Clearnet, which operates under a complex governance structure as a non-profit entity in which market participants have 83 per cent ownership, with NYSE Euronext and the London Metal Exchange holding the rest.Since taking over, Mr Axe, a former Barclays Capital banker, has streamlined the clearer in an attempt to turn it from a utility into a more commercially driven business.LCH.Clearnet faces competition in OTC derivatives clearing globally from CME Group, the US-listed operator of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and will soon face Deutsche Börse’s Eurex Clearing in Europe when the Frankfurt-based group launches clearing of OTC interest rate swaps, in March.Mr Axe said: “The old strategy was far more of a utility mindset but it is now one of a commercial mindset where we can reinvest in ourselves.”His comments came as the clearer, formed from the 2003 merger of the London Clearing House and Paris-based Clearnet, reported an 81 per cent jump in operating profit for the full calendar year, to €106.9m, compared with €58.9m the previous year.Underlying net revenues rose by 16 per cent to €387.2m, compared with €335m last time.
248;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-02-09T13:09:31Z;Eurex to introduce new trading system;;Eurex, the derivatives arm of of Deutsche Börse, on Thursday revealed plans to cut derivatives trading speeds by more than half to attract high frequency traders and put its parent’s failure to merge with NYSE Euronext behind it.The German exchange said it would roll-out a new trading system later this year in a move which highlights the continued technology war being fought between the world’s exchange groups.Many bourses are looking to attract the business from investors that use high frequency and automated trading software but are faced with a constant battle to make improvements to the speed and reliability of their trading platforms. Improving the efficiency of trading times is known in the industry as “latency”.However most of the war has been fought over improving trading speeds for simpler cash equities products. Rival exchanges, such as Nasdaq OMX and the London Stock Exchange, are able to execute trades in around 100 microseconds.The new Eurex system will be based on a version operated by the International Securities Exchange, the US equity options exchange owned by Deutsche Börse.Jürg Spillmann, Eurex’s deputy chief executive, said the ISE system was delivering average latency of about 220 microseconds, compared with a current average time for futures transactions on Eurex of about 600 microseconds.The German exchange group had been planning to introduce a new proprietary trading system for several years but it was not until last year that a first version, known as Optimise, was introduced at the ISE.A drive to streamline and integrate trading systems was one of the ways that Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext planned to obtain cost synergies from the planned merger before it was called off last week.The European Union’s competition commission blocked the tie-up, partly on concerns that Eurex would have enjoyed excessive market dominance through its integration with Liffe, the derivatives exchange owned by NYSE Euronext.Deutsche Börse said the new Eurex system would also cut the time it would need to introduce any new products developed. Roll-out of the system is set to begin in December, with exchange products moved in stages from the existing infrastructure. A transition could be completed within the first quarter of 2013.Deutsche Börse said interfaces for the new Eurex platform would be based on industry standards, helping exchange participants implement the system. Mr Spillmann said the plan amounted to a “complete overhaul of our trading architecture”.Eurex is 85 per cent owned by Deutsche Börse, which last year agreed to buy out the 15 per cent share controlled by SIX, the Swiss exchange group, regardless of the fate of the NYSE Euronext merger plan.Completing the acquisition this year as planned would contribute about €100m to Deutsche Börse revenues, Reto Francioni, chief executive, said this month. Deutsche Börse is to announce annual results next week.
249;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-02-08T19:10:39Z;Nasdaq launches spot gold futures;;Nasdaq OMX, the global exchange group, is prospecting for new markets by branching out into US precious metals trading, with the launch of spot gold futures.In a partnership with IKON Global Markets, a commodity trading merchant, Nasdaq yesterday launched futures contracts on gold that are settled with cash rather than the delivery of physical gold.Gold has seen a surge in investor interest amid substantial market volatility, as well as fears that expansionary monetary policy by central banks will lead to future inflation. The price of gold, which hit nominal records last year, has been highly volatile in recent months.At present, gold is primarily traded via forward agreements or spot physical markets in London dominated by large banks. Most small investors trade gold via exchange-traded funds in the US.Nasdaq’s contracts aim to simulate spot trading for individual traders. The contracts, which have one expiration per year, currently December 2012, will reference physical spot gold prices.To have the cash settlement match the cost of holding gold, the holder of the future will be required to pay a daily cost of storing the gold to the dealer, an amount to be calculated by Ikon.The contracts will be centrally cleared via the Options Clearing Corporation, in order to meet Dodd Frank act requirements that standardised derivatives be cleared via a central counterparty.”By combining the components of a futures contract with the integrity of the OTC spot gold market, this is a natural progression of the customer protections and transparencies dictated by that legislation,” said Diwakar Jagannath, IKON chief executive.There are gold futures listed on the NYSE Liffe US and CME Group markets. The listed Liffe US futures have some 1,600 contracts in open interest and the CMEs have about 435,000, which is relatively small by CME’s standards.CME’s contract is the most liquid gold future, but just fraction of the exchange’s 12m average daily futures trades. So far in 2012 CME has has traded 227,000 gold contracts daily, in futures as well as over-the-counter contracts via ClearPort.The main Liffe US and CME futures trade in 100 troy ounce units, while Nasdaq’s contracts can be agreed with as few as 10 ounces. CME also last year launched a “mini” gold future at 10 ounces per contract.Nasdaq, which operates primarily in cash equties and options in the US, and the Nordic countries via OMX, has until now had little exposure to futures or commodities. It acquired an energy trading market in the Nordic countries in 2010.As part of its acquisition of the regional Philadelphia exchange in 2007, Nasdaq also took on a small futures exchange, the Philadelphia Board of Trade. It was renamed Nasdaq OMX Futures Exchange, or NFX, and trades currency futures.
250;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-02-07T22:54:51Z;EIG to quit Goldman platform for Asia listing;;US asset manager EIG Global Energy Partners is to delist its investment vehicle from Goldman Sachs’s US electronic platform and list in Hong Kong, according to people familiar with the matter, a decision that reflects an unattractive US regulatory environment.When EIG, in which China’s sovereign wealth fund has just taken a minority stake, originally listed its Gateway unit on Goldman’s GSTrUE platform before the financial crisis, its plan was to eventually migrate to the NYSE.This would have followed the path from GSTrUE to the NYSE that US private equity investor Apollo Management took last year and its rival Oaktree Capital plans to take soon.GSTrUE was a quasi-public exchange set up in the US for trading stocks of companies that do not want to go public.But since Apollo went public in April 2011, the regulatory burden in the US has become far more onerous and inflexible, with the emergence of the Dodd/Frank Act as part of a wide-ranging reform of Wall Street. That in turn has made an offshore listing far more attractive, according to the people familiar with the situation.EIG, with about $10bn to invest in the energy sector, considered listing in both Australia and Singapore before settling on Hong Kong. “Hong Kong was the most appropriate” and the regulators the most welcoming, added one of the people. “It is part of EIG’s plan to ramp up in this part of the world.”A spokesman for Washington, DC-based EIG declined to comment on the listing, which is expected in coming months.The ramp-up in Asia includes the minority investment from China Investment Corporation, which has has a long history with EIG. CIC has made investing in energy one of its priorities, and has invested in EIG’s funds as well as being a co-investor with it on projects ranging from a Brazilian midstream operation to a tar sands undertaking in Canada.CIC was attracted to investing in the fund manager itself by the core of engineering talent at EIG, at a time when many generalist investors are rushing into energy assets. CIC will not have a board seat, a move intended to head off any potential issues with other investors.Blair Thomas, EIG’s chief executive, told the Financial Times that much of the company’s focus is on unconventional resources, including shale gas.“Gas is a destination, not a bridge to anything else. Over time, its share of the global energy mix will increase.” Mr Thomas noted. “It will eventually undermine all the subsidies for renewables.” Still, he added that with natural gas prices very low, at about $2.50 per million British thermal units, the poor profit margins make the US currently less attractive as a destination for investment.Proceeds from both the listing and the CIC stake sale will be used to help the investment group to expand its operations in Asia.EIG’s move signals the demise of the GSTrUE listing experiment that was meant to offer alternative investment groups the best of both worlds – the liquidity of an exchange without the disclosures that public exchanges require. But these groups soon discovered that there wasn’t much liquidity and they could get far higher valuations by going public.GSTrUE is now part of a Nasdaq platform but when Oaktree, which filed to list last year, lists in New York, it will pass into history.
251;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-02-07T20:59:51Z;Nasdaq OMX ramps up data centre battle;;Nasdaq OMX, the second-largest US exchanges operator, is ramping up competition to attract trading via complex algorithms by expanding the data feed capacity in the connections at its main US data centre.The transatlantic operator is planning to upgrade the bandwidth of telecommunications cables within the site to 40 gigabytes a second, from 10 gigabytes. This will cut 7 microseconds off the time it takes investors to trade, currently roughly 100 microseconds.The operator will also offer customers that put their servers at the Nasdaq site in Cartaret, New Jersey, a facility leased from Verizon, a service that could increase the amount of computing power in a rack of servers by 70 per cent.The time-saving of seven millionths of a second underlines how the growth of automated trading has transformed trading in recent years. It has propelled a spurt of investment into trading infrastructure around the world, with rival exchanges ploughing hundreds of millions of dollars into technology to attract customers.The main focus has been on building systems capable of handling thousands of trading messages per second and making physical electronic trading pathways – cables, software and hardware – more efficient.Cutting the time to trade, what the industry calls “latency”, has also become a critical issue to the point where seven microseconds can mean the difference between thousands of dollars for some traders.As the difference can sometimes be a matter of proximity to an exchange server, many bourses earn revenues from investors placing their own systems in the exchange’s data centre. The London Stock Exchange and NYSE Euronext are among those offering such a service. Upgrading the bandwidth of fibre optic cable at the data centres can speed up times to execute trades.“The [new] service offers the fastest access with the highest bandwidth available at any exchange,” said Stacie Swanstrom, vice-president of transaction services at Nasdaq OMX.The upgrade to a 40GB service requires approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission, but Nasdaq OMX expects to roll it out from April.At the same time, Nasdaq will offer a service that allows customers to use more power for their servers in the data centre. The servers emit heat, which requires power for cooling. Nasdaq OMX’s new service, known as Super Cab, will supply up to 17 kilowatts of power to customers. The bourse is making the power consumption more efficient by funnelling the excess heat through a chimney. The rest of the industry typically offers 8 kilowatts, Nasdaq said.Additional reporting by Telis Demos in New York
252;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-02-03T23:56:29Z;Carlyle removes class-action clause;;Carlyle, the Washington DC-based private equity group that is set to go public, has bowed to pressure from investors and regulators to remove a legal clause from its listing documents that attempted to limit the ability of shareholders to sue the company.The industry is under intense political scrutiny of its business practices, tax arrangements and the way senior executives have built their fortunes. Rivals to Mitt Romney for the Republican nomination have attacked his record while chief executive of Bain Capital.Carlyle, renowned for its political connections, manages $148bn of investor money and plans to list on Nasdaq.Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of the initial public offering had included a clause preventing shareholders from bringing class-action lawsuits against the company in the event of wrongdoing. Instead, they would have to use a confidential arbitration process as individuals.However, the legal strategy provoked opposition from investors and corporate governance activists. On Friday, Senators Al Franken, Richard Blumenthal and Robert Menedez sent a letter to the SEC urging it to oppose the arbitration conditions.“Requiring shareholders to forgo litigation and instead settle disputes in individual, confidential arbitration …would deprive investors of important congressionally established rights,” the letter said.“Private arbitration usually prohibits or significantly limits pre-trial discovery – making complex securities claims almost impossible to prove.”The letter also said that the prohibition against bringing claims as a class made the hurdles to vindicating shareholder rights “insurmountable”.Carlyle said: “After consultations with the SEC, Carlyle investors and other interested parties, we have decided to withdraw the proposed arbitration provision. We first offered the provision because we believed that arbitrating claims would be more efficient, cost effective and beneficial to our unitholders.”The California Public Employees’ Retirement System, an activist for shareholder rights, owns 5 per cent of Carlyle.However, Carlyle’s structure as a trust in which investors will own partnership units, rather than shares in a limited company, means shareholder rights are significantly curtailed.As with other private equity groups that have gone public, such as KKR and Blackstone, shareholders do not have the right to elect board members, or vote on matters such as executive compensation.The three founders of Carlyle, which does not intend to have a compensation committee, shared a pay-out of $413m last year as the company returned about $18bn to investors in its funds.Carlyle is expected to list as soon as market conditions improve. Shares in peer Blackstone have risen by a fifth so far this year.
253;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-02-01T21:35:13Z;US stocks rebound on solid manufacturing data;S&P 500 back in bull market territory;Shares in the New York Stock Exchange fell while every other large US exchange group made gains, after the European Commission blocked NYSE’s merger with Germany’s Deutsche Börse.NYSE shares fell 0.5 per cent to $26.43, even though analysts were generally supportive of the standalone business.“We believe the stock could get a lift in the near term as investors that have been on the sidelines because of deal uncertainty come back into the name,” said Alex Kramm, exchanges analyst at UBS.Rob Rutschow at CLSA said “a failed deal may be for the best. We see upside from less exposure to Europe and a potential transaction tax”.Mr Rutschow added that other incumbents could benefit from the collapse of the deal.“If the merger had gone through, there would have been concern that Nasdaq in particular was becoming an also ran in the exchange space globally, but now competitors are under less pressure to do their own deals.”CME Group climbed 2.5 per cent to $245.41, Nasdaq OMX gained a cent to close at $24.77, although shares were hit by fall in fourth quarter net income, and IntercontinentalExchange was up 0.2 per cent to $114.69.Elsewhere, Wall Street was back in tune with global markets, as US stocks climbed higher after a rash of positive global manufacturing survey data.The S&P 500 closed up 0.9 per cent to 1,324.08, back once again into bull market territory, although the index tended to face resistance from sellers taking profit whenever it moved above 1,325 in January.Banks led the rally with Morgan Stanley up 4 per cent to $19.39, as reports gathered momentum that the investment bank has won the race to be the lead underwriter of Facebook’s IPO.Goldman Sachs lagged behind, up just 1.8 per cent to $113.45, on suggestions it may also have been beaten by JPMorgan to the role of second underwriter in the Facebook deal.Large commercial banks also climbed, with Citigroup up 2.9 per cent to $31.60 and Bank of America climbing 3.2 per cent to $7.36 on reports states’ attorneys-general may be looking at a comprehensive deal on mortgage-related litigation that has been hanging over bank stocks since the financial crisis.Amazon shares fell 7.7 per cent to $179.46 after the company’s fourth-quarter results disappointed on Tuesday evening. Wall Street had been primed for a fall in margins, as the online retailer has pursued growth through heavy spending on its Fire tablet and promotions, but analysts were taken aback by a fall in revenue and sales growth.Brian Nowak at Nomura was equally concerned about the company’s cautious outlook.“This is the seventh straight quarter in which Amazon’s forward . . . guidance has come in below the Street, and the second consecutive quarter where the midpoint of revenue missed guidance. We are lowering our forward estimates,” he told clients.Broadcom climbed 8.1 per cent to $37.13, with management upbeat on the company’s current quarter prospects, without quite calling a bottom to the semiconductor market. That was vindication for analysts who had called for investors to buy the stock in the wake of Apple’s blockbuster results.JPMorgan analysts once again picked out Broadcom’s supplier relationship to Apple smartphones and tablets as they predicted the company will “outgrow the overall semiconductor market [in 2012]”.Whirlpool shares soared 13.5 per cent to $61.64, approaching levels last seen in July, before last summer’s market sell-off. Quarterly profit at the dishwasher manufacturer surged by a fifth on cost savings.Marathon Petroleum shares climbed 9.6 per cent to $41.88, as the company announced a $2bn share buy-back programme. Shares in refiners have slumped in recent weeks after a succession of oil companies announced collapsing margins on refining operations, as the discount of WTI to Brent crude fell in the fourth quarter, increasing input costs for refiners.Shares in hard disc drive manufacturer Western Digital climbed 4.6 per cent to $38.03, as profits at its rival Seagate Technology surged. Seagate shares climbed 20.8 per cent to $25.53.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.7 per cent to 12,716.46, and the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 1.2 per cent to 2,848.27.Gas exploration and production companies sold off again, as natural gas prices reversed their recent rally. Chesapeake Energy fell 0.8 per cent to $20.97, Southwestern Energy was off 2.3 per cent to $30.41 and EQT Corp was off 1.1 per cent to $49.98.Chesapeake, among other companies, has announced cuts in production this year in a bid to put a floor under gas prices.
254;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-02-01T20:15:48Z;IDCG in talks with banks over stake sale;;The International Derivatives Clearing Group is in discussions to sell a stake to a group of banks, as the US regulatory process pushing more derivatives trading to central counterparties moves into the late stages.Nasdaq OMX confirmed on Wednesday that it was reviewing its stake in IDCG, with a resolution expected by the end of February and possibly early March. The business is majority-owned by Nasdaq but operates independently of the bourse.Nasdaq has held talks with a consortium of banks to discuss a deal that would enable the bourse to withdraw some of the $75m of capital it is using to back the clearing house.“We’re engaged in active dialogue for a proper home over the long term,” said Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, in an interview with the Financial Times.IDCG is one of several clearing houses that has emerged since the financial crisis to clear over-the-counter trades in interest-rate swaps and other derivatives between big-bank dealers and their customers.The space has been evolving slowly as the final rules on clearing are completed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and other regulators. IDCG, like rivals launched by CME Group and LCH.Clearnet, has seen only test trading thus far.But one thing that is becoming clear is that smaller broker-dealers and pension funds and asset management groups, known as the buyside, are for the most part not becoming direct members of clearing houses, as had initially been envisioned.Instead, buyside firms are clearing via brokerages known as futures clearing merchants, or FCMs, which are mostly attached to large banks such as Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan.By bringing in banks as partners, IDCG may be opting to follow a similar model. The group declined to comment on its plans. The minority investments in IDCG are from Bank of New York Mellon and other firms.Last year, IDCG was sued by Jefferies, the US investment bank and owner of a mid-tier FCM. Jefferies accused it of mispricing swaps transactions it was converting into futures positions. The two groups agreed to resolve the suit via arbitration earlier this month.
255;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-02-01T17:05:29Z;Nasdaq upbeat over bourse tie-ups;;Robert Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, sees continued opportunity for global exchange consolidation under the right circumstances, in spite of the collapse of the Deutsche Börse-NYSE merger.“We do not believe this ruling will preclude other large exchange deals from happening,” he told analysts on Wednesday.Nasdaq, like NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse, has been an aggressive but thwarted operator in global exchange consolidation, as the operators of marketplaces have sought to fend off competition and falling volumes by joining forces.It has seen two significant deals blocked, including a counterbid alongside IntercontinentalExchange to buy NYSE Euronext, which was turned down by US anti-trust authorities, and an attempt to take over the London Stock Exchange in 2007, rejected by shareholders.However, Mr Greifeld said that the lesson was that only certain types of deals were doomed to fail, notably those that would create near-monopolies in a single market, such as futures for DB-NYSE, or US listings for Nasdaq-NYSE.“Our rejection and DB-NYSE’s rejection sends a clear message that a transaction that results in 90 per cent market share is suspect. But there is compelling industrial logic in combining …non-overlapping exchanges,” he added.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Greifeld declined to say that Nasdaq was considering a fresh approach for the LSE, but noted that it would not be precluded.“You have in the UK, like you have in the US, a proper environment where they will consider or approve exchange mergers. The London market place is a fair and open market,” he said.He added: “It’s important to realise that [the DB-NYSE deal] was approved on the US side. It’s a clear example that the entire world can buy the NYSE, even if we cannot.”At present, Mr Greifeld said, Nasdaq was focused on what he termed “bolt-in” acquisitions that aim to profit from market regulation and falling technology spending by large banks.Nasdaq’s core quarterly earnings topped forecasts despite volume declines in US and European equities and only small gains in derivatives trading.Earnings were $113m for the quarter, defying analysts’ forecasts of zero growth over last year’s earnings of $110m in the same period. Nasdaq shares rose 1.3 per cent to $25.08.
256;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-01-30T23:09:30Z;Nasdaq OMX makes clearing house pledge;;Nasdaq OMX has moved to reassure investors trading on its exchange in Europe that their funds cannot be touched by administrators in the event of a broker default.The transatlantic exchanges operator put the pledge at the heart of an overhaul of its clearing default fund. The group is switching to a member-financed default fund for its Nordic business on March 1 in preparation for sweeping incoming European legislation that will elevate the role of clearing houses in safeguarding the world’s financial system.The issue of segregation of investors’ collateral, or insurance against their trades failing, has become a key topic following last October’s collapse of MF Global, the US futures broker. Senior US management, led by former US senator Jon Corzine, have said they do not know what happened to $1.2bn of client funds while investor anger is mounting that three months on, the administrator of the UK division of the group has yet to return any customer funds.Nasdaq OMX’s move comes as European authorities prepare this week to put the final touches to regulation intended to strengthen financial markets. Countries of the G20 have pledged to move more of the $6trn over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market on to recognised venues and through clearing houses. European governments and policymakers are expected to meet this week to give their blessing to the region’s response – legislation called the European Market Infrastructure Regulation.Many MF Global customers have found themselves unable to access their collateral posted for trading on exchanges. A significant number have subsequently discovered their funds were also held in unsegregated accounts and may not have all their assets returned as they are classified as unsecured creditors.Hans-Ole Jochumsen, president of Nasdaq OMX Nordic, told the Financial Times that investors effectively entered into a direct legal relationship with the clearing house and could post collateral knowing it was completely protected from a clearing members’ default. “There is no chance of being mixed up with unsecured creditors,” Mr Jochumsen said. About 400 customers were using it, he added.Nasdaq OMX Nordic has been upgrading both its strategy and the IT risk management system that powers daily operations to attract the bulk of OTC trading in the Nordic region and fend off competition from LCH.Clearnet, the London-based clearing house, and Eurex, the clearing house of Deutsche Börse. Nasdasq OMX Nordic was also one of the few in the world to have a default fund wholly financed by the exchange group.It has already applied for recognised overseas clearing house status from UK authorities, which would allow it to boost its physical presence and marketing efforts in the UK. Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, told Bloomberg in Davos last week that the exchange was planning to grow organically, with a couple of small acquisitions. He was not interested in buying the London Stock Exchange, he added.
257;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture).

258;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-01-26T20:12:43Z;NYSE chief sees little chance of Deutsche Börse deal;;Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext, has admitted he “misjudged” European antitrust authorities’ approach to his exchange’s attempted tie-up with Deutsche Börse, saying there was only a “glimmer of hope” the deal would succeed.His comments are the first sign the German and US groups have all but given up hope that European politicians will approve the deal after Brussels competition officials blocked it this month.That decision – backed by Joaquín Almunia, EU competition commissioner – was based on a view that the combination would create a dominant player in derivatives markets in Europe, stifling competition.Of the 27 EU commissioners who must make a final call on the proposed deal by February 1, only about six are understood to sympathise with the exchange groups’ arguments: that trading both on and off exchange is a global market, so a European concentration in some on-exchange areas is the wrong basis for a decision.“I misjudged the process,” Mr Niederauer said, referring to the antitrust authorities’ analysis of the markets in which the two exchanges’ derivatives platforms operate.Asked in a Financial Times video interview if he had given up on the deal, he said: “You don’t give up until the end. It certainly looks like a low probability of success. But it’s not hopeless.”Deutsche Börse shares rose 3 per cent to €45.33 in Frankfurt on Thursday, while in New York NYSE Euronext shares were 0.5 per cent lower at $27.31 in afternoon trading.Mr Niederauer’s comments come amid an intense lobbying campaign by NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse to convince EU commissioners and other decision-makers that the antitrust authorities’ definition of the market was flawed. The NYSE chief has shuttled to and from European capitals in the past week to make his case.NYSE and Deutsche Börse say the two derivatives exchanges they operate, Liffe and Eurex, already compete with CME Group, the largest US derivatives exchange operator, and would continue to do so once merged.However, Brussels has privately made it clear to the groups that a combination of Eurex and Liffe – which would control 85 per cent of trading in benchmark euro-denominated interest rate and German government bond futures – would reduce market choice in Europe.Mr Almunia has appeared unmoved by the argument – accepted by many in the derivatives industry, including CME – that the market definition should be global, not European.One senior person close to one of the two exchanges said on Wednesday night: “Duncan has good relations with a lot of top European officials, including [International Monetary Fund managing director, Christine] Lagarde, and I think he thought he’d be able to persuade Almunia. But that was not going to work with Almunia.”The exchanges’ bruising encounter with Brussels is a sign regulators are taking an unexpectedly tough stance on exchange mergers. Many have collapsed in the past 12 months on antitrust or nationalism hurdles, including an attempt by the Singapore Exchange to combine with ASX of Australia.Mr Niederauer said regulators and politicians had clearly turned against the concept of large-scale dealmaking in the sector after the financial crisis. “There is a lot of nationalism, a lot of protectionism. Globalisation is being put on hold,” he said. “There will be no more mega M&A in this space.”Bob Greifeld, his counterpart at rival exchange operator Nasdaq OMX, expressed the opposite view in remarks to reporters in Davos, saying deals were still possible.Mr Niederauer said NYSE Euronext would continue to pursue smaller-scale acquisitions, particularly in the areas of technology and post-trade services.
259;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-01-15T15:17:50Z;D Börse and NYSE investors face failure;;Like fans watching a football team struggle to salvage a point in the dying minutes of a losing match, investors in NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse appear increasingly resigned to the failure of the two exchange’s year-long attempt to combine.The US and German exchange operators are lobbying EU politicians to override a recommendation by EU antitrust staff that their plan to create the world’s largest bourse would stifle competition in European derivatives markets, and should not proceed.Attention is already shifting to whether a wave of exchange consolidation that had all but fizzled out on antitrust and political hurdles could spring back to life.The focus is on London, a hot spot given that it is home to two market infrastructures that are both available and have global heft: LCH.Clearnet, the Anglo-French clearing house and the London Metal Exchange.That may seem surprising, given that the exchange landscape is littered with failed deals. The London Stock Exchange’s attempted tie-up with TMX Group, operator of the Toronto and Montreal bourses, and a deal between the Singapore and Australian exchanges evaporated last year.But deals are still possible says Roger Barton, managing director of Financial Reform Consultancy. “Far from dampening down consolidation, a failure of DB/NYSE could re-invigorate it. The drivers – economies of scale and globalisation – are still there, even though people are acutely aware of the competition issues.”Rich Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, argues that failure for the DB/NYSE plan “should not affect mergers that are smaller in scale or geographic focus, such as nationally focused or bolt-on transactions”.He cites potential deals involving LCH.Clearnet and the LME – which has acknowledged approaches from bidders – as well as the ongoing merger between the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Osaka Securities Exchange.The LSE has been in exclusive talks since September with LCH.Clearnet about taking a controlling stake in the clearer which processes UK share and derivatives deals done on the UK bourse.The Singapore Exchange is seen as a likely player in London and is believed to be considering using its formidable balance sheet to join forces with the LSE in its LCH.Clearnet venture or target the LME – or a combination of both.Yet LCH.Clearnet could still make an attractive target for NYSE Euronext.Aside from NYSE Liffe Clear, a small London clearing operation, NYSE has few clearing assets to speak of and needs them as the trend towards exchange ownership of post-trade assets continues.This month NYSE rival Nasdaq OMX took control of the central securities depository in Lithuania, adding to its existing ownership of such post-trade businesses in Latvia and Estonia.By getting its hands on LCH.Clearnet, NYSE would gain control over a clearing house for its Euronext network of stock markets in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Portugal. It would also own the clearer for its Liffe derivatives exchange, whose flagship euribor interest rate futures is one of the most widely traded derivatives products.As a next step, NYSE could offer customers the ability to clear euribor together with over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate swaps, which are already cleared at LCH.Clearnet through its SwapClear clearing service, operated together with key banks in the swaps markets.Moreover NYSE is no stranger to LCH.Clearnet’s business. It was briefly a junior partner with Markit, a UK-based financial information company, in a bid to secure the exclusivity that the LSE eventually won with LCH.Clearnet.It also has roughly half of a 17 per cent stake in the clearer, the rest of which is held by the LME. Market participants hold the remaining 83 per cent.Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James, estimates that NYSE has about $300m cash and could add up to $500m in debt and still have a debt to ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) ratio of less than two times.LCH.Clearnet is hard to value given its not-for-profit structure but the LSE‘s offer may value it at up to €1bn.As for other scenarios, some observers see Deutsche Börse making another attempt to take over the LSE, while Nasdaq chief executive Bob Greifeld’s long-held interest in the LSE remains a possibility – as does reviving interest in LCH.Clearnet, after he abandoned pursuit of a minority stake at the time of the Markit/NYSE and LSE approaches.Deals may also emerge in the US. Mr O’Shaughnessy suggests NYSE may go for the Chicago Board Options Exchange, or MarketAxess, a US-listed government and corporate bond electronic trading platform.Indeed, such is the attraction of Liffe in London that NYSE itself may prove a target. IntercontinentalExchange, US operator of futures and OTC platforms and clearing houses, has long eyed Liffe as a way of securing a European futures trading business.Mr Repetto says: “We view a NYSE combination with ICE as a possibility given ICE management’s clear attraction to the financial futures business, ICE’s clearing capability and expertise and complementary product set of the two.”
260;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-01-13T17:51:32Z;Quick View: Let the games begin, again;Two weeks from a decision by European antitrust officials;What happens next in the industry if the planned Deutsche Börse/NYSE Euronext merger fails?Two weeks from a decision by European antitrust officials, it’s not too early to speculate.First, the rationale for the London Stock Exchange-LCH.Clearnet tie-up is weakened.One of the reasons for the UK bourse’s interest was that, if DB/NYSE were to happen, there would be all the more reason for the LSE to build up its own post-trade infrastructure too. DB/NYSE is also a eurozone play, and neutral if not negative for London.That is not to say the LSE wants to create a “vertical silo” in the way that Deutsche Börse is. The LSE says it would certainly control LCH.Clearnet from an ownership perspective, but it would be open to competitors in a way that the German silo is not.But the LSE probably hopes DB/NYSE goes ahead.That would also allow the LSE to snap up the continental European equity options businesses that DB/NYSE have offered to offload as a remedy. Either the LSE gets this business, or BATS Chi-X Europe does.The other risk of the deal failing, for the LSE, is you could then see NYSE Euronext making a bid for LCH. Clearnet. Aside from NYSE Liffe Clear, NYSE has no clearing assets to speak of and needs them.NYSE has also declared its ambition to build a Paris-based cash equities clearer, as part of plans this year to cease using LCH.Clearnet as clearer for that. It has already partly withdrawn its futures business from LCH.Clearnet, doing its own clearing at London-based NYSE Liffe Clear.Worth remembering that NYSE Euronext was a junior partner in Markit’s failed bid – against the LSE – for exclusive talks with LCH. Clearnet. And NYSE used to be a 15 per cent shareholder in LCH.Clearnet, so is no stranger to the business.And here’s another interesting wrinkle: LCH.Clearnet – the holding company – may be incorporated in the UK but has a French watchdog, the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel, as its primary regulator, not the UK’s Financial Services Authority. LCH.Clearnet has never really managed to make the 2003 merger of Paris-based Clearnet and London’s LCH work properly. And as an astute observer has pointed out to me, the French regulator may prefer to deal with an exchange owner that has a stronger interest in the French market.Nasdaq OMX was also in the running, late last year, for LCH. Clearnet. Bob Greifeld saw a bid as a way of preserving the “horizontal” clearing model in Europe amid the prospect of a DB/NYSE tie-up, which would significantly strengthen the silo. Might Nasdaq come back in, or even have another go at the LSE? Possible.Then there is SGX, the Singapore exchange. It has a strong balance sheet and probably cannot pass up the chance to secure a London-based asset – by teaming up with the LSE on its LCH.Clearnet venture and/or in a bid for the London Metal Exchange.Deals may suddenly spring back to life in the US. Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James in the US, suggests that NYSE may go for the Chicago Board Options Exchange, or even MarketAxess, the US-listed government and corporate bond electronic trading platform.Equally, NYSE may itself become attractive, as Sandler O’Neill analyst Rich Repetto points out. It’s conceivable that IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) may make a move on NYSE as a way of getting its hands on Liffe. It may seem odd for ICE to do a deal that involves it getting into cash equities – not a business that ICE chief executive Jeff Sprecher has been interested in, given its relatively low margins and lack of compatibility with his energy and OTC business.But it was striking how much he said he had learnt about the cash equities business from Mr Greifeld, when the two men paired up in their ultimately doomed effort to bust up the DB/NYSE deal.And it’s also worth remembering that John Thain, chief executive of New York Stock Exchange group, didn’t balk at the prospect of acquiring the Euronext cash equities business as one of the costs of getting hold of the ultimate prize: Liffe.Finally, over in Canada, if Maple is blocked from taking over TMX Group, might the LSE and TMX revive their deal?Let the games begin.
261;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-01-13T15:49:53Z;DB-NYSE tie-up hits another hurdle;;Plans by Germany’s Deutsche Börse and US-based NYSE Euronext to create the world’s largest stock and derivatives exchange hit a significant hurdle after Europe’s antitrust regulators decided to recommend that the deal be blocked.While no official announcement was made, people familiar with the matter said that regulators argued that a combination of the Börse’s Eurex derivatives exchange with NYSE’s London-based Liffe derivatives arm would create a business that would stifle competition in exchanged traded derivatives in Europe.The two groups are lobbying to persuade European Union commissioners – who will make the final decision on the deal – that the merged entity would still face stiff competition from the US, where CME Group dominates derivatives trading, and that Europe needs a similar “champion” as the exchanges compete globally.The commissioners are expected to decide by February 1, although legally a decision is not required until February 9.The possible failure of the tie-up has prompted speculation that talks between the London Stock Exchange and LCH.Clearnet about the UK bourse taking a majority stake in the Anglo-French clearing house might be disrupted by a possible bid for LCH.Clearnet by NYSE Euronext or Nasdaq OMX.Raymond James, a US broker, believes NYSE Euronext might attempt a takeover of the Chicago Board Options Exchange or MarketAccess, a US-listed electronic government and corporate bond trading platform.Other options include a possible bid for NYSE Euronext by IntercontinentalExchange, the US-based operator of futures exchanges, energy trading platforms and clearing houses, with the ultimate prize being to snag Liffe.
262;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-01-13T00:00:25Z;Nasdaq looks at changing its structure;;Nasdaq OMX’s board of directors is discussing the possibility of changing Nasdaq’s leadership structure, which could include Robert Greifeld being named chairman in addition to chief executive, people briefed on the discussions said.The discussion comes as NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse’s deal appears at risk of being called off due to strong opposition from antitrust regulators in Europe.It is likely to stoke anticipation that Mr Greifeld may be trying to clear a way for a potential merger to capitalise on his rivals’ failure by seeking the ability to offer up the chief executive role to a merger partner as an inducement to complete a deal.However, people familiar with Nasdaq’s thinking said that no such deal talks were being held.A Nasdaq OMX spokesperson declined to comment.Mr Greifeld, 54, has been chief executive since 2003, overseeing an aggressive evolution of Nasdaq from a US cash equity marketplace to a global group, merging with Sweden’s OMX stock and derivatives exchange and the Philadelphia Exchange, one of the US’s largest options markets.He is said to have strong support from the board to continue as chief executive and has no plans to retire. Last year saw record earnings for Nasdaq OMX as it slashed costs and expanded market share in options, though its share price has languished along with other capital markets groups’.Nasdaq has recently launched a series of acquisitions of market services and technology groups with the aim of diversifying Nasdaq’s revenues away from trading.But moves to dramatically transform Nasdaq’s footprint have struggled. Last year, the US Department of Justice blocked its bid, jointly with the IntercontinentalExchange, to buy NYSE Euronext and break up the planned tie-up with Deutsche Börse.Nasdaq has also twice attempted to merge with LSE, the first time calling off a friendly merger, then later having an unsolicited bid rejected by shareholders of the LSE, then under the leadership of Dame Clara Furse.Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, said the board move may be a way to ease potential discussions with other exchanges.“Mr Greifeld’s potential elevation to the role of chairman could facilitate a merger with another exchange peer as it would remove a cultural conflict over who would run the combined company as CEO,” said Mr Repetto.The board discussions were first reported by Fox Business News.Deregulation is increasing competition among exchanges, leading many to seek mergers and acquisitions as a way of increasing scaleA move by Mr Greifeld into the chairman’s role, even if temporary, might raise corporate governance concerns. Many shareholders and experts argue that the chairman and chief executive roles should be separate.“It goes without saying that a stock exchange ought to exemplify good governance,” said John Wilcox at Sodali, a corporate governance consultancy.Mr Wilcox noted that some companies combine the role for strategic reasons but emphasised that “a board chairman and a CEO have different roles to play”.During Nasdaq’s takeover bid for NYSE, Nasdaq argued that good corporate governance practices were not observed when NYSE’s board did not offer up Nasdaq-ICE’s counter-proposal to a shareholder vote.
263;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-01-12T19:39:49Z;Tech Beat: Monitoring the market;;The mini-flash crash in the energy securities market last week reminded the world that for all the investigations, the sophisticated technology used in trading leaves markets open to more unexplained plunges.Extensive academic work in the last 20 years has shown real dangers that complex networked systems can react in unforeseeable ways, and disturbingly, show few problems while even up to 99.9 per cent capacity, only to fail dramatically with sometimes disastrous consequences if they hit 100 per cent for any length of time.The biggest fear is what is known as a self-reinforcing feedback loop. In it, a small change in computer trading feeds back to itself, triggering a bigger change, which in turn feeds back to itself. On and on the process goes, amplifying volatility, especially in a market with multiple trading venues.But what, if anything, can be done about it?Even before the biggest flash crash of them all, on May 6 2010, there were calls for a “supercomputer” that could model financial markets and act as an early warning system. Regulators such as Andy Haldane, executive director, financial stability of the Bank of England, have long suggested that understanding of systemic risk in financial systems could benefit from mathematical and simulation modelling approaches developed in other fields. Mary Schapiro, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, is also lobbying for a supercomputer database.The idea was given fresh impetus last year in a working paper published by the UK government’s Foresight Committee, a panel of experts looking into the future of computer-based trading. Two academics, Dave Cliff of the University of Bristol and Linda Northrop of Carnegie-Mellon University called for “an urgent need to develop major national strategic modelling and predictive simulation capabilities”, comparable to national scale weather monitoring. The aim of such a computer isn’t to predict price movements of particular instruments but to flag up potential systemic risk before it’s too late, they say.Yet the idea has met with a sceptical response. Concerns have been raised about the cost of the project, banks’ fear over greater regulation and the need for agreement from all areas of the market to share data. A greater doubt is whether the model could actually recreate the market.In another paper submitted to the Foresight working group, Seth Bullock of the Institute for Complex Systems Simulation at the University of Southampton pointed out that: “Model richness is not an unalloyed good. The more detailed and realistic a simulation model is, the greater the challenge of understanding its behaviour.”Yet leaving the issue there feels unsatisfactory, assuming high frequency trading as an activity is here to stay.One of the key issues today’s infrastructure must cope with is the sheer volume of messages that are sent around the system. According to the Options Price Reporting Authority, messages from US options exchanges alone have soared from 2,970 per second in 2000 to a peak, set last August, of 5.5m messages a second. Yet that averages out to about 7,000 quotes to every trade.The extra “noise” is generated by automated programmes that can bombard trading venues with messages and cancel them at lightening speeds. What has changed from the days of human trades is that computer trading is far more impersonal. Unlike humans, algorithms, it has been said, know the price of everything and the value of nothing. Perhaps what regulators and the market need is a better understanding of the intention to trade.Nanex, a US trading data company, has suggested that quotes be marked with a special “immediate” tag that could be cancelled in less than, for example, 250 milliseconds. Non-labelled quotes simply require that they remain executable for a certain amount of time, it said.“A quote from someone wishing to buy stock would automatically carry more value than a quote marked immediate, because it could be executed by more people,” argues Eric Scott Hunsader, chief executive. Labelling would also allow for better monitoring of feed delays, a key issue in the 2010 flash crash. But self-tagging would rely on the honesty of market participants.There have been indications that exchanges – which actively compete for HFT business – are developing smaller scale alternatives that are more robust to failure and crises. Circuit breakers have already been introduced.A tie-up between Nasdaq OMX’s FTEN and Australia’s Object Trading late last year offered broker-dealers better ability to monitor risk across asset classes in real-time, both before and after trades have been executed.The aim was to give automated traders more protection for trades. Perhaps a response can only be formulated by individual institutions rather one ill-fitting “template that fits all.” After all, one cannot do anything about the weather except be prepared for it.
264;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-01-12T17:27:53Z;BATS exchange wins first listings;ETFs to begin trading on market later this month;BATS, the US stock exchange, has won its first listings since launching a market to compete with Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, announcing that BlackRock will list a series of exchange traded funds on BATS later this year.The first fund, the iShares MSCI Norway Capped Investable Market Index Fund, will list and begin trading later this month. Seven other funds, primarily country-specific, small-cap stock ETFs, are set to begin trading on BATS shortly thereafter.US listings of companies and funds is dominated by NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX. Corporations are primarily listed on the NYSE and Nasdaq, but subsidiary markets operated by the two groups, such as NYSE Arca, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq BX, list hundreds of new exchange traded funds each year as well.“The innovation and leadership that iShares brings to capital markets makes them the perfect partner for our first primary listings,” said Joe Ratterman, BATS chief executive, in a statement.BATS itself – which operates US stock and options markets, and recently acquired the Chi-X electronic exchange in London – is set to become the new market’s first corporate listing when it launches its own IPO in March.The new market hopes to win listings through flat and lower fees than Nasdaq and NYSE, which both have tiered pricing, and also with a new market-making programme.The initial listing fee is $100,000 for BATS, less than half of what NYSE and Nasdaq charge. Annual fees are a flat $35,000, versus up to $99,500 on Nasdaq and up to $500,000 for the largest companies on NYSE.BATS’s Competitive Liquidity Providers programme, an analogue to designated marketmakers on NYSE, will give discounts to marketmakers who quote prices at the national best bid or offer a certain percentage of the time.BATS has yet to announce who will be participating CLPs, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission has not yet approved the programme.Like market-making programmes on the NYSE and Nasdaq, it is designed to attract high-volume traders such as Getco, Knight Capital and Virtu to make markets in listed shares, who in return receive certain discounts and close relationships with the companies whose shares they trade.“We appreciate the partnership and the innovative approach they are bringing to the market,” said Noel Archard, global head of product development iShares at BlackRock.BlackRock is currently seeking SEC approval for a series of actively-managed ETFs, but has not yet named a listings venue for the products.In general, BATS will face stiff competition as it seeks to win further listings. Listings generate steady fee-based revenue for the exchanges, and Nasdaq and NYSE vie fiercely for each new IPO and work to win transfers of existing companies as well, through inducements such as marketing arrangements, shareholder services or rebates.NYSE Euronext said on Thursday that NYSE Arca listed a record number of ETFs in 2011, nearly 300, versus the previous high-water mark of 220.“NYSE Euronext is proud to see impressive growth and market innovation in Exchange Traded Products on our platform,” said Lisa Dallmer, chief operating officer of European cash markets. “We look forward to continuing to offer investors and market professionals the most compelling value proposition on a global scale in 2012 and beyond.””
265;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-01-09T00:45:11Z;Mexico’s BMV to be among fastest bourses by May;;Bolsa Mexicana de Valores (BMV), the Mexican exchange operator, is completing work on a new trading platform that will process orders 200 times quicker than the current system, making it one of the fastest in the world.In an interview with the FT, Luis Téllez, BMV president, said that the project was in “the final stages” of implementation and would be up and running as early as May. “It is going to place us firmly in the vanguard,” he said.The $18m overhaul comes in response to a dramatic increase in the number of orders that the BMV and other bourses around the world receive each day as so-called algorithmic trading, in which computers send orders automatically, replaces orders sent by humans.The growth of algorithmic trading last year pushed daily transactional demand on the BMV to a record 3.7m per day on average – more than double the daily average in 2010, and 50 times more than that of 2005.Mr Téllez said that the new system’s initial configuration will be able to handle 200,000 transactions per second, and take less than 100 microseconds to process a single order. That catapults the BMV into the same league, in terms of latency, as large exchanges such as Nasdaq OMX, NYSE Euronext, Deutsche Börse and the London Stock Exchange.“We needed to find a way to accommodate and keep up with new trading strategies,” said Mr Téllez. “Algorithmic trading is here to stay.”But Mr Tellez said that the new system, which was developed in-house with the help of Carnegie Mellon University and US-based Tibell & Associates, will also integrate the BMV’s cash and derivatives markets on to the same trading platform, and allow the bourse to develop new services with a view to attracting more foreign participants.Indeed, completion of the new system coincides with an aggressive drive by the BMV to attract overseas business. In December, it signed a letter of intent to join the Chilean, Peruvian and Colombian bourses in Latin America’s first stock market tie-up, known as “Mila”.The possibility of joining Mila could boost the BMV’s international traffic via additional trading and initial public offerings, BMV says.At the time of the announcement, the BMV said that the proposed partnership would “integrate BMV Group to Mila with the goal of increasing listings and bringing further technological and operational benefits to participants in the region”.
266;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2012-01-06T22:56:18Z;Transfers outweigh IPOs at Nasdaq OMX;Exchange saw a net gain in market cap of $50bn;Nasdaq OMX, the US-based exchange operator, added more market capitalisation by poaching listings from its rival, NYSE Euronext, than by taking companies public last year.Nasdaq saw a net gain in market capitalisation of $50bn as 34 companies switched their listings between the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange markets in 2011. That dwarfed the $10.5bn raised by the 78 companies that listed on the Nasdaq last year after initial public offerings.Its is the third time in four years that Nasdaq has attracted more market capitalisation through listings transfers than through IPOs, although Bob McCooey, head of listings at Nasdaq, denied NYSE defections were becoming more important than attracting new listings.“We’re pleased that companies are recognising the benefits we offer but we are not looking at listings transfers as a short-term filler for the fact that there has not been a lot of IPO activity,” he said.Nasdaq did win the high-profile IPOs of tech start-ups Groupon and Zynga, although market volatility in the second half of the year led many companies to delay listing.Mr McCooey said this should lead to a bumper 2012, with 112 US companies filed with the SEC to list on Nasdaq, slightly higher than the number filed to list at NYSE.However, 2011 was a third successive lean year for IPOs on the Nasdaq, with $8.8bn raised in 2010 and $7.6bn in 2009. In 2008 and 2009 combined, Nasdaq attracted $100bn more through listings transfers than IPOs, with IPOs only exceeding listings transfers in 2010.The data came to light as the two exchange groups battled for bragging rights over company defection, in what is becoming an annual ritual.Until recently, the flow was almost exclusively one way, with several companies switching from NYSE to Nasdaq, but since 2007 competition has increased as the NYSE began allowing four-letter ticker symbols to be transferred from Nasdaq.Nasdaq prospered in market cap terms in 2011, attracting $80bn of market cap from the NYSE, including Viacom and Texas Instruments, while $30bn moved the other way.But NYSE was more successful in poaching companies. Twenty-four companies went from Nasdaq to the NYSE, twice the number that moved in the other direction. That included SuccessFactors, which cited NYSE’s pending merger with Deutsche Börse as a key attraction.With BATS now also cleared to accept listings, competition between exchanges for listings is set to intensify.“Switches are high-profile marketing events for sure and the exchanges work very hard on winning them for branding purposes,” said Alex Kramm, exchanges analyst at UBS, “but the number of companies that actually transfer in any year is tiny.”NYSE also chose to play down the significance of listings transfers, emphasising instead its performance in attracting IPOs. The 104 IPOs listed on NYSE in 2011 raised $33bn, more than any other exchange group.“The NYSE is far more than what happens on the trading floor here. The majority of our business is outside the US and we have a thriving futures and derivatives business,” said Scott Cutler head of trading at NYSE.“New listings could fall to zero and it wouldn’t have a material impact on revenue,” he added.
267;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-12-15T22:35:37Z;Iceland exchange lands first listing since 2008;;"Iceland’s tiny stock exchange is on Friday set to land its first company listing in three years, signalling the first flickers of a revival in the country’s equity market since the collapse of its banking system in 2008.Pall Hardarson, president of Nasdaq OMX Iceland, said trading in shares of Hagar, a supermarket chain operator that was once part of the failed Baugur retail group, would bring the number of companies listed to 12.At its height in 2000, the Icelandic exchange had 75 companies listed. It lost 95 per cent of its value from 2007 to 2009, with most of that occurring in October 2008, followed by a wave of delistings.The new listing follows a public tender last week of a 30 per cent share in Hagar that was owned by Arion Bank, which was created from some of the assets and liabilities of the former Kaupthing Bank, which itself failed in 2008.Mr Hardarson said there was a pipeline of six further listings, including Skýrr, one of Europe’s largest IT companies; Reiter, an investment company; and Eimskip, Iceland’s oldest shipping company, which announced its intention to list on Wednesday.“Iceland went down first and it’s coming back earlier, it’s ahead of the curve in that respect. I think there is considerable optimism here, especially with the reception we had with Hagar,” he said.The public tender was priced at IKr11-IKr13.5 per share, valuing the offer at $43m. Mr Hardarson said that 95 per cent of investors bid at the top of the range. The offer was eight times subscribed.He said companies had been restricted in their ability to borrow from banks since 2008, with banks “quite conservative when it comes to lending”.“Even if they are strong they have equity ratios that are quite high – about 20 per cent – which is virtually unheard of,” Mr Hardarson said. “This is part of what is pushing companies to market.”“But I think there is a lot more to it than that. We had a lot of investors that have appetite for these investment options. They’ve been starved of them for three years and they want to get back.”Hagar was acquired by the former Kaupthing Bank, its biggest creditor at the time of the Baugur collapse in 2008.Arion has been selling down parts of Hagar this year because banks are not allowed by law to own non-bank assets for longer than 12 months in Iceland.The bank sold 44 per cent of Hagar to domestic pension funds and other private investors in two operations in February and last month. The bank decided to sell 30 per cent on the public market, with the rest to be sold in a public tender next year, Mr Hardarson said.Iceland’s stock exchange traces its roots to a bond and fixed income exchange estabished in1985. The first company listing came in 1991, and it became part of OMX, the Stockholm-based Nordic exchange network, in 2006. Nasdaq, the US exchange operator, bought OMX in early 2008."
268;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-12-14T12:20:06Z;Nasdaq OMX in risk monitoring deal with Object Trading;;Nasdaq OMX has agreed a venture with Australia’s Object Trading to offer automated traders better risk protection as exchanges and trading technology companies capitalise on regulators’ concerns that better mechanisms are needed to prevent excessively risky trades from destabilising the financial system.The venture will see Nasdaq’s subsidiary FTEN and Object Trading, which provides connectivity to exchanges for high frequency trading firms, offer broker-dealers the ability to monitor risk across asset classes in real-time both before and after trades have been executed.Nasdaq has taken the lead among exchanges in expanding services to investors beyond simply executing trades and into areas such as pre-trade risk management.The FTEN-Object Trading link-up is an early illustration of how new rules such as the Dodd-Frank act in the US, and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive in Europe, are forcing many technology vendors to rethink their businesses.Many trading technology companies are examining whether they can stay competitive by selling tools like pre-trade risk and market surveillance to as many broker-dealers as possible. An alternative, increasingly pursued by the industry and highlighted by the FTEN and Object Trading deal, is to co-operate with rivals to offer connected services to capital-strapped customers.Risk management in trading is being shaken-up in the US by a market access rule introduced by the Securities and Exchange Commission. It intends to clamp down on investors using a broker’s exchange membership to trade directly on the market, a practice known as naked sponsored access.Risk monitoring rules apply to all individual trades submitted on behalf of a firm. However trading firms must also assess the impact of all orders from a firm to determine compliance with the market access rule.Ted Myerson, chief executive of FTEN, told FT Trading Room the changes were having a more profound impact on trading than some brokers had initially realised, and competing technology systems would in future have to be able to talk to each other.“The business process of trading is changing,” he said. “You can’t get overall credit risk from a trading screen. You need a fuller picture.”Nasdaq OMX bought FTEN, a privately held US company specialising in pre-trade risk management, a year ago as part of its expansion into technology and IT services. Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq, said the exchange’s second quarter was the “the first quarter we’re saying ‘you can’t really think of the equity business as really being just the match”.
269;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-12-13T19:33:36Z;Antitrust fears a main obstacle;;If anyone tried to predict whether the planned combination of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext would go through, based solely on the record of recent planned exchange mergers, they would probably say “No”.While that is not the right measure by which to judge the deal, the trail of failed mergers highlights how antitrust concerns have emerged as a key obstacle – as the German and US groups are discovering.The wave of mergers kicked off in October last year when SGX, the Singapore exchange, made an audacious bid for ASX, the Australian exchange. That foundered after Canberra rejected it, objecting to ceding control of a key piece of the country’s financial infrastructure to a foreign entity.The Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext tie-up, unveiled in February, drew a spoiler bid from Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange. They aimed to break up the deal with an offer for NYSE Euronext.But that failed after the US Department of Justice ruled that a combination of the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq share market would reduce the choice of listing venues for US companies.A few days after the German-US tie-up was announced, the London Stock Exchange and TMX Group unveiled a merger of their own, in part to ensure the exchanges’ survival amid what seemed to be a rapidly consolidating sector.That failed after a rival bidder emerged for TMX from a consortium of Canadian banks and pension funds, known as Maple. Casting themselves as a national champion they prevailed after TMX failed to muster a sufficient majority of shareholders in favour of the LSE deal. Now the antitrust spectre stalks Maple’s bid for TMX. Authorities are scrutinising whether competition would be reduced in a TMX/Maple combination – the same issue bedevilling the Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext deal.
270;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-12-12T20:26:32Z;Virtu acquires DMM of Cohen Capital;Company now NYSE Amex’s largest market maker;Virtu Financial has acquired a designated market maker (DMM) on the NYSE Amex trading floor, marking the continuing diversification push by high-speed trading shops.Although lesser known than rival Getco, which last week purchased the DMM business of Bank of America, Virtu has built a similar business, using high-frequency trading techniques to make markets rather than purely trade for its own book.On Monday, Virtu announced it had acquired the DMM business of Cohen Capital Group. Cohen was a market maker on NYSE Amex, the former American Stock Exchange, where many small companies and mutual funds are listed.Virtu will now oversee trading of 170 companies and 80 closed-end mutual funds, making it the largest market maker on NYSE Amex.It also acquired Cohen’s license to make markets on the main NYSE Big Board. Though Cohen was not currently a DMM for any NYSE-listed stocks, Virtu could apply for the role for new listings or win transfers from other DMMs.The role of specialist has changed dramatically in the past decade, with many firms exiting the business or consolidating as 1990s-era scandals led to rule changes and markets became fully electronic.But NYSE has kept a version of specialists, the DMMs, on both the main floor and NYSE Amex floor as a way to attract listed companies who want human traders overseeing their stocks.This handful of firms – which on the main NYSE floor now include only Getco, Goldman Sachs, Barclays Capital and Knight Capital – do not have the advantages of specialists, but can match the market’s best price in exchange for constantly quoting bids and asks. They also receive the highest rebates from NYSE.High-speed firms have come to dominate US and European trading, making up more than half of all trading volume, but have still struggled to cope with narrowing margins and uneven volumes over the past two years.Many have added scale and diversified into new businesses, such as client-facing algorithmic trading. Buying a DMM license also gives the trading firms direct contact with big corporations and fund management firms whose stocks they oversee.Along with Getco and Knight Capital, Virtu has backed stiffer obligations on market makers to keep trading during turbulent moments. Not all high-speed trading firms agree with this view, with many arguing that the costs of staying in the markets when prices are moving wildly are too great in exchange for too-few benefits.Earlier this year, Virtu merged with EWT/Madison Tyler, creating one of the five largest trading firms in the world. In addition to US equities, Virtu is market maker on the NYSE Liffe US futures market, and in markets run by the CME Group and others in Asia and Europe.Virtu is backed by Silver Lake, the private equity and venture capital group that has previously invested in trading groups such as Instinet and Nasdaq.“This acquisition is consistent with Virtu’s primary business objective of providing highly efficient, fully obligated, customised liquidity to investors across all markets,” said Vincent Viola, Virtu founder and chief executive. He is also a former chairman of Nymex.He added: “We look forward to working with our listed company partners and providing our unique liquidity to their valued investors.”
271;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-12-12T16:55:28Z;Diamond Food delays earnings filing;Pringles acquisition clouded in uncertainty;Diamond Foods, the maker of Kettle chips whose planned acquisition of Pringles is clouded in uncertainty, confirmed that it would not be able to file its latest quarterly earnings by a Monday deadline due to an internal accounting probe.The news sent Diamond’s share price down by 23 per cent by mid-afternoon in New York trading, the latest dramatic swing in an increasingly volatile stock.The Californian company – which had been set to acquire Pringles potato chips from Procter & Gamble this month in a stock deal worth $2.35bn, including debt – said on Monday that it would not file its earnings until after the accounting probe, which it expects to end in mid-February.The company said: “Diamond will take steps to file its [earnings statement] for the first quarter as soon as practicable after conclusion of the [accounting] investigation.”More than half of Diamond’s shares are held in short positions by investors who are betting they will fall, an unusually high proportion.The probe concerns Diamond’s accounting for crop payments to walnut growers and has disrupted the plans of P&G, the world’s biggest consumer goods company, to exit the food business.Food was out of place alongside P&G’s line up of shampoos, detergents and toothpastes but it took the company several years of searching to find a buyer in the form of Diamond, which it announced in April.Diamond, which also makes Emerald nuts and Pop Secret popcorn, initiated the investigation in November after receiving an “external communication” about its payments to walnut growers.In line with procedures of the Nasdaq stock exchange, where it is listed, Diamond said it expected to receive a notice that the company is not in compliance with market reporting rules. The snack maker intended to “submit a plan to regain compliance as quickly as possible”.In the meantime, the stock will continue to be listed and traded.The fall in Diamond shares on Monday took them down to $31.30. They had soared by nearly 53 per cent on Friday when Akshay Jagdale, senior analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, said in a research note that he expected the investigation to show that Diamond had properly accounted for various payments and that the Pringles deal would go through.But he added that “management’s credibility has been undermined significantly by the recent allegations”.P&G said: “Today’s news is not a surprise given the investigation that Diamond is conducting. We remain committed to closing this deal in the second half of our fiscal year.”
272;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-12-08T22:22:04Z;LSE calls for smaller IPO syndicates;Some high-profile offerings have underperformed in recent years;The London Stock Exchange has called for fewer banks to work on initial public offerings, and for more transparency in fees charged by banks working on flotations.The call comes six months after the flotation of mining group Glencore, which had 23 advisers in its syndicate.The proposals were part of a paper by the LSE designed to counter criticism of London as a venue for initial public offerings. The paper also called on parliament to require regulators to take account of the attractiveness of the UK’s capital markets when making the rules.Investors have criticised flotations in London in recent years amid the share price underperformance of a number of high-profile offerings including Glencore, Betfair, Ocado, Flybe and Promethean World.However, the LSE countered this criticism, saying that London IPOs had not performed worse than those elsewhere. Meanwhile, cities such as Hong Kong and Warsaw have stolen a march as venues for capital raisings in the past 12 months.By choosing London as a listings venue in recent years, some overseas companies have also qualified for membership of the FTSE 100, triggering a debate about the eligibility criteria for the UK’s blue-chip index.Tracey Pierce, director of equity primary markets at the LSE, said its paper should be considered “best practice”.“With market conditions still very tough, we want to make a call to action for key London stakeholders,” she said.The LSE’s analysis said that IPO syndicates in London had not dramatically increased in size when compared with listings on other exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange, Deutsche Börse, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, and Nasdaq OMX.As part of its new Financial Services Bill, the UK government is planning to remove a clause requiring regulators to consider the impact of regulation on the City.However, the LSE’s call to reinstate the requirement was rebuffed by the Treasury.“The government recognises the importance of the regulatory framework to a competitive UK financial sector, but this does not mean it would be appropriate to include a specific Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) objective linked to competitiveness,” it said.
273;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-12-06T13:53:17Z;SIX Group eyes Nordic markets expansion;;The SIX Swiss Exchange may not have taken part in the consolidation attempts that have swept the exchange business in the past year, but it would be a mistake to assume the bourse has been sitting in splendid isolation in Switzerland.Christian Katz, a former Goldman Sachs banker who has been the Swiss exchange´s chief executive since 2009, says the exchange has quietly been “investing in the internationalisation of our reach”.“I would say we are everything but isolated,” he says in an interview at the recent Mondo Visione exchange forum in London. “We´re not standing still. On the contrary we´ve been rolling out new services this year.”The latest example is the expansion of the exchange´s Scoach platform, a five-year old equal joint venture with Deutsche Börse which allows trading of structured products, either collateralised or without collateralisation.The collateralised part of the Scoach service, launched in late 2009 and known as Cosi, was recently expanded to Germany with the Nordic region next, according to Mr Katz. “We have requests from issuing banks to roll out the Cosi offering to the Nordic markets. We are evaluating feasibility,” he says.Cosi effectively minimises the credit exposure that investors in structured products - such as so-called “knock-out” warrants - would face if the bank issuing the product goes bust. The counterparty risk that would normally be borne by the investor is backed by collateral which is held by SIX Swiss Exchange on behalf of the investor.Mr Katz says: “After the collapse of Lehman Brothers many end-investors and some of the banks involved lost out on a series of structured products that were structured as capital guaranteed products because when Lehman was the guarantor they obviously weren´t able to do so after the default.“So investors suffered significant losses from that one issuer. Hence there was a demand in the marketplace to have these kinds of structured products with innovative payoffs in a secured manner.”The Cosi service attempts to solve this by allowing the issuer to provide collateral to the Swiss exchange which manages it on a daily mark-to-market basis. If the issuer fails to pay, the Swiss exchange sells the collateral and hands the proceeds back to the investor.Mr Katz claims that Cosi is “the only collateralised securitised derivatives service that has been taken up by any meaningful measure” as offered by an exchange.In another innovation, the Swiss exchange in September allowed for the settlement of structured products in gold.Separately the Swiss exchange has expanded the reach of its members to 3,000 additional securities beyond its current order book through a partnership with Liquidnet, the US operator of “dark pools”. Under the arrangement, agreed in January, members of the Swiss exchange and Liquidnet’s buyside market participants – asset managers and pension funds – can execute large block trades in Swiss and other European equities.It was the first such deal between Liquidnet and any exchange.Mr Katz said: “Growth has been satisfactory but it is ramping up in the right direction and even a low volume month like November has been encouraging.”The Swiss exchange is also preparing to roll out early next year a faster trading system - in part to attract “high-frequency” traders - provided by Nasdaq OMX.Mr Katz declines to say what proportion of the exchange is made up by high-frequency trading (HFT), “because it´s hard to measure”.But he says it is “slightly below the European average” for exchanges, which he adds need to have the right mix between HFT and other types of market participant.“I think the superior liquidity pool anywhere is the one that´s made up of all kinds of investors, long- and short-term. That is when a genuine liquidity pool best reflects the market forces in play.”Nonetheless that mix has not prevented the Swiss exchange´s market share in Swiss blue chip equities coming under attack from rivals such as Chi-X Europe and BATS Europe - which last week combined their businesses.Mr Katz says the Swiss exchange´s share of Swiss blue chips has fallen to around 68 per cent since Mifid came into force in 2007 - although is has stabilised in the last 12 months. “We are maintaining a slightly higher market share than our major European peers,” he says.“We are aware of the need to deliver great service to our clients and prove that we are the dominant liquidity pool. And we have the largest average trade size of any European venue. It proves our superior liquidity because it´s not just about the (bid-offer) spread, it´s about the depth that you have at that spread, and the resiliency of the market.”
274;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-12-05T22:14:41Z;BATS to establish market-making programme;Move highlights need to prevent “flash crashes”;BATS Global Markets, operator of US and European stock exchanges, will establish a market-making programme to support its nascent listings market, the group said on Monday.Earlier this year BATS announced it would launch a listings market to compete with NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX, which dominate corporate issuance. Though stocks can trade in any venue, the listings venue collects a fee and offers other services.While BATS’s offering is now live, it does not yet have any listings. BATS, which has filed to go public, plans to list on its own exchange. It is also in discussions with other groups to list, according to a spokesperson.On Monday, BATS said for the first time it would roll out an “innovative market maker program”, though it declined to offer details.BATS has already said it will distinguish itself with lower fees and size requirements than the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq stock markets.But the plan to have a market maker programme acknowledges that corporate issuers require levels of customer service greater than the high-speed trading firms which initially backed BATS and Direct Edge, another competing exchange. The pair now account for roughly 25 per cent of daily US stock trading volume.While the core trading clients of BATS include Tradebot and Getco, high-speed market makers who are among the exchange’s owners, the listings business aims to attract companies who often know little about modern market structure.Groups such as Coca-Cola or McDonald’s see value in having intermediaries handling trading of their shares, even if high-frequency trading firms have mostly replaced exchange-designated specialists as key liquidity providers in equity markets.Getco itself recently expanded its role on the New York Stock Exchange floor as a designated market maker (DMM) and filled the role for Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, General Electric and others, citing the value of those relationships. Nasdaq has its own such programme, known as select market maker.The US Securities and Exchange Commission has highlighted the need for market-making requirements to prevent events like the “flash crash” last may, when a sharp drying up of market liquidity allowed prices to swing wildly over 20 minutes.Though some high-frequency trading firms believe that those requirements would only add to their costs, other groups such as Knight Capital and Getco, who are both NYSE DMMs , have backed them.A recent study by Celent, a market research firm, from publicly available data on the execution of stock trading orders from brokerages, found that DMMs were the fastest way to trade larger orders of shares, but did not offer price improvements as strong as independent market makers.
275;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-12-01T23:12:57Z;Senators look to ease IPO regulations;‘On ramp’ would facilitate fundraising;Two US senators plan to introduce legislation to make it easier for private companies to go public as a way to boost job growth, despite concerns that the measures could weaken investor protections.Senator Charles Schumer announced at a hearing in Washington on Thursday that he, along with Senator Pat Toomey, would introduce a bill to provide what is termed an initial public offering “on ramp”. It would exempt small groups from some securities regulations for their initial years as public companies.This would join a number of other measures under consideration to make it easier for small companies to raise capital and create jobs. These include allowing private companies to have more than 500 shareholders before they must file public financial statements and carving out exemptions to allow start-ups to solicit small investors online.These reforms have bipartisan support in the House and many have been backed by the White House and US Treasury department as other jobs creation bills have stalled.But some Democrats in the Senate have expressed concerns that the rules would go too far and weaken public defences against fraud. The reforms have also sparked debate within the industry, with public exchanges such as NYSE Euronext fighting private-share markets such as SecondMarket over whether it should be easier to market non-public securities.At the hearing on Thursday, John Coffee, a professor at Columbia Law School, said: “I’m not against raising the [shareholder cap], but it’s got to be a meaningful level that gives priority and protection to smaller issuer and doesn’t allow large institutions to escape out the back door.”Mr Schumer said his and Mr Toomey’s bill would “strike a good balance between easing burdens and protecting investors”.Meredith Cross, director of the division of corporate finance at the Securities and Exchange Commission, said that the agency was studying the 500-shareholder cap and would release a study and request public comment on it next year.However, she was sceptical of elements of the “on ramp” proposal that would weaken rules restricting bank analysts from recommending IPOs being brought forward by their firms.“Some ideas raise important policy questions,” she testified. “We want to make sure not to tip the balance the wrong way on investor protection.”The “on ramp” was first proposed by the IPO Task Force, a group of industry executives and entrepreneurs convened by the US Treasury department earlier this year.The group’s primary reform idea was to exempt companies with revenues of less than $1bn for up to 5 years from a section of the Sarbanes-Oxley act which requires chief executives to attest to company results, resulting in as much as $2m in annual auditing costs.The rule has been scrutinised since its passage in 2002, but many argue that regulations are not the primary barrier to going public, instead pointing to deregulation of stock markets and the poor economy.The senators’ proposal received the immediate backing of representatives of NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX at the hearing.
276;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-12-01T18:54:25Z;‘Conflict of interest’ challenge for exchanges;;For years, many of the world’s exchanges have been turning themselves into publicly-traded companies by listing on their own boards.But on Thursday Norway’s securities regulator threw cold water on the concept, blocking an application by the Oslo Bors to convert itself into a listed company. The watchdog said this could “lead to conflicts of interest”.Industry analysts suspect the move may be part of a desire to protect the Bors against a predator, such as Nasdaq OMX, which operates the largest market across the Nordic region and last year started competing against the Oslo Bors in Norwegian shares.But the development has surprised the exchange world, where the notion of attracting outside shareholders to fund new growth avenues has been as much an accepted part of the way exchanges are run as the ringing of the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange.Yet some regulators worry that there is a conflict of interest in allowing exchanges to combine a commercial role with their responsibilities to oversee orderly markets.That is especially the case when exchanges face competition. There, the temptation might be to disguise as a regulatory decision a move that was actually aimed at making life hard for a competitor.That is one reason why the Australian regulator in July took over the ASX Australian exchange’s responsibilities for supervising its markets. ASX last month started facing competition in share trading for the first time, after the launch of Chi-X Australia, a smaller platform.In India the ministry of finance has been studying recommendations by a committee chaired by Bimal Jalan, former reserve bank governor, that exchanges be prohibited from listing. “There’s been a lot of debate in India about separating the regulatory and commercial role,” says Divya Malik Lahiri, head of corporate affairs at the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE).Emerging market bourses worry that exchanges in more mature markets are chasing shareholder returns at the expense of their quasi-utility role designed to help support a national economy, such as by devoting a lot of time and expense to new services for “high-frequency” trading (HFT).Huseyin Erkan, chief executive of the Istanbul Stock Exchange, said at a recent meeting of the World Federation of Exchanges in South Africa: “The [bigger] stock exchanges have lost sight of their role in capital formation.”Ravi Narain, chief executive of NSE – which, like the Turkish bourse, is not publicly listed – says the ties that have bound an exchange to the underlying economy through its role in facilitating capital-raising “is beginning to get frayed around the edges” in developed economies.He says listed exchanges in the US and Europe have become “prisoners of low GDP growth and pressure from shareholders seeking higher returns”.Yet larger listed exchanges counter such charges.Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, said: “There is no difference between established exchanges and those in emerging countries, except that most emerging country exchanges are protected by their monopoly position. Established exchanges operate in a competitive landscape, are innovative and highly efficient at raising capital.“Since the financial crisis started the LSE has raised over £206bn in equity at a time that almost all other forms of finance have dried up. This critical fundraising role has, and always will be, a core function of all successful competitive exchanges.”Experts say competition is driving big exchanges to pursue HFT services, not because they are publicly listed. Benn Steil, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, says: “The conflicts of interest were much deeper in mutualised exchanges.”Tom Kloet, chief executive of TMX Group, operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange, says exchange boards are getting better at thinking about a broader range of stakeholders, not just shareholders, “because it’s skewed in the regulators’ minds the other way. And it was the regulators who pushed demutualisation in the first place”.
277;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-12-01T10:30:11Z;Oslo Børs suffers blow in IPO bid;;Oslo Børs has suffered a blow in its bid to float on its own stock exchange after Norwegian regulators advised the government to refuse the application, citing fears of a conflict of interest.The ruling by the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway is unusual as many of the world’s stock exchanges have long been listed on their own bourses. Oslo Børs announced plans to go public earlier this year and made a formal application to the ministry of finance in June.The exchange wanted to list to make it easier for shareholders to trade their stakes on electronic trading platforms. At present, shares in Oslo Børs can only be traded over-the-counter through a broker in Norway. The group was not planning to issue new shares or sell existing stock.“The rationale for the recommendation is, in part, that a listing of the parent company of Oslo Børs on a regulated market that is operated by Oslo Børs could lead to conflicts of interest,” the exchange said.The regulator also advised that conditions should be imposed on Oslo Børs if the government did approve the listing.The FSA’s judgement comes as the bourse is fighting domestic competition from rival exchanges, particularly Nasdaq OMX and Chi-X Europe, which have both carved out market shares in excess of 10 per cent. Oslo’s market share has dropped from almost 100 per cent to 71 per cent in less than three years, according to the Fidessa Fragmentation Index.The exchange is due to give its response to the government on the FSA later this month. However it has postponed a planned shareholder meeting to approve the listing until it has received a final decision from the finance ministry.Oslo Børs’ shareholders include Vital Forsikring, Norway’s largest life assurance company, with a 22.8 per cent stake, Kommunal Landspensjonskasse, an insurance group with a 11.9 per cent stake, as well as Goldman Sachs and State Street.
278;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-11-30T16:30:48Z;Tech Beat: OTC clearing moves to real-time;;"Moves by global regulators to push more over-the-counter derivatives (OTC) through clearing is leading to a fundamental overhaul of the technology the industry uses.A stream of news in recent weeks has highlighted the issue. BM&F Bovespa, the Brazilian exchange operator which also operates four clearing houses, chose Cinnober, a Swedish trading technology group, and Calypso Technology, a US peer, to provide the technology for its new multi-asset class central counterparty to evaluate risk.Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, which aims to connect customers to its OTC clearing house by the middle of next year, has started up an upgrade to its platform with work expected to begin this month.Nasdaq OMX, the transatlantic exchanges operator announced it had gone live in Europe with multi-asset class clearing for its Nordic clearing house.For most the first question has been: what do we need? As HKEx admitted: “The core processing of OTC derivatives is much more complex than on-exchange equity derivatives. The new platform not only has to be highly flexible but also needs to meet HKEx’s stringent reliability and resilience standards.”Then the question is: buy or build? Nasdaq OMX has used technology from Genium, its trading platform but other exchanges, lacking either the deep pockets or the experience in the OTC market, have bought expertise and systems from third party providers.Besides BM&FBovespa, Calypso supplies SGX and CME Group and is working with State Street and Wells Fargo. Cinnober expects other exchanges and banks to follow the Brazilian initiative.But one problem is that while the industry knows clearing and transaction volumes will grow, it is unclear by much. Kevin McPartland, an analyst at Tabb Group, the US capital markets consultancy, estimates transaction volumes could increase twentyfold, and market data volumes up to 3-4 times above the current levels.Earlier this year LCH.Clearnet, the London-based clearing house, developed a system with Paris-based Murex capable of handling 25,000 interest rates swaps trades sides per hour and a total portfolio of 4m. It doubled SwapClear’s previous capacity at a stroke but has been designed to scale to 10m trade sides.“As volatility alone can cause rapid intraday deterioration of major counterparty credit quality, a move towards near-time or real-time clearing is inevitable anyway,” said Mr McPartland in a recent report. “OTC derivatives transactions that once took days to clear and settle will be finalised in minutes, if not seconds.”Within a clearing house, the technology can be roughly divided into systems that deal with trade capture, position management, margin calculation, risk management and settlement. It is likely that pressure will grow to compress all the procedures.As has often been pointed out, valuing a credit default swap is far more complex than valuing a standard interest rate swap. Unlike exchange-traded instruments, OTC derivatives were frequently never intended for clearing and processing.The technology will have to manage huge amounts of complex data to calculate both initial margin and variation margin as fast as possible. But that may have two related key sides effects; market parctipants may have to hold more funds in reserve to meet any intra-day margin calls, while clearing houses may require more capital to protect themselves.Traders of OTC derivatives, such as brokers and buy side firms, have not historically had to put up margin for clearing. A smart tool from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago allows market participants to estimate the amount of collateral they may need from clearing. Tabb estimates, as a worse case scenario, that the industry may need to come up with $2,000bn in capital.And as rules around bank capital begin to bite, market participants will look for operations that tie-up large amounts of capital. It’s probable that there will be a push to reduce clearing times to T+0, to free up capital to use as collateral. Currently the system can take several days.But the calculations are so complex that while a move to real-time clearing may be desirable, it may also be an unattainable goal. This brave new world assumes the system will work – and it’s not a foregone conclusion when you compare with the problems a sophisticated industry like equities trading can experience in stressed periods.Not all are convinced about the benefits of a move to real-time clearing. As clearing house chief executive privately put it: “There’s a general principle that faster is better than slower, but how fast does the CCP need to be? Do you need a CCP to constantly annoy you by grabbing collateral out of your account while you are building a position when you could be flat in an hour?”But Per Anders Häll-Bedman, acting chief executive of Cinnober, pointed out that the risk would therefore still remain in the market. “Clearing members are putting up significant amount of risk intraday. You still would like to know if one of your members is holding a large risk position intraday. Technology makes it possible.”"
279;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-11-22T11:10:44Z;TSE and Osaka exchanges confirm merger;;Tokyo Stock Exchange, operator of Japan’s largest share-trading platform, will merge with the Osaka Securities Exchange, its domestic rival, creating Japan’s largest exchange group and bolstering the TSE’s position as the third largest in the world by market capitalisation of company listings.The proposed combination, expected to be completed by January 2013, was described by the pair as “a step towards the revitalisation of the Japanese economy”.The combined value of stocks listed on the exchanges would be about $3,600bn, trailing transatlantic exchanges operators NYSE Euronext at $12,000bn and Nasdaq OMX Group at nearly $4,000bn, based on data at the end of October.Japan’s two largest exchanges had come under pressure to consolidate as global rivals develop into venues that offer both trading in equities and derivatives. The country, for so long the undisputed largest and most liquid capital market in Asia, faces a long-term threat from China and its maturing exchanges.In a complicated series of transactions, the unlisted Tokyo bourse will first take a majority stake in the listed Osaka exchange in a public tender offer worth Y480,000 per share, or Y130bn ($1.7bn). That represents a 14 per cent premium to the last price before trading in the target’s shares was halted on Tuesday morning. Starting from autumn 2012, the two companies will be merged at a ratio valuing the TSE at about 1.7 times the OSE.The combined holding company, tentatively named the Japan Exchange Group, will have four separate businesses operating a cash equity market, a derivatives market, a regulatory unit and a clearing company. Atsushi Saito, TSE president and chief executive, will serve as CEO of the new entity, to be headquartered in Tokyo. Michio Yoneda, OSE president and chief executive, is to be chief operating officer.“This is a rational response to an evolving competitive environment,” said Neil Katkov, a Tokyo-based financial consultant at Celent, noting that alternative equity trading platforms such as Chi-X Japan and SBI Japannext are claiming an increasing share of trading in Nikkei 225 stocks. “Secondly, it is about trying to prime the pump, to get more offerings and trading going in Japan.”Japanese equity markets have been left standing by regional rivals. Ten years ago, Tokyo was the world’s fifth most popular venue by funds raised in initial public offerings, according to Dealogic. So far this year it ranks 40th. Shenzhen and Shanghai, both outside the top 50 a decade ago, are fourth and fifth respectively this year, with a combined $26bn in initial public offering funds raised. Just 12 foreign companies remain listed in Tokyo, from a peak of 127 in 1991.The pair appear a good fit on paper. The bulk of the TSE’s revenues come from share trading, while Osaka’s are dominated by revenues from the widely traded futures contract tied to the benchmark Nikkei index. Even so, there is significant overlap in operations and technology. Proposed cost synergies of Y7bn a year amount to about one-eighth of the companies’ combined cost bases in the year to March 2011.“This is not a big-bang moment for Japan Inc, but it is generally a positive, as these are two complementary businesses which will benefit from the ability to scale their operations,” Simon Roué, a banker at Deutsche Bank in Tokyo, said. “The real test will be in how well they execute their plans in putting the two together.”
280;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-11-21T12:43:13Z;Nasdaq OMX in clearing technology upgrade;;Nasdaq OMX, the US-based exchange operator, unveiled in Europe on Monday one of the first clearing systems that allows “real-time” risk management for multiple exchange-traded assets and over-the-counter derivatives.The move is a sign that market operators believe that the speed at which trades are happening, increased market volatility and G20 reforms pushing greater use of clearing, especially for OTC products, mean that clearing systems must be able to monitor intra-day risks as far as possible in real time.Currently many clearing systems operate on old technology that only allows for this to happen once or twice a day, or at the end of the day.The new Nasdaq system, known as Genium Risk, will operate for its Nordic clearing house. It would provide the clearing house with “a real-time risk management solution, including new tools for improved risk monitoring and handling of incidents for derivatives clearing”.In addition, “capital efficient risk models for fixed income and equities will optimise the use of member collateral”, Nasdaq said.Hans-Ole Jochumsen, president of Nasdaq OMX Nordic, said: “With the uncertainty there is an increased risk that things are moving very fast and you need to be able to have real time capability to monitor this and have an intra-day margins calls.“The volumes we are talking about coming in for clearing are also very big. That also means that clearing capacity will be much higher and there is so much more to protect.”According to a recent report by Tabb Group, a consultancy, there will be a need for significant upgrades in clearing technology to cope with an estimated 20-fold increase in transaction volumes and demands for ever-faster trading speeds.There will also be increased complexities in margin requirement calculations and finding offsets within portfolios to reduce margin requirements, straining systems further.BM&FBovespa, the Brazilian exchange, last month signed contracts with Cinnober and Calypso, independent Swedish and UK clearing technology companies, for a real-time clearing system for equities, derivatives, bonds, foreign exchange and over-the-counter derivatives.Nils-Robert Persson, Cinnober executive chairman, said: “Legacy clearing systems are clearly not able to match the flexibility and functionality required in a modern marketplace.”
281;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-11-18T08:14:25Z;NYSE and D Börse gamble on concessions;;NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse have launched a high-stakes gamble to assuage serious competition concerns in Brussels over the exchanges’ planned merger with a package of concessions offering rivals partial access to their Germany-based clearing house.After succeeding in overturning some but not all of the concerns expressed by European antitrust authorities, the exchanges have also proposed to sell some single stock equities and single stock futures businesses in Europe, eliminating an overlap in their businesses.The move reflects confidence at the German and US groups that they have made some progress on convincing Brussels of their view on how markets should be defined. But the commitment on clearing house access may not go far enough and the merger still faces big obstacles, ahead of a likely final decision in January.NYSE and Deutsche Börse, on Friday, said in a statement that they hoped to address Brussels’ “remaining concerns …in derivatives trading and clearing while preserving the compelling industrial logic of the transaction”.Deutsche Börse shares closed up 2.97 per cent at €43.04 on Friday, while NYSE Euronext gained 1.88 per cent to end the day at $27.08.In terms of overlap in equity derivatives, NYSE said it would divest its pan-European single equity derivatives business, including Bclear, with the exception of its options businesses in its home markets, where Deutsche Börse would divest its business.In European interest rate and equity index derivatives, Deutsche Börse and NYSE said their proposal meant Eurex Clearing services “would be provided on a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory basis and include cross-margining”.“Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext continue to believe that the transaction will have no detrimental effect on competition, but rather will enhance it by delivering a regulated, stable and transparent European counterweight to established market centers in America and Asia and delivering significant efficiencies to users of our market,” the companies said.Brussels had insisted that the two exchanges’ futures businesses – which together would handle more than 90 per cent of European futures trading – were rivals in Europe and that any merger would eliminate that competition.However, people familiar with the negotiations said antitrust officials now accepted the exchanges’ argument that bond futures on the Börse’s Eurex platform and interest rate futures on NYSE’s London-based Liffe platform did not overlap. But Brussels believed that there still could be competition between Eurex and Liffe in the future.The London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq OMX, fierce critics of the deal, have argued that any combination of Eurex and Liffe would be a monopoly.The German-US group’s concession on access to clearing involves situations where rivals offer new derivatives products and want to have them processed on Eurex Clearing, the Börse’s Frankfurt-based clearing house. Competitors would also be allowed to exploit cost savings by using the German clearing house for so-called cross-margining.But rivals wanting to compete with Eurex or Liffe by launching copycat futures contracts would not be able to take advantage of this concession. That will come as a blow to the LSE, which hopes to launch futures based on the Euro Stoxx index, currently a successful Eurex product.Yet the LSE said on Friday that it had never opposed the deal, objecting only to it moving ahead without concessions that would allow competitors open access to the Borse’s clearing house, and forcing the exchange to relax its grip over the licensing to others of products on the Euro Stoxx index, which the German company owns.Xavier Rolet, LSE chief executive, said: “We have never objected to the NYSE/DB merger, subject to ensuring the creation of conditions that allow for and promote genuine competition in Europe’s capital markets, across all asset classes, including fixed income, listed futures and listed equity derivatives.“We therefore very much welcome any concessions that promote healthy competition, that give customers choice, and that allow innovation to thrive.”The merger parties still risk losing two arguments over the market scope. The European Commission rejected its contention that exchange-traded derivatives markets are global and that the combined group would face competition from CME Group, the biggest US futures exchange.Brussels also remains unconvinced that the combined exchanges would still face stiff competition from the over-the-counter or off-exchange derivatives markets.The submission, made late on Thursday night, automatically extends the final deadline for a decision to January 23 next year and officially represents the exchanges’ last and best offer to address competition concerns. Only in “exceptional” circumstances are further concessions accepted after this date.In order to ensure that rivals would be allowed access, the Commission is likely to require the establishment of an independent body that would monitor conduct and resolve disputes.In the informal discussions on remedies, the Commission offers guidance on whether the proposals are “acceptable” in addressing competition concerns, giving the merger parties a good sense of the risks they are taking with their final offer.Rivals and customers of the merger parties will in coming weeks be given an opportunity to comment on the proposed concessions before a final decision is taken on whether to block or approve the merger.Additional reporting by James Wilson in Frankfurt
282;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-11-14T18:39:09Z;D Börse accuses LSE of copying model;German exchange says its London rival has been imitating its strategy;Deutsche Börse on Monday accused the London Stock Exchange of imitating its strategy of building an integrated exchange and clearing house even as the UK bourse has been a vocal critic of the German exchange’s business model.The German exchange also insisted that its Eurex futures platform and the Liffe futures platform owned by NYSE Euronext did not compete – as the LSE and others have argued – since the biggest contracts on each trade on opposite ends of the interest rate yield curve.The issue of whether Eurex and Liffe compete is central to an antitrust probe by the European Commission into the Börse’s proposed combination with NYSE Euronext.That reaches a critical point this week as the German and US groups prepare possible “remedies” that they may decide to submit to Brussels in a bid to overcome regulators’ concerns over specific issues. If they do so, this would automatically push a deadline for Brussels to make its final decision into January.Reto Francioni, the Börse’s chief executive, told a conference in Frankfurt that the “vertical silo” model, where an exchange controls the process through from trading to clearing, had more often been copied by others than “bemoaned”.The LSE told Brussels in July that “combining Deutsche Börse and NYSE-Euronext would entrench the position both exchanges enjoy in derivatives by removing each other’s closest competitor and making new entry even harder”.Between them the Börse and NYSE Euronext would account for 89 per cent of trading in European equity index products, 83 per cent in European single stock products, and 97 per cent in European interest rate products, the LSE said. Nasdaq OMX, NYSE’s main rival, has made the same case.Mr Francioni said: “Critics of vertical integration, such as the London Stock Exchange, have pursued a crystal-clear and imitative integration strategy, at least since the planned takeover of London Clearing House,” Mr Francioni said, referring to LCH.Clearnet.The LSE is in exclusive talks with LCH.Clearnet about taking a controlling stake in the clearing house. However, the UK bourse has said that it does not view ownership of a clearing house as meaning total control of access to that clearing house.It has advocated an “open” model where vertically-owned clearing houses nonetheless accept derivatives contracts for clearing from rival exchanges - a model that does not yet exist anywhere.Mr Francioni said vertical integration was “often bemoaned in the past, but more often copied, at least by those competitors who didn’t have it”.“The future belongs to integrated exchanges because they offer market participants a single port of call for secure and reliable transaction processing,” he said, adding that CME Group, Deutsche Börse’s main global rival, had a vertical model.Separately, the workers council at the Börse, three Luxembourg-based unions at NYSE Euronext and the French CGT union at NYSE Euronext said they opposed the merger.“The sharing of the French experience of the previous merger with NYSE [Group] has helped them to understand the future US dependency of their European companies. It confirmed the staff and union representatives in their opposition to the proposed merger and will lead to further actions.”Additional reporting by Alex Barker in Brussels
283;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
284;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-11-11T18:16:35Z;Viacom to switch from NYSE to save fees;;Viacom will change its market listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq Global Select Market in a move the media group said would save it significant listing fees.The parent company of Paramount Pictures and MTV has a market capitalisation of $26.2bn and is one of the largest companies in the media sector. It follows rival News Corp, which switched from NYSE to Nasdaq in December 2008.Both class A and class B shares will begin trading on Nasdaq on December 1. Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom and CBS, controls 80 per cent of Viacom’s class A voting shares while holding just 7 per cent of its total equity.Viacom reported net earnings of $614m for the fourth quarter on Thursday, boosted by rising cable television revenues and the success of the latest Transformers film.The two exchanges compete fiercely for listings, and increasingly so since NYSE began targeting web companies, winning listings for LinkedIn and Pandora, that used to be Nasdaq’s exclusive domain. Nasdaq has most recently won Groupon and Zynga.The competition is largely based on marketing opportunities and services, since US stocks can trade in any market and the two exchanges no longer have unique ticker symbols. Four-letter tickers can list on NYSE, and one-letter tickers can list on Nasdaq.Neither Viacom nor Nasdaq would discuss the details of the promotional package but Nasdaq agreed to spend $5m-$8m in advertising on News Corp properties when it switched listings in 2008.Among media groups, Disney, Time Warner and CBS still trade on NYSE, while Viacom will join News Corp, Comcast and Discovery Communications on Nasdaq. Other media groups that have made the switch include Liberty Media and DreamWorks, which is currently promoting Puss in Boots on the large digital billboard Nasdaq owns in Times Square.“Every time Viacom walks out of their offices in Times Square they see our tower. We’re in their face every day,” said Bruce Aust, head of listings at Nasdaq.Mr Aust also said that Viacom wanted to be a member of the Nasdaq 100 index, as did Vodafone, which switched in 2009.Nasdaq still trails behind NYSE by number of companies switching to its exchange this year, with Viacom being the first, while 11 companies have moved from Nasdaq to NYSE. NYSE has stolen some media groups, including Imax, the cinema technology provider.Nasdaq says many switches to their market come in the fourth quarter, since companies have already paid their listing fees on NYSE for the year. The largest companies by shares outstanding – a tier that includes Viacom – pay a higher fee on NYSE, up to $500,000, versus a $99,000 cap for all companies on Nasdaq.
285;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-11-11T17:43:11Z;HKEx to be slower than its global rivals;;An extensive technology upgrade to be carried out by Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing in December will leave the world’s largest stock exchange by market value with a platform far slower than many of its global rivals.Third-quarter results to September 30 from the exchange on Friday revealed that HKEx had marginally increased net profits to HK$1.24bn amid global market turbulence.The period also saw HKEx embark on a wide-ranging two-year plan designed to enable it to compete with the emergence of local rivals, tackle competition from other global exchanges and survive future financial shocks. As part of the plan, its technology platform will be overhauled and HK$1.5bn spent on a vast data centre.HKEx said it would be able to process orders in 9 milliseconds – thousandths of a second – far short of rival financial centres Singapore, Tokyo, New York and London.Rival exchanges have ploughed hundreds of millions of dollars into technology in recent years to attract revenues from automated and high-frequency trading, which can execute trades in the fraction of a blink of an eye.Speed and reliability are critical for high-frequency traders in assessing which markets to trade. Consequently the industry has focused on improving capacity to handle orders and the efficiency of time to trade, what the industry calls “latency”.“The upgrade will increase system capacity tenfold to 30,000 orders per second, which is scalable to 150,000 orders per second, and reduce order processing latency 16-fold to 9 milliseconds,” HKEx said in its results.Those measurements lag far behind those of rivals such as NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX and the London Stock Exchange, which have all sought to attract high-frequency traders to their platform and sold their technology to other exchanges worldwide.Nasdaq OMX’s INet platform, used by Hong Kong’s rival Singapore, is capable of handling more than 1m messages per second in speeds of less than 100 microseconds – millionths of a second – while the LSE’s Millennium system can process 1m messages with latency of 126 microseconds.The Australian Stock Exchange is also set to go live on November 28 with its high-speed order book, PureMatch, as part of an overhaul of its technology. A A$36m data centre is scheduled to open in Sydney in February.However, Charles Li, HKEx chief executive, told FT Trading Room in the summer its forthcoming upgrade would not necessarily favour high-frequency traders. The exchange has also been eager to develop links with mainland Chinese bourses such as Shenzhen and Shanghai, and become a centre for global equity listings.“It is our goal to enhance our markets’ overall competitiveness so that all our stakeholders can continue to prosper,” Mr Li said on Friday.The group aims to open its data centre in just under a year’s time. It has also been involved in market consultations about extending after-hours futures trading.
286;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;SEC tightens rules on reverse mergers;;The Securities and Exchange Commission has approved new rules proposed by stock exchanges to make it harder for private companies to go public by merging with a shell company, a response to concerns that Chinese groups were using such deals to skirt accounting rules.Earlier this year, a number of Chinese companies that had gone public via “reverse mergers” were targeted by short sellers who believed that US auditors were not able properly to monitor these companies’ Chinese operations.The exchanges proposed new rules on such mergers earlier this year, which the SEC adopted on Wednesday despite some investor concern that the scrutiny should be on the companies themselves, rather than the reverse merger structure, as that could hurt capital formation for some small companies.Reverse mergers will now require a “seasoning period” of one year during which companies will only be able to trade in over-the-counter markets but will still have to file financial statements according to listed-company standards.They will also have to meet a minimum share price requirement of a $4 closing price for 30 of the 60 days before applying to list with an exchange.In the past, the exchanges said, promoters of such deals were able artificially to inflate prices to meet standards.“We believe the more rigorous standards for reverse mergers will benefit investors and issuers, and we applaud the SEC for its thoughtful attention and leadership on this important matter,” the NYSE said in a statement.The US exchanges have been doing brisk business with Chinese companies raising capital in the US. The US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board found that 215 companies with operations in China had listed in the US, a majority through reverse mergers.But following inquiries into several companies by the SEC, the US Department of Justice and the accounting board, the exchanges moved to tightened their listing standards.Already, Nasdaq OMX and NYSE Euronext, which operate the two largest US listings markets, have delisted five Chinese companies and halted trading in the shares of more than 35 other small and micro-cap Chinese companies.Shares in Bloomberg’s reverse merger index are down 55 per cent this year.Separately, the PCAOB sanctioned a US auditing firm for relying on poorly trained Chinese assistants and blocked a Hong Kong firm’s registration to practice in the US.
287;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-11-06T15:23:21Z;Nasdaq clings to top spot for tech listings;;Nasdaq OMX is making a push to remain the top listings venue for new tech and internet companies, winning Groupon and Zynga after losing LinkedIn and Pandora to rival NYSE Euronext earlier this year.While Nasdaq dominated the first wave of internet IPOs, winning listings for groups like Ebay and Google, the exchanges have been competing fiercely for social networking companies – with the biggest prize, Facebook, still up for grabs.NYSE Euronext has expanded its Silicon Valley offices, and took its highest share of US tech and web listings last year since 1995, at more than 50 per cent, according to Dealogic. So far this year it is tied with Nasdaq with 17 listings each.But Nasdaq has dominated the second half, winning most of the big-name listings including Groupon, the online-coupon seller, and Zillow, the real estate website. It will also be home to Zynga, the social networking games maker, which hopes to list by year-end.Since US stocks can trade in any venue, revenues from listings are much more important.Nasdaq attempted to break-up NYSE’s pending merger with Deutsche Börse earlier this year, but US regulators blocked a counterbid, saying it would create a monopoly.Nasdaq, which has an office on Sand Hill Road in Silicon Valley, said that it was leading this half in part because the listings were more consumer-focused.Nasdaq touts its digital billboards in Times Square, which 1m people visit daily, and the corporate services it has acquired, such as Glide Technologies, which tracks media coverage of companies.“We’re able to do a lot in terms of creative branding,” said Bob McCooey, head of capital markets at Nasdaq. “Companies can get the services they need with an exchange known for innovation and growth.”NYSE, meanwhile, highlights its bigger presence in Europe and says it is targeting a broad range of tech companies. Earlier this year, Imax, the cinema technology group, and Successfactors, a business software firm, switched to NYSE from Nasdaq.“The fact is, you’ve got two exchanges in a heated battle. That’s a huge change from how it used to be,” said Scott Cutler, head of listings at NYSE.Some smaller tech groups, such as Angie’s List, a website for services including housekeeping that plans to list this month on Nasdaq, do not qualify for NYSE.While listing fees for smaller companies are similar, for bigger firms Nasdaq caps fees at $99,500 a year. NYSE fees can be up to $500,000.But many companies do not see major differences, and end up choosing based on factors such as the personal preferences of their founders, said Tim Quast, chief executive of ModernIR, a consultancy.“Underneath the skin, the two markets aren’t really any different,” he said.
288;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-11-02T15:20:33Z;NYSE says EU has ‘no issues’ with D Börse arm;;NYSE Euronext has told staff that Brussels has “no issues” with many areas of its proposed deal with Deutsche Börse, including the latter’s Clearstream settlement business, although the exchanges face a another meeting with EU competition authorities on November 8.The comments are likely to allay speculation that one of the two exchanges could be forced to divest some parts of their businesses in order to secure regulatory approval for their merger, which would create one of the world’s largest exchanges operators.The bourses had two days of hearings in Brussels into the deal last week as they looked to persuade regulators conducting an in-depth probe into the €12bn ($16.6bn) deal. Authorities are deciding whether to allow a combination which would create a near-monopoly in trading and clearing of exchange-traded derivatives in Europe. A verdict is due by Christmas.“There are no issues with regard to our equities, listings, market data, technology or settlement/depository businesses, and there is even some agreement with regard to our derivatives business,” Duncan Niederauer, chief executive, told employees in an email. Excerpts were filed to US authorities on November 1.Mr Niederauer has long ruled out a potential sale of a derivatives business as potential remedy to satisfy competition authorities but market participants have speculated other operations, such as Clearstream, the custody and settlement arm of Deutsche Börse, could be sacrificed. Clearstream is the part of the business that calculates and manages the amount of collateral that market participants have to post as a guarantee of a trade.However Mr Niederauer added: “We will head back to Brussels the week of November 7 to assess where we stand …and discuss any remaining issues with the Commission.”NYSE and Deutsche Börse argued at the hearing that the exchange-traded derivatives markets are global and that the combined group would face competition from rivals such as CME Group of the US. Rival European stock exchanges such as the London Stock Exchange, Nasdaq OMX and Chi-X Europe have voiced concerns over the combination, as has Icap, the interdealer broker.Mr Niederauer described NYSE’s tactics in the two-day hearing as playing “offense” on the first day “while rebutting the Commission’s findings”. The second day, he said, “required more nimbleness, as the ‘dissentors’, primarily in the form of competitors with obvious motivations, were given the opportunity to express themselves”.
289;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-10-31T23:35:23Z;Brussels probe puts silos under scrutiny;;"This week, Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, two of the world’s largest exchanges, will be hoping that after lengthy talks in Brussels they have persuaded European antitrust regulators to approve their plan to merge.Two days of hearings at the European Commission ended last week, marking a key milestone since the German-US operators in February unveiled a plan to combine to create the world’s largest bourse.At stake is not merely the creation of the world’s largest company listings platform – at first glance the most obvious result of the merger.The Commission’s antitrust division has misgivings about the combination of the Börse’s Eurex futures arm with NYSE Euronext’s Liffe platform, which would have more than 95 per cent of trading in European futures contracts, a popular type of exchange-trade derivative instrument.Yet what makes this case unusual is that the same issue of competition in derivatives is enshrined in sweeping pan-European reform of the equities and derivatives markets that is happening at the same time – known as “Mifid II”.Both developments have resulted in a fierce battle over the future of a business model in the exchange world that has remained unchanged for decades: the “vertical silo”.That refers to a structure where an exchange owns its own clearing house in one integrated business. It allows an exchange to lock in clearing revenue that otherwise would go to an external provider.It also gives the exchange a powerful strategic weapon, since ownership of a clearing house makes it hard – if not impossible – for rival exchanges to offer trading in the same derivatives offered by the silo.Deutsche Börse operates as such a structure and its relatively high valuation in comparison with other exchange groups has long been underpinned by it; the same applies to CME Group, the US futures operator.Yet the silo is coming under threat in Europe that could have repercussions across the global exchange business.As part of its probe, Brussels has focused on whether the merged entity should have to open up access to its Frankfurt-based clearing house to rivals, to ensure greater competition in exchange-traded, or listed, derivatives.A new version of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, known as Mifid II, and unveiled earlier in October as part of Europe’s commitment to meeting G20 financial market reforms, challenges the silo by insisting that clearing houses allow “open access” to competitors’ exchanges.A related European proposal called “Mifir” would require that exchanges that own stock index businesses allow rival exchanges to license those indices so they can spin rival products off them. The Börse owns the Euro Stoxx index.Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James, says that the proposals are “a game-changing attempt to open up European futures competition”.Nasdaq OMX and the London Stock Exchange, both of which have ambitions to grow in derivatives, have lobbied in favour of Mifid. So have interdealer brokers such as Icap, which want as much choice in derivatives clearing as possible.Daniel Garrod, analyst at Barclays Capital, says that under Mifid and Mifir, “Deutsche Börse’s silo clearing model and control over indices faces the greatest threats [in the sector]”.The German and US groups argue that now is not the time to be considering disrupting a model in exchange-traded derivatives that could lead to fragmented derivatives markets, pointing to the unintended consequences of what some see as excessive fragmentation in the equities markets that has resulted since the original Mifod was enacted in 2007.Reto Francioni, the Börse’s chief executive, says: “We are convinced that the combination of our exchange groups will enhance transparency and strengthen regulators’ roles in Europe and the US …helping make markets less vulnerable to crisis situations.”The Börse and NYSE have also sought to persuade antitrust officials not to limit the definition of the derivatives market to Europe, arguing that the merged group would face stiff competition from the CME and that the derivatives markets are global, not regional.There would be a danger in Europe unilaterally forcing competition in listed derivatives, they argue, since this would leave the silo intact in the US, leaving Europe exposed without a champion in derivatives trading.And Börse officials point out that even the LSE is moving closer to a vertical model, with its attempt to take a controlling stake in London-based clearer LCH.Clearnet, even as the UK bourse makes the case against the existing silo structure.Some suggest that if Europe did force a change to the market structure to force more competition in listed derivatives, the US might end up following even though the US antitrust authorities in 2007 approved the takeover by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange of the Chicago Board of Trade. That created a near-monopoly in US futures trading, similar in scale to what would result from a combination of Eurex and Liffe in Europe.John Damgard, president of the Futures Industry Association, which represents banks and brokers in the futures markets, said: “I think if the Europeans go down that road there will be political pressure in the US to do the same, and it will be the exchanges’ responsibility to defend their vertical silo.”The FIA’s members have been behind repeated and ultimately failed attempts to take on the CME and CBOT by launching rival platforms, most recently by backing ELX, a small futures exchange that competes with the CME in eurodollar futures.Craig Donohue, chief executive of CME Group, said in an interview at the exchange group’s Global Financial Leadership Conference in Florida last week there was no appetite for change to the market structure for derivatives in the US. “We are continuing to see more and more exchanges moving to vertical silo models because they are more efficient. I think there’s ample evidence of that.”On Monday, the creation of a silo in Canadian markets moved a step closer after the board of TMX Group, operator of the Toronto and Montreal exchanges, accepted an offer from the Maple consortium of banks and pension funds to create an integrated exchange and clearing group.Mr Donohue added that in the Dodd-Frank act - which contains similar provisions on over-the-counter-derivatives reform to Mifid, Mifir and related proposals called the European Markets Infrastructure Regulation - the US Congress “made a conscious and clear decision to retain the existing structure for listed derivatives”.Mifid has yet to be finalised by the European Parliament and could yet be changed by lobbying. But as the German-US groups await the outcome of the antitrust probe, the future of the silo has never been more uncertain.Much will depend on whether Europe feels it can risk going it alone with a significant change to the structure for the futures markets. Niki Beattie, managing director of Market Structure Partners, a consultancy, believes Europe will make that move. “The Europeans are saying, in terms of market structure, we can lead the way on this”."
290;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-10-27T18:05:05Z;Technical glitch halts Australian trading;;Trading on the Australian Stock Exchange was halted for four hours on Thursday due to a technical glitch, leaving traders unable to react to news of a European agreement on Greek debt that was sparking rallies in other markets around Asia.The outage came just a few days before the ASX will face its first major competition, with alternative equities trading venue Chi-X due to begin operations in Australia on Monday.The exchange has yet to explain Thursday’s outage except to say it halted trading after it “detected a connectivity issue” shortly after opening.“It’s just interesting timing – or poor timing – with Chi-X launching next week,” said one trader in Australia. “The question everyone will be asking is if volumes would migrate to the alternate exchange” if a similar outage were to happen again.The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index rallied after reopening at 2pm Sydney time, closing 2.5 per cent higher.The bug is not the first ASX has faced this year. A technical issue also halted trading for over an hour on February 28.Traders and analysts say Thursday‘s problems might stem from the extent of the upgrades made recently to ASX’s trading systems.Under the looming spectre of Chi-X competition, the exchange has boosted its trading speeds and is launching new platforms and services, including a system for high frequency trading called PureMatch. In December it purchased a new trading system from Nasdaq OMX.“The more you upgrade, the more things tend to have problems. If you don’t touch something, it tends not to break,” said Gabe Butler, a director of global execution services at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The outage in February was also particularly frustrating, said Mr Butler, as it happened on a day that fund managers tracking a major MSCI Asia index had to rebalance their portfolios but were unable to buy or sell Australian equities.Traders said the outages underscored the importance of having alternate venues to the main exchange – although trading on a venue such as Chi-X would have been affected too because prices would still largely be set on the ASX.Derek Ovington, an analyst covering Asian exchanges with CLSA, the Asia-focused brokerage, noted that several other exchanges in the region have faced outages this year due to technical failures.“Often with new systems, once they’ve been introduced you find problems as you go along,” said Mr Ovington. “A couple of outages in a year is bad, but it’s not extraordinary.”The Hong Kong exchange halted some trading briefly in August after its website was hacked. Although the attack did not reach the market’s trading and clearing systems, several companies had been due to post their results to the exchange’s website, prompting the exchange to suspend trading in several stocks for fear some investors would be unable to access those results.
291;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-10-26T21:30:26Z;Nasdaq OMX looks for higher margins;Earnings rise meets expectations;Nasdaq OMX enjoyed a record earnings quarter as stock and options trading volumes rose sharply, but analysts said they were eager for the company to continue to diversify into higher-margin businesses.Nasdaq this week announced it was starting a new European derivatives market that will compete with the interest rate derivative markets run by Deutsche Borse and NYSE Euronext, which are in the process of agreeing a merger.The move comes as European regulators are reviewing the competitive implications of the DB-NYSE merger, as well as European market structures more broadly, and are considering requirements that all clearing houses must be open, or “interoperable”, to third parties.“Clearly there will be opportunities, and interoperability will accelerate those opportunities,” Robert Greifeld, chief executive, told the Financial Times. He noted that Europe’s regulatory review, known as Mifid II, “is long way from being settled law, [but] we clearly think there’s progress in the document”.Mr Greifeld added that plans for the new market were in the early stages, but that interest rate swaps and repos priced in Nordic currencies were “definitely on the table”.Nasdaq’s earnings per share grew 34 per cent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year, to 67 cents a share, meeting expectations. Cash net income was $121m, up from $101m a year ago.The comparison was eased by Nasdaq’s repurchase of 11 per cent of shares outstanding since last year, Ed Ditmire, analyst at Macquarie, said in a note.The weight of Nasdaq’s business continued to shift away from stock trading. Revenues from cash equities trading rose 6 per cent from a year ago to $67m, even as the volume of US trades it matched rose 16 per cent amid a surge in volatility over the summer that saw the US’s sovereign credit rating downgraded. But Nasdaq said the higher volumes meant that some customers received larger discounts.Meanwhile, revenues from derivatives, particularly US options, were much stronger. Nasdaq said that its US options markets, which include the PHLX and Nasdaq Options Market, had a record of 312m contracts traded in the third quarter, as traders scrambled to hedge risks. Derivatives turnover was $84m versus $60m a year ago.“News that Nasdaq is launching a euro derivatives market is probably the bigger non-earnings news, and should be a positive for this low-multiple company saddled with an equity-centric low-growth reputation,” said Mr Ditmire.Nasdaq, like its rival NYSE Euronext, also continues to generate a greater share of its business in non-trading businesses. Market technology sales were 11 per cent of Nasdaq’s revenues at $46m in the third quarter, up 21 per cent versus a year ago.That included a deal with Brazil’s largest exchange, BM&FBovespa, to provide market surveillance technology, using software it acquired in its deal for Australia’s SMARTS Technology last year. Access services, which includes revenues from its acquisition of FTEN last year, saw revenues of $60m, up 33 per cent from FTEN’s revenues a year ago.“We have had a focus on redefining our market,” said Mr Greifeld. “We’re happy to have that level of progress with it. We really hit on all cylinders.”Nasdaq’s shares were closed down 0.6 per cent at $24.31 on Wednesday. It has strongly outperformed the KBW Capital Markets index, which is down 25 per cent so far in 2011.
292;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-10-25T21:26:06Z;Nasdaq plans European derivatives platform;;Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator, is planning to set up a European derivatives trading platform based in London in a bid to compete against Deutsche Börse, NYSE Euronext and the London Stock Exchange, three people familiar with the matter said.The move comes as the proposed combination of Deutsche Börse with NYSE Euronext, a bid by the LSE for LCH.Clearnet, the UK clearing house, and a raft of new European market regulations have thrown the exchange landscape into a state of flux.It also marks another attempt by Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, to establish a trading presence in London since the closure last year of a European share trading platform, Nasdaq OMX Europe, after it failed to gain market share.The latest venture would offer trading in interest rate derivatives similar to existing contracts offered on NYSE Liffe, the futures arm of NYSE Euronext.The contracts would be cleared through LCH.Clearnet, the London-based clearing house that is in exclusive negotiations with the LSE over a possible acquisition by the British bourse.The new Nasdaq derivatives platform would use an existing licence acquired by Nasdaq OMX Europe when it was originally established as a “multilateral trading facility” (MTF).Nasdaq OMX had been in talks with other unnamed parties about being a minority partner in any takeover of LCH.Clearnet, but has since withdrawn.Mr Greifeld said at the time that his interest in LCH.Clearnet was driven by a desire to help preserve the “horizontal” model in the clearing business, where clearing houses that are not owned by an exchange are free to offer services to any trading platform.LCH.Clearnet is owned by 98 shareholders, mostly market participants.All other large clearing houses in Europe are owned by exchanges in an integrated model known as a “vertical silo”.A battle is raging between proponents of the horizontal clearing model, including Nasdaq, and defenders of the silo – including Deutsche Börse, which owns its own clearing house.Nasdaq and others argue that the Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext combination should not be allowed to proceed because the silo makes it hard for competitors to challenge them in their own derivatives products, since trading and clearing of them are locked into a single structure.Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext dismiss such concerns and are expected to address European antitrust authorities’ concerns over their proposed transaction at a hearing in Brussels on Thursday.Eric Noll, executive vice-president in charge of Nasdaq’s equities and options markets, declined to comment on the derivatives platform.However, he told the Financial Times: “We’re looking at multiple opportunities, not just in Europe but on a global basis, that emphasise the advantages of horizontal clearing models and represent competition in markets where it appears that competition is decreasing.”A key feature of the Nasdaq plan is that traders of interest rate derivatives using the new platform who are also trading and clearing over-the-counter interest rate swaps would not have to post as much collateral, or insurance against their trades failing, at LCH.Clearnet since the two types of derivatives would be considered “economically equivalent”.Any Nasdaq derivatives plan would need the support of banks that deal in derivatives. It is not clear whether Nasdaq yet has that support.
293;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-10-21T17:28:53Z;Nasdaq OMX in deal with Chile’s BEC;;Nasdaq OMX will explore creating a Chilean peso-dollar derivatives contract after striking a deal with the Bolsa Electronica de Chile (BEC) to provide technology and advisory services to the Latin American exchange.Nasdaq OMX will advise BEC on the cross-listing of shares, aid the development of new indices and consider ways to create a peso-dollar futures contract for trading on Nasdaq OMX exchanges. BEC will also upgrade its trading platform to Nasdaq technology.The technology agreement marks another notch for Nasdaq OMX as it looks to diversify its business beyond matching equities. However, it has been thwarted in plans for expansion in other areas of the business this year after bids for the New York Stock Exchange and a stake in LCH.Clearnet, the London-based clearing house, both foundered.Robert Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, has played down further acquisition talk and targeted organic growth. The BEC deal comes only weeks after Nasdaq struck a deal with BM&FBovespa to provide trade-monitoring technology to Latin America’s biggest market.Founded more than 20 years ago by a group of banks and broker-dealers, the BEC has more than 40 shareholders and competes for domestic supremacy with the Santiago Stock Exchange.Nasdaq OMX will provide advice as the futures contract is submitted for approval by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The transatlantic exchanges operator has 12 currency derivatives including dollar-euro and dollar-yen contracts, that are traded via its futures exchange, which was formerly the Philadelphia Board of Trade.“Our alliance with Nasdaq OMX will support areas of BEC strategic development like technology implementation and partnerships for new products,” said Fernando Canas, president of BEC.The BEC is expected to move across to Inet, the backbone for Nasdaq’s trading technology and commonly used across the group’s US and European markets and has latency – the time it takes for a trade to be sent, matched and acknowledged – of less than 100 microseconds.Nasdaq provides infrastructure to 70 exchanges globally and battles with NYSE Euronext to provide software and services to as many of the world’s exchanges as possible.Nasdaq OMX also expects to make a renewed push into European markets next year. Bjørn Sibbern, European head of Nordic equities and chief executive Nasdaq OMX Copenhagen, told the Financial Times earlier this week that the group also wanted to build its market share in cash and derivatives markets in Europe.“We want to have a stronger market presence in Europe. We will focus on expanding and increasing our piece of pie. We are keen on Norway. We have to see what we can do outside. We’re looking at different places to, but it’s too early to say more,” he said on the sidelines of the Marketforce-IEA European Exchanges Summit.
294;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-10-20T11:45:23Z;Quick View: The end of an MTF era;Jeremy Grant on the UK’s provisional clearance of the BATS takeover of Chi-X;With exquisite timing, the European Commission produced its massive “Mifid II” proposals on Thursday morning.A central thrust of the whole thing is tackling the monster that was created by Mifid I, namely the excessive (depending on your view) fragmentation of share trading that has resulted since the directive was enacted in 2007.Just as the Mifid document landed in people’s email inboxes, another email was coming in from the UK Competition Commission giving provisional approval to the takeover of Chi-X Europe by BATS Global Markets.The effect of the combination will be to “re-aggregate” the market share of the two largest European “multilateral trading facilities” (MTFs) that owe their very existence to the competitive forces unleashed by Mifid in the first place.In other words the deal will, at a stroke, tackle some of the fragmentation that has so worried Brussels. Ironically, it is the very businesses that owe their existence to Mifid I are now turning the clock back to a time when share trading was more concentrated.Of course the BATS/Chi-X deal – if ultimately approved – does not tackle fragmentation by itself. There are still countless “dark pools” and other ways to trade shares.But was the Office of Fair Trading Right to refer the deal to the Commission in the first place?The move certainly came as a surprise, since the combination was on nowhere near the scale as the proposed Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext deal.And on the central question of whether a combined BATS/Chi-X would reduce competition, it would still be competing with other MTFs, namely Turquoise and Quote MTF and indeed the bank-owned MTFs that UBS and Goldman Sachs now run.That doesn’t, in my view, keep BATS/Chi-X honest on fees by itself. Turquoise and Quote MTF would be a distant second and third behind a BATS/Chi-X.The Commission’s view is that it would be easy for shareholders in the combination to keep the entity honest. They could simply peel off and set up a new MTF of their own.This is what Getco, the large US-based market making firm, argued to the Commission. So did the London Stock Exchange.But let’s not forget motivations here. Getco is a shareholder in both BATS and Chi-X and would benefit from a merger since it would create a more powerful and liquid equities trading platform, more able to attract business without the distraction of competing with each other. There are also big advantages to doing a deal like this at a time when “interoperability” on the clearing side is also driving consolidation and, one presumes, “efficiencies” all the way from trading to post-trade. Getco's mantra is about facilitating more efficient markets. And BATS and Chi-X are of course at the vanguard of that process, with EuroCCP, the clearer.As for the LSE, the BATS/Chi-X combo is not especially welcome, since it creates a stronger competitor in UK blue chips. The LSE’s share in FTSE 100 stocks has started to dip below the symbolically significant 50 per cent level at the hands of BATS Europe and Chi-X Europe. A combination of the two, with a faster trading platform (the BATS system will replace Chi-X’s technology) will only make life harder for the LSE.But for the LSE, a BATS/Chi-X merger is infinitely preferable to Chi-X falling into the hands of Nasdaq OMX. So the LSE swung behind the proposal early on. Worth remembering that Nasdaq lost out to BATS in the bidding for Chi-X last year.I am not so sure it would be that easy for BATS/Chi-X shareholders simply to “credibly threaten to sponsor a new competitor”, in the words of the Commission, if they felt merged entity was not behaving.If Mifid II shows us anything, it is that regulators regret allowing so many trading platforms to proliferate. I don’t see regulators giving the green light so easily to many more - even any more – MTFs in the future. If there is one message coming from Mifid II, it is: “Enough already with these platforms”.And when we talk about regulators approving MTFs, we need to realise that the days are also gone where it was the UK’s Financial Services Authority that did all the approving of MTFs (since they are all, bar a few tiny ones like Burgundy, based in London).Anyone wanting to set up new trading platforms will have to reckon with the powerful new pan-European regulator in Paris, the European Securities Markets Authority (Esma). If I were to bet, Esma will not be handing out MTF licences like confetti as the FSA did in the last five years. Especially given concerns that have been bubbling up over how you spot market abuse in French stocks on a pan-European platform whose primary regulator is in the UK.
295;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-10-12T21:29:37Z;NYSE plans ‘dark orders’ for retail customers;Exchange asks SEC to change trading rules;NYSE Euronext has launched a new programme in the US aimed at taking back market share from dark pools, challenging the Securities and Exchange Commission to revisit its rules.The New York Stock Exchange has filed a request with the US regulator to offer so-called “dark orders” exclusively to retail customers. NYSE’s retail liquidity programme would allow brokers representing small-time investors to receive prices that were at least $0.002 better than the current market price.The exchange would also create a class of traders who would pay a fee but also receive incentives for filling such orders only for retail customers, called Retail Liquidity Providers, or RLPs.This structure, though not currently allowed under SEC rules for public exchanges, replicates what happens in so-called “dark pools”, where prices are not displayed and owners of the pools are allowed to discriminate for or against certain types of orders.“It remains to be seen if the SEC will approve this,” said Joe Mecane, chief administrative officer for US markets at NYSE Euronext. “But it helps to move the market structure conversation forward and helps to further level the playing field between different types of venues.”Banks such as Citigroup have developed venues that prioritise retail orders, while Credit Suisse has a venue that excludes high-frequency traders. Dark pools have in recent years been stealing market share from exchanges, with about 30 per cent of all US stock trades now taking place outside of exchanges such as the NYSE and Nasdaq.“It’s a big deal that a major exchange is trying to offer an alternative to the off-exchange payment for order flow market,” said Justin Schack, analyst at Rosenblatt Securities.While exchanges are allowed to use dark or “hidden” orders, they cannot offer them only to certain customers. Collectively, dark pools traded about 11.3 per cent of US equity volumes in August, according to Rosenblatt Securities, while exchanges’ dark orders were 3.9 per cent of US flows.A large portion off-exchange trades, are said to have come from retail trading. Rosenblatt estimates that about 10 to 15 per cent of all trading is retail flow internalised by wholesale market makers, a group that includes Knight Capital, Citadel, UBS and Citigroup.Retail flow is prised because most trades by small investors are made with long-term price shifts in mind, while many professional traders – including high-frequency groups – profit from price moves on scales as short as a millisecond.The NYSE will designate “retail member organisations” when member brokers attest that their orders came from retail or from another non-member handling retail trades, according to NYSE’s filing.Bringing back more retail flow would also enable NYSE to capture more high-frequency trading, said Mr Mecane. “I think it will get some traction and it will fit well into the ecosystem. It won’t move massive flow but we’ll become a part of the fabric,” he said. “We want to aggregate as diverse a pool as possible.”The SEC will likely take a close look at the proposal. The agency has been debating whether or not dark pools and sub-penny price increments are good for markets and liquidity, a process it began in 2009.The regulator has also raised the possibility of a rule that would require greater price improvements to discourage off-exchange trading, but other issues, such as the “flash crash” and the Dodd-Frank reforms, have taken up the bulk of the agency’s resources.Some high-frequency market makers may oppose the proposal. While sub-penny price trade executions are allowed under current rules, no trader can submit quotes at sub-penny increments.“Market-makers are trying to attract order flow by being fast and having the best price. They would have to compete with the NYSE’s price,” said Bernard Donefer, professor at Baruch College.
296;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-10-12T16:49:50Z;Emerging market bourses in Brics deal;;"Six of the world’s largest emerging markets exchanges on Wednesday unveiled an alliance in an unprecedented arrangement that aims to capture investor interest in leading emerging markets in each other’s markets at a time when exchanges globally have been consolidating.Under the alliance Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, BM&FBovespa of Brazil, the National Stock Exchange of India, the Bombay Stock Exchange, Johannesburg Stock Exchange and the two Russian exchanges that are in the process of merging – Micex and RTS – will cross-list each other’s stock index futures and index options contracts. They will be listed on each exchange in the local currency of each exchange, the exchanges said at the annual meeting of the World Federation of Exchanges in South Africa.The arrangement means that, for example, a Brazilian investor would be able to buy or sell a Hang Seng index futures contract – currently only available on HKEx – and denominated in the Real currency, on the BM&FBovespa exchange.The six bourses will also work towards devising a “Brics” index that traders could use to gain broad exposure to emerging market indices.The development is a sign that exchanges in the Brics countries see an opportunity to expand globally at a time when their older rivals in the US and Europe are battling pressure on profit margins from competition in cash equities trading from other platforms and “dark pools”. Edemir Pinto, chief executive of BM&FBovespa said the growth of trading on emerging market exchanges was “exactly the opposite of the developed market exchanges”.Last year the volume of futures traded on exchanges in Asia exceeded that in North America for the first time, according to the Futures Industry Association.Ronald Arculli, chairman of HKEx and of the WFE, said: “The alliance enables more investors to gain exposure to the emerging economies of the Brics group whose economic power is on the rise. From a global perspective [it] highlights the growing significance of the Brics economies and financial markets for the coming decade, and further underlines the importance of enhancing co-operation between the Brics members.”The idea for the alliance was devised by HKEx, which first approached the other exchanges in June. Romnesh Lamba, head of the market development division at HKEx, said: “From a revenue and investor perspective, we don’t expect there will be cannibalisation of each others’ markets.”The arrangement is also a sign that some exchanges believe that forging alliances is a more effective way to grow their business after the failure of a series of big-ticket mergers. Singapore’s SGX exchange was earlier this year blocked by Canberra in its attempt to take over ASX, the Australian exchange; the London Stock Exchange abandoned an attempted merger with TMX Group; while a joint attempt by Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange to break up the planned combination of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext was scuppered by US antitrust regulators.CME Group has been forging similar alliances involving cross-listing and distribution of its products with BM&FBovespa, the BMV exchange in Mexico, the JSE and Osaka Securities Exchange. Eurex, the futures arm of the Börse, last year started offering futures contracts based on the Korean exchange’s Kospi stock index.Asked what effect CME’s alliances would have on the new emerging market alliance, Mr Pinto said: “Our agreement with CME does not conflict in any way with what we are doing here.”The first stage of the project will lead to the exchanges beginning cross-listing of financial derivatives on their benchmark equity indices by June 2012.Charles Li, HKEx chief executive, said: “At the beginning it’s not necessarily going to be a ‘big bang’ for any of us but over time we’re very confident that this will bring a lot of interest and we may be able to create a new asset class.”"
297;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-10-04T16:12:22Z;Nasdaq OMX Nordic to offer clearing choice;Exchange operator falls into line with rivals;Nasdaq OMX Nordic is to fall into line with rivals in offering their customers a choice over where their trades are cleared from the end of April as regulatory blessings reshape the European clearing landscape.Freeing up access to other clearing houses, known as “interoperability”, will allow market participants to net and cross-margin trades between venues, thus cutting costs. Traders have hitherto had little choice over where their trades were cleared and critics have argued that the proliferation of more than 20 clearing houses in Europe has tied up capital in collateral for backing trades.The announcement by the exchange operator, the largest in the Scandinavian region, leaves Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext as the only main European trading platforms which do not offer their customers some form of interoperability. However, the issue is one of the key areas under scrutiny by European regulators as they examine the potential effects to the merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse, which would create the region’s largest exchange.Central to the deal is the creation of a so-called “vertical silo” offering dealers just one choice of clearing house for trades. A clearing house – also known as central counterparties (CCPs) – stands between two parties, guaranteeing that a trade is completed even if one party defaults.Although Europe’s clearing houses had committed to implementing interoperability, it had been delayed as regulators sought to ensure, post-financial crisis, that new clearing arrangements would not lead to a potential systemic risk.However European regulators have steadily been giving their blessing to arrangements proposed by various trading platforms in recent months, including BATS Global Markets, Chi-X Europe, Turquoise and UBS MTF. The London Stock Exchange offers interoperability between LCH.Clearnet and x-clear but is also in exclusive talks to buy LCH.Clearnet.Nasdaq OMX Nordic will offer customers a choice of European Multilateral Clearing Facility, the Dutch clearing house in which Nasdaq OMX has a 22 per cent stake, EuroCCP and SIX x-clear of Switzerland.Hans-Ole Jochumsen, president of Nasdaq OMX Nordic, said the group was eager to move forward. “We are confident that a competitive CCP model will act to drive liquidity and lower investor costs, thus benefiting our clients and the European capital market as a whole.”“A solution with a truly competitive choice of clearers will increase the attractiveness of the Nordic equities market and result in liquidity and cross netting advantages that will benefit our members,” Petri Simberg, Chairman of the Nordic Securities Association, said.
298;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-10-02T21:58:11Z;Europe warned on reform of derivatives;;The biggest users of derivatives, including banks and asset managers, have warned the European Commission that imminent reform of derivatives markets risks “embedding lack of choice” and call for the business of clearing to be opened up to competition.The call, in a letter to Michel Barnier, EU commissioner for the internal market, marks a ratcheting up of efforts to challenge the status quo in the clearing of derivatives, in particular exchange ownership of clearing houses in an integrated “vertical silo”.“We consider that choice and efficiency in clearing services in the EU may diminish dramatically if the current trend towards concentration in the provision of clearing (and trading) services continues,” said the letter, signed by the British Bankers Association, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, all of which represent banks.It was also signed by the Investment Management Association, which represents UK pension fund and asset managers, the European Fund and Asset Management Association, the Association of Corporate Treasurers and its European sister association.Exchanges that operate silos – which include Deutsche Börse, CME Group and IntercontinentalExchange in the US - have come under fire from rivals that do not – such as the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq OMX – claiming such structures impede the ability of others to compete.Deutsche Börse and CME argue that ownership of clearing allows savings for traders and that rivals are free to compete if they can come up with viable products.Clearing has been a source of friction over the years between exchanges that own their own clearers and the banks that are big customers of them.But it is coming to a head as a wave of EU financial regulations are set to create new market structures for over-the-counter derivatives, with clearing of them a key requirement of wider G20 reforms.Clearing is a key feature of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir) which requires that many OTC derivatives be cleared to help safeguard the system against the effect of a big default.It is also central to a probe by Brussels antitrust authorities into the proposed combination of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse. That would not only combine the group’s respective futures platforms, Liffe and Eurex, but would also strengthen the Börse’s clearing house, Eurex Clearing, as it would act as clearer for the combined platforms.The LSE, Nasdaq and many banks argue that access to clearing houses should be made easier and that silos should accept for clearing contracts from any trading venue. They also say this should apply to existing exchange-traded derivatives, not merely to OTC derivatives that are set to be cleared as part of the Emir reforms and its equivalent in the US, the Dodd-Frank act.“Specifically we believe that Emir contains insufficient safeguards in this respect. A fundamental shortcoming in the text is that such safeguards as exist are not applied across all financial instruments but only to a limited set of OTC derivatives,” the associations said.“Such open access requirements should ensure that a clearing house must accept instruments for clearing regardless of the venue on which they are traded, and that a venue must provide data feeds and other assistance to any clearing house that wants to clear the instrument in question.“We are concerned that the forthcoming European Markets and Infrastructure Regulation does not take proper account of the likely concentration of clearing provision. It may thus inadvertently, through legislation, embed lack of choice in European financial markets.”
299;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-09-29T22:43:04Z;CBOE acquires National Stock Exchange;;The CBOE Stock Exchange has acquired the National Stock Exchange, consolidating two of the US’s remaining independent stock markets.Though the number of exchanges in the US has been on a steady decline over the last 20 years, as regional exchanges shuttered or converted to electronic markets, only to be bought by larger competitors like NYSE Euronext or Nasdaq OMX, the advent of the national market system has given a role to small exchanges.As volumes have fallen over the past three years, stock exchanges now often compete on the basis of pricing schemes to attract new types of trades, such as high-frequency strategies that make money by taking advantage of rebates offered by exchanges to place or execute against orders on their market.Exchanges globally have been in a rush to merge to gain scale and competitive advantage, though many of those mergers – such as the Nasdaq’s bid for NYSE – have been blocked by regulators and antitrust authorities.The CBSX, which is co-owned by the Chicago Board Options Exchange and a group of nine-market making firms, including Cowen and Interactive Brokers, was founded five years ago to cater to floor options traders who wanted to also trade stocks. But the exchange has since moved from Chicago to the Equinix servers in New Jersey.It now caters to brokers and trading firms that take advantage of high rebate fees or use its relatively shallow order book to quickly rise to the top of the trading queue, said David Harris, chief executive. CBSX earlier this week announced a new pricing scheme, raising the rebate it paid to traders who executed against orders.The NSX was formerly the regional Cincinnati Stock Exchange, which was founded in 1885. It became an all-electronic exchange in 1980 and moved to Chicago and changed its name in 2003.Its primary business is printing and displaying trades executed by broker-owned platforms, such as Citigroup’s Lavaflow and Credit Suisse’s Light Pool, that are not regulated exchanges, so that they can meet requirements to trade at the national best bid and offer.Mr Harris said the merger gives the CBSX its own exchange license – previously it traded under the CBOE’s license – and two markets that use different pricing, a strategy that has aided the development of new independent exchanges, such as Direct Edge and BATS Global Markets. Nasdaq also cited a similar strategy when it presented its proposed merger with NYSE.The move allows CBSX to operate independently of CBOE, adding to its value, Mr Harris said. It also gives the CBSX access to NSX’s broker-dealer, which will allow it to route trades to any market.“We are in a real transition. It’s like we’re starting over,” he said. “We want to be focused on serving customers rather than generating volume. We would be responsive to anybody who has a market structure problem to solve.”Together, the two markets will execute less than 1 per cent of total US market volume, though Mr Harris said the CBSX was profitable last year and can continue to do so with little volume.The terms of the transaction between the two private companies were not disclosed.Though the CBSX operates in the same data centre as CBOE’s electronic options exchange, C2, the two exchanges do not operate together. A spokesperson for CBOE said the merger would not affect its own business.The only remaining independent regional exchange is now the Chicago Stock Exchange. Over the past two years Nasdaq OMX acquired the other remaining regionals, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and the Boston Stock Exchange.Other regional exchanges have long since become part of global groups, such as the Pacific Exchange, a roll-up of the San Francisco and Los Angeles exchanges. It merged with electronic platform Archipelago in 2005, then with the New York Stock Exchange.

Although revenue only increased moderately, a higher return on capital allowed the company to boost profitability.Semi stocks have suffered all summer, as data showed companies carrying large inventories, and declining sales of end products, such as personal computers.Citigroup analyst Jim Suva wrote in a client note that “competitors will struggle to match [Jabil’s] results.”and investors appeared to agree with the Philadelphia semiconductor index closing down 2.9 per cent.The wider Wall Street rally evaporated, as hopes of a European deal on sovereign debt again hit a snag, with the European Commission reportedly wading into the argument about whether private banks should take a bigger hit on Greek bonds.The S&P 500 fell 2.1 per cent to 1,151.06, shedding half of its gains from Monday and Tuesday’s rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.6 per cent to 11,010.90, and the Nasdaq Composite index was down 2.2 per cent to 2,491.58.Management consultancy Accenture reported earnings per share of 71 cents for the quarter ended August 31, 2 cents higher than expected, despite falling revenue from its financial and European arms.Shares were up 0.3 per cent to $55.83.But David Koning, analyst at Robert W Baird, warned the recent appreciation in the dollar meant the company could incur foreign exchange losses in 2012.“Further appreciation [of the dollar] could negatively impact revenue and earnings per share,” he added.Materials and energy stocks were hammered on renewed fears for global growth.Amazon shares were up 2.4 per cent to $229.50, after the company unveiled a tablet to compete with Apple’s Ipad.Coal miners Alpha Natural Resources, down 11 per cent to $18.92, and Peabody Energy, off 8 per cent to $35.73, were particularly hard hit.John Bridges, JP Morgan’s coal analyst, said US coal miners faced a dual challenge of a falling metallurgical coal price, and a return to production in Australia, after flooding earlier this year.“When the floods knocked out Aussie production, the Appalachian miners were able to squeeze more of their coal into the higher priced met market. Now they may try and sell this material into the thermal market, and the gap between the two prices is huge,” he said.Cliffs Natural Resources,was off 8.4 per cent to $55.66 after the company announced it would take a $30m hit to earnings, after deciding to idle production at a biomass production facility in Michigan, which has also been put up for sale.Solar panel manufacturer First Solar was down 10.4 per cent to $64.75. Most First Solar revenue comes from Europe, where the weak financial sector is making it difficult for the company to raise finance for new projects.Chesapeake Energy fell 1.4 per cent to $27.27, even after the company reported successful exploratory drilling in its Utica shale field in eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania. The field could yield oil and ethylene, which fetch higher prices than natural gas.All five exchange stocks in the S&P 500 fell after José Manuel Barroso, the President of the European Commission, declared his support for a financial transaction tax in Europe, which could hit on-exchange trading.The New York Stock Exchange fell furthest, down 6.3 per cent to $24.01. According to UBS analyst Alex Kramm, the NYSE is the most exposed to Europe of the US exchanges. The planned merger with Germany’s Deutsche Börse, which fell 4.6 per cent on the news, also weighed on NYSE.The CME Group, fell 3 per cent to $254.32, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange also fell 3 per cent to $26.35, although the US derivatives exchanges are not significantly exposed to Europe.Nasdaq OMX, whose Nordic cash and derivatives business represents 6 to 7 per cent of revenue, was down 4.3 per cent to $23.99. Mr Kramm said a 30 per cent hit to revenue from the Nordic business would reduce his guidance for Nasdaq’s 2012 earnings per share from $2.83 to $2.58.Intercontinental Exchange fell 2.1 per cent to $121.42. Its European businesses are based in London, which may escape a transaction tax.Family Dollar was off 1.6 per cent to $53.31, despite reporting earnings per share of 66 cents on sales of $2.1bn for the quarter ended August 31, a record for the company.Good results were already priced into the stock, which is one of a handful in the S&P 500 whose share price has risen since market volatility began on July 25.
301;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-09-26T20:58:27Z;Casino stocks hit by fears of Asian slowdown;;Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands slid to their fifth consecutive sessions of losses, and Melco Crown Entertainment its fourth in five, as investors fretted that a potential slowdown in the Chinese economy might effect their casino operations in Macau.“There seems to be an awful lot of concern that a slowdown in the Asian economies will reduce the funding that’s available for the corporate junket business, which is really the engine of these businesses’ growth in Macau,” said David Katz, an analyst at Jefferies.Wynn depended on its Macau operation for about a third of revenue, LVS for more than 40 per cent, and Melco for almost its entire business, Mr Katz said. All three operators are now down more than 10 per cent since last Tuesday, significantly underperforming the broad S&P 500.On Monday Wynn was down 1.4 per cent to $136.78, off more than 10 per cent since last Tuesday. LVS fell 1.6 per cent to $43.69, down 11.2 per cent over the five days. Melco fell 3.3 per cent to $9.85 and is off almost 17 per cent since Tuesday.But most analysts said company data did not suggest a slowdown was imminent. Carlo Santarelli, gaming analyst at Deutsche Banks said, “I’m not seeing anything fundamental out of Macau to make me believe there is anything changing in the VIP. I think the share price moves are more reflective of general macro fears in the equity markets.”Elsewhere, the S&P 500 bounced a healthy 2.3 per cent to 1,162.95, to snap a five day slump, driven by a strong rally in bank stocks.Financials in the S&P 500 rose 4.4 per cent, significantly more than any other sector. Citigroup jumped 7 per cent to $26.72 and JPMorgan was also up 7 per cent to $31.65. Bank of America also outperformed the sector, up 4.6 per cent to $6.60, as crisis meetings involving European and American officials once again raised hopes of a solution to the eurozone crisis, which has battered bank stocks.Gains for big banks pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 2.5 per cent to 11,043.86, but the Nasdaq Composite index, which has a lower weighting of financials, and whose bank stocks tend to be small domestic lenders, lagged behind, up only 1.4 per cent to 2,516.69.Consol Energy was the best performer in the S&P 500, gaining 9 per cent to $37.17, after announcing the $193m sale of royalties on a Marcellus Shale field in Pennsylvania and West Virginia to Antero Corporation.Berkshire Hathaway shares rose 8.1 per cent to $108,449, after Warren Buffett’s company announced it would use some of its $48bn cash hoard to repurchase shares. The buy-back programme allows for unlimited purchases as long as the stock is trading at a premium of less than 10 per cent of book value, and the company’s cash pile remains above $20bn.Netflix was up 2.2 per cent to $132.22, despite reports of a deal with DreamWorks Animation to stream the studio’s content. Netflix’s share price has fallen by more than 50 per cent in recent weeks after it broke off negotiations to renew a content contract with the Stars cable network, and a move to separate its streaming and DVD delivery business lost it up to 1m subscribers.Expedia, the online travel company, jumped 4.7 per cent to $28.44 after Piper Jaffray analysts upgraded the stock to “buy”, arguing international bookings could account for 50 per cent of revenue by 2013.Clorox Company, the cleaning products manufacturer, was the biggest faller in the S&P 500, down 4.3 per cent to $66.44, after investor Carl Icahn withdrew his nominees to the board of directors, citing shareholder resistance to his attempted buy-out of the company. Clorox had been up almost 10 per cent for the year before Monday on expectations of a takeover.With the S&P 500 down 17 per cent from its April 29 peak at the start of the day, most analysts notes on Monday were discussing the probability of a bear market and how to position for it.Adam Parker, Morgan Stanley’s US equity strategist, said the high correlation among sectors in the S&P 500 leaves few obvious defensive plays. Less than a quarter of healthcare stocks and only half of consumer staple stocks have a correlation to the index of less than 0.9. The 80 per cent of utility stocks, which are exhibiting low correlation to the S&P 500, may be the best bet for investors expecting the market to enter bear territory.But, Mr Parker warned “low beta stocks have seen a recent increase in trading volume relative to high beta stocks”, which has driven up prices, so investors would have to pay a price to buy into defensive stocks.Two less intuitive candidates for defensive plays are exchanges and brokers. Exchanges have seen trading volumes spike during recent market volatility, which has increased revenue. Several analysts have recommended buying into the sector, and Nasdaq OMX, CME Group and Intercontinental­Exchange have all outperformed the S&P 500 since July 25.On the day, Nasdaq OMX was 0.3 per cent higher at $24.47, CME Group had gained 0.7 per cent to $259.83 and Intercontinental­Exchange had risen 0.4 per cent to $122.58.But Alex Kramm at UBS, who has “buy” ratings on all three names, said: “We still think there’s value in exchanges as a defensive play within financials.”The New York Stock Exchange is down 29 per cent since July 25, almost twice the fall in the S&P 500, although it has largely moved in tandem with potential merger partner Deutsche Börse, so has suffered from falls in European markets.Despite NYSE’s underperformance, “I’d hesitate to pick it as a favourite given uncertainty around the merger”, said Mr Kramm.Brokers have also benefited from a sharp rise in trading volumes. In a note last week Brad Hintz at Bernstein Research said Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade and LPL Investment Holding, all of which have significantly underperformed their indices, had “relative near-term opportunities” from elevated trading volume.But on Monday he revised down earnings per share estimates for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, arguing that the impact of depressed IPO and M&A activity on investment bank earnings would outbalance any sharp rise in revenue from their brokerage businesses. He predicted Goldman Sachs would deliver a 20 cent loss per share in the third quarter.
302;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-09-25T23:19:34Z;LCH poised to choose between rival bids;SGX interested in  joining one offer;The battle for control of LCH.Clearnet, London’s biggest clearing house, is expected to move closer to resolution today as the clearer’s board meets to decide between rival bids from the London Stock Exchange and Markit, a financial data and derivatives post-trade company.The development comes as the UK clearer has attracted interest from other parties interested in teaming up with the existing two bidders.SGX, the Singapore exchange, was interested in joining one of the bids, two people familiar with the matter said. NYSE Euronext had teamed up with Markit initially but withdrew recently and has been replaced by Nasdaq OMX, which in June expressed interest in a minority stake. SGX was not immediately available for comment.The bids come as London’s key market infrastructures have been thrown into flux as Brussels regulators finalise sweeping reform of derivatives and equities markets. It also comes as exchanges have been swept up in a wave of consolidation.Both developments have turned clearing houses into prized assets, with LCH.Clearnet – the largest clearer left that is not owned by an exchange – as a key target. It has 98 shareholders, mostly market participants such as banks but also exchanges including NYSE Euronext and the London Metal Exchange.A clearing house stands between two parties to a trade, guaranteeing that a transaction is completed if one side defaults. A push by G20 regulators to force more OTC, or off-exchange, derivatives through clearing is set to benefit clearers such as LCH.Clearnet.The LSE has tabled a €21 a share bid for 51 per cent of LCH.Clearnet, valuing it at €1bn (£873m). Markit has offered €15 a share for the whole company.The UK bourse wants LCH.Clearnet to acquire its own UK-based clearing business, which it lacks at a time when exchange ownership of clearing houses has been a growing trend.The trend has been reinforced by the prospect of a combined Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, which would dwarf the LSE.However, banks were nervous about the power of such combinations to raise clearing fees and the LSE’s bid included a cap on fees at LCH.Clearnet for a period, a third person said.For Markit, the attraction of LCH.Clearnet lies in its Swapclear interest rate swaps clearing service, which it runs in conjunction with the largest banks dealing in OTC derivatives. Such banks were also shareholders in Markit, making the businesses a good fit, according to analysts.LCH.Clearnet is also clearer for the London Metal Exchange, which on Friday said it had received expressions of interest from unnamed bidders.A fourth person said that bidders included CME Group, SGX and ICE.
303;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-09-20T23:14:20Z;Nasdaq sued over swaps trade pricing;;Nasdaq’s effort at expanding into the business of clearing interest rate swaps has run into resistance, with one of its customers filing a lawsuit, accusing it of inaccurate pricing.Jefferies, an investment bank, filed suit against the International Derivatives Clearing Group, a majority-owned subsidiary of Nasdaq OMX, alleging fraudulent inducement, breach of contract and other misconduct.The dispute arises from $180m in swap trades Jefferies made with DRW Trading Group. Jefferies said that to clear the trades, IDGC converted them into what it claimed were “economically equivalent” futures positions. Jefferies alleges that in doing so, IDGC failed accurately to price the swaps.Nasdaq said: “IDCG and its clearing house acted in full accordance with its rules, the relevant contract specifications and the agreements that Jefferies signed.”Nasdaq added that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, IDGC’s regulator, has stated in writing to Jefferies that there were ”no grounds” to conclude that IDCG violated its rules or contract specifications. “Therefore, the suit is without merit, and we will vigorously defend against it,” the exchange group said.The CFTC confirmed that it had written to Jefferies.The clearing of over-the-counter derivatives has become a focus of regulators since the financial crisis. The business is dominated by LCH.Clearnet, with the CME Group and others trying to gain share.IDCG has been trying to clear interest rate swaps since December 2008 after it was granted a Derivatives Clearing Organisation designation from the CFTC. IDCG, however, only secured a handful of members for its clearing house, such as MF Global, BNY Mellon and Newedge.Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James, said: “While the lawsuit may not ultimately prove successful, we believe facts revealed in the lawsuit cast IDCG’s future success into serious doubt.”IDCG has set itself apart with its clearing process by seeking to take OTC interest rate swaps and turn them into economically equivalent listed futures.Last March, two DRW employees and a Columbia University professor co-wrote a paper that said IDCG’s valuation method for swap futures causes “substantial deviations in valuation with respect to a non-cleared interest rate swap”.“If market participants don’t trust the product, they simply will stay away,” said Mr O’Shaughnessy. “IDCG has always been a long shot from our perspective.”Don Wilson, chief executive officer at DRW, said: “We’re not named in the suit because we didn’t do anything wrong and we entered into a settlement agreement with them.”Jefferies said: “The complaint speaks for itself.”Additional Reporting by Tom Braithwaite
304;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-09-15T15:59:00Z;Almunia ‘concerned’ about Deutsche Börse-NYSE deal;;Europe’s competition commission is “concerned” that the proposed combination of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext would create a “very large player that would monopolise the derivatives market” in the region, the commission chief said on Thursday.Joaquín Almunia, EU competition commissioner, told the Eurofi conference in Poland that any outcome of his department’s probe into the deal that would “eliminate the possibility of new entry and user flexibility would be unacceptable to us”.The combination of the two groups would include merging the Börse’s Eurex futures exchanges with NYSE Euronext’s NYSE Liffe futures exchange, creating a derivatives exchange that would account for more than 95 per cent of trading in European interest-rate and German bond futures.Two of the exchanges’ rivals, Nasdaq OMX and the London Stock Exchange, argue that this would eliminate competition that exists between Eurex and Liffe, and that the combination of their clearing activities will make it even harder for competitors to gain traction.Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext argue the opportunity for rivals to compete already exists, and the combination would create cost savings and “efficiencies” for market participants, including eliminating the need for them to connect to two exchanges and two clearing platforms.They told the Financial Times this week that they had raised their estimates of such savings.The issue of competition in exchange-traded derivatives has taken on heightened sensitivity beyond the antitrust probe into the proposed combination, as market infrastructure regulators at the European Commission push ahead with post-crisis reforms to exchanges, clearing houses and trading.Part of that includes an effort to open up exchange-traded derivatives to competition, challenging the “vertical silo” structure enjoyed by some exchange groups – like Deutsche Börse – where trading and clearing sit together in one ownership structure. Deutsche Börse is opposed to such efforts.Mr Almunia said: “I am aware that huge interests revolve around this merger. But I can assure you that our decision will be guided solely by our duty to guarantee the good functioning of financial markets and to protect the interests of the users of financial services.”
305;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-09-15T12:17:36Z;Quick View: Were risk managers asleep at UBS?;Bank’s statement on rogue trading raises worrying questions;How could this happen?UBS’s brief disclosure that it was facing a $2bn loss on unauthorised trades threw up more questions than answers. But while the world learns about Kweku Adoboli, who has been arrested in connection with the loss, and the exchange-traded funds business, the statement leads to some disturbing conclusions.First, hard questions need to be asked about UBS’s internal risk controls. It is hard to believe the Swiss bank’s view that it cannot identify the area in which the rogue trades were made, or when more information might become available – everything has an electronic audit trail.No matter which part of the bank’s operations is responsible, it seems that top management at UBS were unaware of the issue until very recently, even though risk management meetings had been a regular part of the bank’s day-to-day life. It also made significant investments in its risk IT infrastructure last year, particularly in its investment bank.However it also acknowledged last year that “increased risk-taking was authorized for incremental trading activity, particularly to support client flow activity.”As Richard Bentley, vice-president for banking & capital markets at Progress Software, points out: “Detection of criminal fraud or market abuse is something that must happen in real time before any unauthorised trading has a chance to lose a firm money or move the market.”Secondly, isn’t the slew of regulation – the Dodd-Frank act in the US and, in Europe, the review of Mifid (the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) and Emir (the European Market Infrastructure Regulation) – supposed to usher in an era of tighter risk controls for banks?What the new regulations imply is that the burden of surveillance is increasingly being pushed on to the industry, even if some people at the top of the banks are not aware of it. After all, last year UBS told an investor conference it would take on more risk– including proprietary trading risk – to meet its medium-term profit targets.The concern is that UBS has been so focused on meeting other regulations, such as capital requirement rules as required by Basel III, that this significant shift in Dodd-Frank has not been given as much attention. We wait to hear what more the bank says, and of course full judgement should be withheld until then.But the questions raised by the UBS case go wider.Many other financial institutions, particularly in the US, had to race to update their surveillance systems in preparation for the introduction in July of anti-fraud rules from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.For UK-based firms, the big fear is an “Arrow” visit – a regulatory swoop by the Financial Services Authority to assess an institution’s riskiness. On average, an Arrow report raises about 60 points that require action to be taken.One large interdealer broker with extensive operations in London, for example, received such a visit over the summer and parts of its systems were judged to be lacking. Threatened with a range of punishments, including the potential cessation of trading, it is now rapidly updating its systems.For those watching the UBS scandal unfold with concern, the good news is that the technology does exist to monitor trades and risks in real-time. Nasdaq OMX’s recent purchase of FTEN, a specialist in pre-trade risk management, and Smarts, its trade surveillance business, shows that some large markets infrastructure groups see that such safeguards are going to be a big issue – and a business opportunity.Although of course this would not have been any help with the OTC exchange-traded funds that appear to have been involved in Mr Adoboli’s trades. OTC is done over the phone, invariably.Every firm does have risk checks that apply to OTC trading. But this bumps up against an uncomfortable fact: traders have a lot of discretion as to how they do these trades - how large, with what counterparties. In other words, OTC trading brings in additional operational risks.All this is, of course, a gift to the exchanges, which have long criticised the OTC markets as opaque and inherently risky and less transparent than theirs. It is hard to disagree.
306;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-09-12T13:58:30Z;Equity market: Luxury of a long view of the mainland;;"When surfing for car insurance or a tablet PC, shoppers generally do not care which website they use, as long as the service is quick, inexpensive and reliable. The same applies, increasingly, to the business of equity trading.In financial centres across the world, a combination of deregulation and technology has transformed the landscape.In New York, for example, where authorities began to encourage a migration of turnover to alternative platforms more than a decade ago, the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq have ceded almost half the market to rivals. A similar process has unfolded in Europe since the mid-1990s; Japan and Australia look to be heading the same way.In Hong Kong, though, things are different. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx), the world’s largest exchange group by market capitalisation, owns the territory’s only stock exchange, its only futures exchange and its only clearing house for stock transactions. In the case of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, a “de facto monopoly” is embedded in a series of definitions in Article 19 of the territory’s Securities and Futures Ordinance, notes David Webb, a corporate governance activist.It is one of the main reasons why a host of alternative venues have amassed only about a 3 per cent market share in equity trading between them, over several years of competition; even then, all trades on platforms other than the SEHK are reported to, and cleared through, HKEx. “Our primary role is to ensure that we maintain orderly and informed securities markets in the public interest,” says Ronald Arculli, the chairman of HKEx. “We have to work within the mandate we’re given.”A new competition bill, due to be enacted next July, could contain some more challenging provisions for HKEx. But it seems unlikely that the group will be exposed to the kind of wholesale reforms that swept across Europe under MiFID, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, legislation for the regulation of investment services.Hong Kong’s government owns 6 per cent of HKEx, and appoints half of its non-executive directors. KC Chan, secretary for financial services and the treasury, is known to take a critical view of the fragmentation of liquidity. That suggests that HKEx’s operating margins, typically about three times higher than peers in the US or Europe, are likely to remain among the best in the world. The group’s average return on equity over the past five years is 61 per cent – comfortably the highest on the Hang Seng benchmark index.Mr Arculli and his executive colleagues thus have the luxury of taking a long view. Increasingly, that is towards mainland China. As the 71-year-old chairman explains, the group has always had a “natural bias” toward the mainland. In July, mainland enterprises accounted for 55 per cent of the market’s capitalisation and 69 per cent of its turnover; three years ago, the ratios were broadly similar. But now, as Beijing looks to use its special administrative region as a laboratory to observe how the renminbi and renminbi-denominated assets are traded, HKEx sees itself playing a vital role.The group recently realigned its trading hours to be a better fit with those of Shanghai and Shenzhen – mainland China’s dominant equity markets, churning out about $18bn of equity trades between them every day (roughly two and a half times Hong Kong’s volumes).Last month, as Li Keqiang, the Chinese vice-premier, toured Hong Kong, the trio announced that they had embarked on a joint venture to develop cross-border products. “This can be seen as a first step towards working together commercially, starting to engage,” says Sam Hilton, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, the research company.In the short term, deepening ties with the mainland is not the sole objective. As Mr Arculli notes, HKex has made a “big push to attract international listings” – the likes of Prada of Italy and AIA, the Asian arm of the New York-headquartered AIG.But over the long term, those efforts should be set in the context of the gradual opening of China’s capital account. Hong Kong, ultimately, wants to achieve a transformation: from being a place where Chinese issuers meet international investors, to one where Chinese investors meet international issuers.In a recent research note, HSBC, the banking group, said it expected renminbi-denominated stocks to account for 15 per cent of Hong Kong’s total market capitalisation and 20 per cent of turnover by the end of 2015 – a much faster pace of liberalisation than anyone had been expecting two or three years ago. “If the development of Hong Kong as an offshore centre for renminbi is anything like the development in London of the eurodollar market in the latter half of the last century, we’ll have an awful lot of opportunities on our plate,” says Mr Arculli, now in his sixth year as chairman of HKEx. The group recently disclosed that 81 of its members had signed up to use a new platform to trade renminbi-denominated stocks.Of course, there are potential dangers in drawing closer to mainland China. Hong Kong is already heavily exposed to its fundraising cycles. So far this year, companies offering shares for the first time in the territory account for one in every 10 dollars raised globally; in 2009, when China was powering through the global downturn, that ratio was one in four.Deeper ties with unlisted mainland groups also imply that the HKEx will be a bystander as listed peers do deals. Notably, shares in HKEx dropped 5 per cent on the day in February that NYSE Euronext said it was tying up with Deutsche Boerse, suggesting investors suspect the company will play no meaningful part in the current wave of industry consolidation.But when Mr Arculli argues there is no sense in the group “doing a combination for the sake of doing one”, it is hard to disagree. Freed from serious competition for cash-equities trading, and almost guaranteed regular flows of primary business from north of the border, HKEx remains an anachronism. And for investors in it, a pretty glorious one."

The reports of an Anglo American bid for Walter follow a confirmed bid last week from US coal miner Peabody for MacArthur, the Australian coal producer.“Reports of M&A in the coke and coal space are driving up shares across the sector,” said Jeremy Sussman, at Brean Murray Carret. “Anglo American is one of the biggest mining companies in the world so the possibility of activity by them will move stocks.”Alpha Natural Resources and Cliff Natural Resources, both companies which have coal and coke in their mining mix, were among the biggest gainers in the S&P 500. Alpha rose 10.6 per cent to $33.44 and Cliff was up 8.3 per cent to $81.46. Peabody also rose 6.9 per cent to $48.72.The S&P 500 energy sector advanced 3.7 per cent. Financials rallied 4.8 per cent, up 3 per cent for the week. Regional banks propelled gains.Regions Financial rose 12.3 per cent to $4.37, its largest single-day rally since March 2010.The stock had fallen heavily on Tuesday despite a note from Credit Suisse advising clients to buy regional banks.Credit Suisse argued regional bank business models already price in low interest rates because most loans are made to businesses at floating rates.That note seemed to be having an impact on Wednesday. Midwest lender Fifth Third Bancorp recorded a second straight day of strong gains, up 7.2 per cent to $10.45. Synovus, which has branches across the southern states, rose 10.7 per cent to $1.45. Bank of America rose 7 per cent to $7.48 after a reshuffle of senior management at the much scrutinised bank.The S&P 500 rose 2.9 per cent to 1,198.62, within touching distance of the 1,200 level, which it butted up against for much of August. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.5 per cent to 11,414.86 and the Nasdaq Composite index put on 3 per cent to 2,548.94.Yahoo gained 5.4 per cent as investors greeted the dismissal ofCarol Bartz, chief executive. At $13.61, shares are trading near the level they were at when Ms Bartz was appointed in late 2008.“Yahoo’s board has generally been viewed as slow-moving and more passive; any kind of shake-up here will suggest greater interest in value creation,” said Doug Anmuth, internet analyst at JPMorgan, in a note to explain the share price move.Apart from M&A hopes, the rally appeared to be driven by positive sentiment about global growth with highly cyclical semiconductor stocks performing strongly.Nvidia rose 8.1 per cent to $14.25 after the company forecast positive quarterly earnings .Micron Technology was also up 6.9 per cent to $6.06.Sentiment also drove steel shares. Materials rose 2.7 per cent with US Steel leading the way, up 9.2 per cent to $29.92, and AK Steel, up 10.2 per cent at $8.90, despite a fall in weekly steel production.“It’s a mixture of bargain-hunters coming in to the market, because steel stocks have been beat up so much, and also the talk that President Obama’s stimulus plan might divert idle construction workers to infrastructure projects, which are a source of demand for steel,” Charles Bradford at Bradford Research, said. “But I would not be moving back into steel stocks until there is a clear sign of a turnround,” he added.JPMorgan lowered its earnings per share forecast for FedEx Corporation. JPMorgan said the business-driven package delivery service would suffer from weak demand. FedEx shares rose 3.6 per cent to $76.27.Citigroup upgraded DR Horton to buy, citing the low share price and an expected seasonal upturn in construction for the homebuilder. DR Horton shares rose 4.5 per cent to $10.17, while homebuilder Pulte Group rose 8.8 per cent to $4.58.C&J Energy Services rose 2.3 per cent to $25.53 after JPMorgan initiated coverage with the equivalent of a buy recommendation and a $41 target price. Citigroup also initiated coverage with a buy-high risk rating and a $33 price target.Exchange shares were higher after Deutsche Bank upgraded Nasdaq OMX to buy. Nasdaq shares gained 8.6 per cent to $23.56 and NYSE Euronext rose 8.5 per cent to $27.23."
308;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-09-06T18:14:31Z;Antitrust chief stressed negotiation at DoJ;;After two and half years heading the antitrust division of the US Justice Department, Christine Varney left for private practice only weeks before the DoJ’s momentous move to block AT&T’s $39bn purchase of T-Mobile USA.Now, in her first week as a partner at New York-based Cravath, Swaine & Moore, she has a message for prospective clients as they seek to deal with government antitrust lawyers – be willing to negotiate.“The most common approach that I’ve seen parties take, that I don’t think is fruitful, is to stonewall the government because you don’t want to negotiate against yourself,” Ms Varney told the Financial Times. “The earlier you engage on the government’s concerns, the more likely you are to be able to dispel them and the more quickly you will get to resolution, if they are credible.”With AT&T pledging to make its case in court, Ms Varney will not be drawn on the deal. While closely involved, she departed before the parties began moving towards last week’s denouement.But the DoJ’s quick decision to sue is among the most significant for antitrust enforcement under the Obama administration, which promised a more aggressive stance after the laisser faire years under President George W. Bush.A speedier review was among her goals on joining the division in 2009, she says.“When you dedicate that amount of person-power and analysis to a transaction, in most instances you do not need an 18-month process. We tried to make efficient decisions in all matters,” she says, noting May’s move to block Nasdaq OMX’s attempts to buy NYSE Euronext.Opinions vary about her time at the DoJ. Some applaud her willingness to consider creative solutions, while other practitioners accuse her of overturning decades of well-established practice.Either way, with the White House yet to nominate a successor and her deputy Sharis Pozen now at the helm, her approach should persist for now.Ms Varney, a former commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, styles herself as pragmatic.“I was interested in setting a course where the division was willing to block any deal that met the criteria of substantially lessening competition, while at the same time recognising that there can be solutions,” she says. “It’s not a binary decision, to block or to let the deal go.”That included a flurry of so-called conduct remedies, which govern companies’ behaviour after a deal’s close.Comcast agreed to license programming as part of its tie-up with NBC Universal, while Ticketmaster committed to share software and open up ticketing at venues in buying Live Nation – both instances where companies were active in countering government concerns.“We found enough credible evidence that this would be anti-competitive and I was prepared to block it,” she notes of the former deal. “Comcast and NBC, to their credit, said: ‘We understand your analysis and we are prepared to address the issues you’ve raised.’ It could have gone the other way. They could have said: ‘We disagree.’”Small deals also provoked unusual results. Having challenged the $3m acquisition of a Virginia poultry processing plant by George’s, the chicken company, the DoJ acquiesced, provided the company installed a special freezer and deboning equipment.“There is obviously a threshold for what is an appropriate use of government resources,” says Ms Varney. “But the size of the deal does not drive the antitrust analysis. If a deal is anti-competitive, the government should approach it with the same amount of rigour.”At Cravath, her diary is filling up despite US ethics rules that bar her from representing clients before the DoJ for two years.The firm already has a highly rated antitrust group, despite no Washington office, and Ms Varney’s move up the east coast is a long-promised concession to her husband of 27 years.“There are already a number of clients who are eager to get the benefit of her insight and experience,” says presiding partner Evan Chesler. “She is going to be quite busy from the time she arrives.”So will the lawyers she leaves behind. However, Express Scripts controversial $29bn purchase of rival Medco will be considered by the FTC.Ms Varney bats away talk of friction between the bodies. Nor does she see a notable rise in companies in relatively consolidated industries opting to take a punt on antitrust approval.“It has always happened over the course of history,” she says. “Sometimes companies, as you would say of people, are not very self-aware.”
309;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
310;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-09-05T17:04:44Z;Wall St’s awful August a disaster for financials;;"After a disastrous start for US equities, August ended up merely awful. Unfortunately, the same could not be said for shares of banks and other financial groups.Banks enjoyed solid gains in the second half of the month, like the rest of the market. But they had much further to travel. The S&P 500 financial sector is still furthest from its cyclical peak of any big S&P sector, and nearest to its bottom.Financials, which make up 14 per cent of the weighting of the S&P 500, are the worst performers this year, down 20.1 per cent versus the broader index’s 6 per cent decline.The S&P 500 ended lower by 5.7 per cent in August, while the financials sector was down 9.4 per cent.The banks segment was hardest hit. The KBW Banks index fell 13.2 per cent.Analysts say a sustained equity rally will be difficult unless there is a sharp change of fortune for financial stocks.“There’s a very strong correlation between the relative returns of financials and the market itself,” says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Harris Private Bank.For banks, fears of a slowdown do not just mean fewer people and companies buying things; it also means falling home prices that stress balance sheets still weighed down by mortgage obligations, as well as related litigation.Financials in the S&P 500 fell another 3.5 per cent on Friday as the Federal Housing Finance Agency said it would sue US-based banks for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities.Bank of America has been acutely affected by fears for banks. Its stock fell to just $6.01 a share at one point in August amid rumours it would have to raise capital or sell a big asset to survive an economic slowdown.Warren Buffett’s agreement to buy shares only returned the shares to $7.91 by September, still a 19.4 per cent fall over the month.The bank’s executives and many analysts rushed to its defence, and to the defence of peer Citigroup. They cited a balance sheet repair in the past two years and less exposure to mortgage losses than some had feared.But fears persist over how banks fund themselves amid the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. While US banks have little exposure to Greece – less than $10bn, according to the Cleveland Fed – they are counterparties to large European financial institutions. Many also fear they could be affected by a run on money market funds that own bank paper.Even normally staid custodian banks, such as BNY Mellon – down 18 per cent in August – and State Street – down 15.9 per cent – demonstrated some of that worry. Early in August, BNY Mellon began charging additional fees for cash deposits, citing complexities in managing its balance sheet, as customers dumped money market funds ahead of the US debt ceiling deadline.The anxiety is stark in the gap between the expected volatility of the broad S&P 500 and US financials, which continues to widen. While the US 30-day expected volatility has fallen to about 30 per cent, from highs just above 40, bank volatility is still nearly 60. “At the core of the stress evident in S&P volatility is the perception that risks are growing in the financial sector,” said Barry Knapp, US equity market strategist at Barclays, in a note. “A return to equity market normality is unlikely without a sharp drop in perceived risks in the financial sector.”He said that although Barclays analysts were “sceptical” of a funding crisis – he cited policymakers’ experience during the 2008 crisis in providing interbank funding – “investors seem intent on looking at financing markets for signs that capital problems are evolving into a liquidity crisis”.But analysts are also lowering expectation for financials’ core businesses. Analysts at ISI Group downgraded Goldman Sachs from “buy” to “hold” last week.“Debt and equity underwriting fees have also been under pressure due to equity market weakness,” they said, citing “high market volatility” and “much wider debt spreads”.Goldman’s shares fell 16 per cent for August. Morgan Stanley was down 24 per cent.Though volatility can also help banks’ trading businesses, risks were still seen there, including a transactions tax being considered in Europe.The KBW Capital Markets index – which includes groups such as Nasdaq OMX and NYSE Euronext – closed the month down 11.5 per cent."
311;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-09-01T19:22:12Z;US options trading volumes double;;Options trading volumes in the US nearly doubled in August from the same month last year, surpassing half-a-billion contracts for the first time as extreme volatility sent traders to the derivatives markets to hedge their positions.More than 550m options contracts changed hands last month, a 94 per cent increase from August 2010’s 283m contracts, according to the Options Clearing Corporation, which clears for all nine US options exchanges. On average, 24m options were traded in the US each day in August, up from less than 13m a day in August 2010.The data underline how traders are making increasing use of options with money managers and retail traders seeking to protect themselves from sudden market plunges as uncertainty pervades the global economy following the gridlocked debate in Washington over raising the US debt ceiling and Standard and Poor’s downgrade of the US’s debt rating.The previous monthly options trading volume record was achieved in March, when 417m contracts changed hands. The industry has seen rapid growth this year, in spite of dips in April and May. So far this year, more than 3.1bn options contracts have traded in the US, up 22 per cent from last year.The boom in volumes is good news for options exchanges, which compete fiercely in a crowded market where every point of market share is energetically fought for. Exchanges frequently change their pricing models to attract different kinds of traders.Three operators dominate the market, each of them controlling two different options-trading platforms.The Chicago Board Options Exchange group, the oldest and traditionally the most powerful in the industry, saw its share of the market rise to nearly 28 per cent in August, up slightly from the 27 per cent it held in August 2010.While market share dipped slightly on CBOE’s traditional exchange in Chicago, its overall market share was boosted thanks to C2, the all-electronic, New York-based platform it launched last year, which is designed to appeal to high-frequency traders.Amex and Arca, the two US options-trading platforms operated by NYSE Euronext, secured almost one-quarter of the overall market in August, up from the 23 per cent of trading volumes they garnered in the same month last year.The Nasdaq Options Market and PHLX, Nasdaq OMX’s two options-trading venues, saw collective market share dip to 23 per cent from 28 per cent a year ago.The International Securities Exchange, owned by Eurex, the derivatives arm of Deutsche Börse, saw a slight fall in its market share to about 17.5 per cent.
312;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-08-30T20:35:57Z;BATS given go-ahead for US listings venue;;BATS Global Markets has been given the go-ahead from regulators to launch a listings venue in the US this year, as it seeks to take on industry leaders Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange.Joe Ratterman, BATS chief executive, has long said that the listings business was ripe for a competitor, in the same way the trading business was when BATS launched about five years ago as a low-cost, speed-trading focused alternative.The listings market will go live in December, BATS said on Tuesday.BATS has proposed to create a listings venue with lower and flatter fees than either Nasdaq or NYSE. The Securities and Exchange Commission did not request any changes to BATS’s application, filed in May.Top-tier issuers will pay a flat fee of $35,000 a year on BATS’s market, after an initial fee of $100,000. That compares with an initial fee of up to $225,000 and annual fees up to $99,500 for Nasdaq’s stock market, depending on the size of the company’s stock float. NYSE-listed companies pay as much as $500,000 a year, with initial fees of up to $250,000.BATS will also allow smaller companies to list than NYSE, with a minimum market value of $8m, versus the NYSE’s $40m threshold. It will employ two tiers of listings, as Nasdaq does.BATS, like its close competitor Direct Edge, has won market share in US equity and options trading over the past few years by forging close ties with high-frequency market-making firms by paying some market participants and charging low fees to others.Although shares can trade in many venues, corporate listings in the US is currently dominated by the Nasdaq stock market, part of Nasdaq OMX, and the New York Stock Exchange, owned by NYSE Euronext.Listings of securities, such as convertibles and exchange-traded funds, is a slightly broader market, though NYSE Euronext’s Amex and Arca units are big players. Some large European companies that have US listed securities, called American Depository Receipts, have opted to delist and trade over-the-counter.Observers have said BATS will face an uphill battle to convince companies to forgo the marketing advantages that come with bell-ringing ceremonies and other publicity associated with NYSE and Nasdaq, and may have more success with listings of other securities or small start-up companies.US antitrust authorities expressed concern about competition in the US listings market when it reviewed Nasdaq’s proposed merger with NYSE Euronext, and was not swayed by BATS’s nascent efforts to break into the market.“Its good to have the competition, but it can be tough sledding trying to pry listings away from the NYSE and Nasdaq in the US. For most companies, a listing is a branding event,” said Richard Repetto, equity analyst at Sandler O’Neill.Among the first listings will probably be BATS itself, which has filed for an initial public offering. The offering has been pushed back to later this year because of delays in gaining approval in the UK for the acquisition of Chi-X.BATS could not comment on the SEC’s approval because it is in a quiet period leading up to the IPO.
313;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-08-29T00:38:23Z;Clearstream in trading service talks with ASX;;Clearstream, the settlement and custody business owned by Deutsche Börse, has entered into exclusive talks with the Australian Stock Exchange to provide a service that addresses the exposure that banks and brokers face when trading on the Australian market.The Sydney-based bourse plans to outsource to Clearstream the part of its business that calculates and manages the amount of collateral that participants have to post as a guarantee of a trade.The move highlights how market infrastructure operators are being forced to reshape their businesses by a tide of global regulatory reforms.Members of the G20 group of economies have pledged to move more of the vast but opaque $6,000bn over-the-counter derivatives market on to exchanges or other electronic trading platforms, and send trades through clearing houses.Many of the world’s bigger exchanges, such as Deutsche Börse, Nasdaq OMX and the London Stock Exchange, are eyeing opportunities in post-trade services – like clearing and settlement – that have been thrown up by the reforms.In July, IntercontinentalExchange, the US exchange and clearing house, agreed to buy a minority stake in Cetip, a Brazilian clearer, for $512m.At the same time, ASX is facing domestic competition in share trading for the first time after Australian regulators granted a licence to Chi-X Australia, an alternative trading platform, earlier this year.The ASX and Chi-X have also agreed a deal that will see the newcomer pay to use the ASX’s clearing services.Luxembourg-based Clearstream is set to take over the real-time management of collateral held in Austraclear, the sole central securities depository in Australia, and Chess, a settlement house.All financial products traded on ASX are cleared and settled through Austraclear and Chess and both businesses are owned by the ASX.“ASX is working to expand the range of its post-trade services in the Australian market to meet the rapidly changing needs of financial market participants,” said Peter Hiom, deputy chief executive of ASX.Clearstream is expanding globally and already derives about 20 per cent of its revenues from Asia, mainly through custody services to banks, exchanges and central banks.Australia would become the second market to use Clearstream’s real-time collateral management outsourcing service, following Brazil’s Cetip.While rivals also offer collateral oursourcing services, Clearstream said it is the only one that keeps assets in domestic markets, under local authority jurisdiction.Many regulators prevent assets used for collateral to be taken out of the country.Stefan Lepp, head of client relations and a member of the executive board at Clearstream, told FT Trading Room that the group had been approached by 17 potential customers, including banks, regulators and central banks, about using the system.
314;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-08-28T22:10:46Z;Irene downgraded to post-tropical storm;;Hurricane Irene left at least 18 people dead and more than 4m businesses and homes without power as it rampaged up the east coast of the US, but New York was speared the worst as the storm weakened.By late Sunday night Irene was downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone as it neared the US-Canada border and Wall Street was set to open as normal on Monday with public transport in and around New York City expected to reopen gradually from around 6am local time.Barack Obama warned earlier on Sunday that flooding could worsen and that recovery efforts would take weeks.The US president declared a federal state of emergency in several states, which means federal funds will cover much of the cost of disaster clean-up. “The federal government is going to participate in the funding. That will be a significant benefit to us,” said Andrew Cuomo, New York governor.The storm left at least 18 people dead and more than 4m homes and business without power, according to the Associated Press. US media reported widespread flooding in upstate New York and southern Vermont as Irene churned north. Canada issued warnings for its maritime provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.The financial district in low-lying southern Manhattan had been braced for a full frontal assault by the storm. Residents in some areas in the New York metropolitan region were forced to evacuate, but the flash flooding and widespread damage that many had feared did not materialise.“The good news is the worst is over and we will soon move to restore and return mode,” said Michael Bloomberg, New York’s mayor. “The dangers of additional flooding have been eliminated and the existing flooding should start to go down”.There were no confirmed deaths or injuries in the city but it was too early to know the full extent of the damage, he said.The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market buildings were largely unaffected, officials said and, following discussions with city officials, power authorities and regulators, they announced plans to open for trading as usual. CME Group and BATS also said they will be operating normally.Several Wall Street firms said they planned to open. Credit Suisse said it had contingency plans in place to bus essential employees into the city if the transit system was not operating. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley said they would open as normal.American Express said that while its building in Battery Park did not experience any damage, due to repairs to the mass transit systems and clean-up work, the credit card company’s headquarters would be closed on Monday. Business would continue as normal, a spokeswoman said, saying employees would work remotely where they could.How quickly New York will return to normal will depend on how soon transit authorities can get the trains running. Sections of some commuter lines were underwater on Sunday. Bus service was restored on some lines by early Sunday evening and the PATH trains to New Jersey were expected to reopen in time for the Monday morning commute.The Port Authority said all New York area airports remained closed on Sunday. The city’s ports and container terminals were due to open at 8am on Monday.Mr Bloomberg is expected to face criticism for the decision to shut the subway service, with some saying it was an overreaction following the city’s slow response to a blizzard last winter.Mr Bloomberg said on Sunday that the decision was made because “we were unwilling to risk the life of a single New Yorker. The bottom line is that we would make the same decisions again without hesitation”.Jay Walder, chief executive of the Metropolitan Transit Authority, said inspections were under way to assess damage to the city’s extensive subway system. “We can only do that as quickly as we can do it safely,” he said. “It’s clear that we have widespread impacts of the storm” from flooding, downed trees and power outages.Irene’s centre moved over New York City at 9am local time, according to the National Hurricane Center, but following a fall in wind speed it was downgraded from a category one hurricane to a tropical storm. In New Jersey, where Irene came ashore earlier, Chris Christie, the state’s governor, said he expected the cost of repairing damage to be “in the billions of dollars, if not in the tens of billions of dollars”.By late Sunday the eerily quiet streets of New York were coming back to life.The roughly 370,000 city residents who were ordered to leave their homes in low-lying areas were told they could return.At Hunter College on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, which was housing a mixture of homeless people and people evacuated from their homes, Miriam Kessler, a social worker at Resort Nursing Home, said: “We had to evacuate our entire nursing home. There are about 250 people [spread] between Hunter College and John Jay College. Some are in hospital. It’s been difficult to keep track of people and their medications but we are getting there”.In Manhattan’s Times Square, two Italian tourists, Enrico Agostinelli and Antonella Tancredi, were filming the quiet streets of the normally bustling intersection on a video recorder.Mr Agostinelli said the shutdown of mass transit and warnings to stay indoors were an overreaction. “This problem is not a reality … it’s a show” for television. “It is a wonderful country. You can’t stop everything for this problem”.At a makeshift shelter at Brooklyn Tech high school, Tate John waited to be taken back to his home in Seagate near Coney Island.“I don’t know why I bothered coming, I’ve called and there’s no damage in our area. There were 30 of us or so, all senior citizens,” he said. “None of the young folk paid attention to the evacuation orders. It was just Mayor Bloomberg making a fuss, because of what happened with the snow at Christmas”.Additional reporting by Barney Jopson in London and Ajay Makan in New York
315;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-08-26T09:02:18Z;EMCF to push into OTC clearing;;European Multilateral Clearing Facility, the Dutch clearing house, is to expand into the clearing of products traded off-exchange amid increasing competition in its core business of clearing cash equities.The group announced a deal on Thursday with Citi Automated Trading Services, a bilateral trading system operated by Citigroup, to offer clearing of structured products such as warrants and certificates to the region’s largest banks and brokers.The agreement highlights how wide-ranging reforms of the global financial system, in the shape of the Dodd-Frank Act in the US and similar reforms in Europe, are shaking up clearing services in Europe by opening up new markets such as over-the-counter derivatives trades.In the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, countries belonging to the G20 have agreed to push more trades from the vast but opaque $6,000bn OTC derivates market through clearing houses to guard against the systemic risk. A clearing house – also known as a central counterparty – guarantees trades are completed in the event of a default.CATS garners little outside attention but is a Citi-run bilateral facility that allows large investment banks like Goldman Sachs, Barclays Capital and Merrill Lynch to trade OTC products. Although it is not a regulated market, there were more than 6m trades completed on it last year and counterparties settled with each other. The new venture will be launched in the fourth quarter of the year and has been approved by Dutch financial regulators and the Dutch Central Bank.The push by EMCF, which is owned by ABN Amro and Nasdaq OMX, into OTC products clearing comes as it faces deepening competition in cash equities. Last week the group, Europe’s largest cash equities clearer, agreed to join rivals x-Clear, LCH.Clearnet and EuroCCP in a scheme that opens its clearing house to investor choice over where their trades in Europe are cleared.The system, called “interoperability”, will allow market participants using the Chi-X Europe, BATS Europe and UBS MTF trading venues to net and cross-margin trades between clearing houses. Traders hitherto had little choice over where their trades were cleared.“Adding the transactions from Citi’s CATS to the current flows being cleared by EMCF will positively contribute to EMCF and it will provide opportunities for further consolidation to our clients,” said Jan Booij, chief executive of EMCF.Mr Booij told FT Trading Room that the deal with CATS would be exclusive and not subject to the interoperability that exists in cash markets.At the same time Citigroup has staked out its ambitions to capture business from the OTC markets reforms by poaching 14 bankers to beef up its derivatives business.Chuffy Hunter, head of Citi’s CATS platform, said the move would cut counterparty risk on the bilateral trading system and allow it to comply with the G20 pledge, which must be enforced by the end of 2012.
316;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-08-24T14:31:35Z;BofA rallies but Wall St flat;;A strong rally in Bank of America helped Wall Street record a second day of gains.BofA rose 11 per cent at $6.99, recovering all of their losses for the week. The stock had touched a low of $6.01, not seen since 2009, on Tuesday, as investors fretted about the bank’s capital adequacy levels.Glenn Schorr, director of US financial equities at Nomura, said the “sell-off [in BofA] may be overdone” and set a target price of $11.But Mr Schorr said the stock still compared unfavourably to Citigroup, citing Citi’s better tier one capital ratio – 6.7 per cent to BofA’s 5.1 per cent – smaller mortgage portfolio ($431bn to $1,600bn at BofA) and less legal risk from continuing claims relating to mortgage mis-selling and trading.Citigroup was up 4.1 per cent per cent at $28.45, Goldman Sachs climbed 3.2 per cent to $110.31 and Genworth Financial put on 6.7 per cent to close at $6.55, as financial stocks in the S&P 500 strongly outperformed the index, up 2.8 per cent. The broader KBW bank index gained 3.3 per cent to close at 37.72.The main S&P 500 index climbed 1.3 per cent to 1,177.60, now up 4.8 per cent for the week. But defensive utility stocks were up 2 per cent in a sign of continuing investor nervousness.Traders are hoping the index will break through the 1,200 level, which has proved a barrier since market volatility heightened at the start of August.McGraw-Hill companies, whose businesses include Standard & Poor’s and several media companies, rose 7.4 per cent to $41.30 after JPMorgan said shareholders could gain $5bn if the parent company was split and individual businesses sold.CVS Caremark, was up 3 per cent at $34.44, after the pharmacist announced plans to buy back at least $1bn in shares by the end of the year, as part of a larger $4bn programme.Wednesday saw good economic data. Orders for durable goods were up 4 per cent month-on-month in July, the biggest climb in four months, and well above expectations of a 2 per cent rise.House prices rose a seasonally adjusted 0.9 per cent month-on-month in June, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The homebuilder PulteGroup climbed 4.2 per cent to $3.76.Stock exchange operators gained after Patrick O’Shaughnessy, an analyst at Raymond James, tipped them to benefit from rising transaction volume in volatile markets.The New York Stock Exchange was up 4 per cent at $27.28, and Nasdaq OMX climbed 3.1 per cent to $23.05. Alex Kramm at UBS upgraded Nasdaq to buy, targeting $28, also on high transaction volume.Sprint Nextel lost 3.9 per cent to $3.45. Reports the mobile phone network will be able to offer the iPhone 5 handset by the end of the year had led shares to rise 10.1 per cent Tuesday.But UBS telecoms analyst John Hodulik warned that, while the Iphone would attract new subscribers, higher upfront subsidy costs would drive down margins.Research in Motion put on 3.9 per cent to close at $34.44, on reports its new Blackberry models will be able to run applications built for Google’s Android operating system.Semiconductor manufacturers and suppliers slipped after JPMorgan forecast lower demand for the industry, due to the weak macroeconomic situation.Micron Technology, which supplies computer manufacturers, led fallers in the S&P 500. Its shares slid 6.4 per cent at $5.30, after it gave advance warning of lower revenue.Cisco Systems was the second worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 0.1 per cent to $15.46. The broad index gained 1.3 per cent to close at 11,320.56.Volterra Semiconductors lost 7.9 per cent to close at $20.10, after Collins Stewart lowered its forecast, citing expected weak demand from Intel, a key Volterra client.The Nasdaq composite index underperformed the S&P 500, up 0.9 per cent at 2,467.69.Applied Materials, which supplies parts for solar panels as well as computer semiconductors, was boosted by a bullish Goldman Sachs note on the solar industry.Its shares were down 0.7 per cent on the day at $11.36, but were still up 5 per cent for the week, before an earnings report after the bell on Wednesday.Avago Technologies, a San Jose-based manufacturer of semiconductors for phone handsets, was up 10.3 per cent to $32.27 as it reported quarterly revenue of $603m and earnings per share of 68 cents, a 4 cent increase on the previous quarter.Terence Whalen, analyst at Citigroup, added the stock to his top picks and said the company was outperforming by winning key contracts from handset manufacturers including Apple rather than because of broad demand for semiconductors.Energy shares underperformed, up 0.4 per cent, after recording strong gains on Tuesday. Shares were led down by domestic oil producing companies.Refiner Tesoro put on 5.9 per cent to $21.30 after Benchmark Company analyst Mark Gilman upgraded the company, and predicted Tesoro will reinstate its 40 cent annual dividend, suspended in 2009.
317;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-08-23T10:10:30Z;NYSE Euronext-D Börse deal passes US hurdle;;The planned merger of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, which would create the largest exchanges company in the world, has moved a step closer after a key US regulatory body approved the $9.4bn merger without objection.Clearance by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, a government panel that vets foreign takeovers of US assets, means the deal faces only one more serious hurdle – clearance from European competition authorities.A green light from CFIUS is a notable exception for an industry that has seen nationalist sensibilities scupper other exchanges mergers around the world in recent months. A joint Nasdaq OMX- IntercontinentalExchange bid for NYSE Euronext, the London Stock Exchange’s bid for Canada’s TMX Group and SGX Group of Singapore’s bid for the Australian Stock Exchange have all failed in recent months amid vocal opposition that has viewed national exchanges as important strategic assets. CFIUS is chaired by the US Treasury and includes representatives from the justice, commerce, state, defence and homeland security departments.The Deutsche Börse -NYSE Euronext deal has elicited muted opposition in the US. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, an influential Democrat, has backed the deal, saying it could protect jobs and strengthen New York’s position in the derivatives markets.However, the deal faces an in-depth probe from regulators in Brussels, who are focusing their investigation on its potential to shift market power in derivatives trading and clearing, rather than defining and protecting so-called “strategic assets”. It comes amid fierce debate in Europe over forthcoming financial markets regulation that will reshape the rules governing trading and clearing in the derivatives marketDerivatives generate substantially more profits for exchanges than share trading. Banks, inter-dealer brokers and exchanges such as the London Stock Exchange have expressed concern that the combination of Eurex and Liffe, the derivatives trading platforms of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext respectively, would create an overwhelmingly dominant player in Europe.Rival derivatives platforms have worried that they could be blocked from accessing the merged company’s enlarged post-trading facilities, which, rivals say, could prevent them from entering certain derivatives markets.Deutsche Börse has argued that it faces competition from the off-exchange or over-the-counter markets, where banks – the exchanges’ biggest customers – are active.“We are continuing to work with regulatory authorities to achieve the remaining approvals and deliver this compelling combination to shareholders, clients and partners,” said Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext.A decision is expected by the European Commission by December 13. Shareholders in NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse both backed the deal last month.Deutsche Börse shares closed down €1.20 at €38.73 while NYSE Euronext shares traded flat at $25.50 in morning trading.
318;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-08-17T17:23:59Z;Merkel and Sarkozy pledge to defend euro;;Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Nicolas Sarkozy, French president, on Tuesday pledged to defend the euro with plans to reinforce economic governance even as Germany’s economy suffered a sharp slowdown in the second quarter.The two leaders, speaking after a two-hour meeting in Paris, said they were committed to greater integration in the eurozone. They pledged to prepare annual budgets on harmonised economic outlooks, work towards a common corporation tax by 2013 and proposed a twice yearly summit of eurozone leaders. They also want all 17 members of the eurozone to be obliged to produce balanced budgets a constitutional requirement, and plan to revive proposals for a European tax on financial transactions.“Germany and France feel absolutely determined to strengthen the euro as our common currency and further develop it,” Ms Merkel said.“We have to converge,” said Mr Sarkozy. “The status quo is impossible.”But both leaders firmly refused to bow to pressure to reinforce the €440bn European Financial Stability Fund or to consider commonly issued eurozone bonds. Mutualising debt while the 17 members pursued divergent fiscal and economic policies made no sense, they said. “We could imagine this, but at the end of the process of integration of the eurozone, not at the beginning,” Mr Sarkozy said.Ms Merkel and Mr Sarkozy were meeting as gloom over the future of the eurozone was intensified by a sharp slowdown in Germany’s economy, which came to a near standstill in the second quarter.German gross domestic product increased by only 0.1 per cent in the three months to June compared with the previous quarter, the country’s statistical office reported. Data for the first quarter were also revised down to show a rise of 1.3 per cent compared with the 1.5 per cent originally reported.The euro and US stocks fell amid talk in Paris of a tax on financial transactions such as derivatives.It also hit the share prices of exchange groups. NYSE Euronext, parent company of the UK’s Liffe futures exchange, was down 8.4 per cent to $26.54 in New York. IntercontinentalExchange, which owns a London energy derivatives market, traded 4.47 per cent lower at $111.22. Nasdaq OMX, with its Nordic derivatives exchange, was 2.75 per cent lower at $22.97.Market analysts expressed some disappointment at the lack of detail in the Franco-German proposals, such as whether there would be automatic sanctions for members who did not abide by the balanced budget rule. “The framework has been set but there was not a lot of detail,” said Phlippe Waecheter, head of research at Naxtixi Asset management.The latest German growth figures meanwhile will add to the pressure on the European Central Bank, which last week spent €22bn buying eurozone government debt to prevent borrowing costs soaring out of control for Spain and Italy. The ECB may have been overly hasty in raising interest rates twice this year, analysts said.German economic activity in the second quarter remained below its pre-crisis peak, according to the revised figures – whereas earlier data had shown it had exceeded that level already in the first quarter.Economists revised down 2011 and 2012 growth forecasts after Tuesday’s data, and warned that an escalation of the eurozone debt crisis posed significant risks. Thomas Mayer, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, said the slowdown was more worrisome “because there is not much chance of a rebound in the third or fourth quarters”.Additional reporting by Telis Demos in New York
319;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-08-15T16:23:26Z;ASX on the offensive to fend off Chi-X;Australian bourse modernises in attempt to retain market share;Barring last minute hitches, the Australian Securities Exchange’s share trading monopoly will be broken in a little over two months, when a small company called Chi-X flicks the switch on its new trading platform.When Chi-X is launched, investors will for the first time have a choice as to where they place their orders for blue-chip Australian stocks, just as investors have for some years had the choice with blue chips in Europe and the US.Four years ago Europe broke the monopoly of its exchanges, allowing start-ups to compete, including a sister company of the Chi-X that is about to enter Australia. The US did the same a few years earlier.Exchanges were forced on to the defensive by these platforms, which, armed with low fees and fast trading technology, eroded incumbent exchanges’ market shares.Chi-X Europe, which offers trading in stocks across 14 European markets, now accounts for a quarter of trading in FTSE 100 stocks, while the London Stock Exchange has seen its market share fall to about 60 per cent since 2007.The same trend has played out in Canada, where the Toronto Stock Exchange’s share has fallen to 66 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters.Yet, ASX may yet avoid the same fate, analysts believe. That is because it has learnt from its global peers, which were slow to anticipate the upstarts and modernise.Steve Grob, director of strategy at Fidessa, a trading technology company, says: “ASX has jumped straight to the acceptance phase of this, whereas other exchanges were in denial.”Since last year, ASX has been pushing through a flurry of initiatives. In December it bought a new trading system from Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator, six months after slashing fees by about 40 per cent.The Sydney-based exchange is building a new data centre to meet demand for “collocation” services, involving capital expenditure of A$32m (US$33.5m). Under collocation, exchanges allow “high-frequency” traders to place their computers physically next to the exchange’s system. This shaves crucial microseconds off the time it takes for trades to be done.So confident is ASX that it can fend off Chi-X that last month it adopted a “smart order routing” system from Fidessa, which will send customers’ orders to competing trading venues if a better price can be found there.David Raper, ASX’s general manager of trade execution and information services, said the risk that this would send orders to Chi-X was an issue “we’ve obviously grappled with”.But he said: “I don’t think the introduction of [the service] is going to be a major influence of the proportion of volume that is going to be routed to Chi-X.”ASX is also tackling Chi-X on its home turf with the launch shortly of PureMatch, a high-speed system targeted at high-frequency traders that will seek to counter Chi-X’s trading for the top 200 ASX stocks.“They are trying to match the new entrant’s service offering pre-emptively,” said Nigel Pittaway, a Sydney-based analyst at Citigroup.ASX’s diversified business model will also help mitigate the impact of competition. Revenue from equities execution, the part of the ASX’s business being targeted by Chi-X, only accounts for 7 per cent of the group’s total.Its derivatives business accounted for 25 per cent of revenue in 2009-10 and is expected to show further solid growth when the group reports earnings on Thursday.Chi-X has been trying to break into Australia since 2007, but the global financial crisis, a change in Australia’s government and an overhaul of the country’s securities industry regulation have led to delays, which have given ASX more time to prepare.Yet, Chi-X is entering a market where the regulator has made clear it wants to see competition.Peter Fowler, chief operating officer of Chi-X Australia, said the group had support from market participants operating in Australia, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland.So far 15 firms, representing more than 80 per cent of ASX’s order flow, had told Chi-X they intended to take part in its market launch in the final quarter, he said. “We are confident we will have a successful launch and we will compete very effectively with the ASX.”
320;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-08-11T22:32:01Z;Milan bourse in derivatives trading outage;;A technical glitch ended trading on Borsa Italiana’s derivatives market more than two hours before its intended close on Thursday as the Italian exchange’s technology infrastructure struggled to cope amid high trading volumes and market volatility.The Milan bourse did not give a reason for Thursday’s technical issues on IDEM, its derivatives arm, which uses technology owned by TMX Group, the Canadian exchange.The group blamed a technical error for halting trading in equity instruments on IDEM at around 14:10BST. Although the exchange said it was considering extending trading hours, the venue failed to reopen and it informed clients that trading in FTSEMIB index products would not resume on Thursday. “The session is closed,” it confirmed. The Milan-based bourse began using the technology, named Sola, last December.The closure is the second glitch on the bourse in six trading days. It came amid another day of volatile trading on European markets on fears over the health of the European financial system and rumours of a European ban on short selling. A week ago Borsa Italiana, which is owned by the London Stock Exchange, was forced to suspended its FTSE MIB Index half an hour before the close.Several other exchanges around the world, including Nasdaq OMX, NYSE Euronext and TMX Group have all suffered temporary technical glitches in recent days as trading venues face record trading volumes and data message traffic sent across their systems. The New York Stock Exchange alone this week has seen more than 2bn data messages - quotes and trades - a day sent to its venue, an all-time record.Glitches have become more common in recent months as exchanges look to upgrade their old systems to attract investors who use the fastest and most efficient computers possible to compete on trading.Seperately, the LSE won a deal on Thursday to provide technology for equity and fixed-income trading to the Oslo Børs, Norway’s exchange.
321;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-08-11T16:30:45Z;Volatility boosts revenue at exchanges;;Exchanges are reaping a revenue bonanza as volatility drives trading in equities and derivatives to record levels, but some analysts are already warning of lean times ahead.“Exchanges, market makers and brokers are having very busy days right now,” said Niamh Alexander, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, in a note. “But we’re not expecting this to be the ‘new normal’ and history has shown that periods of extraordinary activity are often followed by a long calm after the storm.”Exchanges have been among the few winners amid the market turmoil since they earn a fee every time a trade is done.Trading activity has been at unprecedented levels, with Bloomberg processing 43.7bn “ticks” – that is, a change in a security’s bid and offer prices – on Wednesday.That was a 33 per cent increase on the previous peak level of March. It compares with 27.5bn ticks amid the “flash crash” of last year in the US.CME Group, operator of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade, has seen a 93 per cent rise in average daily volume across all its products – unprecedented for August, normally one of the quietest months.The Johannesburg Stock Exchange traded 230,797 trades on Wednesday, 12 per cent higher than the previous record in June last year.Sandler O’Neill analyst Rich Repetto noted that volumes at US options exchanges were especially strong, up 81.6 per cent this month so far. He said there was likely to be “upside” to his firm’s estimate for third quarter earnings per share at the Chicago Board Options Exchange of 39 cents.Yet Ms Alexander warned of a “pullback in risk taking and market participation” and that the risk of no volume growth was already priced into the sector.“Implied [earnings] multiples to current 2012 estimates are 20-30 per cent below three year median multiples, suggesting these stocks are already priced for volume to stagnate,” she said, citing Nasdaq OMX, IntercontinentalExchange and NYSE Euronext.Daniel Fannon, analyst at broker Jefferies, said: “With the latest move in the markets, the earnings outlook for the [exchanges and brokers] group has changed materially.”Volumes had already started to slow to “a very sluggish pace” in July, according to Barclays Capital, which lowered its volume forecasts across the board during the last earnings round that month, given the weak volume environment.In one sign of investor concern over CME Group, the Chicago-based operator’s shares fell 10 per cent in early trade on Thursday, twice as much as the average falls in the share prices of other big exchanges that day.That was seen as a sign of worry over future levels of activity in the eurodollar, short-term interest rate futures contracts that are the CME’s flagship products, contributing about a quarter of group revenues.Such contracts – especially near-term dated maturities – are traded actively when interest rates are moving or when markets expect the interest rate cycle to change. The US Federal Reserve this week said that it was likely to keep short term interest rates steady until 2013.However Howard Chen, Credit Suisse analyst, argued that while the CME is “highly leveraged” to interest rate futures products its business was increasingly diverse, with other products including energy derivatives, providing 22 per cent of revenues, and equity indices, commodities, foreign exchange and metals making up the rest.Mr Repetto said: “While we expect the extended ceiling on short term interest rates will continue to negatively impact eurodollar volumes, it’s too early to tell how longer term interest rate and commodity futures will be impacted.”Roger Freeman, an analyst at Barclays, argued that exchanges could yet ride out any volume weakness because some of them have an increasingly diverse source of revenue. NYSE Euronext has reduced its share of revenue from transactions to 47 per cent of group revenue in the second quarter, from 52 per cent for the same quarter a year earlier.Nasdaq OMX’s share of US equity trading fell to 22 per cent in the second quarter, from 22.8 per cent in the same period last year, pulling down the amount that Nasdaq earned from charging fees each time a trade is done. But it more than made up for that by growing its options market shares and revenues, and through earnings from a relatively new business area called “market services”.Mr Freeman said: “The [exchanges] group has historically been highly levered to higher volume environments, considering the high variability in exchange margins based on volumes. However, more recently we have seen the exchanges broaden their revenue base, earning an increasing portion of revenues from non-transaction oriented areas.”The question still dogging investors, however, will be whether recent extreme volatility continues and what effect that will have on exchange and broker volumes.Mr Repetto of Sandler O’Neill said there were differences with the last two spikes in volatility: the immediate 2008 financial crisis, and last year’s “flash crash” in US markets.“While both previous volatility spikes were related to macro-economic shocks, the credit crisis of late 2008 had a profound effect on the global economy, regulatory environment, and leverage/capital in the global financial system.“The flash crash was also triggered by a faltering global economy but contained a technical component, which was triggered by a liquidity void that shook the credibility of the markets. And while it is much easier to look backward at the causes of volatility spikes, still we leave it to investors to decide whether the downgrade of the US debt by S&P is reflective of the credit crisis, or more technically driven, like the flash crash, or somewhere in between,” Mr Repetto said.
322;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Tech Beat: Industry struggles with tide of data;;The technical issues that halted trading last week on NYSE Liffe, one of Europe’s largest derivatives trading platforms, have highlighted one of the most profound, yet most hidden, revolutions in trading of recent years.The platform, owned by NYSE Euronext, explained in an apology to customers that a problem with its outgoing messaging system caused the 90-minute outage, which occurred amid heavy trading and volatility on the markets.Borsa Italiana, NYSE Euronext’s European cash equities business, TMX Group and Nasdaq OMX‘s Nordic derivatives market also faced problems at the end of last week. In the US, futures and equities alone saw more than 130m trades on Friday, generating 950 gigabytes of data, according to Nanex, a US market data analytics company.The effect of heavy trading was to drive up messaging traffic, comprised of all the trade and quote data sent to and from trading venues. That flow is the lifeblood of the world’s markets and its growth in recent years has been little short of staggering.From virtually nothing in 2003, it climbed to 1.5m messages a second on US markets a year ago and reached a peak of 5.3m messages a second last week, according to MarketDataPeaks, a website that tracks data feeds from US exchanges.The explosion has come from the fragmentation of the market into alternative trading venues, dark pools and the existing exchanges. The switch to electronic trading and the rise of high-frequency trading have also been decisive.High-frequency trading, or HFT, refers to a variety of trading strategies that use ultra-fast systems and sophisticated computer programs to generate, send and carry out or cancel orders, all in a split second. The strategies make tiny amounts of money per share, on a huge volume of small trades. HFT, in its various forms, now accounts for between 60 and 70 per cent of average daily volume on equity markets.Corporate information officers and regulators alike are preparing for those numbers to get bigger still. Electronic trading platforms such as swap execution facilities are being mandated by incoming financial markets regulation in the US and Europe, which will generate yet more message traffic.The growth of co-location services is opening the markets to traders who might previously not have been able to afford to participate, generating still further activity.Companies such as Getco, the US market making firm, and Deutsche Bank are making their proprietary algorithms available to other traders, allowing hedge funds and mutual funds to directly mimic the methods of high-frequency traders.But, as events last week highlighted, trading now occurs at speeds never before seen. The biggest issue the industry faces is the ability to understand and process data from different types of order flow in real time.The effects are multi-sided. “We keep having to re-engineer more capacity to react to spikes,” the head of electronic trading at one large London-based investment bank told FT Trading Room.But it also comes at a time when regulators are showing fresh interest in the issue of messaging. Two weeks ago, Esma, the new European markets regulator, proposed that regulated markets and multilateral trading facilities should “have electronic trading systems with sufficient capacity to accommodate reasonably foreseeable volumes of messaging” but still ensure there are controls on message flows.Illustrating the precautions exchanges take, Esma’s fact-finding questionnaire discovered that bourses typically take the data from the order flow of their busiest trading days and then test their systems by multiplying those figures by up to 20 times.The controls Esma referred to are the action that exchanges can take to limit the volume of messages that individual trading firms can send, a practice known in the industry as “throttling”. But many exchanges have spent heavily on attracting HFT customers and are usually loath to limit the business of their customers.If last week showed anything, it is that the industry will face a renewed emphasis on understanding the flow and quality of the data it is being bombarded with.“Trading fast is good, but ‘fast and dumb’ is dangerous,” says Mark Palmer, chief executive of Streambase, a US software group that provides tools to analyse data. “But the bigger technical problem is actually getting more data and scrubbing it,” he said.Scrubbing refers to the process of detecting and correcting or removing corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, table or database. Several heads of investment bank electronic trading desks said part of the issue that arose in the Italian market last Thursday was uncertainty over the accuracy of its data.Streambase develops an emerging technology called complex event processing, a software that can process vast amounts of data in real-time, but other tools are on the market.Kyte Group, the broker owned by US group GFI, has adopted a system developed by ITRS, a UK trading technology platform, that measures the comparative latency of data from different exchanges to alternative trading platforms. ITRS has also supplied Thomson Reuters with a platform to monitor the performance of a financial firm’s market infrastructure in real time.Logica, a UK IT services group, and Tibco, a US trading technology company, on Wednesday unveiled a service that could handle 5m messages a day on a single hub. It was particularly aimed at exchanges and banks that “are currently burdened with disparate legacy systems”.It is unlikely to be the last such move. Expect a raft of partnerships, deals and potentially even small acquisitions by trading venues in the coming months.
323;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-08-10T17:36:18Z;Hong Kong exchange hit by hackers;;Computer hackers forced the Hong Kong stock exchange’s website to crash, prompting the bourse to suspend trading in the shares of seven companies including HSBC and the exchange operator itself.The cyberattack, which deprived investors of important announcements from listed companies, came just hours before Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, the world’s largest by market capitalisation, announced its interim results.HKEx is the second high-profile global exchange to admit to an attack this year after Nasdaq OMX, which owns the second-largest US exchange, said criminals had tried to penetrate a web-based service for customers. In both cases, the exchanges stressed that their trading systems had not been affected.Charles Li, HKEx chief executive, said the collapse of the website on which local-listed companies announce price sensitive information appeared to be the result of “a malicious attack by outside hacking”. But he said it was unclear who the hackers were or what they hoped to gain from the attack. “We’re digging into that particular question right now.”HKEx took the decision to suspend trading in the shares of the seven companies that were due to make announcements during the lunch break, including China Power International and Cathay Pacific, the airline. HSBC, the most liquid stock in Hong Kong, was also suspended.The world’s largest exchanges have improved security following an attack on the Nasdaq, which sparked an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Nasdaq admitted last month it faced “constant attack” from hackers every day.Breaking into an exchange’s trading system would be extremely hard because of the multiple layers of security, according to experts. Many exchanges run their trading operations away from the internet on a separate private network, often with its own computing language.When its news website was down, HKEx told market participants to obtain listed company announcements through its bulletin board, a back-up website.The exchange is placing advertisements in Hong Kong newspapers to inform retail investors about the unprecedented situation.If the website remains unstable on Thursday, the bulletin board will be used to disseminate information but stocks will be not suspended, said Mark Dickens, head of listing at HKEx.The exchange has drafted in a team of external computer experts to work out how the website was brought down. It has reported the attack to the Securities and Futures Commission, Hong Kong’s regulator.The exchange emphasised that its other systems were not affected and trading in its securities and derivatives markets continued to operate normally. The bourse’s core trading systems are not directly connected to the internet, it said.Over the past few years hackers have been deploying increasingly sophisticated malware to attack the operating systems of companies, exchanges and governments. Sony, the Japanese electronics group, disclosed in April that more than 70m users of its online gaming network had their personal details stolen by hackers.McAfee, the computer security company, said last week that it had uncovered a five-year long campaign of cyber attacks on the networks of governments, organisations and businesses, including the UN and 13 defence contractors.HKEx announced profits of about HK$2.6bn (US$333m) in the first half, an increase of 14 per cent compared with the same period last year, in line with analyst expectations. The company’s shares jumped 2.6 per cent before being suspended from trading during the midday break.www.ft.com/tradingroom
324;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-08-07T21:43:54Z;Asia and LatAm ripe for bourse consolidation;;The failure of a string of exchange mergers means bourses in Asia and Latin America stand the best chance eventually of consolidating, leaving their western counterparts to limit themselves to less ambitious partnerships, a new report says.PwC, the auditor and consultancy, says in the report out on Monday that with growth in emerging markets set to outstrip the west, exchanges in Asia and Latin America would benefit.The value of share trading in Asia grew by 20 per cent in the decade to 2010, while value in the Americas and Europe, the Middle East and Africa fell by 14 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively.Shamshad Ali, partner at PwC, said: “Talk of an end to consolidation in the stock exchange sector may be largely true for the more mature western European markets, but Asia and Latin America are likely to see significant mergers and acquisitions in the future – if regulatory hurdles can be overcome.“Over the next five years, significant M&A activity will be driven from the emerging markets as local exchanges seek growth opportunities outside their home markets,” Mr Ali said.A wave of global exchange mergers kicked off last October when SGX, the Singapore exchange, agreed to combine with its counterpart in Australia, ASX.Four months later Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext unveiled a $9.4bn deal to combine, followed the same week by the London Stock Exchange and TMX Group, operator of the Toronto and Montreal bourses.Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), then teamed up on a counter bid for NYSE Euronext.However, all but the Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext deal collapsed amid a combination of nationalist opposition in the countries of the target exchanges, and antitrust hurdles.PwC said that the Asian exchange landscape was still limited by the lack of “cross-border market liberalisation measures” and less reliance than in the west on sophisticated electronic trading. Many exchanges in the region are also partly owned by local interests, and not publicly listed.However, the firm said it may only be a matter of time before demutualisation gained ground and regulatory hurdles were broken down. High operating leverage and heightened competition have suppressed margins across the sector and would “continue to provide a compelling economic rationale for consolidation”.Western exchanges could even face the prospect of becoming targets themselves, as economic growth in Brazil, Russia, India and China – so-called “Bric” countries – could fuel the emergence of a next generation of “mega exchanges” from those regions.The report suggested that the most viable growth options for western exchanges are to focus on developing post-trade clearing and settlement capabilities or fostering ties with emerging market players.Mr Ali said: “Traditional exchanges cannot afford to ignore the dominant role the emerging markets are likely to play in the future exchanges landscape. They will need to look closely at different models to compete against, or collaborate with, their emerging market counterparts.”
325;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-08-05T20:36:22Z;Volume of deal messages tests exchanges;;"Extreme volatility on Friday exposed the vulnerability of electronic trading systems across Europe and North America, as record numbers of messages carrying dealing instructions and data knocked out systems.The amount of data generated by the day’s trading in US futures and equities alone saw over 130m trades on Friday, generating 950 gigabytes of data, according to Nanex, a market data provider. It was the first time either mark had been reached, they said.One senior trader said: “The amount of [trade] executions generated is absolutely huge. We are breaking all sorts of records today, like numbers of messages generated.”The strain on exchanges has underlined the extent to which the market is dominated by electronic trading, in particular the use of algorithms that either react to news or data, or are programmed to try to anticipate them. That can cause sudden, sharp movements in prices.Banks, hedge funds and other investment firms use such devices to gain a trading edge. Such “high-frequency” trading strategies, which rely on sending and receiving high volumes of trade messages, are no longer the domain of a few small firms.On Friday, the strain was acute at many trading desks in London as some exchanges with older technology could not cope.Retail brokers in the UK struggled to obtain electronic quotes from market makers as Proquote, the LSE-owned system, suffered problems in trading between 8am and 9am.“We were asking for a quote and getting nothing back,” said John Douthwaite, chief executive of SimplyStockbroking, estimating that the broker had been unable to obtain electronic quotes for 40 minutes. The firm had reverted to trying to obtain quotes from market makers by
telephone, he said.The LSE said the Proquote problem resulted from “the sheer volume of requests that hit the system” but played down its effect. The issues were “intermittent” and may have affected some participants for only 30 seconds.TD Waterhouse, one of the biggest online brokers in the UK, said that market makers were also temporarily withdrawing or reducing their electronic quoting to avoid buying too much stock as prices fell - so preventing investors from obtaining quotes.For a second day the Milan bourse in Italy had problems with market data for its blue-chip FTSE MIB 30 index and forced BATS Europe, a pan-European trading platform which competes with the Milan bourse, to take Italian market data out of its feeds.Nasdaq OMX experienced problems at its derivatives market, citing issues “with pricing updates on the Nordic derivatives markets and are working hard now to troubleshoot the issue”.A trader at a US bank said: “We’re beginning to see the European market infrastructure, especially around some exchanges, start to creak. We’re having a tough time with price discovery.”However a trader at another bank said: “Pointing the finger [at HFT] at this point is impossible. There’s just too much going on today.”Exchanges in North America had troubles as well. The New York Stock Exchange said that a brief outage affected 22 symbols, including 3M, though no other exchanges declared “self help”, meaning to stop routing trades to NYSE.NYSE Euronext on Friday apologised to customers as it explained that earlier problems with the outbound messaging system from its trading engine were behind a 90-minute outage on Thursday on Liffe, its futures platform.Widely-traded contracts such euribor, eurodollar, and some FTSE index futures were hit, leaving investors unable to trade on one of the busiest trading days of the year. Earlier in the week the group also said previous glitches on its European cash equities market had arisen in part from high volumes of shares and using older software.In Canada, start-up exchange Chi-X Canada did stop routing some orders to the Toronto Stock Exchange, part of the TMX Group, citing a problem with market data feeds."
326;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-08-04T17:41:48Z;D Börse and NYSE Euronext tie-up faces probe;;Plans to create the world’s largest exchanges group by combining Deutsche Börse with NYSE Euronext are to be submitted to an in-depth probe after European antitrust authorities raised “significant concerns” over its dominance in derivatives trading.The move came after Brussels launched an initial investigation in June into the planned $10bn tie-up, which would create a transatlantic group larger than the CME Group, ICE or Nasdaq OMX in the US, as well as the London Stock Exchange.It also marks the first time that exchange ownership of the crucial post-trade business of clearing in a so-called “vertical silo” has come under antitrust scrutiny in Europe.Deutsche Börse owns its own futures exchange – Eurex – and clearing house, a position that would be strengthened with the addition of NYSE Euronext’s Liffe futures exchange, based in London.Banks, which are among both exchanges’ biggest customers, have expressed concern about what they say is the increased market power in derivatives trading and clearing. Derivatives generate significantly more profits for exchanges than share trading.A combined Eurex and Liffe would give the group a combined share of almost 95 per cent of exchange-traded derivatives.The commission said: “At this stage, [we are] mainly concerned that due to the removal of an important competitor, the merger would have a negative impact on innovation in derivatives products and technology solutions.“Moreover, the possibilities for fee competition may be reduced due to increased difficulties for competitors to enter the market. Customers who could be affected by this include pension funds, mutual funds and retail banks, as well as professional brokers and investment banks.”Brussels said its investigation had revealed concerns that without access to the merged company’s enlarged clearing facilities – “ie: in the presence of a closed ‘vertical silo’” – entry by rival derivatives platforms would be made more difficult in a market already characterised by high barriers to entry.It also singled out concerns over equities trading and settlement, and index licensing. That refers to the ownership by exchanges of companies that compile stock indices, such as Deutsche Börse’s ownership of the Stoxx index company.Joaquín Almunia, EU competition commissioner, said: “The Commission needs to make sure that markets which are at the heart of the financial sector remain competitive and efficiently deliver to users.”Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext argue that their derivatives combination would face significant competition from over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets, including when such instruments are shifted on to formal trading systems, as required under the Dodd-Frank act and similar reforms working their way through Europe.“[We] remain confident that [our] planned combination will be approved,” they said. It would “bring together two complementary derivatives businesses, giving them the scale and depth to compete effectively in a global industry with many powerful participants – exchanges, OTC platforms, banks and clearers – and to keep pace with increased competition driven by technology and regulatory changes”.Both exchanges have won overwhelming shareholder support for the deal, with Deutsche Börse saying this week it had received 95 per cent acceptance rate from its shareholders.Brussels has 90 working days to complete its probe.
327;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-08-03T18:49:14Z;ICE posts record results for second quarter;;IntercontinentalExchange, the US exchanges operator, reported record second-quarter earnings after strong demand for over-the-counter derivatives and commodity futures trading.Revenues at the Atlanta-based ICE rose 10 per cent year on year to $325m in the three months to June. Net income rose 19 per cent to $121m compared with a year ago. Diluted earnings per share rose 21 per cent to $1.64.The results outstripped an 8 per cent profit increase earlier this week from its principal rival CME Group, the world’s largest futures market. They also underlined how exchanges focused on trading of over-the-counter and energy derivatives have outpaced the earnings of rivals focused on equities.NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX, the two largest US equity exchanges, found trading tough in cash equities and derivatives trading, particularly in Europe, but their performances were boosted by non-trading revenues, such as listing fees and providing IT services to other exchanges.ICE said its earnings had been driven primarily by record trading volume in ICE’s Brent crude and gasoil futures and options contracts, as well as solid OTC energy volumes.Jeff Sprecher, chief executive, said the WTI crude contract, owned by rival CME, was no longer the world’s benchmark for oil prices. “While WTI remains an important US oil benchmark to us, it no longer reflects global prices,” he said.The period also saw ICE pull out of a joint $11bn bid with Nasdaq OMX for NYSE Euronext, which would have given ICE a strong position in the European derivatives market. The failed bid contributed to a 14 per cent increase in operating expenses in the period.However, shares in ICE fell $3.09 to $116 in New York after it lowered guidance for revenues from clearing credit default swaps. The group made $30m from CDS clearing in the first half but forecast it would make $65m to $67m for the year, down from its previous estimate of about $70m to $73m.The group added it was preparing to set up platforms to comply with incoming regulatory changes in the Dodd-Frank Act, even though some rules will not be finalised until the end of the year. Authorities in Washington and Brussels are looking to move more over-the-counter derivatives trading, such as swaps, through electronic trading platforms and clearing houses.“Despite delays, we’re moving ahead on key provisions to bring needed certainty to the markets,” Mr Sprecher said.
328;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-07-31T21:31:30Z;Traders cautious on exchanges tie-up;;Some of the largest electronic trading companies have given a qualified welcome to the proposed combination of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, warning that while it could “create market efficiencies” regulators had to “mitigate its increased market power”.Their response to the deal, which would create the world’s largest exchange by market capitalisation and number of company listings, highlights divisions among market participants over the merits of the combination.Rivals such as the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq OMX have attacked the proposed $9.4bn deal as creating a monopoly in derivatives trading.While some banks privately echo such concerns, others say combining the two exchanges’ derivatives platforms – NYSE Liffe and Eurex – could save them money by doing away with overlapping infrastructure such as clearing services.A “position paper” out on Monday reveals the views of automated traders, many of which use “high-frequency” trading, on the deal. Their views carry weight as they account for about half of US equity markets and 35 per cent of European markets, and are also active in derivatives.The European Principal Traders Association, a lobby group made up of 17 such companies, said: “While [we support] the proposed merger …we believe the competition and regulatory authorities need to mitigate, where possible, the increased market power of the merged entity.”The EPTA includes the European arms of Getco and Citadel Securities, two Chicago-based market-making firms, and Optiver, IMC and Flow Traders, three Amsterdam-based companies that are among the largest market makers in Europe. The views of the EPTA, set up under the auspices of the US Futures Industry Association, come as exchanges, banks and financial industry associations have been responding to a questionnaire distributed weeks ago by Brussels antitrust authorities probing the proposed deal.Brussels is expected this week to extend its probe to a deeper, so-called “level two” inquiry.The EPTA said that while a merged Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext clearing businesses would “result in substantial margin efficiencies for market participants”, the combination would still leave them with “little choice as to where their trades are cleared”.The firms said there was an opportunity to address competition in derivatives clearing given the emergence of such issues in European reforms of the derivatives and clearing business, known as the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir) – equivalent to the Dodd-Frank Act in the US.The EPTA highlighted a fresh area of concern in the way exchanges operate data centres used to attract high-frequency traders.Exchanges allow electronic traders to place their computers as close as possible to their own trading systems, known as “co-location”. Being close to an exchange’s systems – usually a matter of less than a metre – helps shave microseconds off trades.Data centres are operated by exchanges but also by independent operators, such as Verizon, Nasdaq-listed Equinix and Interxion, listed on the New York Stock Exchange.The EPTA said: “Although many exchanges provide fair and equal access to co-location facilities, there is a growing trend for exchanges to insource the operation of data centres, thereby creating potentially undesirable forms of vertical silos.“The costs of co-location and network connectivity into these data centres are potentially prohibitive for many participants.”Last month Swedish authorities raided the Stockholm bourse operated by Nasdaq OMX, in a search for evidence of “possible anticompetitive co-operation or abuse of dominant position” in the sector, without identifying Nasdaq OMX or Verizon.
329;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;More clearing choice for European trades;;Traders of European shares will for the first time on Friday have greater choice over where their trades are sent for clearing when a new system comes into operation at BATS Europe, one of the region’s leading trading platforms.The system, known as “preferred interoperability”, will let customers of BATS choose between three clearing houses: LCH.Clearnet, based in London, x-Clear of Switzerland, or EuroCCP, the European clearing arm of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation of the US.Hitherto firms carrying out equities trades on BATS were forced to use EMCF, which has been the designated clearer for BATS since the platform was launched in 2008. EMCF will still be available.By being able to route their trades done on BATS to a range of alternative clearers, traders will now be able to choose between clearing houses based on price and service – an option that has been largely absent in the European equity markets.Next week Euro CCP is expected to reveal the names of a number of firms that have agreed to use Euro CCP as part of the BATS arrangement. That is expected to help generate more clearing business for Euro CCP, which has struggled since it was launched in 2007 to act as clearer for Turquoise, which was at the time an independent trading platform backed by banks, and is now controlled by the London Stock Exchange. Some trades done on BATS are likely to be cleared through Euro CCP, and not on EMCF, which had all the business until now.EMCF, owned by ABN Amro of the Netherlands and Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator, has not signed up to the preferred interoperability.The BATS move has reignited hopes that so-called interoperability between clearing houses in Europe will become a reality more than four years after the industry signed up to an agreement to implement it. That could help reduce post-trade costs in Europe, which are significantly higher than in the US.However the BATS move – and therefore the scope of interoperability – only covers the share of the market that trades on BATS Europe. That is because for interoperability to take effect across the whole of Europe’s share markets, rival trading platforms and the operators with the largest shares of trading European stocks – the LSE, Euronext, Deutsche Börse and Chi-X Europe, would have to agree to take part by allowing their “trade feeds” to connect to other CCPs beyond the one that each currently uses.BATS Europe accounts for 8.2 per cent of the FTSE 100, and 5.2 per cent of trading in continental European markets such as the CAC-40, according to Thomson Reuters.While clearing fees have come down in the last two years as clearing houses, or central counterparties (CCPs), have come under pressure from exchanges and trading platforms to lower fees, BATS believes there is further to go.Mark Hemsley, BATS Europe chief executive, told FT Trading Room: “Various [CCPs] are coming up with pricing schedules to try and attract business since firms can now elect their CCPs so ultimately what we hope will happen is it will encourage competition in terms of pricing and service.”
330;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-07-27T16:37:58Z;Nasdaq downplays acquisition talk;;Nasdaq OMX has played down investor expectations that it might make a large acquisition as the US exchange operator reported higher second-quarter earnings that beat market expectations.The comments by Robert Greifeld, chief executive, come after weeks of speculation that Nasdaq might be tempted to make a move on the London Stock Exchange, after the collapse of the UK bourse’s attempted merger with TMX Group of Canada.“As we evaluate current valuations in the marketplace today, including our own, we realise that there are a number of external and internal alternatives for capital deployment that we need to consider in order to maximise returns for our shareholders,” Mr Greifeld told analysts on a conference call. “To the extent that external alternatives do not generate adequate returns, we will remain focused on the substantial organic opportunities to generate attractive returns on capital.”Asked later by the Financial Times if that would apply in the case of any bid for the LSE, Mr Greifeld said: “It constraints what we can do, yes.”Nasdaq reported a rise in net income to $112m, compared with $108m the previous year’s quarter, and diluted earnings per share of 62 cents, compared with 52 cents last time.That was helped by better than expected revenues of $416m, a rise of 7 per cent over the same period a year earlier.Nasdaq’s share of US equity trading fell to 22 per cent, from 22.8 per cent in the second quarter last year, pulling down the amount that Nasdaq earned from charging fees each time a trade is done to $59m.But it more than made up for that by growing its options market shares and revenues, and through earnings from a relatively new business area called “market services”.That includes a suite of businesses associated with being involved in equity markets beyond pure matching of trades on the exchange – which Nasdaq calls “the match”. They include pre-trade risk management, real time” market surveillance, and collocation, which allows traders to place their computers next to an exchange’s matching system to cut trading times.Mr Greifeld said: “It’s the first quarter we’re saying ‘you can’t really think of the equity business as really being just the match’.”He said that as a result the yield achieved per matched trade had risen as revenues had come in from services such as FTEN, a pre-trade risk management company acquired last year, and Smarts, a real-time surveillance company which Nasdaq also bought last year.“Over the past four years, the total yield per matched trade has grown by 25 per cent, despite the fact that the rate on the pure match has declined slightly,” Mr Greifeld said.The increased cash flow had allowed Nasdaq to cut its net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to 2.1 times, from 2.3 times. Lee Shavel, chief financial officer, said: “Sustained strong cash flow will allow us to continue to deleverage and put us in a position to explore efficient capital allocation alternatives as the year progresses.”In spite of playing down a large exchange acquisition, Nasdaq is nonetheless pursuing a bid for a minority stake in LCH.Clearnet, the UK-based clearing house in which Markit, a post-trade services company, and Nasdaq rival NYSE Euronext are also interested.Asked about progress with the bid, Mr Greifeld said: “We are having productive discussions with the parties. We obviously see the strategic merits.”He said a combination of International Derivatives Clearing Group – Nasdaq’s fledgling interest rate swaps clearing house – and SwapClear, LCH.Clearnet’s 11-year old interest rate swaps clearing service, “would be a huge global competitor”.Nasdaq’s shares were down 74 cents, or 3 per cent, to $23.55 in afternoon trading in New York.
331;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-07-20T15:58:45Z;LSE keeps open mind on new Asia tie-ups;;The London Stock Exchange on Wednesday said large exchange mergers were still likely, signalling that it was still open to doing deals in spite of the failure of its merger with Canada's TMX Group and pointing to Asia where markets were “opening up”.The LSE’s hopes of striking a transatlantic deal with TMX, operator of the Toronto and Montreal exchanges, collapsed last month after TMX failed to muster enough shareholder support. Since then the LSE’s shares have risen amid speculation that the exchange could become a takeover target.Chris Gibson-Smith, LSE chairman, told an annual meeting of shareholders it had been disappointing not to clinch the Canadian deal. “To some extent you win some and you lose some. But there are and will be other deals in the future. We’re still actively thinking about what we might do,” he said.Asked by the Financial Times if he believed the LSE would still be an independent company in six months’ time Xavier Rolet, LSE chief executive, said: “I believe so, given our strong and improving performance. There is no reason for it not to.“We remain open of course to things that can be accretive to shareholder value. We are not ideological about anything but there is no reason for us not to consider faster independent growth as long as it makes sense for shareholders.”Mr Rolet said one area for possible growth was expanding securities services using Monte Titoli, the LSE’s Italian central securities depository.The comments came as the LSE reported a 14 per cent rise in first-quarter income boosted by a string of company listings and higher clearing revenue. The increase in total income to £190m was helped by a 58 per cent jump in income in post-trade services, which includes the LSE’s Italian clearing arm.Speculation about possible interest in the LSE from Nasdaq OMX has receded in recent weeks as the US exchange operator has appeared more focused on a bid for a minority stake in LCH.Clearnet, which acts as clearing house for UK shares traded on the LSE.Mr Rolet signalled possible opportunities in Asia. “I see and hear on my very frequent trips to Asia – which by the way continued throughout the TMX transaction – big markets that for a long time have been closed really now considering opening up, letting competition in because the same old questions about performance, fees, efficiency are being asked and I think there will be opportunities.”Asked if deals with SGX, the Singapore exchange, or with Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, were possible, he said: “On specific names I won’t comment. But what I would say is …look to markets where competition potentially is coming and where regulators are thinking connectivity might be a good thing to bring down cost, expand the range of products that are distributed rather than keep infrastructure in a national silo.”Exchanges in Australia, Japan and Hong Kong have started overhauling their businesses to gear up for competition from similar alternative trading systems that have eaten into the market share of European exchanges.The LSE saw a 65 per cent rise in the amount of money raised through initial public offerings and other capital raisings, with the number of new issues up 26 per cent to 54 in the quarter ended June. Companies listing included Glencore, DP World and Salvatore Ferragamo, the fashion house.In recent weeks a logjam of IPOs has been building in Europe after almost $10bn of flotations were shelved in the first half of the year due to market volatility and investors disillusionment with recent listings.Asked if the LSE was also seeing a fall-off in IPO plans, Doug Webb, LSE chief financial officer, said: “When we look at the pipeline we still see lots of opportunity. Not everything will come through but when you have debt in the pipeline absent any external shocks there is plenty in the hopper for the September-November period.”The LSE has been making more money at its Italian clearing arm after increasing the number of Italian banks it uses to place funds from the clearing house in short-term, interest-bearing deposits.Post-trade services, including Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia, the LSE’s Italian clearing house under Borsa Italiana, account for 23 per cent of LSE group revenue.Clearing houses not only make money by charging a fee for transactions cleared but also by making a turn on the margin, or collateral, posted by market participants and pooled at the clearing house for use to help in case of default by any clearing member.Mr Webb said that the “overall quantum of margin” was up at Cassa “as growth in fixed income business plays through and we are using a wider pool of 15 banks for depositing margin funds”.He said the LSE had about €8bn ($11.3bn) of collateral held in Italy and was able with the wider pool of banks to “negotiate an improvement over Euribor” – the overnight European bank lending rate.Shares in LSE were up 1.6 per cent at £10.12 in morning trading.
332;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-07-18T08:56:42Z;Nasdaq OMX mulled US listings split;;Nasdaq OMX held talks with BATS Global Markets about the possibility of selling it a significant share of the combined primary listings business of Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange in an attempt to overcome any antitrust hurdles, two people familiar with the issue said.The disclosure is a sign of the length to which Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq OMX chief executive, was prepared to go to ensure that his joint counter-bid for NYSE Euronext with IntercontinentalXchange (ICE), would pass scrutiny by the US Department of Justice.A key issue in the department’s examination of the joint bid, which was designed to prise NYSE Euronext away from its agreed merger with Deutsche Börse, was the combination of the initial public offering business of the two US exchanges.It was that which eventually scuppered the deal, after the department made clear to Mr Greifeld and his counterpart at ICE, Jeff Sprecher, that combining the two listings businesses would reduce choice of IPO platforms for US companies.The decision surprised some, since BATS announced plans during the antitrust review that it planned to launch a primary listings business, which would compete against NYSE and Nasdaq.Mr Greifeld approached Joe Ratterman, BATS chief executive, suggesting that it buy a portion of the Nasdaq-NYSE listings business, the two people said.Nasdaq OMX and BATS both declined to comment.Mr Ratterman was interested in Mr Greifeld’s offer, one person said. But the talks broke down after it became clear that antitrust authorities were unlikely to support the Nasdaq-ICE counter-bid.
333;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-07-17T19:52:32Z;Exchanges ‘need rethink’ over failed tie-ups;;Exchanges will have to “rethink their global strategies” because of unexpectedly strong scrutiny of proposed bourse tie-ups from antitrust regulators, according to IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), one of the world’s biggest exchanges.A string of proposed mergers has come unstuck in recent months, either through nationalist opposition in the home market of exchanges perceived as the targets of takeovers, or as antitrust authorities have moved to stymie combinations amid concerns they could reduce competition.The London Stock Exchange’s planned tie-up with TMX Group of Canada evaporated last month after the UK bourse failed to convince enough TMX shareholders to back the deal.A rival bid for TMX from a consortium of Canadian banks and pension funds, known as Maple, appeared to have helped swing the decision by arguing against Canada’s exchange falling into foreign hands.Also last month a planned purchase by BATS Global Markets, a US operator of trading platforms, and Chi-X Europe, a pan-European share trading facility, was thrown into doubt after the UK’s Office of Fair Trading referred it to Britain’s main antitrust authority.Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, said: “There’s been a marked change in the way regulators look at exchanges generally. The good news is that they are looking to exchanges to provide more transparency to prevent another meltdown.“The bad news is that they want to ensure a lot more exchanges to ensure competition. So the impediments are now higher than they were a few years ago and I think it’s going to cause everyone to rethink their global strategies,” he told the Financial Times.Mr Sprecher was a victim of antitrust scrutiny in April, when the US Department of Justice told Nasdaq OMX and its partner ICE that a proposed joint counter-bid for NYSE Euronext, the US exchange operator, would not be approved because it involved combining Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchanges’ company listings businesses. That would have reduced choice in the primary listings business for US companies.Last month antitrust authorities at the European Commission sent market participants a detailed questionnaire on the proposed combination of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse – target of the failed Nasdaq/ICE counter-bid.Last week, Börse shareholders gave overwhelming support to the deal. But it still faces formidable hurdles in Brussels which will examine – among other issues – its creation of the dominant market for trading and clearing of derivatives in Europe. It would also create a company with about 30 per cent of trading in cash equities in the region.Canada’s competition bureau is in the throes of reviewing a hostile bid for TMX by Maple. Its decision is expected in the autumn.Reports surfaced last week that Maple is in direct talks with TMX. The exchange group was precluded from negotiating with Maple while the LSE offer was still on the table.Additional reporting by Bernard Simon in Toronto
334;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-07-15T17:21:05Z;Interview: ICE passed on Cetip in 2009;Sprecher aims to license technology to Brazilian group;IntercontinentalExchange, the US exchange and clearing house operator, looked at taking a stake in Cetip as far back as 2009, when the Brazilian post-trade group received its first investment from the private equity firm that this week sold its stake to ICE.The disclosure, by Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, is a sign that Brazil’s financial market infrastructure was attracting the attention of many of the world’s large exchange operators earlier than many investors may have realised.CME Group, ICE’s main rival, signed a letter of intent in 2007 with BM&F, then Brazil’s standalone futures exchange, covering a proposed cross-investment between them.Mr Sprecher said that ICE had looked at Cetip in 2009 but that “it wasn’t the right time for us”.Since then, the Bovespa stock market index has risen by 135 per cent in dollar terms and 58 per cent in local currency terms.Late on Thursday, ICE said it had agreed to buy a 12.4 per cent stake in Cetip at R$25.50 a share or about $512m, from Advent International and some other smaller shareholders. Advent took Cetip public in October 2009. Advent sold a portion of the 32 per cent stake it acquired earlier that year in the company’s IPO and sold additional shares in a block trade in January this year.ICE will take a board seat on Cetip.Speaking to FT Trading Room, Mr Sprecher said Cetip was a logical move for ICE given growth in emerging market commodities businesses and that many Brazilian banks were already using it for their post-trade needs.“Our company’s been benefiting from emerging economies because of coffee, sugar, oil and emissions – in all of which demand has been going up. And of all of the ‘Bric’ countries, Brazil is the country where we felt like having a direct investment could have long-term benefits because of how far along they are in developing a financial services infrastructure,” Mr Sprecher said.Earlier this year, ICE said it was launching BRIX, an electricity futures market, in partnership with Eike Batista, Brazil’s richest manMr Sprecher said Cetip was “going to become an important player in Brazil and it’s an entrepreneurial entity that the banks have been using for their post-trade needs, so it felt like a very good fit with ICE”.“Cetip has been looking to license world class technology and deal with the rapid growth of its business. We have a lot of pre- and post-trade matching technology that we hope over time we can licence to them,” Mr Sprecher said. “Cetip’s shareholder registry contains a lot of the Brazilian banks so this gives us an opportunity to work directly with them to develop post-trade services.”Asked whether it was planned to develop cash equities clearing that could be used by competitors wanting to challenge the near-monopoly of BM&FBovespa, Mr Sprecher said that was “not a priority right now”.BATS Global Markets, the US exchange group, has teamed up with Claritas, a Brazilian asset management firm, to explore the launch of a low-cost exchange in Brazil.Cetip already has a relationship with Clearstream, the settlement and custody business owned by Deutsche Börse, as part of a Bric strategy that Clearstream is pursuing.Mr Sprecher and Bob Greifeld, the Nasdaq OMX chief executive, were forced to abandon a hostile counter-bid in April for NYSE Euronext, which had agreed to merge with Deutsche Börse.“Given that Deutsche Börse is tied up with its merger, it seemed to us to make sense to enter and take a board seat and work with [Cetip] management,” Mr Sprecher said, adding that he was comfortable with Cetip continuing to do business with Clearstream.

336;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-07-14T20:09:04Z;LCH hires new CIO amid shake-up;;LCH.Clearnet has hired a former Bank of America Merrill Lynch banker, Tom Zschach, as group chief information officer in one of the first signs that the clearing house’s new chief executive, Ian Axe, is making changes to his top team.Mr Zschach, who replaces Martin Taylor, will be responsible for overseeing LCH.Clearnet’s technology infrastructure, “ensuring that the robustness and resilience of the company’s industry-leading clearing solutions is preserved”, the clearer said.LCH.Clearnet is facing unprecedented uncertainty as Mr Axe pushes through a radical restructuring of the group, the only remaining large user-owned clearing house in Europe.At the same time it has been presented with a joint bid from Markit and NYSE Euronext, and one from Nasdaq OMX, which is interested in a minority stake.Technology has been a running issue at LCH.Clearnet, the products of the merger in 2003 between Clearnet SA of Paris and the London Clearing House.The French and British markets that are cleared by Clearnet and LCH respectively each use different settlement netting practices. That is one reason why it has been hard to mesh the two technology platforms – one the merger’s initial ambitions.At Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Mr Zschach was managing director and co-head of global rates and currencies technology infrastructure.Before that he held several senior technology roles at investment banks, supporting fixed income, equities and derivatives businesses, including Barclays Capital, Credit Suisse First Boston, Merrill Lynch and the former Lehman Brothers.Ian Axe, chief executive, LCH.Clearnet, said: “Tom’s wealth of experience as a technology leader, coupled with his deep industry knowledge, will enable us to sustain the highest possible performance to meet the needs of our customers across the globe.“With regulators and legislators looking to introduce more products to clearing, providing a safe, reliable and robust technology infrastructure is crucial.”
337;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-07-14T15:56:33Z;D Börse investors back NYSE merger;;Deutsche Börse shareholders have supported the German exchange group’s plan to merge with NYSE Euronext, ensuring the proposed deal has cleared one of its biggest hurdles.The owners of more than 80 per cent of shares in Deutsche Börse accepted a tender offer made by the Netherlands-based holding company that will be created out of the merger. The deal had needed an acceptance rate of at least 75 per cent by the end of Wednesday.“Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext have accomplished what other recent proposed mergers were unable to: secure shareholder approval on both sides of the deal. That said, the most difficult hurdle for the proposed merger to pass still remains, which is to obtain European regulatory approval on terms that are acceptable to the two exchanges,” said Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James.NYSE Euronext investors already voted last week in favour of the transatlantic tie-up, which was announced in February and will create the world’s biggest exchange group by revenues.The two groups sweetened their offer in May by pledging a special dividend of €2 per share, after also revising upwards the estimates of synergies they could obtain from their merger.The deal – valued at $10.1bn at current share prices and exchange rates, including the special dividend if paid in full – may still need several months to win approval from European antitrust regulators.The merger is being forged after initial attempts to break up the deal through a possible counter-offer for NYSE by the two US exchanges Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange, which was abandoned in May.It is one of a string of plans for high-profile exchange tie-ups that were announced, but London Stock Exchange abandoned its bid for TMX Group of Canada while SGX of Singapore failed in an attempt to buy ASX of Australia.Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE, will be chief executive of the enlarged group and Reto Francioni, his counterpart at Deutsche Börse, will be chairman. No name for the new group has been announced, in part reflecting the sensitivities over cultural differences and various national interests that the new company intends to try to balance with a geographical spread of key staff and functions.Deutsche Börse investors are set to own 60 per cent of the enlarged group. Any who initially opposed the deal will now have an extra window in which to tender their shares, meaning the final acceptance rate may not be known until later this month.
338;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-07-13T18:33:33Z;Swedish watchdog raids stock exchange;Data centres emerge as battlegrounds;"Swedish regulators have raided the country’s stock exchange as part of an investigation into whether Nasdaq OMX, the US-based exchange operator, is trying to suppress competition from rival trading platforms in the Nordic region.Verizon, the US telecommunications company, is also involved amid claims it helped Nasdaq OMX defend its dominant position in Sweden by excluding rival exchange operators from an important data centre.The Swedish competition authority said it had visited multiple companies in a search for evidence of “possible anticompetitive co-operation or abuse of dominant position” in the sector, without identifying Nasdaq OMX or Verizon.Data centres are becoming battlegrounds between exchanges and freshly established rivals, often backed by banks and brokers.Nasdaq OMX operates exchanges in Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Iceland and has four rivals in the region: Burgundy, a trading platform backed by Nordic banks and brokers; London-based Chi-X Europe; BATS Europe, operated by Kansas City-based BATS Global Markets; and Quote MTF, a Hungarian-regulated platform based in London.Data centres are crucial to market structures as exchanges, banks and brokers compete to build the fastest, most efficient systems with transactions measured in split-seconds.Exchanges and rival platforms allow electronic traders to place their computers in data centres to be as close as possible to their own trading systems. Being close to an exchange or trading platform’s systems – usually a matter of less than a metre – helps shave microseconds off trades.Data centres are operated by exchanges but also by independent operators, such as Verizon, Nasdaq-listed Equinix and Interxion, listed on the New York Stock Exchange.The case stems from a complaint last year by Burgundy after it was refused access to a Verizon data centre used by Nasdaq OMX and most of the big Swedish banks and brokers.Olof Neiglick, Burgundy’s chief executive, told the Financial Times on Wednesday he was “very happy” the competition authority was taking the complaint seriously and said it could set a precedent for similar cases elsewhere in Europe.“This goes way beyond Sweden because it undermines the whole idea of competition between exchanges if someone can dictate who gets into which data centre,” he said.Nasdaq OMX confirmed its Stockholm premises had been visited by the Swedish competition authority and said it was co-operating with the inquiry. The raids took place last month but only publicised this week.Burgundy claims that by barring other exchange operators from its Swedish data centre, Verizon allows Nasdaq OMX to execute transactions more cheaply and faster for banks and brokers with servers in the facility. “If I cannot get into the data centre with my main competitor and largest clients, my competitive edge is . . . diminished,” Mr Neiglick said. “Speed [is] so critical that if we have to use a data centre 5km away, it [costs] milliseconds which increase the risks for our clients.”Nasdaq OMX had no comment on Burgundy’s complaint. Verizon said it was co-operating with the competition authority, but had no comment."
339;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-07-13T13:37:56Z;Icap to expand in spite of reform delays;;Icap, the world’s largest interdealer broker, confirmed on Wednesday was committed to pushing on with the expansion of new electronic trading platforms, even amid delays to the introduction of far-reaching financial markets reform.In a trading update for the three months to June 30, the broker said it had seen further growth in use of the electronic platforms it has spent heavily on to trade swaps, derivatives and fixed income products.Michael Spencer, chief executive, is aiming to take advantage of a drive by regulators in Washington and Brussels to make the vast but opaque derivatives market more transparent and efficient. Authorities want to push more bilaterally-agreed trades through electronic platforms and clearing houses.Broker-dealers have been pressing ahead with their plans even though the rules have yet to be finalised and have been pushed back to allow regulators time to write the rules.Implementation of the Dodd-Frank act has been put back about six months to the end of the year while European has postponed finalisation of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Emir), which contains similar provisions on clearing of OTC derivatives to Dodd-Frank.However, Mr Spencer ruled out making acquisitions or branching out into new areas. “We will continue to concentrate on growing our business organically, work to reduce our costs and push forward with our drive to expand our successful electronic interest rate swap platform into other currencies,” said Mr Spencer.Among the assets eyed by the market is LCH.Clearnet, the London-based clearing house, which has received offers from the London Stock Exchange, Nasdaq OMX and a joint bid from NYSE Euronext and Markit, the data provider. Icap made a bid for the business in 2009.Total revenues in the three month period dipped 4 per cent compared to last year as higher numbers of public holidays over the period restricted trading volumes. Comparative figures were also affected by increased market activity surrounding the ‘flash crash’ of May 2010. However Icap added that June saw an uptick in market volumes. The group remained comfortable with analysts’ forecasts for full-year earnings to be in the range of £366m to £402m as it expected to benefit from market uncertainty over central banks’ inflation and interest rate strategies.Icap said volumes on its EBS and BrokerTec electronic platforms for fixed income products had risen 10 per cent year-on-year to $878bn. Meanwhile it said more than 6,800 trades valued at over €510bn have been traded on iSwap, the new electronic interest rate swaps platform for over-the-counter derivatives which launched last September.It added that its post-trade services business is “back to levels we would expect” after a slow start to the 2010-11 trading year. Shares in Icap were down 1 per cent at 476p in lunchtime trade in London.
340;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-07-11T18:43:48Z;Dunkin’ IPO could raise $460m;;Dunkin’ Brands, parent company of coffee and doughnuts chain Dunkin’ Donuts, aims to raise as much as $460m in an initial public offering to pay down debts.In terms released on Monday, a projected IPO price range of $16 to $18 per share would value the company at as much as $2.3bn, roughly in line with the valuation of its rival Starbucks, the world’s largest coffeehouse chain.Dunkin’ is the largest seller of takeaway hot coffee in the US, according to NPD Group, an industry research firm.Proceeds of the offering will be used to pay down some of the $1.85bn in net long-term debt, or a leverage ratio of about 6.5 times adjusted cash flow, accrued as part of a 2006 leveraged buy-out.Bain Capital, The Carlyle Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners acquired the group’s 16,000 locations in 57 countries, which includes the Baskin-Robbins ice-cream chain, in a leveraged buy-out in 2006. The firms are selling no shares in the offering, consistent with other private-equity deleveraging deals.In such deals, the owners hope to pay down the company’s debts in an IPO, then sell shares in secondary offerings.Dunkin’s shares will be listed on the Nasdaq exchange, where Starbucks is also traded.
341;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-07-09T00:38:26Z;US exchanges see softening equities trading in June;;The importance to NYSE Euronext of its merger with Deutsche Börse has been illustrated with industry figures that showed softening equities trading in June and US market share gains for Nasdaq OMX.Monthly trading figures from the main US and European exchanges highlighted the fragility of the cash equities trading market in the US and Europe, while derivatives trading continued to grow.It comes as the NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse merger, which will create the world’s largest exchanges group and a powerhouse in European derivatives trading, is going before the US and German exchange operators’ shareholders.On Thursday, NYSE shareholders voted in favour of the $10.4bn (€7.3bn) merger with Deutsche Börse, setting the stage for a similar vote by the German group’s shareholders next week.Figures from NYSE Euronext showed US cash equities trading fell 2.8 per cent in June month on month and by 28.7 per cent on June 2010 levels. The figures largely mirrored softening trading of equities seen by rivals, although Nasdaq OMX reported 2 per cent sequential monthly growth in US equities average daily volume in June, outpacing the 1 per cent increase in industrywide volumes.Patrick O’Shaughnessy of Raymond James pointed out that Nasdaq OMX’s market share had increased for five consecutive months, reaching 22.9 per cent in June against 18.1 per cent in January.Trading on cash equities markets in Europe was equally soft with average daily volume on NYSE Euronext’s markets down 2.8 per cent compared to June 2010 and down 3.9 per cent on May 2011. Deutsche Börse said the order book turnover on its Xetra and on the trading floor of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange fell 1 per cent year-on-year to €109.9bn in June.European derivatives average daily volume at NYSE Liffe rose 4.8 per cent compared to June 2010 but fell 2 per cent month-on-month.At Eurex, the German group’s derivatives exchange, saw an average daily volume of 11.4m contracts, up from 10.9m a year ago.
342;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-07-04T08:23:55Z;LSE open to approach from Nasdaq;;The London Stock Exchange would be open to considering a merger of equals with Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator, in the first sign that the British bourse could yet turn its attention to securing its future in another big merger after its attempted tie-up with Canada’s TMX Group collapsed.Nasdaq’s chief executive, Bob Greifeld, is considering an approach for the LSE but people familiar with the matter said advisers were not yet formally involved. Nor had Mr Greifeld spoken with his counterpart at the LSE, Xavier Rolet.The prospect of the combination revives the vision of a transatlantic exchange powerhouse first pushed by Mr Greifeld five years ago when he made a failed bid for the LSE.It would combine two of the most recognised brands in the exchange business and provide a counterweight to a larger combination planned by Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext amid a wave of exchange consolidation that started last October. Nasdaq is separately involved as bidder for a minority stake in LCH.Clearnet, an independent clearing house that clears UK stocks for the LSE.Mr Greifeld’s last, and ultimately hostile, attempt at the LSE involved an offer to shareholders of £12.43 a share, increased from a friendly offer of 950p. The LSE’s shares closed at £10.61 on Friday, valuing the exchange at £2.8bn. Nasdaq’s market capitalisation stands at $4.6bn (£2.86bn).One person said LSE management believed the exchanges’ higher share prices in recent weeks suggested the market did not favour an “aggressive leveraged takeover”. An LSE spokesman said it “did not comment on speculation”.The LSE’s share price has risen 15 per cent since mid-May, amid bid speculation even as it tried to finalise its deal with TMX, operator of the Toronto and Montreal bourses. The LSE abandoned that last week after insufficient support from TMX shareholders.Explore deals on the table, as well as those which have fallen by the waysideMr Greifeld’s last attempted deal, which ended in April after objections from US antitrust authorities, was a $11.3bn counter-bid for NYSE Euronext, with IntercontinentalExchange as joint bidder.However, any Nasdaq-LSE deal would have to overcome a number of hurdles. It is not clear which of the men would be chief executive. Mr Rolet has been in his job since May 2009, while Mr Greifeld has been chief executive of Nasdaq since 2003. A deal would also have to pass UK regulatory scrutiny.A second person said that while the LSE would consider an approach from Nasdaq, Mr Rolet had made clear recently that the LSE could grow its business independently.Additional reporting by Anousha Sakoui and Helen Thomas
343;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-07-04T01:57:58Z;Direct Edge changes pricing to boost trading;;A pricing change by Direct Edge, the US stock market, is the latest move by exchanges to drum up activity amid low trading volumes.Direct Edge plans to end its inverted pricing model, known as “taker-maker”, and return to the “maker-taker” pricing model starting August 1 pending approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission.The company had originally planned to make the shift on Friday, but pushed it back a month for technical reasons.“Taker-maker”, adopted by Direct Edge in 2008, is meant to encourage traders to “take”, or execute against prices quoted on the exchange, by offering them rebates. The more common model, “maker-taker”, gives rebates to trades for creating quotes, and charges for executing against them.The idea was to draw in brokerages who were making large volumes of trades, and sought the transaction costs. These trades were typically from so-called “VWAP” algorithms, or automated trading strategies that aim to trade at the volume-weighted average price, rather than a single price.“You don’t care about the price you execute [for] any particular trade, just the average, but you can save money on the transaction costs,” said Diego Perfumo, exchange analyst at Equity Research Desk.The market share of “taker-maker”, via Direct Edge and other exchanges using it such as BATS Global Markets and BX, a small-companies market owned by Nasdaq OMX, surged in 2009, as US trading volumes peaked.But now, as volumes in US markets are declining and traders are moving to more sophisticated algorithms that are choosier about prices, “taker-maker” trading has held steady at about 8 per cent of market share on Direct Edge and other exchanges.That has prompted Direct Edge, which uses the strategy in its EDGA market, to try something new.“EDGA is still the low-cost market leader, but to stimulate liquidity, we want to give a much more material incentive to liquidity providers. We’re moving to a new neighbourhood,” said Bryan Harkins, chief operating officer at Direct Edge.Mr Harkins said the new model would be “maker-taker with a twist”. Though it will end the incentive to “take”, it would still charge substantially lower fees: just 6 mils, or $0.0006 a share. The next lowest fees are on the New York Stock Exchange, which charges 23 mils.It will then pay a 5 mil rebate to post, or “make” trades, earning just a 1 mil spread. “Our model has partly been based on operating efficiencies, low overhead, and straightforward technology, and watch our fixed costs,” said Mr Harkins. Direct Edge has recently been expanding its services to traders, adding additional connectivity to its trade-routing software.Some analysts believe it may signal a growing discomfort with “taker-maker” pricing. “There’s nervousness about inverted pricing,” said Alison Crosthwait, head of global trading research at Instinet.“Even though the fill rates are good, the problem is, it’s kind of a red flag [if] you’re not a high-frequency player. It tips your hand,” she said, though she said that some studies, including one by Goldman Sachs, suggested that the risk of being “gamed” by traders was outweighed by the higher fill rates.Jamie Selway, a market structure analyst at brokerage ITG, said Citigroup’s reverse split– which alone often accounted for several percentage points of US volume– was a factor in the shift.“The sense is that the inverted pricing model was directed toward low-priced stocks with lots of dark pool activity, but now with Citi out of there, those kinds of stocks are less target-rich environment,” said Mr Selway.“With stock prices a bit higher, different dynamics by retail traders and some retrenching among high-frequency trading, it’s not surprising to see exchanges start experimenting again,” he added.
344;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-07-03T21:35:29Z;Chi-X takeover plan in jeopardy;Several shareholders in platform are said to be exploring a sale to new buyers, after its takeover was referred to UK antitrust authorities;"A plan to create the largest share trading platform in Europe is in jeopardy as several shareholders in Chi-X Europe are now exploring a sale of their platform to new buyers, following the referral of its takeover by BATS Global Markets to UK antitrust authorities, according to people close to the deal.The move could also threaten plans by BATS Global Markets – BATS Europe’s US-based parent – to come to market later this year, with a valuation of about $1.2bn.Chi-X Europe and BATS Europe have become two of the most popular venues for trading pan-European equities. A combined group would trade more stocks on a pan-European basis than Euronext, which trades French, Belgian, Dutch and Portuguese equities. It would also account for 35 per cent of trading in FTSE 100 stocks, after the London Stock Exchange.But three people familiar with the takeover plan have told the Financial Times that several shareholders in Chi-X Europe – including Instinet, which holds a 35 per cent stake in Chi-X Europe – are examining alternative options for the group.Last month, many industry participants were surprised when the UK Office of Fair Trading referred the proposed takeover of Chi-X Europe by BATS to the Competition Commission. BATS said at the time that it was aware this was a possibility. “There’s a feeling in Chi-X that the referral is a bit political, given how London has been so keen to promote open markets,” one person said. “But shareholders are now actively considering options. They’re not waiting for the Commission decision.”Chi-X Europe and BATS share five of the same shareholders in Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Getco, a US-based market-making firm.Explore deals on the table, as well as those which have fallen by the waysideOne person said three options were under consideration: waiting in the hope that the deal goes through; independence for Chi-X Europe; or a sale of the company to a rival. Staying independent “is very high on the agenda”, said another source familiar with the matter. Chi-X Europe, Instinet and BATS have declined to comment.Some shareholders had hoped that Nasdaq OMX – which made the highest offer in the first round of bidding last autumn – could return if it does not pursue a bid for the London Stock Exchange in the wake of the UK exchange’s failed merger with Canada’s TMX Group.While the group could remain independent, sources say morale is low after staff had been told they would be made redundant in any BATS-Chi-X deal. Hiring the same employees on new terms would be costly and threaten the group’s profitability for the year. After four years, Chi-X turned its first profit last year. Chi-X Europe and BATS Europe were set up to compete against the continent’s incumbent exchanges, a move made possible by the enactment of the European Union’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid) in 2007. That created a new category of trading platform known as a “multilateral trading facility” (MTF), adopted by Chi-X Europe and BATS Europe."
345;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-06-30T07:51:55Z;LSE shares up on hopes it may be bid target;;The London Stock Exchange’s shares jumped over 3 per cent on Thursday as investors appeared to be expecting the UK bourse to become a bid target after the failure of its planned merger with Canada’s TMX Group.Arnault Giblat, analyst at UBS, said: “We believe that there is a good chance of a Nasdaq approach.” He said there was “sufficient scope” for Nasdaq to offer £11.50, with 40 per cent of that in cash.The LSE’s hopes of securing its future as part of a transatlantic deal with TMX Group evaporated on Wednesday after the UK bourse withdrew its merger plan having failed to secure enough support from shareholders of its Canadian peer.The withdrawal is a serious setback to Xavier Rolet, the French chief executive of the LSE, and might put the exchange in play as a potential bid target.The LSE’s share price has risen by 15 per cent since mid-May amid speculation that it might be taken over, with Nasdaq OMX of the US topping the list of potential predators. On Thursday they opened up 46p at £10.02.The LSE and TMX had both been waiting for their shareholders to vote on Thursday on whether to support the LSE’s proposed “merger of equals” with TMX, or side with a bid from a consortium of Canadian banks and pension funds.But the LSE said: “Based on proxy information received in Canada by TMX Group, a majority of TMX Group shareholder proxies have voted in favour of the merger.However, [we] and TMX Group believe that the merger is highly unlikely to achieve the required two-thirds majority approval at the TMX Group shareholder meeting.”Mr Rolet said he was “clearly disappointed”, but added: “Whilst the merger with TMX Group was an exciting opportunity for LSE group, we continue to see other significant growth opportunities”.TMX Group will pay the LSE an expense fee of C$10m. If TMX finalises an alternative deal over the coming 12 months it is to pay a further $29m to the LSE.Supporters of the LSE offer had argued the deal would give TMX, which operates the Toronto and Montreal exchanges, greater presence among global markets.Critics had focused on the argument that the deal was more a takeover than a merger, thereby raising the risk that TMX’s two main businesses in Toronto and Montreal would fall under foreign control.Luc Bertrand, a spokesman for the rival 13-member Maple consortium, said the group hoped that it “may now engage in a positive dialogue with the TMX board”. TMX has up to now rejected Maple’s advances.The LSE and TMX sweetened their deal with addition of a special dividend a week ago, resulting in an implied value of the LSE deal of C$49. But Maple quickly upped the ante by adding further cash to its bid, making its offer worth $50 a share.Mr Bertrand said Maple’s plan, which involves the creation of a so-called “vertical silo” encompassing trading and clearing operations “represents the best way forward for TMX Group and the Canadian capital markets”.The failure of the LSE-TMX deal is the third proposed exchange merger to have failed since consolidation was sparked by an attempt nine months ago by Singapore’s exchange to take over its Australian counterpart.It raises questions over whether any exchange merger is likely to be completed amid signs of nationalist opposition to takeovers and growing antitrust scrutiny of the sector.TMX will pay a C$10m expense fee to LSE and a further C$29m if the Maple bid is consummated within the next 12 months.
346;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-06-27T18:55:20Z;ISS endorses NYSE-D Börse merger;;The NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse merger moved a little bit closer to completion on Monday when ISS, the influential proxy advisory service, advised US shareholders to vote for the deal at a special meeting in July.But the merger’s fate still lies in Europe, where authorities are expected to give it a thorough review that will not be completed until well after shareholders in the US and Germany are asked to vote next month.“The bigger issue in my mind is, what will happen antitrust-wise in the EU?” said Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James.The ISS recommendation carries some weight. Funds within large asset management institutions T Rowe Price and BlackRock, which are the two top owners of NYSE Euronext, are often bound by ISS decisions, as they own shares on behalf of clients rather than in their own portfolios.But the deal had already been expected to sail through in New York, where investors now have no alternatives to which to compare the deal after Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange withdrew their counterbid earlier this year under pressure from US antitrust authorities.The NYSE vote is set for July 7, when a majority of shareholders must vote for the deal for it to be approved.Some shareholders had been attracted to the competing bid because it represented a premium to the agreed merger of some 10-20 per cent to the NYSE-Deutsche agreement, which is now valued at $33.87 a share.That is roughly a 10 per cent premium to the day’s before the offer was announced in February. Last month, the exchanges also approved a €2 ($2.85) a share sweetener dividend to be paid after the deal closes.“The one-day premium, albeit low relative to normal acquisitions, exceeds that of recent merger-of-equal transactions, including those among exchange operators,” wrote ISS in its recommendation.Glass Lewis, another shareholder advisory, was more critical of the deal in a note last week, arguing that NYSE had a “rather focused pursuit of a transaction with DB” and “limited discussion of what other specific alternatives”.However, it said that the unusually strong regulation of exchanges would “limit the number of realistic alternative buyers that could satisfy antitrust scrutiny”, and recommended the deal, which placed the exchanges “in an attractive competitive position.”Glass Lewis had also earlier this year recommended that shareholders vote against approving the pay packages of NYSE Euronext management, giving the company a “D” for tying payment to performance. But shareholders overwhelmingly approved the pay packages, which ISS supported.Meanwhile, there has been some opposition in Germany to the deal, where staff unions have urged rejection following statements by NYSE-Deutsche that the bulk of the cost-cutting synergies will fall in Europe.European antitrust regulators are also still in the early stages of reviewing the merger, which will see Europe’s largest futures exchanges, NYSE Euronext’s Liffe and Deutsche Börse’s Eurex, become one entity.Significantly, that will join Liffe to Clearstream, Deutsche’s market-leading futures clearing business. Regulators have expressed concern about the “vertical” and “horizontal” elements of the deal. No final decisions are anticipated until next year.But it is still anticipated to receive approval by shareholders, who are required to tender three-quarters of shares outstanding for the deal to be approved.
347;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-06-23T18:02:36Z;New circuit breaker rule under fire;;The much anticipated new circuit breaker mechanism for US equity markets, known as “limit up-limit down”, has come under fire by industry groups.The “limit up-limit down” proposal by the US’s largest exchanges was backed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year, hailed as superior to the initial circuit breakers approved last year following the “flash crash” last May.While the current system halts trading if a stock rises or falls a certain percentage, the “limit up-limit down” mechanism simply bars trading outside that range. If there are no trades inside the range after a short period of time, then trading is halted.The purported advantage is that the new breaker would make trading halts more predictable, and would not interfere as much with the market’s pricing mechanism.But in a series of comment letters filed on Thursday, several aspects of the new system have come in for criticism. Market participants also expressed concern about the sheer complexity of market rules following the “flash crash”, given that part of the underlying cause of the crash itself were poorly understood mechanisms.“The more complex the commission makes the market, the more likely it is that surprises like the flash crash will occur,” wrote Steve Wunsch, president of the Arizona Stock Market and former executive at the International Securities Exchange.“The remedies that have been enacted or are contemplated to address extraordinary volatility in the wake of the flash crash, including the ‘limit up-limit down’ plan, have ratcheted up complexity by an order of magnitude from anything we have seen before,” he wrote.Craig Donohue, chief executive of CME Group, wrote that the CME “has consistently argued that single security circuit trading halts that meaningfully interrupt price-discovery serve to exacerbate rather than remediate uncertainty”.The Securities and Financial Markets Association (Sifma), the US’s largest financial services industry group, wrote that the proposal could “inadvertently reduce market liquidity or otherwise introduce unintended and adverse consequences into the market”.The group said that the halts should not apply during the market close, arguing that they would “impede what otherwise would be a fair and accurate mechanism for determining an orderly closing price for a security”.It also said the mechanism should not be applied to any trades not reported to the consolidated tape, such as privately negotiated transactions.There was disagreement about the length of the amount of time prices could trade outside the band, known as the “limit state”.Gus Sauter, chief investment officer at Vanguard, an asset management group, said the 15 seconds proposed is “a short time threshold and will lead to an unnecessary number of trading halts”.Sifma, however, recommended that the period for new quotes to be entered once a price hits a limit should be 5 seconds, rather than the proposed 15 seconds.“The longer the period allotted for exiting a ‘limit state’, the greater the potential for uncertainty among market participants,” Sifma wrote.The Managed Funds Association, which represents hedge funds, said that the limits should not apply to “smaller, less-active instruments for which there is less prior experience from other markets”. They said it should only apply to S&P 500 and Russell 2000 companies.The US’s largest exchange operators, NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX, earlier this year told the FT that they would withdraw their own mechanisms if the “limit up-limit down” proposal was deemed suitable to replace them.Sifma said that the SEC should itself write the rule, rather than approving exchanges’ proposals, for that reason.
348;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Exchanges urge SEC to delay direct access rule;;The largest US stock exchanges have asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to delay a new rule that would end direct access to the markets by traders.In a letter to the agency, NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX, BATS Global Markets and Direct Edge posed dozens of questions about the so called “naked access” ban, primarily related to the exchanges’ internal broker-dealer subsidiaries that route trades to other markets.The ban was first proposed before last year’s May 6 “flash crash”, but its adoption was accelerated by the one-day crash-and-rebound in dozens of US equities and exchange traded funds.The rule was due to come into effect by July, and brokerages have been racing to develop software and hardware that perform the necessary pre-trade risk checks, such as a traders’ credit or suitability to be making the trade. The exchanges have asked for it to be delayed until November.Sources close to the exchanges confirmed the authenticity of the letter, which was viewed by the Financial Times, but the exchanges themselves declined to comment on the letter or on the naked access ban.In the letter, they argue that the internal broker-dealers owned by the exchanges, which route orders to other markets when those markets are displaying the best price, as required by regulation, are not equipped to handle aspects of the rule.They further said performing risk checks would be redundant, since they only receive orders from other broker-dealers.“Routing broker-dealers …carry out the critical function of routing orders to other market centres,” they wrote. “We believe the additional time requested would enable us to finalise systems changes so that this important routing function can continue …without having a detrimental effect on the national market system.”Due to competition, the cost of routing of trades to other exchanges is near-zero, they said. The exchanges are not allowed to offer other services, such as prime brokerage services like stock lending, to offset the cost of performing risk checks.“This has had the effect of limiting the availability of sources of revenue to offset the costs of compliance with regulatory requirements,” the letter said. “The exchanges are concerned that such costs may be well in excess of those projected.”The SEC projected the ban would cost the industry about $100m to initially set up new systems, and $100m a year to maintain.The ban also requires brokerages to check trades against a restricted stocks list, or stocks that the broker cannot trade due to conflicts of interest, such as being an adviser on a deal involving that company.For the exchanges to perform these checks, they would incur legal risks by asking each brokerage provide that restrictions list to them, said one person close to the exchanges.About 83 per cent of all trades by hedge funds, including high-frequency trading shops, are executed directly in the market in 2011, according to the Tabb Group. About 9 per cent of traditional traders, such as mutual funds, are sent directly to the market and not through a broker-dealer trader or algorithm.
349;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-31T17:42:50Z;LME concerned about LCH.Clearnet ‘viability’;;The London Metal Exchange has warned that decisions by IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) and NYSE Liffe to build their own clearing houses may undermine LCH.Clearnet’s “viability as a clearing house”.The commodities exchange is in talks with members about creating its own clearing house in a move that would bring it into line with rivals such as CME Group and ICE and give it control over launching new products. In doing so, the LME is considering splitting from LCH.Clearnet, the LME’s long-standing clearing house.It comes as LCH.Clearnet is being eyed by exchanges as wave of bourse consolidation sweeps up Europe’s largest independent clearing house. NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX and the London Stock Exchange have all tabled bids for the clearer in an effort to profit from sweeping post-crisis reform of the financial system, people familiar with the matter have told the FT. However the LSE has said it is not in any discussions with LCH.Clearnet about any transaction.In a statement to members explaining its reasoning, the LME said it was “concerned” by the effect of the decisions of ICE, NYSE Liffe and the LSE to self-clear.“With its diminishing exchange portfolio, LCH.Clearnet is focusing on the growing market in over-the-counter derivatives clearing. This could be to the detriment of those exchanges that remain,” said Chris Evans, head of business development.Alberto Pravettoni, managing director, corporate strategy at LCH.Clearnet, said: “LCH.Clearnet is committed to continuing to serve both exchange traded and OTC markets and we have invested significantly in our infrastructure in order to ensure we are best placed to do so.“As we stated on May 3, we value our relationship with the LME and shall continue to provide the LME and its members with an excellent service and the benefit of our unique experience in clearing for this complex market – we are a leader in commodities clearing globally. Market participants tell us they are looking for proven, efficient and consolidated clearing offerings. LCH.Clearnet is best placed to continue to deliver this.”A clearing house stands between parties to a trade, stepping in to ensure that a deal goes ahead even if one party defaults. Regulators in Washington and Brussels are keen for central counterparty clearing in the market in order to reduce the risk traditionally associated with such trades. The LME has not yet committed to a decision and has considered partnering with ICE Clear, CME Clear and other houses but self-clearing is its preferred option.“Preliminary discussions suggest that self clearing is achievable, could give the market a more efficient service and will place decisions about the exchange’s independence more firmly in the hands of LME shareholders,” Mr Evans told members.The LME added that its financial advisers have indicated it would have “little problem” raising debt finance to start a clearing house. However, it added: “if there was shareholder appetite for a rights issue to fund an LME-owned clearing house, this would be considered”.LCH.Clearnet collects some £10m annually in direct fees for clearing LME trades, the LME estimated. “Modelling done by the LME Executive and its consultants indicates that treasury revenue from members’ margin funds brings LCH.Clearnet a further return that is a multiple of the clearing fee income,” it said.Regulators have been keen to ensure that clearing houses do not become a potential new weak link in the financial system. The LME said work on the establishment of the size of a potential default fund had not begun. However it envisaged that there would be little change to LME clearing member default fund contributions as the contribution it would normally pay LCH.Clearnet would switch to a potential new LME-operated clearing house.The group added that it was recruiting a director of post-trade services but said the move to build the house was not part of larger plans to sell the exchange.
350;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-30T23:02:40Z;Business diary: Bill Brodsky;CBOE chief tells of a particularly busy week;As chief executive of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Bill Brodsky heads the US’s biggest options-trading venue. Here he speaks about a particularly busy week in which his company, which had its initial public offering last year, held its first shareholder annual meeting. He is based in Chicago.I wake at 6am and check e-mails on my BlackBerry in my home office – I don’t sleep with the BlackBerry in the bedroom because it would buzz all night. Then I watch CNBC to update myself on the markets while working out.May 16 starts with the shock news that Nasdaq, one of our main rivals, and IntercontinentalExchange had pulled out of their bid for NYSE Euronext, another competitor. E-mail my staff to make sure we change my comments at tomorrow’s annual meeting to reflect the news.By 7.30am, I’m on my way to a breakfast meeting with Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner and about 20 local financial leaders. Chicago’s an important stopping place for policymakers. The financial community is big enough to have an impressive array of people but small enough that we can get all together at the same time.Leave the meeting early to join a conference call with the Securities and Exchange Commission staff in Washington. CBOE is the options industry’s leading advocate in Washington. I talk to the SEC probably once a week, on industry matters or issues specific to CBOE. I have great respect for Mary Schapiro, SEC chairman, who has a thankless task – the scope of reform is staggering and the pace is unrelenting. There’s no “pause” button – we’re in a fast-moving environment and new issues crop up all the time.Drive to the office for a staff meeting, before heading to Millennium Park to watch Rahm Emanuel being sworn in as mayor of Chicago. I’ve known him more than 20 years, and he was a “go-to guy” in the House of Representatives – he had a great knowledge of our business and his door was always open. His Congress experience can only help in terms of advocating for support in Washington now that he is mayor.Eat lunch at my desk before a dress rehearsal for our first ever annual meeting. Going public has definitely increased our communications effort. We have 20 analysts covering us and a broad range of new and potential shareholders, so I tend to do more of my work from the road. I keep up to date on the markets using my office computer, the financial TV channels, my BlackBerry and my iPad.Next morning, I’m at my desk by 7am. I have two quiet hours to review the materials for the shareholder meeting and a meeting with my board of directors. At 9.30, I start greeting stockholders. Most of our stock is still held by people who were members of the exchange before we went public.The meeting goes well, although I didn’t know what to expect. Someone wants to be on the board who has not been nominated, but he doesn’t get the votes. When it comes to the question-and-answer session, I’m shocked that there is only one question.Spend all afternoon at our board meeting. Go home for dinner, which happens only a couple of nights a week.On Thursday morning I meet with international staff on our strategy in Asia. Spend the day in meetings and conference calls, including seeing our chief financial officer to get a first glimpse of how we did in April.I go with my wife to the annual dinner of the Newberry Library, one of the great humanities libraries, where she is a trustee. It’s nice to go as the accompanying spouse – my family save me from being one-dimensional.Back in the office early on Friday to prepare for a trip to London, Paris, Milan and Zurich on a “mini roadshow” to interest investors in our shares. I visit Europe three or four times a year and Asia once a year. We’re in Europe to maintain customer relationships and in Asia to cultivate new ones.Meet with two groups of members of the US House of Representatives. Maintaining a strong congressional outreach programme is imperative for us – much of our destiny is shaped by our policymakers.
351;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-29T22:38:06Z;New front opens in battle of exchanges;;"A gigantic game of chess has been playing out between the world’s exchanges for the past few months.The owner of the New York Stock Exchange – NYSE Euronext – is pursuing a merger with Germany’s Deutsche Börse and was until recently fighting a counterbid for NYSE from rival Nasdaq OMX and another US exchange known as ICE.The London Stock Exchange is pushing an agreed merger with TMX Group, operator of Canada’s exchanges, in the face of a counter-bid for TMX from a consortium of Canadian banks and pension funds.But now the action is moving to the arcane business of clearing.LCH.Clearnet, one of the world’s largest clearing houses, confirmed at the weekend it had “various proposals indicating an interest in pursuing some form of possible business combination or other co-operation”.People familiar with the matter say LCH.Clearnet recently received three bids – from NYSE Euronext and Markit, a UK financial information company; Nasdaq; and from the LSE – valuing the business at €350m-€1bn ($500m-$1.4bn).Since then the LSE has distanced itself, saying it is “not engaged in any discussions with LCH regarding a possible transaction”.The London-based clearer is a product of the merger in 2003 of the London Clearing House and Clearnet, a Paris clearer. It clears cash equities for the LSE as well as commodities, energy, freight, repos and – the big attraction for any bidder – off-exchange, or over-the-counter, derivatives.This shows that the wave of exchange mergers is being driven as much by growing exchanges as by capitalising on post-financial crisis regulatory reforms forcing greater use of clearing in key markets.A clearing house stands between parties in a trade, ensuring that a deal is completed even if one side defaults. More clearing in the OTC derivatives markets is a key part of G20 reforms aimed at preventing another crisis, and is enshrined in the Dodd-Frank act in the US.Morgan Stanley and Oliver Wyman, a consultancy, say this will create an available “pool” of clearing revenues of about $1bn by 2013, more than double the pool in 2009-12.LCH.Clearnet is well positioned. It runs, with OTC dealer-banks, a service called SwapClear that has been clearing interest rate swaps since 1999.Pre-tax profits at LCH.Clearnet last year fell 80 per cent to €32.3m, while revenues were 39 per cent lower at €553.6m. Clearing fees from equities fell by 26.9 per cent to €44.3m. But revenue from clearing OTC derivatives rose more than 26 per cent to €21.2m.The International Swaps and Derivatives Association puts the notional value of OTC derivatives contracts outstanding at about $601,000bn as of December, of which 77 per cent is interest rate swaps.Industry experts say the opportunity to clear swaps will only grow as they shift from being negotiated bilaterally in large contracts to traded electronically on exchanges and other platforms, since this will slice orders into smaller sizes – increasing volume.Exchanges with clearing houses are already jostling to capture this business, with CME Group launching last year and Deutsche Börse’s Eurex Clearing also preparing a service.SwapClear launched a rates clearing service in the US in February. Nasdaq OMX hopes to compete through International Derivatives Clearing Group, a clearer set up a year ago. But it has gained little traction, which may explain its interest in LCH.Clearnet.NYSE Euronext’s choice of Markit reflects the importance of regulators’ desire to see derivatives data that flow from trading and clearing made more transparent as well. Yet structuring any deal will be delicate. Any acquisition of LCH.Clearnet risks removing from the industry the only remaining derivatives clearer that is not controlled by an exchange, with trading and clearing integrated in a “vertical silo”.Market participants complain that silos – such as CME and Deutsche Börse – give their owners undue market power and fret that this will only increase as consolidation deepens.LCH.Clearnet is a not-for-profit utility owned by 98 shareholders, from banks and other market participants – which own 83 per cent – to NYSE Euronext and the London Metal Exchange, with the rest.Any acquirer would face complex talks with the SwapClear banks, which take most of the revenues from OTC clearing, with LCH.Clearnet earning a fee. LCH.Clearnet cautioned its “considerations are at a preliminary stage and there can be no certainty that these proposals will result in any transaction”."
352;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-28T11:17:19Z;Exchanges fight for LCH.Clearnet;;Three of the world’s largest exchanges have entered a battle for control of LCH.Clearnet as a wave of exchange consolidation sweeps up Europe’s largest independent clearing house, three people familiar with the matter said.The move for the London-based clearer, between NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX and the London Stock Exchange, is a sign that the world’s bourses are desperate to snap up businesses that allow them to profit from sweeping post-crisis reform of the financial system.All three bourses tabled bids ranging from €350m ($500m) to €1bn at a board meeting held two weeks ago.LCH.Clearnet confirmed on Saturday that it had “received various proposals indicating an interest in pursuing some form of possible business combination or other co-operation with LCH.Clearnet”.“LCH.Clearnet’s considerations are at a preliminary stage and there can be no certainty that these proposals will result in any transaction,” the London-based clearer said.The LSE has offered €21 a share for LCH.Clearnet, valuing it at €1bn, one person said. However, the LSE on Saturday distanced itself from any move, saying it noted “recent press speculation” regarding it and LCH.Clearnet and “confirms that it is not engaged in any discussions with LCH regarding a possible transaction”.Clearing houses have long been part of the unglamorous back office processes that ensure deals are completed in shares, binds and derivatives and bonds.But they have shot to prominence amid financial reforms designed to clean up the financial system after the 2008 financial crisis. Such reforms, enshrined in the Dodd-Frank act in the US and similar European proposals will force over-the-counter derivatives on to exchanges and through clearing houses to make such markets more transparent.A clearing house stands between buyers and sellers, stepping in to ensure a deal is completed if one party defaults. The London clearer was formed from a merger in 2003 between the London Clearing House and Clearnet, clearer for the Paris Bourse.All three bidders want control of LCH.Clearnet since it operates, with big banks, a clearing service for OTC interest rate swaps called SwapClear, which recently pushed into the US to compete with CME Group, the US exchange, in derivatives clearing. Interest rate swaps are the largest part of the OTC derivatives market and are set for growth, market experts believe, as they are pushed on to electronic platforms by the reforms.One person said LCH.Clearnet had not yet responded formally to any of the offers. “It’s very fluid and nobody knows. The board’s gone away to think about it,” the person said.The board is made up of 21 people, including Ian Axe, former chief operating officer for Barclays Capital, who became chief executive in February. At the time of his appointment, he said: “As the market leader in OTC clearing and with expertise in a broader range of assets than any other clearing house globally, LCH.Clearnet is well placed to benefit from the worldwide drive to reduce systemic risk.”Ownership of a clearing house boosts revenues at exchange but also gives them quasi-monopoly control of derivatives trading and clearing and locking out competitors in so-called “vertical silos”. Derivatives are growing faster than equities, with certain benchmark futures contracts – a popular type of derivative – among the fastest-growing of them.For the LSE, one of the few exchanges not to own a domestic clearer, the move was described by a second person as “a survival move” to get deeper into clearing as rivals Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext pursue a $9.4bn merger. That deal, if consummated, would bring together the Börse’s Eurex futures exchange with NYSE Euronext’s London-based Liffe futures exchange, with clearing being concentrated at Eurex Clearing, owned by the Börse.The LSE is next month set to launch an assault against Eurex and Liffe in futures, with clearing to be carried out at LCH.Clearnet and an Italian clearing house operated by the LSE through its ownership of Borsa Italiana, Italy’s main exchange operator.Shares in the LSE soared more than 10 per cent this week to their highest level in three years amid speculation that Nasdaq might make its second attempt since 2006 to buy the British bourse.The LSE is in the midst of a separate battle against a consortium of Canadian banks and pension funds as it pursues an agreed merger with TMX Group, operator of the Tornonto Stock Exchange and Montreal derivatives exchange.Nasdaq OMX has tabled a bid that would value LCH.Clearnet at €350m, the first person said. “The offer’s a bit low and complicated,” that person said, referring to how Nasdaq has proposed to include in its cash offer the existing clearing businesses it owns in Europe.Nasdaq’s talks with LCH.Clearnet started about six weeks ago, just before Bob Greifeld, the exchange’s chief executive, was forced to abandon an audacious joint bid with InterContinentalExchange for NYSE Euronext, owner of the New York Stock Exchange, after it failed an antitrust test. “It gets Nasdaq more firmly into Europe,” one person close to the Nasdaq bid said. “But this is not a deal that needs to be done.”Nasdaq declined to comment.Mr Greifeld said last week at Nasdaq’s shareholder meeting that the company would be “maniacally focused on executing our business plan and at the same time ensuring that we are strategically positioned for emerging growth opportunities”.A move for LCH.Clearnet would secure Mr Greifeld a major presence in clearing of cash equities and OTC derivatives in London, at a time when an existing US OTC derivatives clearer he controls, International Derivatives Clearing Group (IDCG), has failed to gain traction in interest rate swaps. It has secured only a few members of the clearing house, meaning it has too few members that would be able to bring it OTC derivatives trades from customers using them that need them to be cleared.LCH.Clearnet already has a thriving interest rate swaps business at SwapClear in London and recently launched such a service aimed at non-banks users of interest rate swaps in the US, which competes with a service also recently launched by CME Group.NYSE Euronext has teamed up with Markit, a financial information company specialising in OTC derivatives, in a €10 a share bid that values LCH.Clearnet at under €500m, the first person said.Markit is involved in the pricing and dissemination of data in the OTC derivatives markets, which are also a focus of regulators as they insist that such data be more formally organised, electronically, to provide pricing more transparently to markets and to help build an “audit trail” of trades that can be easily seen by regulators.However, a takeover of LCH.Clearnet would be complicated because it has 98 shareholders, including NYSE Euronext with 9 per cent and the London Metal Exchange with 8 per cent.In addition, the banks involved in the OTC derivatives clearing business that falls under the SwapClear service must give their consent to any change in control that affects SwapClear. Many of those banks – including JPMorgan and Barclays Capital – are on the LCH.Clearnet board.The banks share revenues from the SwapClear service with LCH.Clearnet as part of a complex arrangement. They are seen as unlikely to be in favour of selling to an exchange unless on terms that secure their ongoing involvement in OTC derivatives clearing.This is the third time since 2008 that LCH.Clearnet has been faced a possible change in ownership or takeover bid. The first came that year when The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the US clearing and settlement group, agreed a merger with LCH.Clearnet, to create a transatlantic clearing group.That deal collapsed after the emergence of a consortium of 11 banks – many of the same ones affiliated with the SwapClear service – joined forces with Icap, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, in 2009 for a €11 a share cash offer valuing the UK clearer at about €830m.
353;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-26T23:22:08Z;Ex-Nasdaq executive pleads guilty;;A former Nasdaq executive pleaded guilty to making more than $640,000 in illegal profits by trading on secret company information he learnt while employed on the US exchange’s market intelligence desk.Donald Johnson, 56, was a managing director at Nasdaq’s market intelligence desk, which gave him access to sensitive information, such as earnings, executive changes and drug trial results before they were announced. Until he retired in September 2009, prosecutors say, Mr Johnson helped companies anticipate how their stock prices would react based on their news.Authorities allege that Mr Johnson, from a work computer, logged on to an online brokerage account in his wife’s name eight times between 2006 and 2009 and traded stocks after receiving the non-public company information.“Mr Johnson was in fact a fox in a hen house,” said Lanny Breuer, chief of the Department of Justice’s criminal division. His actions were “a shocking abuse of trust”.The US Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud charges against Mr Johnson for allegedly making nine improper trades – one more than in the criminal case – that resulted in improper profits exceeding $755,000. The trading was detected by regulators and brought to Nasdaq’s attention, an exchange spokesman said.In his biggest single profit made in November 2007, Mr Johnson bought shares of United Therapeutics one day after he met with senior company executives and learnt it would report positive drug trial results for Viveta, an inhaled medication used to treat constricted blood vessels in the lungs, which is now known as Tyvaso. The following day, when the results were announced, he sold his stock and pocketed $175,000, according to the SEC charges.Authorities say Mr Johnson violated Nasdaq’s policy that prohibits trading stock listed on the Nasdaq markets while in possession of material non-public information. Mr Johnson also violated Nasdaq policies by not disclosing his wife’s trading account, according to court documents.A lawyer for Mr Johnson said his client “chose to accept responsibility for actions done in the past” and looks forward to moving on with his life. He declined to comment on why his client broke the law. Mr Johnson is scheduled to be sentenced on August 12.The episode follows another client breach revealed earlier this year when the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated a hacking incident at Directors Desk, a unit of Nasdaq’s issuer services business that allows board member to access private company documents remotely. Nasdaq said it did not know of any specific instances of information being stolen.
354;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-26T12:53:07Z;Tech Beat: London calls in liquidity rush;;"“Come friendly bombs and fall on Slough! It isn’t fit for humans now,” the English poet John Betjeman once wrote. Yet it’s perfect for high-frequency traders, inter-dealer brokers and market information providers, it seems.BATS Global Markets has earmarked the town, situated just underneath the flight path to the US out of Heathrow airport, as the site for its key operations in creating Europe’s largest share trading platform by volumeOnce it has received regulatory approval for its planned merger with Chi-X Europe, the US group plans to keep Chi-X Europe’s data centre at Slough. The site, hosted by US data centre provider Equinix, matches trades on the Chi-X Europe platform and BATS will switch its main trading book and “dark pool” trading platforms from London Docklands to the Berkshire town.In doing so it will be moving a large part of its operations, which are currently situated close to its City and Canary Wharf customers, to a site more than 40 miles away.So why would a fast-growing company eager for more business move away from its customers? The answer lies in what facilities can be provided and increasingly, the shape equity markets are taking.Data centres have proliferated as the world’s economy goes online but they are not all built equal. They have ratings much like hotels and Equinix’s Slough facility has been pitched by the company as a five-star establishment, albeit one that won’t be advertised in any guide book.Even if you stumble across it, you have to be James Bond to get in. Entry to the building is via a secure car park, fingerprint scanners, mantraps and thick steel doors. The control room has bulletproof glass; closed circuit television is everywhere. Individual customers’ servers are partitioned off in cages.The key issue for running a data centre is securing sufficient power to maintain the servers and the air conditioning that cools them. Its availability in the south-east of England, especially in London, has been severely constrained, at least until the 2012 Olympics. Data centres located outside the M25 are able to use more power from the national grid, whilst still providing low-latency connectivity into the city. At the Equinix site, back-up generators and extra fuel is ready should all power fail. As a test, once a week Equinix does the unthinkable; turns the power off to see it all works.The building is a testament to Equinix’s meticulous paranoia, even down to the sticky mats that take dust off the soles of one’s shoe. All in all, it gives the impression that it would withstand those bombs Betjeman called for.But Equinix’s attention to detail is really only a reflection of the sensitivities of its clients. Millions of trades are centred on servers miles from their operations.“Around 60 per cent of European cash equities are automated trades – speed and execution are key. The distance between the exchange platform and the bank matching engine matters,” says Terry Quigley, head of financial services sector at Colt, the telecoms services group.He points out that Mifid has fostered fragmentation, in the form of new multilateral trading firms. “Now we’re seeing consolidation, such as with BATS and Chi-X. We’re also seeing a consolidation of liquidity.”Yet the site, like the NYSE Euronext one in Basildon, is preparing for evolution of the market. As Michael Spencer, chief executive of Icap, the inter-dealer broker, and a client of Equinix at Slough, pointed out last week: “I expect to see high frequency trading move into derivatives.”“We try to provide infrastructure or a place where it all could come together,” acknowledges Eric Schwartz, president of Equinix Europe.Location increasingly matters. Yet customer demands for the best latency and a bank’s desire to be fairly close to its equipment means the data centre cannot be located too far from the UK capital.Market participants estimate that the furthest distance one can locate a data centre from a trading floor is around 40 miles, which explains why many of the largest operators for financial services firms have sought new facilities around the M25, the motorway ring road that circles London.NYSE Euronext moved east to Basildon in Essex, Sungard has found another facility at Hounslow near Heathrow airport and LSE has set up a proximity hosting service with Colt near the City.While the exchanges and trading venues chase lucrative business from high frequency traders in the US and Europe, the happy accident of geography makes London the first major financial centre when crossing the Atlantic eastwards.It illustrates how technology is increasingly able to move to the best environment to operate. And the physical trading hubs are moving out ever further away from the City, they are reinforcing London’s position as Europe’s key infrastructure hub for trading. The combined Deutsche Börse- NYSE Euronext bid, if it is approved by regulators and shareholders, is likely to concentrate trading German stocks in addition to the trading of Portuguese, Dutch, French and Belgian stocks in London.The London Stock Exchange has moved its Turquoise multilateral trading facility to the same central London hosting centre as the group’s UK and Italian cash markets, and its new EDX derivatives markets will be based there. The upgrade of trading platforms for Norway and South Africa using technology provided by the LSE could add new customers.It stands in contrast to the option taken by other domestic exchanges such as Deutsche Börse, Nasdaq OMX, SIX Swiss Exchange and Bolsas y Mercados Españoles (BME) which have chosen to locate their data centres locally.In the past, those opting to keep their primary market local have argued that the platform was faster relative to others because the sheer physical distance to London added extra crucial milliseconds’ worth of latency. However they are in danger of being overshadowed by the sheer number of firms around the UK capital.“London is becoming increasingly important as a main liquidity centre. It’s draining liquidity from other locations,” says Mr Quigley."
355;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-26T11:32:16Z;Oslo Børs plans to go public;;"Oslo Børs, Norway’s exchange operator, said on Thursday it was planning to remain independent after announcing plans to go public, even amid global exchange consolidation and tough domestic competition.The group said it would not issue new shares or sell existing stock for a planned flotation, for which it hopes will receive approval from shareholders before the end of the year.Its move comes amid fevered consolidation among US and European exchanges and as Oslo faces competition from Nasdaq OMX, the dominant exchange in the Nordic market, as well as from new trading venues such as Burgundy and Chi-X Europe.Oslo Børs said the move had been made after consultations in recent months with its shareholders, who wanted the share to be traded on automated trading platforms. At present, shares in Oslo Børs can only be traded over-the-counter via a broker in Norway.Shareholders include Vital Forsikring, Norway’s largest life assurance company, which has a 22.8 per cent stake; Kommunal Landspensjonskasse, an insurance group with a 11.9 per cent; Pareto Securities with 8.5 per cent and Orkla, the consumer goods group, with a 9.7 per cent stake.“A listing does not imply any change in company strategy,” Bente Landsnes, chief executive, told FT Trading Room. “We aim to remain independent.”She also said the move was not prompted by the consolidation moves involving many of the world’s largest exchanges. “A year ago we promised shareholders we would come back to it. We had some internal restructuring first.”Nadaq OMX, together with the IntercontinentalExchange, was unsuccessful with a bid for NYSE Euronext while the London Stock Exchange, one of Europe’s few independent exchanges, faces a challenge from a Canadian rival looking to break-up its agreed bid to buy TMX Group, operator of Canada’s largest bourse.Oslo Børs is also fighting fierce domestic competition from rival exchanges, particularly Nasdaq OMX, the New York-based stock exchange operator. The Norwegian group is the only incumbent Nordic exchange the Nadaq OMX does not own. Relations between the two parties, once allies, grew more strained when Oslo ended a technology alliance between the pair last year and struck an alternative deal with the London Stock Exchange.Nasdaq OMX launched trading in Norwegian derivatives in 2009 but has failed to take significant market share. Oslo Børs has an 82 per cent market share, down from a near 100 per cent share two years ago, according to the Fidessa Fragmentation Index.Ms Landsnes also said that no decision on its future trading platform had been made “but it’s very near.” The bourse is mulling whether to switch over to using the London Stock Exchange’s new MillenniumIT trading system. It currently uses TradeElect, the LSE’s outgoing system.A listing on either Oslo Børs or Oslo Axess, the exchange for junior companies, would also require approval from the Norwegian finance ministry. The group plans to make its application in a couple of weeks in order to have regulatory approval before the shareholder meeting."
356;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-25T15:28:50Z;NYSE Technologies pushes into Chinese market;;NYSE Euronext has deepened its push into Asia with a deal to provide technology to the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE).The US exchanges operator will provide the technology that sends trades through the FIX protocol, a global standard for electronic order messaging to the world’s financial markets. It will allow licenced trading firms to trade faster into, and out of, China.The move underscores how exchanges in emerging markets are keen to attract high speed traders from all over the world by using cutting-edge technology from around the world.NYSE Technologies, the IT services arm of NYSE Euronext, already provides trading platforms to emerging markets such as Warsaw and Qatar but technology can just as easily move from developing countries to more mature western markets. The London Stock Exchange chose a Sri Lankan-based company, MillenniumIT, as the platform for its technology upgrade while earlier this week RTS Realtime Systems Group, a German-based trading software provider, bought India’s First Futures Software Engineering in its first acquisition since its foundation in 1992.Emerging markets have been rapidly building their trading infrastructure to meet demand from investors keen on emerging markets but China, while regarded as the largest untapped market, has been regarded as one of the most difficult to trade. Beijing has restricted foreign institutions from widely accessing the market.“With NYSE Technologies Marketplace we can now provide our members access to more than 1,200 buy-side and sell-side institutions and connections to exchanges and other electronic execution venues around the world,” said Lin Pei, vice general manager at Shanghai Stock Communications, a subsidiary of the SSE.Faced with a declining market share, incumbent exchanges have looked to boost their global profile and diversify revenues by exporting their trading platforms and information technology systems to emerging markets.Nasdaq OMX’s trading technology platform is widely regarded as one of the best in the world, powering dozens of markets including SGX Group, the Singapore exchange, while the London Stock Exchange’s technology will be used for upgrades in South Africa and Mongolia.The Asean Trading Link, a venture between the Singaporean, Thai, Malaysian and Philippines exchanges, was designed with assistance from NYSE Euronext, which has to meet an internally-set target of $1bn in turnover per year to the group by 2015.
357;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-25T14:47:58Z;Indian exchanges given SME platform go-ahead;;The Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange of India have both secured provisional approval from India’s markets regulator to establish separate platforms for small and medium sized companies as the two go head-to-head for market share.The new SME platforms will allow Indian companies to list at a lower cost and raise a smaller amount of money than on the main boards. The new platforms aim to increase visibility among investors and venture capitalists as well as providing liquidity for shareholders and encouraging entrepreneurship in India.Madhu Kannan, chief executive of the BSE, said the SME platform would tie in well with the government’s agenda of opening up India’s markets to more of the population. He said it would also provide “promising enterprises of the future to access retail capital”.Mr Kannan, a former banker who has worked for the New York Stock Exchange and Merrill Lynch, was appointed as head of the BSE two years ago with an agenda to drive through reforms at the 136-year old exchange, which had been steadily losing market share to its younger rival, the NSE.Ravi Narain, chief executive of the NSE, said SMEs played a critical role in the Indian economy: “We are committed to providing a world class platform to deserving SMEs to give them the opportunity to list. This will give them access to the capital markets in an efficient manner and help them to raise capital to meet their growth opportunities.”The Securities and Exchange Board of India, the market regulator, set out guidelines for an SME exchange last year, relaxing rules in an effort to make it easier for SMEs to list. Companies listing on the new trading platforms, for example, would only have to report half-yearly and not quarterly.The BSE said it expected to secure final approval from Sebi in the next few months after it had addressed a number of technical, regulatory and arbitration issues. The NSE said it was making good progress to “operationalise” the platform.The new trading platform will follow a hybrid model that copies elements from other exchanges such as London’s junior Aim market or Nasdaq OMX.The Multi Commodity Exchange of India, controlled by Indian markets entrepreneur Jignesh Shah’s Financial Technologies, has also signalled interest in launching its own SME platform.With only 2 per cent of India’s 1.2bn population involved in market trading, commentators point to the huge growth potential in India.Research by the International Monetary Fund and Standard Chartered suggests that India could move from being the world’s tenth largest economy, with a GDP of $1,700bn, to the world’s third largest economy by 2030.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said on Wednesday that it expected India’s economy to grow about 8.5 per cent this year.
358;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-24T14:31:36Z;DB, NYSE Euronext may still approve special payout;;Shareholders of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse may still see a billion-dollar dividend before the July deadline to vote on the proposed merger, even though the threat of a counterbid has dissippated.Following a meeting with NYSE management, Richard Repetto, an experienced analyst at Sandler O’Neill, told clients on Tuesday he believed it was likely that some kind of dividend or special cash payment would be made – something that NYSE had talked about while it was still fending off a since-withdrawn higher offer made by Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange.“Though they felt they were always shareholder friendly, the higher counter bid made them take a long hard look at how they were interacting with shareholders and what the shareholders were signaling to them,” Mr Repetto wrote in a research note, of NYSE’s top executives.With a leverage ratio target of 1.0 to 1.3 net debt to cash flow, Mr Repetto believed that NYSE could pay a dividend of between $1.5bn and $2.7bn within a year of the deal closing.He added that while the two companies could not do a share repurchase, they also could not pay a dividend payment after shareholders approved the deal, according to law in the Netherlands, where the joint holding company is set to be headquartered.“Therefore with little appetite for M&A activity at present, the potential remains for NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse to optimize their capital position and pay a one-time dividend to shareholders at the closing of the deal,” he wrote.“We also believe a special dividend would likely be structured to benefit both Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext shareholders equally,” he added. NYSE Euronext shares were trading 0.1 per cent lower at $35.20 while shares in Deutsche Börse were 0.1 per cent higher at €54.64.NYSE shareholders are set to vote on the deal on July 7 and must vote a straight majority of the shares to approve the deal. Though many shareholders have said they believed NYSE ought to consider Nasdaq-ICE’s counterbid, there is expected to be little opposition to the merger without an alternative on the table.However Deutsche Börse shareholders – who must tender 75 per cent of their shares by July 13 – may be more difficult to convince. Unions who control shares and are influential in Germany have expressed opposition to potential job losses as part of the merger’s synergies.Mr Repetto said NYSE made no definitive statements on the matter.Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext told shareholders at the annual meeting in April that NYSE and Deutsche Börse had the cash and operating strength to pay substantial dividends in their first few years as a combined company.A spokesperson for Deutsche Börse declined to comment.
359;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-20T20:49:31Z;Weak retail profits drag on Wall Street;;Barnes & Noble rose sharply after Liberty Media offered to buy the struggling US bookseller for $1bn, but worrying earnings reports from the retail sector led the wider markets down for their third successive week of losses.Barnes & Noble, the largest book retailer in the country, was up 30 per cent to $18.34 after an announcement late on Thursday.But Liberty Media, which offered about $17 per share for the group in a move that will diversify its holdings, was down 1.5 per cent to $17.70.The bid comes during tough times for booksellers, which are struggling to remain solvent as customers buy more books online, especially from Amazon, and adopt e-books.Borders, the second-largest bookseller in the US, filed for bankruptcy in February and has struggled to find a buyer.The offer for Barnes & Noble failed to lift the wider markets as sentiment was weighed down by disappointing earnings reports from the retail sector.The S&P 500 closed 0.8 per cent lower to 1,333.27, down 0.3 per cent over the week.This follows losses of 1.7 per cent and then a fall of 0.2 per cent in the first two weeks of the month.Shares in Gap, the largest US clothing chain by sales, fell 17.5 per cent to $19.21 after it reported a 23 per cent drop in first-quarter profits and slashed its earnings forecast as profits were hurt by higher commodity costs.The company said costs would rise 20 per cent in the second half and it would not be able to pass on all of this to consumers.Shares in retailer Aéropostale dropped 14.3 per cent to $18.30 after it reported a 64 per cent drop in first-quarter earnings as the company struggled with rising material costs.The S&P retail index was 1 per cent lower, down 2.9 per cent over the past five days, as other earnings also disappointed thanks to high commodity costs.This left the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.7 per cent to 12,511.89 and the Nasdaq Composite 0.7 per cent lower to 2,830.32.Sentiment was also weighed down by worries over the sovereign debt crisis in Europe.The Dow lost 0.7 per cent over the week while the Nasdaq fell 0.9 per cent.A bright spot was the initial public offering from LinkedIn, the networking website. It made a spectacular first day of trading on Thursday, jumping 109.4 per cent from its initial public offering price.The stock largely maintained those gains on Friday, falling only 1.2 per cent to $93.09, still over double the $45 IPO price and nearly triple its valuation at the beginning of the week when bankers set a price tag of $32-$35.In the energy sector, Cheniere Energy soared 32 per cent to $10.14 after announcing it had received approval from the Department of Energy to export US natural gas to more countries overseas.However the past five days on Wall Street have been generally downbeat, with sentiment weighed on by disappointing economic data.Traders were unnerved by worrying reports on the US housing markets as well as data showing a sharp drop in manufacturing activity this month.The influential Philadelphia Fed index of mid-Atlantic manufacturing showed a reading of 3.9, a sharp decrease from the 18.5 reading in April and lower than the 20 points that economists had been expecting.“Some people are arguing that we are seeing the start of a protracted slowdown in global growth as rate hikes in the emerging markets begin to bite, but I think this weakness will only last a few months,” said Paul Zemsky, chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies at ING Investment Management.The negative sentiment over the week was limited as weekly employment data came in stronger than expected, but overall the mood was downbeat and investors continued to move their money from the cyclical to defensive stocks.Since the start of the second quarter, defensive sectors like healthcare, consumer staples and utilities are up 6-9 per cent while energy, financials and materials are all down 3-6 per cent.The worst performing stocks of the week were in the consumer discretionary and the technology sectors.The technology sector was helped lower by Hewlett-Packard, which disappointed investors by lowering its full-year earnings forecasts.The stock was down 11 per cent to $35.98 over the week. The S&P technology index was 1.5 per cent lower.
360;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
361;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-20T17:51:04Z;Big exchange mergers stopped in their tracks;;With stunning speed, the week saw the unravelling of two large exchange mergers, casting a cloud over the wave of consolidation that has swept the business since October last year.First, London Stock Exchange’s attempt to forge an all-share merger with TMX Group, operator of the Toronto and Montreal bourses, was stopped in its tracks by a rival C$3.6bn bid from a consortium of Canadian banks and pension funds.The consortium, named Maple, is positioning itself as guardian of TMX’s independence from foreign entanglements.But the deal has yet to pass antitrust tests. The Maple bid would involve folding the domestic post-trade operator – currently owned by the banks – into TMX, creating a powerful, integrated exchange and clearing house.Meanwhile, a day after the Canadian development, Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange withdrew their $11.3bn bid for NYSE Euronext, after it became clear that their move would fail US antitrust tests.They were told by the US Department of Justice that their plan to merge the New York Stock Exchange with the Nasdaq market would reduce the choice of listings venues available to US companies, effectively ending the deal.The development came as a relief to NYSE Euronext, which can now proceed with a planned $9.4bn combination with Deutsche Börse, although this faces antitrust hurdles in Europe.www.ft.com/tradingroom
362;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-18T23:47:31Z;SEC probes electronic platform failures;;The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating computer system failures at electronic marketplaces including Nasdaq to determine whether internal controls are sufficient, according to people familiar with the matter.The investigation is being handled by the enforcement division’s market abuse unit and is part of a broader regulatory review of stock exchanges following last year’s “flash crash”, recent hacking attempts and trading glitches.Mary Schapiro, SEC chairman, signalled in March that exchanges could face new rules governing their technology policies, which would formalise guidance issued following the 1987 stock market crash. The guidance, known as Automation Review Policies, advises exchanges to “acquire appropriate technology and assure its functionality”.Ms Schapiro suggested new rules “would require market participants to meet adequate standards for the capacity, resiliency and security of their automated systems”.Regulators are concerned that exchanges may have let risk and internal controls weaken in a race to develop innovative trading platforms, according to a person familiar with the matter.The SEC declined to comment, as did the four largest US stock exchanges – Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, BATS Global Markets and Direct Edge.One area under scrutiny is whether exchange operators are complying with SEC rules that require quote feeds to be delivered to all investors at the same time, these people say. The agency is interested in whether exchanges are transmitting proprietary feeds that are sold to private investors faster than they are distributing feeds to the consolidated tape.SEC investigators are also looking at whether the for-profit exchange operators are following their own rules and describing them accurately to the public. For example, they are looking at whether exchanges have notified the SEC of changes to their platforms such as execution priority, so they can be scrutinised and so investors are fully informed, people familiar with the matter say.SEC investigators have grown concerned about the stability and security of computer systems following glitches at Nasdaq and other exchanges and hackers’ ability to penetrate the Nasdaq’s computer system last year, these people say. The recent run of computer problems at the London Stock Exchange, which is not regulated by the SEC, has added to that concern.Those glitches follow the flash crash on May 6 2010, which sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 700 points in minutes before it rebounded.The combination of events has exposed the fragility of the stock market and undermined confidence in the system.
363;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-17T01:32:31Z;BATS unveils cheaper listings fees;;BATS Global Markets has unveiled a cheaper pricing structure for its planned stock listings market the same day US regulators cited a lack of competition as a reason for spiking Nasdaq’s proposed merger with the New York Stock Exchange.In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Kansas City-based BATS said that top-tier issuers would pay a flat fee of $35,000 annually, after an initial fee of $100,000.That compares to an initial fee of up to $225,000 and annual fees up to $99,500 for Nasdaq’s stock market, depending on the size of the company’s stock float. NYSE-listed companies pay as much as $500,000 annually, with initial fees of up to $250,000.“While not necessarily cheaper for all issuers at all other markets, [the fees] are roughly equivalent or less than issuers would pay at other exchanges,” BATS said.BATS, among the four largest US stock exchanges by daily volume, is launching a competing US equity listing platform, set to go live by the end of this year pending SEC approval of its pricing and rules. The shares will be listed on BATS’s BZX exchange.BATS says the long-planned move will bring the same ultra-competitive, low-cost approach it used to break into stock trading in competition with Nasdaq and NYSE. The pair currently dominate listings of companies, as well as convertible securities, closed-end funds and exchange-traded funds.Among the first participants in the market will be BATS itself. Last week, BATS revealed that it planned to raise $100m in a public offering, and would list its shares on its own market.BATS named Brian King, who previously managed client relations for the company, as its listings director.The market envisioned by BATS will have similar standards to Nasdaq’s listings market, it said in the filing. To list on the top tier of BATS, a company’s shares must trade at $4 a share or more and the company must have at least 400 investors and 1.1m publicly held shares.The requirements are slightly different than those of the NYSE, which requires that the market value of listed shares must be at least $40m. BATS would allow some companies meeting other criteria, such as past profits or having market makers, to have just $8m in market value.BATS, like Nasdaq, will also have a junior listing, or “Tier II”, for smaller companies or US-listed foreign securities.“As we ready for the launch of our listings business, we remain very excited about bringing companies a fresh alternative venue to access the capital markets,” said Joe Ratterman, BATS chief executive. “BATS listings will be focused on the key differentiators that have set BATS apart from the incumbent exchanges since day one: simple and competitive pricing, innovative tools and technology, and leading customer support and education,” he said.The US justice department, in saying it would sue to stop Nasdaq from merging with the NYSE stock market – a central piece of the joint bid by Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange to buy NYSE Euronext – cited a lack of competition in listings as a key concern.“If they were to merge, they would have the ability and incentive to raise the cost of stock listings, increase listing fees and reduce the quality of services,” said Christine Varney, head of the US justice department’s antitrust division, on a conference call on Monday. “Virtually all, if not every” one of the US-based Fortune 500 companies is listed on NYSE or Nasdaq, she said.
364;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-16T21:47:32Z;Nasdaq and ICE withdraw bid for NYSE;;Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange have abandoned their $11.3bn break-up bid for NYSE Euronext after a US competition regulator threatened to sue the companies to block the potential deal.The Department of Justice said that combining the NYSE’s stock market operations with Nasdaq’s would have “substantially eliminated competition” in listings, trade reporting and other areas.Nasdaq and ICE were seeking to derail an agreed merger between the NYSE and Germany’s Deutsche Börse but on Monday withdrew their proposal, adding that they were “surprised and disappointed” by the DoJ’s decision.The abrupt end to Nasdaq-ICE’s counterbid leaves the way clear for NYSE to court shareholders ahead of a July vote on the Deutsche Börse deal.Nasdaq’s failure could increase pressure on Bob Greifeld, chief executive, to explain how the US bourse plans to compete as exchanges consolidate for global scale and greater exposure to derivatives.“This was opportunistic for Nasdaq but history has repeated itself,” said Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, referring to Mr Greifeld’s failed hostile bid for the London Stock Exchange in 2007. “As the other exchanges grow in global scale, Nasdaq will still be focused on US equities. I think investors will view them in a narrower scope.”Nasdaq and ICE have yet to reveal how much the abortive bid will cost.The DoJ on Monday said it would file an antitrust lawsuit if the bid continued, highlighting numerous concerns about a merged Nasdaq and NYSE including listings, opening and closing auctions, off-exchange stock trade reporting services and real-time data products.Nasdaq stock fell 2.5 per cent to $26.23 while NYSE shares fell nearly 13 per cent to $35.73 as investors’ hopes faded over a sweetened Deutsche Börse offer.The demise of Nasdaq’s bid comes as other proposed exchange combinations also falter. The LSE faces competition for TMX Group, operator of the Toronto and Montreal exchanges, from a group of Canadian banks and pension plans, which have lodged a C$3.6bn (US$3.7bn) counterbid designed to preserve TMX for Canada.The Australian authorities in April blocked a bid by Singapore’s SGX for the ASX exchange on national interest grounds.NYSE’s deal with Deutsche Börse, unveiled in February, is expected to face a tough antitrust review in Europe where combining the pair’s derivatives platforms would create a dominant pan-European futures exchange.But Senator Chuck Schumer of New York said on Monday that the NYSE-Deutsche Börse deal could protect jobs and strengthen New York’s position in the derivatives markets.
365;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-16T21:30:05Z;Economic data weigh on Wall Street;;Shares in NYSE Euronext fell sharply after Nasdaq OMX Group and IntercontinentalExchange withdrew their bid, while in the wider markets the week kicked off in negative territory after a slew of disappointing economic data and some mixed earnings results.NYSE Euronext dropped 11.1 per cent to $36.36 after a joint bid from Nasdaq and ICE for the exchange was withdrawn. The $11bn offer had been higher than NYSE’s already agreed deal with Deutsche Börse.The two exchanges, which had been threatening to go hostile with their bid after it was rejected by the NYSE board, blamed the move on a failure to secure regulatory approval from US authorities.Shares in Nasdaq lost 2.5 per cent to $26.23 while ICE was up 3.3 per cent to $122.22.In the wider markets the S&P 500 closed down 0.6 per cent to 1,329.147 as weak data on housing and manufacturing left investors feeling uneasy.Figures from the New York Federal Reserve showed that manufacturing growth in the New York area had fallen to its lowest level in five months.The Empire State manufacturing index fell from 21.7 in April to 11.9 in May, the lowest level since December and well below economists’ expectations of 19.9.Separately, the National Association of Home Builders’ housing market index stayed at low levels, highlighting the weakness of the US housing market.This left the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.4 per cent to 12,548.30 in the session while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.6 per cent to 2,782.31.This follows a loss of 1.9 per cent on the S&P 500 over the past two weeks as commodity prices tumbled lower and investors worried about the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Greece.The retail sector lost ground in the session as a week of earnings reports from big industry groups kicked off in a mixed fashion after JC Penney surpassed expectations but Lowe’s, the home improvement retailer, released disappointing results.JC Penney, the mid-range US department store, reported first-quarter earnings up 7 per cent, benefiting from cost reductions and from strong sales in its exclusive brand names.But sentiment in the sector was weighed on by Lowe’s lacklustre results.First-quarter net income for the home improvement store fell 6 per cent, as the weak housing market limited demand for remodelling projects.The company blamed the 1.6 per cent fall in sales on poor weather and the housing market. Lowe’s reported earnings of 34 cents a share on net income of $461m, short of the 36 cents a share expected by analysts.Shares in Lowe’s fell 3.6 per cent to $24.83 while JC Penney fell 3.2 per cent to $37.21, dragged down with the rest of the sector.The S&P retail sector was down 1 per cent, one of the worst performing on Wall Street. Last Monday, Macy’s reported strong results and later this week Home Depot, Walmart and Target will report their first-quarter earnings.The general ‘risk off’ trade hit technology stocks the hardest, with the S&P technology index falling 1.5 per cent.These losses were led by Monster Worldwide, the jobs listings service provider, was down 8.3 per cent to $14.99 while Yahoo fell 4.5 per cent to $15.81. Salesforce.com, which provides an online service for salespeople to manage their customer data, lost 4.4 per cent to $128.96.In deal news, Joy Global, which manufactures mining equipment, bought equipment maker LeTourneau Technologies from Rowan for $1.1bn. The news sent Joy Global up 1 per cent to $88.36, but Rowan lost 0.2 per cent to $37.96.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Siga Technologies added 2.3 per cent to $14.52 after the pharmaceutical company said it had won a $433m contract with the US Department of Health and Human Services to deliver 2m courses of its smallpox antiviral.The contract includes options that would raise the total value to approximately $2.8bn.Merck, another drugmaker, was up 0.6 per cent to $37.30 after it won approval to launch a new hepatitis C drug after the Food and Drug Administration evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the treatment in clinical trials.Iron Mountain, the US information storage company, was up 0.7 per cent to $32.67 after Autonomy, the UK software group, said it had agreed to buy selected assets of the company’s digital arm for $380m in cash.
366;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-16T19:29:53Z;Chill wind blows over plans for market mergers;;Another day, another global exchange merger turns to dust.The withdrawal by Nasdaq OMX of its audacious counter-offer, in partnership with Intercontinental-Exchange, for NYSE Euronext is as stunning for its timing as well as for falling a day after another exchange combination was all but scuppered.The London Stock Exchange is licking its wounds after a consortium of Canadian financial institutions on Sunday tabled a C$3.6bn ($3.7bn) bid for TMX, which had earlier agreed a tie-up with the British exchange.So, with the failure of the Singapore exchange’s takeover of the Australian exchange only five weeks ago, was the much-vaunted wave of exchange consolidation merely a gigantic spasm of executive hubris?After all, for Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq OMX chief executive, it rankled that his crosstown rival Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext chief executive, had managed to pip him to a deal by tying up with Deutsche Börse.“We are moving into a period where any deal is going to be hard to get off the ground. This will really test the mettle of CEOs and differentiate between those who thrive on buzz of deal-making versus those with the real strategic vision to grow their organisations organically,” said Niki Beattie, managing director of The Market Structure Practice, a consultancy.More importantly, it may even be the wrong time for exchange consolidation to be taking place.In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008, regulators and market participants are struggling to figure out how market structures – exchanges, trading venues, clearing houses and banks – should best be built for a post-crisis world.They know they must be run in a way that safeguards both the stability of the financial system to prevent another crisis, but also allows enough competition to keep markets liquid and functioning smoothly. The question is: does allowing structures like exchanges to get bigger and more powerful achieve that balance?That tension is causing uncertainty as market participants wait for regulators in the US to implement the Dodd-Frank act on over-the-counter derivatives and clearing houses, and as Europe grapples with similar issues.“Everyone’s struggling with putting the right regulations in place for future market structures and until those are squared away it’s going to be difficult to do any cross-border deals, particularly these megamergers,” said Robert Hegarty, global head of market structures at Thomson Reuters.Crucially, there are signs that antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have concerns about the bulking up of certain businesses and the market power they appear to have.A few weeks ago the European Commission launched a sweeping probe into the arrangements that ICE has with leading banks in OTC derivatives for the clearing of credit default swaps at its clearing house in London. The concern is possible abuse of a dominant market position, since ICE has built the clearing service in a revenue-sharing partnership with dominant dealers in OTC markets.Joaquín Almunia, EU competition commissioner, said on Monday: “Competition control should ensure that the actual evolution of the market does not lead to structures that harm users and legitimate market participants. In particular, we should prevent that any one entity or group controls essential infrastructure – be it a trading platform, a clearing platform or a pre-trading service – to the benefit of a restricted few.”In the US the failure of Nasdaq’s proposed merger with NYSE to pass antitrust tests is another sign of increased scrutiny.It stands in contrast to the approval that the justice department gave for the merger of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade in 2007, even as that created a near-monopoly in US futures trading, showing that US antitrust watchdogs are paying close attention too.Matthew Cantor, a partner at US law firm Constantine Cannon, said: “I think that in the last six months the [US] antitrust authorities have really stepped it up a notch and are shown they will be a vigorous force.”That may complicate matters for the only exchange merger left that has not run into trouble: NYSE Euronext’s agreed tie-up with Deutsche Börse which Mr Greifeld had been attempting to break up.It faces a deep and lengthy probe by Mr Almunia’s department, which is likely to study plans to combine the Börse’s Eurex futures business with Liffe, NYSE Euronext’s London-based futures exchange. This would create a near-monopoly in European futures markets, with clearing of futures contracts all taking place at the German group’s clearing house.Mr Almunia, speaking at the Cass Business School at the City University London, did not address the German-US tie-up. But he said: “Lack of competition is always a red line.”
367;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-16T19:06:11Z;Maple consortium upbeat on antitrust issue in TMX bid;;The consortium of Canadian banks and pension funds bidding for the TMX stock exchange group expressed confidence that intense competition from US exchanges and other trading platforms will allay disquiet at the banks’ heightened dominance of the domestic securities industry.Luc Bertrand, vice-chairman of Quebec-based National Bank of Canada, representing the consortium known as Maple, said on Monday that “we believe the applicable provisions of the Competition Act will be satisfied”.He noted that most big Canadian companies maintain listings on both sides of the border.For instance, about 80 per cent of trading in Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, takes place in the US.Such competition, he added, “will continue to be a major constraining factor on trading fees”.Mr Bertrand said that Maple’s approach was “very, very different” from the aborted bid by Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange for control of NYSE Euronext.While the US deal would have given Nasdaq control over listings on US markets, the Maple offer involved no change in listing arrangements in Canada.The C$3.6bn ($3.7bn) Maple cash-and-shares bid, valued at C$48 a share, offers a 24 per cent premium over an earlier merger proposal between the London Stock Exchange and TMX.Under the Maple proposal, the banks will create a “vertical silo” by folding into TMX their existing interests in CDS Clearing and Depository Services, the Toronto exchange’s clearing house, and Alpha, an alternative trading platform that has captured close to one-fifth of equity trade in Canada.The Maple group foresees significant efficiencies from combining CDS’s platform with the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation, which handles trades on the Montreal exchange.Mr Bertrand said that, unlike Nasdaq/ICE, Alpha provides limited services as a trading platform, with no authority over listings.Furthermore, Mr Bertrand said, “Canada has a unique regulatory environment from a securities and a competition law perspective”, with trading fees and access to markets subject to public interest oversight by securities commissions.
368;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-16T17:19:31Z;Nasdaq in strategic quandary after failed bid;;Nasdaq OMX, after announcing the end of its effort to acquire NYSE Euronext, now finds itself in the same strategic quandary that led it to make the high-risk, high-reward offer in the first place.It is the second time that Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive, has failed to capture a target he has gone after. A hostile bid to buy the London Stock Exchange in 2007 failed after shareholders rejected the approach.The same is true for Jeffrey Sprecher, chief executive of IntercontinentalExchange, which was bidding alongside Nasdaq. He had tried to buy the Chicago Board of Trade, but failed to break up its merger with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.But the effort to buy NYSE Euronext was viewed as being far more critical for Nasdaq, among observers and even internally among the bidding group. While ICE has grown organically in the fast-growing derivatives markets from scratch in the past decade, and is highly valued by investors, Nasdaq has struggled to grow as US equity markets have seen volumes shrink and an explosion in competition. “Yes, Nasdaq can exist as a standalone, but they have a huge handicap on the derivatives side,” says Georges Ugeux, chairman of Galileo Global Advisors and a former exchange executive.Mr Greifeld was far more visible than Mr Sprecher in selling their bid, and the focus of the deal’s purportedly vast synergies – more than $700m for an $11bn deal – was on the combining of the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, the two historical rivals.Whenever asked, Mr Greifeld argued that a singularly focused global equity-focused exchange could deliver superior returns than the “supermarket” to be created by NYSE Euronext-Deutchse Börse. On a recent earnings call, he made the semantic point that equities were a “derivative” on US economic growth.However, it was the strategic logic of combining the leading US equities exchanges that also ended up sinking the bid. US antitrust regulators seized upon the competitive implications of turning two US listings venues, which also manage opening and closing-bell price auctions, into one.Nasdaq OMX now faces the daunting question of what to do next. “By making such an aggressive bid so quickly, Greifeld aided and abetted the perception out there that he needs to do something strategically,” says Jamie Selway, a market structure analyst at brokerage ITG.Nasdaq has made strides in businesses other than cash equities, in particular technology and equity derivatives. Nasdaq’s trading technology platform is a world-beater, powering dozens of markets around the world, and potentially a better way to deliver value than via NYSE’s expensive data centre business.Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James, says that Nasdaq will probably continue to search for outside opportunities for growth in equities. At the very least, he says, Nasdaq “has demonstrated it is not afraid of levering up for the right deal”. However, many logical combinations – such as with the Singapore Exchange, or joining the proposed London Stock Exchange-TMX Group deal – face their own political hurdles as well.
369;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-16T17:19:31Z;Nasdaq/NYSE: monopoly trouble;Back to the blackboard for Nasdaq’s chief;Most American schoolkids could have guessed this deal might be blocked. OK class, name a US stock market. The New York Stock Exchange – very good! Does anyone know the other big one? Nasdaq – well done! The US Department of Justice also receives full marks on Monday for knowing the word monopoly. In its announcement that Nasdaq and IntercontinentalExchange had abandoned their bid for NYSE Euronext, the DoJ simply pointed out that the two companies “operate the major stock exchanges in the United States”.So back to school for Nasdaq chief executive Bob Greifeld. But he done well, tripling revenues since 2005, partly thanks to eight sizable acquisitions. Sure, he will be teased for being chased away from America’s oldest bourse just three years after failing to win the London Stock Exchange. But Mr Greifeld can still point to 34 per cent earnings per share growth since 2007. Nasdaq shares have outperformed NYSE’s over the last five years by 25 percentage points.Still, investors should be miffed. Nasdaq’s shares are trading at half the level they were at the end of 2007 and the pursuit of NYSE was a big distraction. Worse, the chance to bag a share of an estimated $740m in annualised synergies is off the table. That Nasdaq’s market capitalisation did not plummet on Tuesday shows that no one thought it had any chance capturing those synergies.What next for Nasdaq? The most important thing is not to be panicked into action. The fear of missing out on all the exchanges deals happening around the world these days could lead to bad moves. Rather, Mr Greifeld should concentrate on growing Nasdaq’s equity options and derivative businesses and on improving returns – making the company an attractive target. There are two sides to the consolidation game.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
370;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Quick View: Are exchanges doomed not to merge?;;Knocked right out of the ball park, before half time.That is what the US Department of Justice has just done to Nasdaq OMX’s attempted break-up of the Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext merger.Bob Greifeld must be hurting.If there is one thing that can be said for the guy, he pursued this counter-bid aggressively, with his partner Jeff Sprecher of IntercontinentalExchange.One thing stood out as odd, however. That was how over-confident he seemed of getting through the anti-trust process.Early on Mr Greifeld made some public comments on how long he thought part of the process would take. Not a good idea when you are supposed to let the justice department get on with it and keep schtum.Then last week, apropos of nothing in particular, Nasdaq OMX issued a press release saying it was “working closely” with the justice department on its review of the offer for NYSE Euronext, and that it “makes no comment on the specifics of these discussions or how they are progressing, has received no assurances from the Department of Justice as to the timing or outcome of the review”.Something must have prompted them to put that out.So far, so historical. So what now?For Mr Greifeld this is clearly a shattering blow. His move, in partnership with ICE, was pretty much the last roll of the dice for him when it came to keeping Nasdaq OMX in the global consolidation game.And the deal itself was a stretch, involving a leap of faith by NYSE shareholders in Mr Greifeld’s ability to turn a combined NYSE-Nasdaq cash equities and listings business into a proper money-spinner – when everyone knows that cash equities is a low-margin commoditised business.We heard repeated statements from Mr Greifeld that he could run the US and European cash equities businesses far more efficiently than NYSE and Deutsche Börse would.I think he probably could have, as he has a deserved reputation as cost-cutter-in-chief in the exchange business, coupled with a track record of running businesses efficiently.But that was never going to move the dial enough on the cash equities piece of this. And in any case shareholders in this sector are interested in derivatives – futures, mostly – and clearing. Mr Greifeld even tried to make the case on an April 20 earnings call that cash equities was “the original and the most important derivative product” since it was “a derivative of the economy”. Hello?And Mr Greifeld was the most leveraged of his peers in the exchange sector. That was before he lined up $3.8bn in financing from a consortium of banks for the NYSE counter-offer.Mr Greifeld is not known for giving up easily on anything, so this will have been hard. His next option might be to have another go at the London Stock Exchange, for which he famously pursued a hostile bid which ultimately failed in 2006.The LSE’s own attempt to combine with TMX Group of Canada lies almost in tatters after a bank and pension fund-led consortium tabled a C$3.6bn bid for TMX on Monday. The market certainly jumped to that immediate conclusion, puhsing the LSE shares as high as 899p, its highest level since it agreed to merge with TMX.But is it not also possible that, after three of the four exchange deals to have emerged since October last year – the first being SGX of Singapore’s attempted takeover of ASX of Australia, it may actually be that none of these deals happen?The US antitrust decision in the Nasdaq OMX-NYSE case could be interpreted as making it all the easier for European antitrust regulators to erect barriers to the DB/NYSE deal, if not blocking it outright.And with the mood music among European antitrust regulators being distinctly pro-competition – you only have to look at the recent case launched against ICE in credit default swaps clearing – it may be that DB/NYSE’s path to approval may be more complicated.
371;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-15T21:22:07Z;Protectionist instincts are rising;;Unfurl the national flag, wave it about and make rude noises about foreigners.That seems to be the strategy employed by a large swathe of financial interests in Canada as they seek to stop the TMX Group from consummating an agreed merger with the London Stock Exchange.It looks very much like a replay of what happened in Australia weeks ago, when Canberra – in what it said was “a no-brainer” – blocked the Singapore exchange’s planned takeover of the Australian bourse on national interest grounds.Protectionist instincts are welling up as a wave of exchange mergers sweeps the globe.Yet what’s odd is that countries have barely blinked as their national airlines, telecoms companies – even carmakers – have all but disappeared in cross-continental mergers.What’s so different about exchanges? Are we not told repeatedly that capital is global and trading – whether it be stocks, bonds or derivatives – is an increasingly borderless affair?One answer lies in the regulatory clean-up after the financial crisis. G20 nations agreed to set up new market structures to ensure that over-the-counter derivatives move on to exchanges and be processed at clearing houses to help safeguard the financial system.Countries such as Canada are keen to ensure they have such market structures of their own, without London and New York hogging the game.And some countries worry about a world dominated by vast trans-national exchanges forged by big US and European players – such as NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse, which are pursuing a merger of their own (that is, unless Nasdaq OMX and ICE, two other US exchanges, don’t break up their party first).That partly explains the attempt to turn TMX into a national champion. Exchanges are suddenly too important, to some, to be traded away in the name of globalisation.Now that protectionism has claimed two big exchange mergers, the worry for those left is that they may get caught up in the flag-waving, too.
372;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-15T18:21:04Z;Counterbid for TMX catches LSE on the hop;;"If the Canadian banks and pension funds trying to scupper the London Stock Exchange’s merger with TMX Group chose their moment to inflict maximum embarrassment on the UK bourse, they chose well.Xavier Rolet, the LSE’s chief executive, ended a long day on Friday buoyed by reporting its best set of results for years. Efforts to diversify into lucrative areas such as derivatives and clearing are starting to pay off.The same day, the LSE had even filed applications with provincial securities regulators in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia for approval of the LSE’s planned merger with TMX Group, unveiled in mid-February.But on Saturday news started to filter through that what could be his crowning achievement since taking over in 2009 – a transatlantic merger – had run into a significant roadblock.Last night, a consortium of Canadian banks and pension funds codenamed Maple unveiled a C$3.6bn (US$3.7bn) counterbid for TMX Group to keep the operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange and Montreal’s derivatives exchange in Canadian hands. The LSE has said it stands by its agreed merger with TMX. But it seems unlikely that if TMX shareholders accept the Maple offer, the LSE would risk a protracted and expensive battle to defend its deal.The LSE would have few options but to quietly drop the bid, given the financial firepower that Maple is bringing to bear, coupled with a tailwind of nationalist sentiment.Niki Beattie, managing director at The Market Structure Practice, a consultancy, says: “It’s a massive blow for them [the LSE].”Fortunately, as Friday’s full-year earnings showed, Mr Rolet’s efforts are paying off. The LSE is earning more from high-margin services such as clearing – at its Italian clearing house – than from fees charged when traders place a trade.The exchange’s customers have also benefited as its UK clearing service provider, LCH.Clearnet, has cut fees. Mr Rolet says the LSE is set to attract “high-frequency” traders from the US with the launch of a new service that will allow them easier access.For Mr Rolet and observers in London, the surprise is that the TMX deal, of all the deals in the current wave of exchange consolidation, encountered such problems. Other moves – such as Deutsche Börse’s planned merger with NYSE Euronext and the subsequent spoiler bid from Nasdaq OMX and Intercontinental­Exchange – have been more obviously contentious.By contrast, says Ms Beattie, the LSE-TMX deal “is the most benign deal out there”, with no antitrust issues. Both exchanges share the same language and legal system.Mr Rolet and his counterpart at TMX, Tom Kloet, were careful to stress that the Canadian exchanges in the combined group would be run by Canadian residents; that the group would have joint headquarters in London and Toronto; and that the board would be made up of seven Canadians, five Britons and three Italians.The LSE even fielded two fluent French speakers – Mr Rolet and Nic Bertrand, his French head of markets – to help lobby regulators and others in Quebec. But the fact the LSE would end up with 55 per cent of a holding company, leaving the Canadians with the rest, still rankled in Canada.The Maple consortium will have to prove that control of TMX by a handful of powerful Canadian banks and pension funds will not disenfranchise big customers that are not owners in TMX.Mr Rolet will be hoping he has time to secure the LSE’s future before his larger rivals figure all that out – and pounce on the UK exchange."
373;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-12T18:06:50Z;Banks look to counter LSE’s TMX deal;;"This week a giant blue illuminated ball and electronic ticker tapes were inaugurated at the London Stock Exchange as the UK bourse launched a new market opening ceremony to kick off trading each day.It was probably a welcome distraction for Xavier Rolet, LSE chief executive, from having to follow the progress of his planned “merger of equals” with TMX Group, operator of the Toronto and Montreal exchanges, thousands of miles away in Canada.Unveiled three months ago, the LSE-TMX deal has been overshadowed by a bigger battle revolving around NYSE Euronext, the US exchange that owns the New York Stock Exchange. Although it agreed a $9.4bn combination with Germany’s Deutsche Börse, Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange are pursuing a bid to snatch NYSE Euronext away.Now Mr Rolet and his TMX counterpart, Tom Kloet, could be facing a possible counterbid for the TMX from a group of local financial institutions.Banks opposed to the merger, led by Toronto-Dominion, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Quebec-based National Bank of Canada, are exploring other options for TMX with institutions such as pension funds, one person familiar with the discussions said.He said the talks were prompted by a desire to build on TMX’s strengths rather than allow it to fall under the control of a foreign institution, such as the LSE. He noted that both Mr Rolet, a Frenchman, and Mr Kloet, an American, are foreigners with little appreciation of Canadian sensibilities.Mr Rolet and Mr Kloet have stressed that the Canadian exchanges in the combined group would be run by Canadian residents; that the group would have joint headquarters in London and Toronto; and that the board would be made up of seven Canadians, five Britons and three Italians, from Borsa Italiana.The banks have a sizeable stake in TMX’s fate, owning two-thirds of CDS Clearing and Depository Services, Canada’s main securities clearing house. TMX and a securities industry regulator own the remaining 33 per cent, and CDS is run as a non-profit partnership.The banks, through their brokerage arms, also control Alpha Trading Systems, an alternative trading platform which has captured 19 per cent of the value of equities traded in Canada. The Toronto exchange’s share has slipped from 87 per cent two years ago to 65 per cent in the first three months of this year, as share trading has fragmented across venues, as it has in the US and Europe.The banks see an opportunity in giving the exchange greater control of CDS.Such a move would transform the clearing house from a low-margin, user-owned utility into a money-spinner along the lines of Deutsche Börse, which has its own clearing house in what the industry calls a vertical silo.Exchanges that have their own clearer tend to have higher stock market valuations since they are able to collect clearing fees on the trades that are done on their platforms.But the banks face some daunting obstacles. They have conflicts of interest stemming from their stakes in Alpha and CDS. The banks would gain a near monopoly over securities trading if they were allowed to control both Alpha and the Toronto and Montreal exchanges.Mr Rolet said this week: “If there is another project out there that materialises we will see what it is.“It will also highlight the benefits of our transaction. It is an exchange-to-exchange transaction which is by definition neutral.“And the concept of certain clients or constituencies controlling an exchange raises a whole host of other questions,” he said.Canadians have a love-hate relationship with the banks, respecting their stability while chafing at their size and influence.Any TMX deal involving the banks would force politicians and regulators to choose between the potential rewards of creating a national champion and the risks of the banks abusing their extra power.Tom Caldwell, a Toronto securities dealer whose company, Caldwell Financial, invests in exchanges, said a bid for TMX involving the banks “would be a terrible thing for Canadian markets”, adding that “exchanges should be neutral”.The dilemmas facing the banks are already on display in the LSE-TMX deal. Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s biggest financial institution, and Bank of Montreal have publicly supported the LSE deal. But each is an adviser to one of the parties.Still, Mr Caldwell said he would not be surprised to see a counterbid: “If the banks do come in, it depends on how they package it and the price.”"
374;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-12T10:54:58Z;D Börse raises NYSE revenue forecasts;;Deutsche Börse on Thursday raised its estimates for revenue synergies that could be achieved in its planned combination with NYSE Euronext from €100m ($141m) to €150m partly through expanding the group’s clearing service across the proposed new group.Reto Francioni, Deutsche Börse chief executive, also attacked the counter-bid for NYSE Euronext by Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange, saying it would lead to a monopoly in US listings, weaken New York as a financial centre and “marginalise” European cash markets through “a US-oriented Nasdaq and NYSE Euronext combination”.Mr Francioni told the German group’s shareholder meeting that cost synergies would now likely be €400m, up from an original estimate of €300m, confirming a new figure earlier disclosed by Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext chief executive, in an interview with the Financial Times.Mr Francioni said: “We have also made advances in recent days with NYSE Euronext in calculating revenue synergies. Instead of a figure of €100m, as originally estimated, we now expect to see synergies of €150m.”He said the larger synergies would come from the “progressive introduction” of Eurex Clearing across the whole group and extension of risk management to all cash and derivatives markets.“A global clearing infrastructure will be formed which will significantly enhance risk management and efficiency in the use of capital for our customers,” Mr Francioni said.Extra revenue would also come from the combination of equity and derivatives markets, allowing “cross-selling across European spot markets”.Customers would also benefit from “stronger hosting and management of technology and data services”, and the extension of the Stoxx index benchmark business to the US.Mr Francioni made his most vocal criticism of the Nasdaq OMX-ICE counter-bid, saying huge jobs cuts would result in New York as a result of a “high degree of overlap in structures”.“By bringing together complementary business areas, the [DB/NYSE] merger will create the world’s leading exchange organisation which will be unique in addressing the needs of the market for global presence and breadth of product offering.“By contrast, the Nasdaq and ICE bid is focused on breaking up NYSE Euronext to form a cash market operator focused on the US market with very limited growth potential and a monopoly for US listings,” Mr Francioni said.Mr Francioni also sought to play up the impact on Frankfurt as a financial centre of the planned combination of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext.“When negotiating the [merger], we placed utmost importance on protecting the interests of Deutsche Börse and of Frankfurt as a financial centre. Frankfurt has so far served as an important financial centre in Europe. But with the merger, Frankfurt will become a key location in the global capital market,” he said.“What is better – being globally connected up in a globalised world, or cocooned in a local environment? To me, the answer is obvious: the merger in the form we have agreed will strengthen Frankfurt as a financial centre and will therefore also strengthen Germany as a financial location.”
375;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-12T06:45:50Z;City fortunes in flux as exchanges merge;;In the centres of Paris and Brussels two neoclassical buildings, each with the word “Bourse” engraved above their entrances, tell a story of once-proud national stock exchanges, their floors teeming with traders.But for years the buildings have been empty, or have provided office space, as trading has gone electronic and the bourses have become part of the NYSE Euronext group, operator of exchanges in the US and across Europe. But their disappearance does not mean that national pride in hosting key market infrastructure has entirely disappeared from Europe too.As a wave of exchange mergers sweeps the globe, a tense game is being played by exchanges as they seek to assure political leaders in Europe’s financial centres – from the dominant one in London to tiny Lisbon – that they will not lose out as the mergers move towards their endgames.NYSE Euronext is trying to finalise a planned $9.4bn merger with Deutsche Börse, of Germany.This would create by far the largest exchange in the world, a sprawling entity including the New York Stock Exchange and NYSE Euronext’s four European stock markets of Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon, with the German exchange’s Frankfurt Stock Exchange.The Börse’s big Eurex derivatives business would be combined with the NYSE Liffe futures exchange, which is based in London.Yet NYSE rival Nasdaq OMX has teamed up with another US exchange, IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE, to thwart the merger, with a $11.4bn cash and shares offer to NYSE Euronext shareholders for the NYSE Euronext business.Each permutation has significant implications for London, Frankfurt, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, since each places different emphasis on where certain businesses will be located.But what is making matters politically charged is how big changes to the trading landscape since 2007, combined with the financial crisis a year later, have turned Europe’s capitals into competitors like never before.The London, Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam share markets lost their near-monopolies in share trading with the enactment by the European Commission in 2007 of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid).That created competition for the first time, provided largely by London-based upstarts and giving the UK financial centre a boost at the expense of its smaller rivals. In the wake of the crisis, London’s Anglo-Saxon financial model became an easy target for continental European capitals eager to encourage market infrastructures to their centres instead.Against this backdrop, the merging exchanges are playing “a high-stakes game”, says Niki Beattie, managing director of the Market Structure Practice, a consultancy.“Paris and Amsterdam and Frankfurt have all felt they probably ceded something to London post-Mifid [Europe’s markets in financial instruments directive], so all of them probably want to take something back. Everyone’s looking to be appeased,” she says.That explains why the chief executives of each exchange have been shuttling from capital to capital trying to reassure politicians and regulators that their city will be a winner from the deals.In recent weeks Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, met the chief of staff of French president Nicolas Sarkozy. This week Mr Greifeld revealed that he had offered the French to restore the name “Paris Bourse” to France’s stock market if Nasdaq-ICE wins the battle for control of NYSE Euronext.When the Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext tie-up was announced, Paris Europlace insisted the two exchanges ensure that Paris remain “the largest stock-listing activity in the eurozone”.Speaking before the Nasdaq-ICE bid emerged, French finance minister Christine Lagarde said of the Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext deal: “It was my initial concern – is that going to be a New York-Frankfurt alliance and Paris will fall between the cracks? I don’t think so.”The chief executives of these two groups, respectively Reto Francioni and Duncan Niederauer, have also done the rounds. While Frankfurt looks set to benefit in any US-German deal, both men have been careful not to ignore Paris and Amsterdam in their public statements. For London, the key factor will be what happens to Liffe, the futures exchange run by NYSE Euronext. The Nasdaq-ICE camp argue that Liffe would eventually be “gutted” because it would become subsumed in the Eurex business in Frankfurt. NYSE Euronext rejects the notion, saying that while the ancillary business of providing clearing services may move to Frankfurt, over time Liffe will remain intact.Diego Valiante of the European Capital Markets Institute, a Brussels thinktank, says London will ultimately keep its position as top financial centre.“It is complicated as there are a lot of national interest arguments. But London will survive.”…………………………………………..NYC flashpointThe fate of New York city has become a flashpoint in the exchange takeover battle, writes Telis Demos in New York.Both potential deals, the NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse tie-up, and the Nasdaq OMX-IntercontinentalExchange offer to buy NYSE, are promising at least $700m in synergies, primarily from cost-cutting.US politicians, notably Charles Schumer, the senior senator from New York, have asked both NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq to detail potential job losses that might result from those cost cuts. He suggests any entity keep “New York” at the front of its name.In Nasdaq’s vision, it would combine trading platforms and data centres for the six US equity and options exchanges it would control after acquiring NYSE, and create a near-monopoly listings exchange. NYSE has argued that 800 jobs would be lost in New York with Nasdaq’s savings. However, Nasdaq has not said how many job cuts could result, arguing that NYSE has blocked it from doing due diligence.Nasdaq argues its deal could restore New York city as a global financial hub by creating a national champion of listings.Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, has pointed to the Prada initial public offering, which chose Hong Kong, and Glencore, which chose Hong Kong and London, as evidence that New York is losing its appeal.Duncan Niederauer, NYSE chief executive, has instead pointed to a rush of Chinese groups listing in New York, primarily on NYSE, as evidence the city has not lost its edge.

The management and supervisory boards recommend the merger explicitly as the best option for all shareholders, clients and financial centres involved and thus also for the employees,” a spokesman said.The works council’s views mirror similar worries about the deal voiced by local politicians and parts of the German press, which fret that the merged group would in the end be dominated by NYSE Euronext and that Frankfurt could lose out as a financial centre.
377;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-10T21:34:05Z;Nasdaq in offer to Paris over NYSE bid;;Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange group, has offered to restore the name “Paris Bourse” to France’s stock market, if it wins the battle for control of NYSE Euronext, current operator of the Paris exchange.The disclosure, by Nasdaq chief executive Bob Greifeld, is the latest twist in an increasingly aggressive effort by Nasdaq and its partner IntercontinentalExchange to persuade NYSE shareholders of the merits of its counter-bid for NYSE Euronext.Nasdaq and ICE are trying to break up a $9.4bn agreed merger between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse, unveiled in mid-February. This week Mr Greifeld met arbitrage hedge funds, as part of a campaign to persuade shareholders to vote against the Deutsche Börse deal.Mr Greifeld and Jeff Sprecher, ICE’s chief executive, have also swept through Europe in recent weeks to sell their deal to regulators and the French and Dutch authorities.Their support for either deal will be crucial, given that the French stock market and Dutch options market are key parts of Euronext, which Mr Greifeld and Mr Sprecher would run if their bid is successful.Mr Greifeld said on Tuesday that he had offered the French authorities to resurrect the Paris Bourse name, which was lost when it was subsumed in the Euronext group of exchanges – including Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon – in 2000.However, he said the response had been muted. “I’m all for it. I went there [to Paris] expecting that we would be universally applauded for that approach, but the response has been more nuanced,” he told the Financial Times.Wooing Paris is important because the French government is keen that market infrastructures such as exchanges and clearing houses be based in Paris as a counterweight to London.Mr Greifeld has pledged to run the European cash equities markets more efficiently than NYSE Euronext, as part of achieving cost synergies of $740m. A combination of OMX, Nasdaq’s existing Nordic markets and the Euronext markets would create “the first and most comprehensive pan-European [cash equities] market”, he has said.Mr Greifeld originally offered to move a large data centre and trading systems built by NYSE Euronext outside London back to Paris. But he said he had all but abandoned this idea after customers told Nasdaq they would not support the move. “It was our hope that we could do that. We have been in intensive dialogue with customers and they are saying we didn’t want that to happen,” he said.Instead Nasdaq was in talks with Clearnet SA, the French arm of UK-based clearing house LCH.Clearnet, about ensuring that clearing of cash equities would stay in Paris.
378;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-10T20:31:46Z;Quick View: How to woo the French?;;Ever since Nasdaq and IntercontinentalExchange announced their counter-bid for NYSE Euronext, one of the key elements of Nasdaq OMX chief executive’s strategy has been one of paying close attention to Paris.Robert Greifeld said on numerous occasions that it was an option to move the data centre that NYSE Euronext built in Basildon, England (at vast expense) to Paris, effectively moving back to the French capital the trading system that has long been used to handle cash equities on Euronext back to Paris.But as of Tuesday, that idea appeared to be off the table.In an interview, Mr Greifeld said customers expressed that they were not keen on the idea. “It was our hope that we could do that. We have been in intensive dialogue with customers and they are saying they don’t want that to happen.”This is not surprising. Moving the data centre back to Paris – where Euronext’s “UTP” trading platform was before – would entail yet more costly reconfiguration of connections and technology only a few months after banks and brokers did what they had to do to connect up to Basildon. That omelette is made, and can’t be unscrambled, basically.So, how else to please Paris? Because Paris needs to hear how it will benefit from a combined Nasdaq-ICE deal.(And by the way, I understand that Nasdaq-ICE are not making any changes to their cost synergy numbers immediately, just because the data centre issue is not going in Paris’s favour).Mr Greifeld said he had offered the French authorities the restoration of the “Paris Bourse” name, which was abandoned when “NYSE Euronext” became the banner over the markets in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon in 2000.That was a nice touch, and included reverting the Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon exchanges to their original names too. But Mr Greifeld was candid enough to admit that it was met with a lukewarm response. “The input has been more positive on this side of the pond [the US] for changing the names back, more thoughtful in Paris and the other centres,” was how he put it, diplomatically.The fact is, merely re-labelling the Paris exchange does not amount to what the French want: building market infrastructures in Paris.That probably explains why Mr Greifeld is, as he told me, in talks with Clearnet SA, the French arm of LCH.Clearnet, about ensuring that cash equities clearing of French stocks stays in Paris. “We certainly believe a better path for us is to commit to having the clearing business stay in Paris,” he said.With clearing and market structures generally in such flux in Europe, thanks to the Mifid review and the tensions emerging between EU member states over Emir, or the European Market Structures Regulation – Europe’s equivalent of Dodd-Frank when it comes to over-the-counter derivatives and clearing – these issues are central to how things will play out between Deutsche Borse/NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq-ICE with its rival bid.Each side will have to play a very careful game with French, Dutch and other authorities, because there is a lot at stake for certain European capitals in the ultimate outcome – jobs, markets and national pride. And I have not yet got into the issue around Liffe, and whether the NYSE Euronext derivatives exchange would be better in the hands of Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, or under Deutsche Borse (see the current video on FT Trading Room for a discussion of that). Or the Dutch options market, for that matter.Mr Greifeld has spent quality time in Europe of late. That is because while the US analyst and investor community is focused on the US implications of his proposed takeover of NYSE, the European context is arguably just as important. Ditto the European antitrust issues around the Deutsche Borse/NYSE Euronext deal, which I think continue to be underestimated by the US analyst community.Mr Greifeld said Nasdaq-ICE is preparing responses to “a detailed set of questions” that the French authorities have raised (and which I understand have been sent to all four exchange protagonists).He is clearly determined to get the European piece of this sorted out. Not being able to do due diligence on Euronext’s books will continue to be a handicap, as he has indicated on previous analysts calls. So in the meantime he is forced to offer what he can to make this work for various European capitals. Not easy.“With the data centre having moved out of Paris, it makes the job [of building up Paris in a Nasdaq-ICE deal] a little bit harder but certainly not impossible,” he said, adding that Paris is “not as strong a financial centre” as it was before the New York Stock Exchange bought Euronext in 2007.The question then comes back to …how to woo the French?
379;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-09T22:19:20Z;Nasdaq and ICE try to woo arbitrage hedge funds;;Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange have been holding talks with merger arbitrage hedge funds, hoping to get them to vote against NYSE Euronext’s proposed merger with Deutsche Börse, according to people familiar with the talks.Nasdaq and ICE have been talking directly to NYSE shareholders and potential investors after the NYSE board twice rejected formally considering their rival, higher bid for the exchange, moving to press ahead with a shareholder vote for July 7 on merging with Deutsche Börse.A letter sent on Monday addressed to NYSE shareholders from Robert Greifeld and Jeffrey Sprecher, the chiefs of Nasdaq and ICE respectively, argued that NYSE would lose the option of considering the rival bid if stockholders vote to approve the Deutsche Börse merger, which could be blocked by antitrust authorities in Europe. Deutsche Börse has said it does not expect approval for several months or even until next year.“You won’t know on July 7 whether regulatory approvals for the Deutsche Börse transaction can be obtained or, even if obtained, the conditions or remedies regulators may require in order for the transaction to close, which may reduce the value of the combined organisation,” they wrote. “But if the proposed Deutsche Börse transaction is approved by stockholders, it would be impossible to consider our financially superior proposal.”“Demand of your board that they meet with us and at the same time ask them, ‘What’s the rush?’” they wrote.NYSE Euronext declined to comment on the letter. A person close to the company said that NYSE was trying to respect a German law that exchange offers must be made within a certain number of weeks of the announcement of a deal.The Deutsche Börse deal was announced February 15, following a leak in the German press, giving the German exchange until May 4 to make a formal exchange offer to its shareholders. Following that, D Börse shareholders would have until July 12 to tender their shares.Meanwhile, hedge funds have been hesitant to accumulate positions in NYSE even though its shares are trading at roughly a $2 discount to the Nasdaq-ICE offer. They cite regulatory uncertainty with both bids, plus the potential that the German exchange could offer inducements to close the $1bn gap between the value of its all-share offer for NYSE and Nasdaq-ICE’s cash-and-shares offer.Mr Greifeld and Mr Sprecher face some pressure of their own to improve their bid to clinch shareholder support, which they will likely address in their meeting with some 60 hedge funds on Monday. They have also been asked by some investors to detail the financing agreements to fund their bid.The two have already offered a $350m reverse breakup fee and have challenged the additional cost savings NYSE and Deutsche Börse have claimed to narrow the gap between the prospective gains offered by the two bids.Additional reporting by Jeremy Grant and Helen Thomas
380;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-08T19:30:51Z;SEC reform proposal threatens ‘dark pools’;;The US Securities and Exchange Commission is considering a proposal to move more trading back on to exchanges from alternative venues such as “dark pools”, which has drawn sharp criticism from banks and many trading firms.David Shillman, associate director of the SEC’s division of trading and markets, told the Financial Times that a so-called “trade at” rule is “very much in play. There’s interest in it”. The “trade at” rule, which would require non-exchange venues to improve on the displayed market price, is a response to concerns among some academics and market participants that a rising share of trading happening outside of exchanges is making trading more expensive and difficult.Mr Shillman said it was among the more dramatic market reforms under consideration. “It’s controversial, and will be the subject of much discussion.”SEC staff will assess the impact of off-exchange trading on volatility and less-liquid stocks. “One thing we would hope to have is some indication that price discovery is suffering,” Mr Shillman said. “We were hopeful we would get more data than we did in response to our requests.”Since the current market rules were introduced in 2006 the share of US trading volume on exchanges that display prices, which includes the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, has dropped to about 70 per cent. The rest are executed in markets where prices are not displayed, known as “dark pools”, the largest of which are operated by Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs, or matched internally by banks and market making firms such as Citigroup, UBS and Knight Capital.“Trade at” was discussed in the SEC’s broad concept release on the structure of the equity markets more than a year ago. But it has received renewed attention after a panel of academics recommended it as a possible reform in response to the “flash crash” on May 6, 2010, when many market-makers stopped matching trades. On May 6, the S&P 500 index fell and rebounded 6 per cent in 20 minutes.Opposition to the rule has been strong by market-makers. Thomas Joyce, chief executive of Knight, said it was “completely nuts” that “regulators would try to curtail competition when the exchanges are going to become huge monoliths”, referring to merger discussions by exchange groups.Citigroup said it estimates that retail traders saved $238m on their trades in 2010, versus $126m in 2006, owing to off-exchange trading. However, Daniel Weaver, a professor at Rutgers University, found that retail traders paid on average some $10m more a year owing to rising levels of off-exchange trading. The study was partly funded by NYSE.NYSE and Nasdaq support some incentives to trade in displayed markets, but not complete trade at protection. Joe Mecane, executive vice-president at NYSE Euronext, described this as a “watered down” version of the rule.
381;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-08T17:29:51Z;NYSE Euronext investors play waiting game;;Investors looking to profit from competing bids for NYSE Euronext are hesitant to build large positions until closer to a July shareholder vote on its agreed tie-up with Deutsche Börse.NYSE’s board has twice rejected a higher, rival offer by Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange.Nasdaq and ICE have pursued shareholders to solicit the board to reconsider, and have said they intend to make a formal hostile offer.That is also meant to draw arbitrage hedge funds, which seek to profit from the gap between NYSE’s share price and the Nasdaq-ICE offer by buying shares below the value of Nasdaq-ICE’s bid and voting against the Deutsche Börse deal.But many hedge funds are not yet heeding the call in great numbers.They cite the likelihood that Deutsche Börse may offer inducements to close the 11 per cent gap – as of Friday’s close – between the offers, in addition to uncertainty over how regulators will view the two deals.One hedge fund manager, who has already acquired a small position, said: “I’m not going to buy any more shares, and not many other people are either. The tender offer doesn’t address the fundamental antitrust issues. There’s no way this deal is going to close by July, and probably not even by year-end. There’s plenty of time.”The NYSE share price bears out this ambivalence. At $40.09, it is roughly at the midpoint of the two bids, with the Nasdaq-ICE offer at roughly $42 and the Deutsche Börse swap valued at about $38 at Friday’s close.Hedge fund managers pointed to last year’s battle for car rental company Dollar Thrifty. In this case, an agreed deal with Hertz and an interloper proposal from Avis both threatened to require stringent review by competition authorities, making some arbitrage investors cautious.Shareholders voted down Dollar Thrifty’s deal with Hertz last September but, nearly 10 months later, the company is still working with regulators on a possible combination with Avis, leaving investors’ payout still in doubt.Jeffery Sprecher, chief executive of ICE, told analysts last week that the Deutsche Börse merger would “definitely fail” if voted on by NYSE shareholders today.Several large institutions have come out in support of further exploring Nasdaq-ICE’s bid, citing the price gap.He also said NYSE did not do enough to inform shareholders that May 9 would be the last day they could acquire shares and vote in July, known as the record date.A person close to NYSE said it made that date clear in an electronic bulletin.According to another person close to NYSE, only about 10-15 per cent of the shares are held by arbitrage hedge funds, though sources close to Nasdaq and ICE say hedge funds may own closer to 20 per cent.Some investors agreed that the Deutsche Börse-NYSE deal could fail a shareholder vote today because of the value gap, potential moves in the share prices or value of the euro, and because there will not be certainty from regulators, especially in Europe.In a filing this week, Deutsche Börse said it did not expect a formal reply from antitrust authorities until at least next year.However, that may not be enough to draw in arbitrage funds to advocate for Nasdaq-ICE.“Many investors, even if they think [Deutsche Börse-NYSE] is a better deal, cannot make the decision to take the lower offer,” said Georges Ugeux, chairman of Galileo Global Advisors and a former NYSE executive and Deutsche Börse adviser. “But whatever the picture is we have today, it is not relevant. There is too much uncertainty.”Rick Wetmore, portfolio manager with Turner Investments, which owns shares in several exchanges, said: “I think the changes that need to be made by NYSE and Deutsche to appease shareholders are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things.”
382;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-06T04:54:29Z;US exchanges eye harmonised pause rules;;Leading US exchanges have said that in discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission they will probably harmonise their mechanisms to pause trading in volatile periods.The New York Stock Exchange, whose Liquidity Refreshment Point programme halts trading, and Nasdaq, which uses Volatility Guard, say they may withdraw those mechanisms when the SEC finalises market-wide pause rules.The move reflects efforts by the industry to improve the infrastructure of US equity trading a year after the “ flash crash” revealed the shortcomings of a fragmented trading environment.In a study of the events of May 6 2010 – when the S&P 500 rose and fell nearly 6 per cent in 20 minutes – regulators identified different rules for pausing trading as a source of market confusion that led to panic selling.In the hours and days after the crash, the chief executives of NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX – now duelling in a merger battle – both appeared on television arguing that the other’s rules, or lack thereof, had added to the confusion.The SEC has said it would, in addition to circuit breakers adopted last year, add a mechanism known as “limit up/limit down” that places a 5 per cent band around share prices, outside of which trades cannot be made. The scheme does not pause trading.“If in our opinion ‘limit up/limit down’ meets the needs of the marketplace, we will likely voluntarily withdraw our guard at that point. Our hope is that every market will do that,” said Eric Noll, executive vice-president of transaction services at Nasdaq.Nasdaq earlier this year delayed the introduction of its Volatility Guard programme, which was developed before May 6.Joe Mecane, chief administrative officer for US markets at NYSE Euronext, said: “We’ve told the SEC that if those mechanisms ultimately make LRPs redundant, then we’ll look to either modify or get rid of LRPs.”The SEC has not yet issued a formal rule on limit-up/limit-down, and is still in discussion with exchanges and interest groups, such as the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, over how to structure the rule. Debates include how wide the band should be and how the market open and close should be dealt with.“There is a need for greater clarity and uniformity around the rules. Harmonisation is easier said than done, but without it another May 6 is possible,” said John McCarthy, general counsel at Getco, the market-making firm.
383;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-05T17:23:01Z;Fears linger of new ‘flash crash’;;In the space of just 20 minutes a year ago on Friday, Wall Street tumbled hundreds of points, dumbfounding dealers, only to rebound sharply. The extraordinary gyration in stocks, dubbed the “flash crash”, stunned investors and revealed gaping holes in the equity market’s structure.Such a chronic breakdown in the operation of the world’s largest stock market sparked an investigation by regulators, scrutiny from Washington and a flurry of new rules.Yet one year later, unease lingers that in spite of new safeguards, stock prices are vulnerable to bouts of sudden selling. For all the talk and action, the big concern remains that the Dow could suffer a repeat of last May’s crash.“We will have another flash crash, yes without question,” says James Angel, associate professor of finance at Georgetown university. “The combination of human nature, markets and technology means that at some point, something will misfire.”After the flash crash, the Securities and Exchange Commission moved quickly to introduce circuit-breakers, designed to impose a “time-out” whenever trading in a stock causes prices to swing too wildly. It also plans to introduce a “limit-up, limit-down” mechanism to prevent trades outside a certain price band.Tom Joyce, chief executive of Knight Capital, says: “The SEC responded in a measured and appropriate way and the introduction of circuit-breakers and soon-to-be-established limit-up, limit-down rules help reduce systemic risk.”Other SEC changes include the elimination of “stub” quotes – quotes that are deliberately set at a huge variance to share prices by market makers to satisfy their obligation to maintain a two-sided market both for buyers and sellers of a stock.Still to come are a possible recalibration of market-wide circuit-breakers that were not triggered on May 6 and a real-time “audit trail” to detect disruption.The confusion surrounding the crash was, some believe, exacerbated by exchanges’ different rules. The New York Stock Exchange, for example, now uses its own circuit breakers, while Nasdaq has its own proposed version. They could drop their their independent efforts once market-wide mechanisms are fixed.However, such steps, while they have been welcomed, are not intended to address more fundamental issues, including some that were raised by the SEC before the crash. Rather, they are designed, says John McCarthy, general counsel at market maker Getco, “to prevent the exact same May 6 from happening again”.The plunge in stocks was compounded by some buyers briefly withdrawing their support and turning off computer systems, even though the largest groups, including Getco, remained in the market. Participants such as brokers that match trades internally or in “dark pools”, where orders are matched with prices not revealed beforehand, tried to sell millions of shares in the public market.This led to thousands of trades being broken, with blue-chip stocks such as Accenture at one point trading as low as one cent amid a dearth of liquidity.There is still intense debate about how to tackle that withdrawal of liquidity. “There is no silver bullet, but to prevent another, new kind of May 6, we’re strong advocates of additional tools like clarifying rules to explicitly state obligations and benefits for bonafide market making,” says Mr McCarthy.Some say withdrawals from the market are inevitable no matter what changes are introduced. “It is tough to expect someone to step in front of a freight train coming at them,” says Sang Lee, analyst at the Aite Group.In the meantime, several of the SEC’s safeguards, as well as some of those recently introduced by private operators, could lead to more technological complexity, which in turn could create its own problems, says Alison Crosthwait at brokerage Instinet.“It means that every firm that builds algorithms has to get really granular. It gets very complicated very quickly, and it’s hard to build strategies and trade efficiently,” she says.Regulators have discussed creating rules for monitoring algorithms, the computer programmes used by high-frequency traders to deal in fractions of a second, which contributed to the rapid acceleration in selling last May. But these are still in their infancy. While the broader market has not seen a repeat of those 20 calamitous minutes, trading irregularities of one sort or another still occur.Last week trades in more than 80 stocks and exchange-traded funds on the Nasdaq had to be broken because of a glitch in the system that provides automated quotes for market makers. This week a customer error led to sharp drops in Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange-listed companies in the after-hours market.“In a world dominated by technology, there will always be unforeseen technology errors,” says Eric Noll at Nasdaq. “What we should be doing is making sure we have mechanisms in place to make sure those problems don’t cause any serious damage.”
384;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-05T01:52:32Z;ICE steps up attack on deal rival;;Intercontinental Exchange, the US exchange operator, intensified its campaign to take control of NYSE Euronext’s futures business with a blistering attack on a rival bid by Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, which it characterised as “absurd”, “risky” and full of “empty promises”.ICE teamed up with Nasdaq OMX last month to launch an $11bn cash-and-stock offer for NYSE Euronext, attempting to break up an agreed friendly merger between NYSE and Deutsche Börse.ICE and Nasdaq are offering a higher price to buy NYSE with the aim of splitting its futures and equities exchanges between them, giving ICE control of Liffe, the London-based futures exchange. NYSE’s board has rejected the proposal twice, calling it an “empty vessel”.Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, hit back on Wednesday, saying: “It’s understandable why NYSE Euronext’s response has been focused on attacking our superior proposal,” he said.“The alternative is to acknowledge and address the serious deficiencies in the Deutsche Börse takeover.”He made his remarks as ICE reported first-quarter net income of $129m, or $1.74 per share, up from $101m, or $1.36 per share, in the prior year quarter.Excluding extraordinary items, net profit was $131m, or $1.77 per share, above analysts’ average forecasts of about $1.69 per share.Mr Sprecher revealed he had first been in talks almost 10 years ago about buying a stake in Liffe – which was acquired in 2002 by Euronext, which was in turn bought by NYSE in 2007 – but had been unable to strike a deal.The ICE chief said that while he wanted to run Liffe as a viable business in its own right, under the Deutsche Börse bid it would “likely be gutted and for all intents and purposes moved to Frankfurt to be subsumed as part of a European product set within the Deutsche Börse”.His comments came as Deutsche Börse published its offer to its investors to tender their shares in return for shares in a Dutch holding company being created for the merger with NYSE Euronext.The deal needs holders of at least 75 per cent of the German group’s shares to approve it. It also needs regulatory clearance by March 2012 from the European Union, as well as authorities in the US, Germany and seven other countries.Investors can tender their shares until July 13, by which time NYSE shareholders are expected to have voted on whether to approve the merger plans.However, Mr Sprecher said it was “absurd” to imply that the combined entity – which would be based in the Netherlands – would be a US company. “Billions of dollars worth of NYSE stock could be dumped on the market by its current institutional shareholders as a result of this new status,” he claimed.ICE shares were down 1.4 per cent at $114.85 in New York.FT Trading Room
385;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-04T00:51:42Z;Renren replaces audit chief ahead of IPO;;Renren has replaced the head of its audit committee on the eve of its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, as the Chinese social networking group seeks to protect itself from the fall-out of an accounting controversy at another company.The offering of Renren, which has nothing to do with the other company’s accounting problems, is set to raise as much as $743m and has seen unusually strong demand from investors.The company’s expected pricing of its IPO on Tuesday night was delayed due to difficulties including an unusually large book of potential investors, according to a person close to the deal. This person said the IPO would be priced on Wednesday morning.Earlier this week, Renren said that Derek Palaschuk, chief financial officer of Longtop, a Chinese Nasdaq-listed specialist software company, no longer heads Renren’s audit committee and is also no longer an independent director appointee, according to an amendment to Renren’s prospectus filed to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday.The step follows an accounting controversy at Longtop that sent the company’s shares plummeting last week.Mr Palaschuk said he resigned on April 30 to “protect Renren”.“I told Joe [Chen, Renren’s chief executive] even though all of the allegations [about accounting fraud at Longtop] are without substance, it is definitely better for [Renren] that I resign from the board with immediate effect so that there is no unwarranted attention brought to Renren,” he said.At Renren, David Chao, an independent director representing one of Renren’s minority shareholders, has replaced Mr Palaschuk.Renren has criticism after it restated last week figures on user growth in the first quarter and has faced questions from investors about the way it calculated the company’s valuation ahead of its listing.Meanwhile, Nasdaq OMX on Monday proposed to introduce stricter requirements for groups seeking to list via reverse mergers – an avenue not being used by Renren but common among Chinese companies last year.The exchange plans to require that a company created through the merger of a private operating group with a publicly listed shell can only list on Nasdaq after having traded over-the-counter or on another exchange for at least six months. The bid price also must have been maintained above $4 a share for at least half of the 60 trading days before the planned IPO.The planned regulatory changes come in response to a series of investor class action suits launched last year against Chinese companies listed in the US. Some had filed revenue data to the SEC dramatically different from that on file with the Chinese government. Some accounting experts say the differences are due to the fact that Chinese tax authorities require filings from local operational companies while the SEC receives consolidated figures filed by a holding company.As reverse mergers offer unlisted companies a ‘shortcut’ to the market, Nasdaq’s proposal aims at introducing a period during which potential accounting problems could come to light.Additional reporting by Telis Demos in New York
386;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-03T09:20:26Z;Nasdaq and ICE to go hostile on NYSE bid;;Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange have confirmed they plan to make a hostile bid for NYSE Euronext, as the pair attempts to derail the US exchange’s agreed deal with Deutsche Börse.Nasdaq and ICE said on Monday that they intended to launch an offer for the exchange this month, and that the two boards had approved a plan to take its $11bn cash-and-stock break-up bid directly to NYSE shareholders.In April, the exchanges proposed to split the NYSE’s equities and futures businesses, just weeks after NYSE Euronext had agreed an all-stock merger with Deutsche Börse. NYSE’s board has twice rejected the rival proposal, which offers a higher price than the Deutsche Börse bid, calling it an “empty vessel”.Nasdaq and ICE are offering $14.24 in cash, 0.4069 shares of Nasdaq OMX common stock and 0.1436 shares of ICE common stock for each share in NYSE Euronext.Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, said: “The NYSE Euronext board has continually challenged the seriousness of our proposal and refused to engage us in discussion despite the positive feedback we have received from their stockholders.”The US bourse on Monday noted that the Nasdaq-ICE’s offer would be launched on the same terms as previously proposed, adding that these had been “unanimously rejected” by its board.People close to the NYSE camp played down the significance of their rivals’ move, arguing that shareholders were already aware of the choice they faced in considering the two proposals ahead of a July vote on the Deutsche Börse deal.As a publicly listed exchange, the NYSE has certain limits on ownership and voting rights, which could make it difficult for Nasdaq and ICE to close a hostile offer, the people added.One party cannot own more than 20 per cent of the exchange, or have more than 10 per cent of the outstanding votes. As the limits must be waived by the board, they impose a condition on Nasdaq/ICE’s exchange offer, effectively functioning as a type of poison pill.Analysts at Raymond James noted this and other conditions to the Nasdaq/ICE offer. “We believe the laundry list of conditions attached to the offer virtually guarantee that it will never be executed,” they wrote.Once Nasdaq and ICE start their offer, the NYSE board will be legally obliged to respond, perhaps offering in more detail its reasons for rejecting the counterbid.Launching the offer could also mean Nasdaq and ICE will have to disclose more information about their bid.The pair have not yet made public the details of their financing commitments.People familiar with Nasdaq’s thinking said the formal launch of the offer would take some time to execute, perhaps a week or two.Yet, the company wanted to make clear its intentions ahead of a deadline this week that will determine who can vote in July on the Deutsche Börse deal.
387;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-05-01T22:04:50Z;Drop in dollar boosts exchange merger;;NYSE Euronext has found some unexpected support for its proposed merger with Deutsche Börse– the sharp drop in the US dollar is propping up the value of the stock-based deal, which is under assault from a counterbid by Nasdaq and IntercontinentalExchange.Since NYSE and the German exchange unveiled their plan in February, the euro has gained almost 10 per cent against the US currency, boosting NYSE’s implied value under the merger and roughly halving the premium in the Nasdaq-led counterbid.As NYSE investors gear up for a July vote on a more than $10bn deal with Deutsche Börse, the shrinking gap between the headline value of the two options is likely to play a role in their thinking, bankers say. At the same time, the slimmer margin could prompt Nasdaq and ICE, which have yet formally to launch a hostile tender offer, to move more quickly.The dollar has fallen to its lowest level against the euro since December 2009, helping to counterbalance a drop in Deutsche Börse shares.However, in the past few days, the German bourse’s shares have recovered ground, also helping to boost the value of the pair’s all-stock merger. At about $39, the implied value of a NYSE share under the Deutsche Börse deal is back to where it was when the deal was announced.At current share prices, the mooted cash-and-stock offer from Nasdaq and ICE is worth about 9 per cent more per share than the Deutsche Börse merger proposal, according to Financial Times calculations, down from a 19 per cent premium when the counterbid was announced at the beginning of April.Had the dollar not moved against the euro since the merger was announced on February 15, that margin would be about 20 per cent.People close to the NYSE camp argue that their merger represents the chance to own 40 per cent of a larger, more diversified global exchange, rather than a per share value.The falling dollar has also helped balance out the cost savings and revenue opportunities. NYSE has said it could find €500m ($740m) in benefits from the deal. At current exchange rates, that puts the proposal neck-and-neck with Nasdaq/ICE’s $740m in synergies.The dollar’s slump comes as the Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, last week tried to reassure markets that the central bank would remain vigilant in guarding against inflation, as it starts to remove its extraordinary policies to stimulate the economy.However, the greenback continued to slide last week on investor concerns and in the wake of weaker-than-expected economic growth numbers.“Ben Bernanke is an important person in this deal,” commented one person close to Nasdaq and ICE.Additional reporting by Telis Demos
388;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-28T22:28:33Z;NYSE and D Börse trumpet profits;;"NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse highlighted their “financial flexibility” and ability to control costs in their quarterly results in an effort to rebut claims by rivals trying to break up their plan to merge.However, growth in technology services failed to keep up with the groups’ lofty ambitions for it to be a $1bn-revenue segment.NYSE, which is refusing so far to consider a rival approach from Nasdaq OMX and the Intercontinental Exchange, earned $155m in net income in the first quarter, compared with $130m a year ago. Stripping out one-off costs, including expenses related to the Deutsche Börse merger plans, net income rose 26 per cent to $177m.In presenting NYSE’s results, Mr Niederauer trumpeted declining costs. Nasdaq and ICE have argued that NYSE and D Börse have historically not done a good job of controlling costs, which resulted in writedowns after their respective acquisitions of Euronext and the International Securities Exchange.NYSE said its expenses of $415m had declined 3 per cent versus the first quarter of last year and 2 per cent versus the fourth quarter last year. Mr Niederauer, speaking to shareholders, said that capital expenditure would be less than $200m this year.“A lot of our capex was to finance the building of data centres, and it is returning to more normal levels,” he said.Mr Niederauer also said that the cost reduction was even more dramatic than the figures showed because NYSE had been spending heavily in recent years on its New York Portfolio Clearing and NYSE Liffe US futures businesses, as well as on developing the Amex Options trading floor.Meanwhile, Deutsche Börse said its net income for the same quarter rose 36 per cent to €213m and also cut its cost guidance for the year, saying it had been able to speed up implementation of efficiency measures.The German group said it expected operating costs this year to come in at €890m, €35m lower than previously outlined. Gregor Pottmeyer, chief financial officer, said: “Our progress since we announced our efficiency measures in the first quarter of 2010 has exceeded expectations.”Mr Niederauer said of the two groups: “It’s actually not a one-hit wonder, it’s a continuation of everything we’ve been doing for the last couple of years.""As a result of their falling expenses, NYSE also said its ratio of debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation fell to 1.8 times, its lowest level since NYSE acquired Paris-based Euronext in 2007.This was critical, Mr Niederauer said, because it would allow the combined group to pay more than $1.2bn in dividends in the year following the deal. This would help close the existing 12 per cent gap between the value of the Nasdaq-ICE cash-and-shares offer and Deutsche Börse’s offer, though neither NYSE nor DB has yet committed to any specific measures.“We have more financial flexibility than anyone in the industry [to pursue] buy-backs and dividends, or to be able to invest in new growth opportunities around the world,” he said.Nasdaq-ICE have said this highlights execution risks with the Deutsche Börse merger, and said shareholders should prefer the offer with more value upfront. Some institutions and individual shareholders have said they want more consideration of the higher offer, though debate is still ranging on antitrust barriers to the competing proposals.Mr Niederauer also highlighted NYSE Liffe US, the newly launched futures platform, which he said “illustrated the strategy” at the heart of the DB-NYSE merger by combining multi-asset class exchange groups.NYSE Liffe US has 100,000 contracts of open interest eurodollar futures as of this week, NYSE said on Thursday, though that is still a tiny fraction of what dominant competitor CME Group has.Analysts were disappointed to see a near-flat result in NYSE’s technology business versus the fourth quarter as they were expecting a sequential gain larger than the 2 per cent achieved, from $114m to $116m.Mr Niederauer has highlighted this business – which he said could generate more revenue than the targeted $1bn in 2015 after the merger – as a reason to oppose Nasdaq-ICE’s plan, which would probably cut the unit sharply and possibly close a data centre to save costs.“While this revenue can be a bit lumpy, we had expected to see a pick-up related to the firm’s two new data centres,” said Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James, in a note. NYSE said that the first quarter is seasonally slow for technology sales and said they had just signed a new “tier one financial services” customer.Gross transactions revenue at NYSE Euronext rose 7 per cent in the quarter versus the same period last year, to $815m. Revenues net of rebates and other fees was $679m, a rise of 5 per cent. Derivatives and cash trading and listings contributed equally to the rise, though rising volumes in US derivatives and European cash equities counterbalanced a drop in volumes in European derivatives and US cash.Nasdaq OMX this quarter saw its net revenues rise, thanks to a big boost in US options, but gross transactions revenue fell due to a steep decline in US equities. Net revenue grew year-over-year, however, due to a reduction in rebates and fees."
389;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-28T20:53:24Z;D Börse backs NYSE synergy claims;;Deutsche Börse executives, including chief executive Reto Francioni, have for the first time publicly backed statements by Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext CEO, that at least €100m of extra synergies can be extracted from their planned merger.That will quiet speculation that NYSE and Deutsche Börse had not previously agreed on what cuts to make, which could be a politically sensitive issue if job cuts are concentrated in one country in Europe or in the US.It also served to highlight what both executives consider to be a core of their vision, a global multi-asset trading exchange group that can cross-sell products in new markets and slash costs by using each others’ technologies.That vision has also been heavily criticised by Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange, who have made a counter-offer to buy NYSE Euronext and split its futures and equities exchanges and combine with their own similar businesses. They have said that shareholders should be “sceptical” of the discovery of new cost cuts.Mr Francioni, speaking to analysts on Thursday, said: “Following the work conducted by joint teams …we were able to increase our initial synergy estimates … to a new synergy target of at least €500m.”Executives on both sides of the Atlantic highlighted the trading platform as an area of additional savings. Gregor Pottmeyer, DB’s chief financial officer, told analysts that about half of the extra savings would stem from technology synergies. “We are now confident we can develop a common trading and clearing infrastructure, he said.That is potentially significant, since the view from both companies so far has been that derivatives trading would probably be conducted through Deutsche Börse’s Eurex system, while NYSE Euronext’s Universal Trading Platform, or UTP, would be the choice for cash equities.At the NYSE Euronext annual meeting in New York, Mr Niederauer also detailed areas of cost savings, which he said the two groups had delayed studying in detail because they wanted to prevent leaks of the deal.But he said decisions had not been made on exactly how to combine the platforms. In addition to UTP and Eurex, platforms in use by the two groups include Xetra, in European cash equities, and Optimise, recently launched by the International Securities Exchange, the US options exchange owned by Deutsche Börse.“What trading platform you will get is not exactly UTP, not exactly Optimise, not exactly Xetra, not exactly Eurex. It will be a common platform, with pieces from each of those. It won’t feel like a heavy lift or big migration,” said Mr Niederauer.One definite commonality, he said, would be the customer-facing gateway, even if the trade matching engines are still somewhat split. “People get very emotional about technology they’ve built. What you have to try to focus on, there are no winners and losers,” he said.Mr Niederauer also defended NYSE Euronext’s technology strategy, of building data centres in Mahwah, New Jersey, and Basildon, England, and selling infrastructure services to a small group of exchanges. That is in contrast to Nasdaq OMX’s business, which involves selling software but not data services to hundreds of exchanges and financial services groups.“We’re not trying to be the matching engine provider to every exchange in the world,” Mr Niederauer said, in an oblique reference to his rival. “That’s quantity not quality.” He revealed that NYSE had signed up a “truly tier one financial services company” to buy infrastructure products.Both Mr Niederauer and Mr Francioni said that while NYSE’s US data centres would remain, a data centre in Europe could be closed. Mr Niederauer was delicate on this point, and said: “Our friends at Deutsche Börse have nothing like Mahwah, but in Europe it’s a little harder. As proud as we are of Basildon, they are also proud of what they have in Frankfurt,” he said.Mr Francioni also said the groups would be “creating one market operations hub for derivatives, equities, and clearing business in Europe, and one for derivatives in the US”. He further promised an “extended realigning of corporate services, as well as . . adjusting management functions across the entire group”.Mr Pottmeyer gave as examples scope for further savings on purchasing, insurance and property portfolios, and said 30 per cent of the extra savings identified were to do with the combined group’s corporate centres.
390;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-28T20:05:42Z;Deutsche Börse and NYSE stand by deal terms;;"The chief executives of Deutsche Börse and NYSE have rebuffed calls to reconsider the terms of their merger plans while giving more details of the costs they intend to save through their deal.Duncan Niederauer, NYSE chief executive, on Thursday faced down calls at the group’s annual meeting for the board to reconsider its two-time rejection of a joint cash-and-shares offer by Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange, valued at about 12 per cent more than the Deutsche Börse merger.Meanwhile, Reto Francioni, Deutsche Börse chief executive, endorsed a recent estimate by Mr Niederauer that the cost savings from the deal could be €400m ($592m) rather than the €300m previously highlighted.Speaking to analysts in Frankfurt, Mr Francioni said the companies were working on how to achieve more revenue synergies. They hope the promise of further savings may help fend off the approach from Nasdaq and ICE.At the meeting in New York, Mr Niederauer responded to individual shareholders who suggested the German group contribute 0.5 shares per share of the combined entity, rather than the current 0.47 ratio.“If we push that ratio too far and the other side doesn’t get the vote, I’d hate to miss out on the accelerating opportunity [of the Deutsche Börse merger] because we got a touch greedy,” he said.Mr Francioni said in Frankfurt: “We believe that the structure and terms are very attractive to both sets of shareholders. We stand by the terms.”Deutsche Börse will require 75 per cent shareholder approval, versus the 50 per cent needed by NYSE Euronext.Also on Thursday, NYSE reported first-quarter earnings per share of 68 cents, versus 54 cents a year ago; Deutsche Börse said earnings were €1.14 per share, versus €0.84 a year ago. Both said the results were driven by stronger derivatives revenues and lower costs. Expenses are a sensitive issue, as Nasdaq-ICE have argued that their rivals are not efficient at controlling costs.Mr Niederauer also highlighted his group’s falling leverage ratio, which he said will enable the group to pay large dividends and close the value gap with the rival offer; it also served to illustrate DB-NYSE’s argument that Nasdaq is too heavily indebted to take on its rival.Echoing comments earlier this week by Mr Niederauer, Mr Francioni said the group also promised more savings for customers.“Consolidating clearing services is expected to provide efficiencies in the range of several billion euros per year,” he said.After questions from shareholders about the nationality of the new group, NYSE said the companies would reveal the composition of the board before July 7, when NYSE shareholders will asked to vote on the merger. Membership will reflect discussions with European regulators who want to have national representatives on the board, highlighting the political risks involved in the deal."
391;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-28T16:53:47Z;CME criticises NYSE-DB merger plan;The biggest US futures exchange group vowed that the bidding war over NYSE Euronext would not deter it from its strategy of expanding its business internationally;CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, vowed that the bidding war over NYSE Euronext – which has pitted two of CME’s main rivals against each other – would not deter it from its strategy of expanding its business internationally.NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse have agreed a friendly merger that would create a powerful transatlantic exchange, while Nasdaq OMX and Intercontinental Exchange want to break up that deal and buy NYSE with the aim of splitting up its futures and equities exchanges.CME, which has undertaken two large exchange takeovers in recent years, has declined to be drawn into making a bid for NYSE. The group insisted on Thursday that it was committed instead to link-ups with international exchanges that enable traders in other countries to access CME’s markets.International business is growing faster than in the US, CME said, with trading volumes during non-US hours up by 27 per cent in the first quarter of 2011 from last year, compared with 20 per cent growth during the US trading day.A central part of CME’s international expansion is the imminent launch of a London-based clearing house, which the group said will initially clear 150 over-the-counter commodity contracts before extending its offering to other OTC and listed futures contracts.“We have more strategic investments and commercial linkage arrangements with major exchanges around the world,” said Craig Donohue, chief executive. “I don’t think that changes whether Nasdaq and ICE are successful or whether NYSE and Deutsche Börse are successful in completing their transaction. Our focus is on expanding our global distribution network and acquiring more customers.”CME also weighed in on the relative merits of the bids for the first time, pouring cold water on the proposed DB-NYSE merger.Mr Donohue said the merger would not benefit traders. “We’ve never, frankly, been big believers in the large, multi-asset class exchange concept,” the CME chief said. “It’s not clear that it has actually delivered demonstrable value to customers in terms of increased efficiencies.”“The synergy opportunities from those very different and very differently regulated businesses are inferior to the synergy opportunities of combining much more similar derivatives businesses as we have done,” Mr Donohue said.Terry Duffy, CME chairman, told the Financial Times that from a cost-saving perspective, the ICE-Nasdaq bid might make more sense. “The way the plan is laid out, ICE would get the Liffe businesses [NYSE’s European futures arm] and that would be more synergistic,” he said.The executives spoke as CME reported better-than-expected results for the first quarter on record revenues, boosted by surging commodity markets and uncertainty in the global economy.Excluding extraordinary items, CME made a net profit of $292m or $4.36 per share, up from $240m or $3.62 per share in the same period last year and ahead of analysts’ average forecasts of about $2.40 per share. Revenues were $832m, up from $693m a year earlier.Shares in CME were trading down 1.9 per cent at $303.94 by noon in New York.
392;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-27T23:36:49Z;Shareholder urges NYSE to consider rival bid;;"A large institutional shareholder urged NYSE Euronext’s board to consider a counter-bid to its agreed deal with Deutsche Börse – a cash-and-shares bid by Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange.Bill Miller, portfolio manager of Legg Mason, said in an e-mail distributed to reporters on the eve of NYSE Euronext’s annual meeting: “We think it is in the shareholders’ interest that the board work to maximise value for owners, and we don’t see how being unwilling to meet with Nasdaq furthers that goal.”Legg Mason is among the top five NYSE Euronext shareholders, owning 2.9 per cent of shares outstanding.NYSE Euronext declined to comment on Mr Miller’s statement.The NYSE Euronext board has twice rejected the approach by Nasdaq-ICE, which offers a higher price than the current value of the all-shares bid by Deutsche Börse.But the counter-offer has piqued the interest of some shareholders, ranging from institutions such as Legg Mason to M&A arbitrageurs, who have privately been urging for the board to consider Nasdaq-ICE’s offer for NYSE Euronext.The rival bid is valued at 12 per cent more than the Deutsche Börse share swap, according to Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James, or $11.2bn versus $10bn.However, many shareholders also have questions about the antitrust implications of Nasdaq buying NYSE and creating a near-monopoly in US listings, say people who have spoken with shareholders.Though the merger is likely to be a backdrop at NYSE’s meeting, it will not be on the table for a vote at the annual meetings of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse, both taking place on Thursday. The two groups will also present first-quarter earnings.NYSE has scheduled a vote for its agreed deal with Deutsche for July 7, at which it will require a majority vote. Deutsche Börse also plans to set a deadline for shareholders to tender their shares by July; they will need 75 per cent support.On Tuesday, Jeffrey Sprecher and Robert Greifeld, chief executives of ICE and Nasdaq, respectively, sent an open letter to shareholders urging them to ask the board to reconsider its decision.Shareholders will have limited opportunity to express their views on Thursday. NYSE board members are not facing opponents, as proxies were submitted before the Nasdaq-ICE bid. Votes have also been cast, and shareholder advisory ISS recommended re-election of all directors.“What [Mr Miller] said is what everybody is thinking. NYSE’s board members will get their votes, but maybe not as much as normal. But at this point, the real showdown will be in July,” said one shareholder, who is in contact with other shareholders but has a relatively small position in NYSE Euronext."
393;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-27T22:11:33Z;Antitrust rumblings over index ownership;;As shareholders in NYSE Euronext ponder the bid battle raging between the US exchange and its partner Deutsche Börse on the one hand, and Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange on the other, they may not be paying much attention to the Eurostoxx 50 index.They may be more focused on the cost synergies and revenue opportunities touted by the two camps as they try and convince shareholders that their proposal is best amid the current wave of global exchange consolidation.However, the low-key business of indices, such as the Eurostoxx and in the US the S&P and Dow Jones indices, are emerging as a controversial issue in Europe.That is because ownership of such indices – more precisely of the companies that compile them – is being concentrated among a handful of exchanges. They see them as a lucrative new source of revenue since products such as derivatives and exchange-traded funds can be created that are based on them.Yet rivals wanting to spin off products based on those indices cannot be sure they will be able to, since the power to license products on an index rests with the owner of the index compiler – the exchange.Some see this as a potential antitrust issue. Edmund Parker, global co-head of derivatives and structured products at law firm Mayer Brown, says: “You do have a potential tension, if it comes down to bigger and bigger exchanges deliberately closing out other exchanges. If that happens, this seems to me the sort of thing that competition authorities can take a look at.”The Eurostoxx 50 index is central to the debate in Europe because it is owned by Stoxx, an index compiler controlled by Deutsche Börse and SIX Group of Switzerland, operator of the Swiss exchange. In 2009 the pair took control of Stoxx after buying out a stake held by Dow Jones.Revenue generated by Stoxx grew at a compound annual rate of 20 per cent from 2006-08, the latest period for which figures are available.While the S&P index is owned by publisher McGraw-Hill, the Dow Jones index has been owned by CME Group, the Börse’s biggest rival in derivatives, since last year.Critics of the status quo include the London Stock Exchange, which last month unveiled plans to start competing against Deutsche Börse’s Eurex derivatives exchange, and NYSE Liffe, owned by NYSE Euronext, starting with derivatives based on the FTSE 100 stock index.The LSE would also like to be able to launch derivatives based on other indices, including those run by Stoxx.Yet an application to license the Eurostoxx by the LSE was rejected last year by the German group. People familiar with the matter say the LSE recently raised the issue with the European Commission.Separately LCH.Clearnet, the UK clearing house, is also in contact with Brussels after being similarly rebuffed after applying to Stoxx to be able to offer clearing of OTC equity derivatives based on the Eurostoxx 50.Neither the LSE nor the LCH.Clearnet would comment.So far there is no indication that the antitrust authorities in Brussels are including the index issue in their impending review of the proposed NYSE Euronext/Deutsche Börse merger.And Stoxx counters any suggestion that index ownership is unfairly exclusive, saying Stoxx faces “strong competition worldwide from other index providers and also from OTC private-label derivatives”.It also argues that an index does not “define a market by itself”.“All indices are calculated and maintained using data which is generally available to the public and in particular to Stoxx’s current and future competitors,” Stoxx says.Yet the index issue could yet become part of a wider debate in Europe over fair access to services such as clearing, often also controlled by exchanges.A key element of Europe’s version of reforms of the vast over-the-counter derivatives markets – mirroring the Dodd-Frank in the US – is how to ensure that clearing houses allow open and fair access to their services from any trading platform, not just one that happens to also be owned by the same exchange.Says one Brussels-based industry observer: “This [index] issue is a fairly close sibling to the issue of access to clearing.”
394;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-27T00:08:14Z;Nasdaq and ICE reach out to NYSE shareholders;;The chief executives of Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange have publicly called on NYSE Euronext shareholders to urge its board to consider their offer for the company.Nasdaq also reached out to corporate issuers, offering NYSE Euronext listed-companies who pay the exchange’s highest annual listings fees a $50,000 discount if the groups merged.Nasdaq and ICE are attempting to buy NYSE Euronext and split its futures and equities exchanges while breaking up the agreed deal between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse to merge to create a global exchange supermarket.The Nasdaq-ICE offer is valued at about 14 per cent more than the agreed $9.5bn share exchange between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse.In an open letter just ahead of NYSE Euronext’s annual meeting on Thursday, Robert Greifeld of Nasdaq and Jeffrey Sprecher of ICE said they “encourage NYSE Euronext’s stockholders to call on their directors to meet with us to address any concerns they have and start a mutual due diligence process”.This is their first public appeal to shareholders, although they have been holding private meetings in the US and Europe.Mr Greifeld and Mr Sprecher wrote that the NYSE-Deutsche Börse agreement allowed the board to consider “a proposal that may possibly be superior”.“Our proposal offers substantially greater short and long-term value and creates a compelling opportunity for the NYSE Euronext board to meet with us while presenting no downside risk and only upside for stockholders,” they said.But NYSE’s board has twice rejected Nasdaq-ICE offer after hearing presentations from its financial advisers and management, voting unanimously to favour the Deutsche Börse deal, which preserves NYSE Euronext’s diversification strategy.No deal on the table at the annual meeting on Thursday. Shareholders could vote, although it is unlikely, not to re-elect current board members. A vote on the Deutsche Börse deal has been set for July 7.Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext chief, who would become chief of the combined company, has said that the Deutsche Börse deal preserves NYSE Euronext’s diversification strategy and creates more value in the future via savings to customers, additional revenues and dividends.Separately, Nasdaq sent letters to issuers saying it would keep its listings fees steady and lower NYSE’s fees if the two groups merged, forming a near-monopoly in US listings.The US Department of Justice this week sent Nasdaq and ICE a second request for information. According to market sources, department officials have been holding meetings with other exchanges and trading firms to gather data and insight on competition.Bruce Aust, Nasdaq‘s head of listings, told Nasdaq issuers the exchange would retain its $99,500 cap on annual fees. He said NYSE’s top rate of $500,000 would be lowered to $450,000.NYSE has a tiered pricing system in which the largest companies pay more. About 165 companies would be affected by the top rate change, according to NYSE figures.
395;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-26T21:55:58Z;Merger cash and politics;The political-economic struggle is probably close to eternal;"The fights over Equinox Minerals and NYSE Euronext cross financial and political faultlines. The first battle is almost over; China’s Minmetals, which made a cash bid for the Australian-Canadian copper miner, has ceded to a higher cash offer from Barrick Gold. The second struggle – rival, mostly share offers from Deutsche Börse and a consortium of Nasdaq OMX and ICE – continues.On the financial side, these disputes are taking place in different domains. The mining fight is in a land of abundant cash flow. Barrick’s cost for mining an ounce of gold was $457 in 2010 – about a third of the current market price – while Minmetals has the backing of a government which is trying to find a safe home for foreign currency worth $3,000bn. But in exchange land, throwing cash around is riskier: the typical 20 per cent operating profit margins are less than half the current level in copper mining. No wonder that the mining deal is at 28 times last year’s profits, while the multiples on the exchange proposals are less than 20.The political divide is different. On one side is economic logic. It makes sense for China to acquire commodities at the cost of production rather than at the exaggerated market price. And it is sensible for exchanges to operate in many countries and markets. On the other side is what is claimed to be national interest. There were probably few tears shed in Ottawa when a local champion displaced a Chinese bid for a partly Canadian company. The politicking around the prestige and jobs that come with independent exchanges seems to be limitless.The financial division will end whenever monetary policy tightens sufficiently and supply catches up with demand. The political-economic struggle is probably close to eternal.E-mail the Lex team in confidence"
396;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-25T23:44:51Z;Rival bidders warn on NYSE Euronext cost savings;;Shareholders should be “highly sceptical” of NYSE Euronext’s plans to reveal additional cost savings from its planned merger with Deutsche Börse, its rival bidders have warned.The caution came after Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext chief executive, told the Financial Times that his group and Deutsche Börse, which agreed a friendly merger in February, would be raising their synergy estimates by nearly a third, from €300m to some €400m ($583m).The additional savings and revenue estimates – to be detailed at NYSE’s annual meeting on Thursday – would put the proposals on a par with the $740m of synergies that Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange have proposed as part of their rival bid for NYSE Euronext.In a joint statement the two said: “Investors should be highly sceptical that after two years of exploratory merger discussions, including more than six months dedicated to finalising the transaction, NYSE Euronext has suddenly found a reported €100m in additional synergies.“This increase appears not to be a matter of sharpening a pencil, but an unexplained shift in strategy.”Savings have been a critical part of Nasdaq-ICE’s argument that their offer is superior. Their cash-and-shares bid is valued at about 14 per cent more than the $9.4bn all-shares NYSE-DB deal. The Nasdaq-ICE rebuttal came as Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE chief executive, embarked on a trip across Europe to explain the counterbid to regulators.Charles Schumer, Democratic senator from New York, has raised concerns about Nasdaq-ICE’s cost-cutting. On Monday he asked Nasdaq and ICE to detail planned job cuts. He said NYSE Euronext estimated to him that Nasdaq’s cuts would eliminate 800 jobs in New York. “I am concerned with the potential impact …on jobs in and around New York City. This would be a major consideration in judging any potential transaction,” he said.Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, told the FT, “Clearly there is not a number [on jobs] out there until we get to do due diligence. It’s impossible for [NYSE] to know.”Mr Greifeld said that many cuts would come from NYSE’s “mystifying” amount of money spent on capital expenditures and from rationalisation of systems and data centres.NYSE Euronext’s board has twice rejected allowing shareholder consideration of the rival bid, although privately some institutional NYSE shareholders have said they want to hear more from Nasdaq-ICE.NYSE Euronext said it would move up its first-quarter earnings report to Thursday, April 28, to coincide with its annual meeting, where shareholders will be able to discuss, but not yet vote on, the Deutsche Börse deal. That vote is scheduled for July 7.Separately, Nasdaq-ICE said the US Department of Justice had made a second request for information on their bid. The rival bidders are racing to get antitrust approval for their offers first.Additional reporting by Jeremy Grant in London
397;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-25T20:50:28Z;Weaker earnings weigh on Wall Street;;Wall Street receded slightly from the strong gains seen last week after a string of disappointing earnings reports from companies such as Advanced Micro Devices, Kimberly-Clark and Johnson Controls.Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies nappies, released particularly lacklustre earnings, reporting a 9 per cent fall in first-quarter net income as higher raw material costs ate into its profitability.The company also revised up its estimate of input inflation for the rest of the year in response to the rising price of pulp, oil and resin. This worried investors, pushing the stock down 2.7 per cent to $64.24, amid wider unease over the effect of rising commodity costs on margins.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Advanced Micro Devices, one of the largest makers of processors for personal computers, reported that profits had more than doubled to $510m, or $0.68 per share, for the first quarter.But investors were a little disappointed by the news, and the stock lost 0.1 per cent to $8.70. This was largely because expectations for earnings in the tech sector were high after bumper earnings results from Intel, Apple, IBM and Qualcomm in the previous week. AMD added 5.3 per cent last week as sentiment jumped for such stocks.These results left the S&P 500 down 0.2 per cent to 1,335.26 at the close, paring some of the sharp gains on Wall Street in the previous week.Of the 124 S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter earnings so far, 80 per cent have surpassed analysts’ expectations compared with 73 per cent last quarter. Before the season started, analysts at Credit Suisse estimated that there would be a 65 per cent surprise rate overall.This week, 181 S&P companies will report their earnings, setting the tone for the markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2 per cent to 12,479.88, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2 per cent to 2,825.88 in the session. The broadly negative sentiment was offset by the news that new family home sales rebounded 11.1 per cent to 300,000 in March from the previous month. This was higher than expected but “still miserable in absolute terms”, said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Volumes were very low as many markets around the world were closed for Easter Monday and investors were reluctant to place large trades ahead of the announcement on Wednesday by the Federal Reserve on US monetary policy.“People are waiting to see what is going to happen with the Fed, but my expectation is that there will not be much news,” said Timothy Holland, portfolio manager of the Aston/Tamro Diversified Equity Fund.“Core inflation has not moved dramatically, and employment and gross domestic product are still not that great, so the Fed will likely just continue to be supportive,” he said.In corporate news, Johnson Controls, a maker of battery systems for hybrid-electric vehicles, reported profit up 29 per cent in the first quarter as volume growth helped offset its higher costs. But investors were hoping for more and the stock was down 2.8 per cent to $39.60.RadioShack, the cons­umer-electronics chain, reported first-quarter earnings down 30 per cent and lowered its full-year earnings estimate by 10 cents a share. Earnings were affected by lower margins, weakness in its T-Mobile business and the expense of rolling out its branded wireless kiosks in Target stores. But the stock was still up 0.1 per cent to $15.85.Polycom, the maker of video conferencing equipment, said its first-quarter earnings had risen more than sixfold. Its shares were up 12.6 per cent to $58.43.In deal news, Barrick Gold, the world’s biggest gold producer, announced a C$7.3bn cash offer for Equinox Minerals, the Australian-Canadian copper miner. This sent shares in Barrick down 6.8 per cent to $51.86, while shares in Equinox Minerals added 10.5 per cent to $8.74. Equinox is already the target of a hostile offer by China’s Minmetals Resources. Barrick offered C$8.15 a share, compared with Minmetals’ C$7.NYSE Euronext said it was set to increase its forecast for cost savings by up to a third from a deal with Deutsche Börse, in a further effort to counter an $11.3bn bid from Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange.Shares in NYSE were down 0.7 per cent to $38.76 while Nasdaq and ICE were down 1.1 per cent and 0.2 per cent respectively, to $27.23 and $122.
398;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-25T10:04:03Z;Quick View: Mr Niederauer borrows from Chicago;;It has taken a while, but the NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse camp seems finally to be fighting back.The past two weeks has seen a relentless campaign by Bob Greifeld and Jeff Sprecher, respectively chief executives of Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), to talk up their $11.3bn cash and shares counter bid for NYSE Euronext.Now Duncan Niederauer, NYSE’s chief executive, has revealed that, as a result of some “pencil sharpening” with its bankers, cost synergies in the Börse deal could be up to €400m - a third more than originally advertised.That should please shareholders. It suggests total synergies could reach about €500m ($728m), including revenue opportunities, compared with the $740m in net synergies touted by Nasdaq and ICE, most of which is cost-cutting.But arguably more interesting was something Mr Niederauer merely hinted at: massive savings that the biggest customers of both exchanges would get from netting. He put that figure at over $3bn.What does he mean?Here is what he said: “There’s a lot of good in this combination for customers that can not be extracted today. Right now they have to pay to connect to both platforms, you’ll only have to connect to one platform in the future.“And I think the most important thing is the capital efficiency savings by being able to net the short end [of the interest rate yield curve] and the long end, and the pan-European equity derivatives against the in-country derivatives.”Stripping away the jargon, this is the savings that banks and brokers will get by not having to connect to both the NYSE Liffe futures exchange to trade euribor interest rate futures, and to the Eurex futures exchange for Bund, Bobl and Schatz German bond futures – the short and long end of the yield curve, respectively. The positions taken on each contract could be considered together from a risk management perspective, and netted off against each other.Nor would customers have to connect to the clearing houses of each exchange. The NYSE/Börse deal envisages customers using one clearing house (Eurex Clearing) meaning they only have to put up one set of margin collateral at one clearing house to trade products on each exchange, instead of two (obviously more expensive).And we’re talking big money here, given that Liffe and Eurex’s flagship contracts are, along with the Chicago futures exchanges’ main products, the most-traded derivatives by value in the world.Mr Niederauer and his counterpart at Deutsche Börse, Reto Francioni, are effectively doing exactly what the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade did back in 2003 when they were faced with competition from – ironically – Deutsche Börse.Faced with an attack on its futures franchise by Eurex, which had set up a US futures exchange, the CBOT switched to using the clearing house owned by the CME, abandoning its former clearer which had recently agreed to act as clearer for the upstart new Eurex venture, based in Chicago.That meant that banks and brokers using both the CME and CBOT no longer had to deal with two clearing houses, saving $1.6bn in collateral and other costs, according to claims by the two exchanges at the time. I recall some of the Wall Street banks telling me that this was a big deal for them.Mr Niederauer said the $3bn figure was conservative, adding: “That’s a pretty important value proposition given what’s in front of them as their business models change.”By which he means the wrenching changes being felt by banks and brokers as they try to comply with the new clearing requirements in the Dodd-Frank act in the US, and similar reforms coming out of Europe.The one area where the banks claim they are feeling pain is the costs involved in having to connect to multiple trading platforms that are starting to emerge to offer trading in over-the-counter derivatives, with all the margin collateral commitments at the clearing houses level that this will inevitably involve as well.Eraj Shirvani, European head of fixed income at Credit Suisse, told me recently: “As a result of the broad range of regulatory changes, the type of business we’re going to be doing in the future will be very different from what we’ve done in the past.”If the exchanges’ biggest customers can get some relief on the exchange-traded derivatives side of the business from NYSE/Börse, along the lines of what Mr Niederauer is proposing, that could well drive even more business through the combined exchange – something that shareholders should also like.
399;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-24T22:00:28Z;NYSE boosts case for Deutsche Börse;;NYSE Euronext is set to increase by up to a third its forecast for cost savings from a deal with Deutsche Börse, as the US exchange operator raises the stakes in efforts to counter an $11.3bn bid from Nasdaq OMX and Intercontinental-Exchange.Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE, told the Financial Times in a video interview that the companies now believed they could find “closer to €400m” in cost savings than the €300m unveiled in February.That suggests that the total synergies could reach about €500m ($728m), with revenue opportunities from the deal, compared with the $740m in net synergies touted by Nasdaq and ICE, most of which is cost-cutting. However on Monday Nasdaq OMX and ICE shot back, saying NYSE Euronext shareholders should be “highly sceptical that after two years of exploratory merger discussions, including more than six months dedicated to finalising the transaction, NYSE Euronext” had “suddenly found” the extra €100m in additional synergies.“This increase appears not to be a matter of sharpening a pencil, but an unexplained shift in strategy. The discovery that initial synergies having been understated by one-third comes after receiving a superior proposal from Nasdsq OMX and ICE that achieves greater synergies,” Nasdaq and ICE said in a joint statement.Mr Niederauer also revealed that NYSE and Deutsche Börse estimated that their biggest customers would save at least $3bn through the combination of the exchanges’ two European derivatives platforms. As part of that, banks would no longer have to tie up money at the platforms’ two clearing houses because only one would be used for the combined derivatives platforms.A shareholder vote on the deal was slated for July 7, Mr Niederauer revealed, while NYSE was set to provide details on the proposed savings at its annual meeting this week.The comments come as NYSE seeks to defend its agreed deal against a break-up bid from Nasdaq and ICE, worth about 13 per cent more than the Deutsche Börse offer at current share prices.The higher cost savings promised by Nasdaq and ICE have been a key sticking point and Mr Niederauer’s new forecast is aimed at allaying shareholders’ fears over the value of the Deutsche Börse deal.However Nasdaq and ICE said if NYSE and Deutsche Börse were to find additional synergies “after the merger economics have been agreed”, then this would be “at the expense of NYSE Euronext stockholders because there has been no increase in the price they are being offered”.“NYSE Euronext should describe these newly-found synergies in detail in order to support the credibility of these revised estimates, particularly in light of commitments to retain two technology platforms and two headquarters. Increasingly it appears that NYSE Euronext is more focused on protecting the transaction than its stockholders,” they said.In the video interview, Mr Niederauer also cast doubt on the savings proposed by Nasdaq and ICE, arguing they had underestimated the business that might be lost through their bid.“When we did similar analyses of the competitive landscape, we think the revenue dis-synergies are understated,” said Mr Niederauer. “In fairness to them, they’re just looking at public filings. I have a feeling if they looked more closely, they’d find the expense synergies may be a bit exaggerated as well.”Mr Niederauer did not rule out sweetening the Deutsche Börse deal through special dividends or the promise of share buy-backs but said he remained confident the company could convince shareholders of the combination’s strategic merits.
400;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-21T19:42:28Z;NYSE: Spurning Nasdaq and ICE;Market scepticism of rival takeover bid seems justified;"NYSE Euronext’s board has unanimously rejected the bid by Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange, even though it offers a premium of some 13 per cent to the price placed on the NYSE by the offer to merge with Deutsche Börse and includes some cash. How can they justify this?The time value of money narrows the gap somewhat, as NYSE shareholders would presumably not receive the cash until more than a year into the future. ICE’s multiple may be inflated by the commodities boom, narrowing it a little more. But rejecting such a competitive bid still implies big doubts about its commercial logic and its chances of closing. Are these justified?The Börse proposal offers a diversified group, not
reliant on any single business line – but critics could call it an unwieldy supermarket. Nasdaq/ICE would create two coherent entities – but one would be in the steadily decaying business of US cash equities.On competition, both have big questions to answer. Merging NYSE and Nasdaq creates a virtual US listings monopoly, while putting NYSE’s Liffe and Börse’s Eurex together, whatever the precedents from the big Chicago futures exchanges, creates a troublingly dominant European futures player. Nasdaq/ICE’s pledge of a reverse break-up fee of $350m if their proposal falls foul of the antitrust authorities and its line-up of financing show commitment and confidence – but theirs is still an opportunistic and hastily arranged “catch-up” bid.Cutting through all this, the current NYSE share price is $39.01. This is a 9 per cent discount to Nasdaq/ICE’s bid, suggesting merger arbitrageurs are extremely sceptical about its chance of closing the deal; and the price is a 3 per cent premium to the Deutsche Börse offer, betokening a belief that that bid will need to be beefed up a bit to close the deal. The market has it about right.E-mail the Lex team in confidence"
401;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;NYSE reaffirms support for D Börse deal;;The board of NYSE Euronext once again rebuffed an approach by Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange, and reaffirmed its belief that the already agreed Deutsche Börse merger is the better deal.Nasdaq and ICE revised their initial, also-rejected offer from earlier this week, adding a fee they would pay to shareholders if regulators blocked its bid and announcing they had secured financing for their bid.However, the NYSE board was unmoved. Jan-Michiel Hessels, chairman, said in a statement: “Our board has …concluded that this proposal is substantially the same as what was previously rejected. Consequently, our view has not changed.”Mr Hessels said the board still viewed the Nasdaq-ICE bid as having “unacceptable execution risk”.But the move was immediately attacked by Nasdaq and ICE, with Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, hitting out at NYSE and Deutsche Borse’s refusal to engage which he said made it appear “as if they are protecting their deal rather than acting in the best interest of their shareholders”.People close to the NYSE board said the reference to execution risk was mostly based on a concern that anti-trust regulators in the US will block the deal, which would create a near-monopoly in US stock listings, as well as a belief that Nasdaq cannot execute on the ambitious synergies it promised.The war of words between the two sides this week have revealed the two main battle lines over which the bids are being fought. NYSE and Deutsche Börse continued to stress what they see as the long term benefits of their deal, including the creation of a fully integrated cash equities, derivatives and clearing business straddling the US and Europe.Nasdaq and ICE are criticising that as an “exchange supermarket”, touting their deal as the best way for NYSE shareholders to get access to a cash equities business that would be run more efficiently, while avoiding what is likely to be a prolonged antitrust probe in Europe of the proposed german-US deal’s derivatives plan.Some analysts had predicted the additional $350m “reverse” break-up fee would not be sufficient, even though Nasdaq had also agreed to pay the existing €250m ($357m) NYSE-D Börse break-up fee.A 4 per cent rise in Deutsche Börse shares since Wednesday also meant that the premium offered by Nasdaq-ICE had narrowed. The Börse offer is now valued at $37.26 a share, versus $42.68 a share for Nasdaq-ICE, a differential of 13 per cent. It was about 20 per cent when Nasdaq-ICE initially approached NYSE.The two groups have said they do not intend make a hostile, formal approach to NYSE shareholders, believing that the board can be convinced of the logic of their deal, and that US anti-trust regulators will ultimately give them a green light.Timing is a consideration, as both Nasdaq-ICE and NYSE-D Börse, which faces a full review of its plan to create a near-monopoly listed interest-rate futures market in Europe, pursue regulatory approval for their deals.NYSE has said it intends to put its agreed deal to a vote with shareholders in July, and Deutsche Börse has said it will set a July deadline for shareholders to tender their shares for a deal.“Clearly, anti-trust approval will have a significant impact on shareholders’ view of either deal,” said Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill.Mr Greifeld, speaking to analysts on Wednesday said that his group would “pursue this to the end-game”.In his latest statement he said: “We will not be deterred by the [NYSE] board’s attempts to protect an inferior transaction.”Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, said: “We do not understand why the NYSE Euronext Board continues to protect the lower-premium Deutsche Boerse takeover, despite urging from its shareholders that they consider our transaction. There is no risk in engaging with us to ensure that the best interests of NYSE Euronext shareholders and markets are served.”The financing commitment his company and Nasdaq have received from a syndicate of banks will last until April 2012.Nasdaq and ICE said in their statement: “Not only does this [our offer] represent a significantly higher short term valuation for NYSE Euronext’s shareholders, but as a significant portion of our offer is in shares of two best in class exchange leaders with proven records of creating value for their shareholders, we believe this offer will result in higher long term value creation as well.”
402;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-20T21:54:45Z;Knight shares surge on profit report;;Shares in Knight Capital soared by the most in two years as the US market making and trading group reported a surge in first-quarter profitability.Though broader US equity trading volumes and volatility were much slower than the same quarter last year, Knight reported that it captured greater profitability as retail order flows and demand for ETFs stayed strong and its young options market-making business saw a jump in volume.The group’s net income grew 10 per cent to $30.5m in the first quarter, from $27.8m in the same quarter a year ago. Earnings-per-share were 33 cents, versus analyst expectations of 26 cents.Compensation expenses, which had been a concern as Knight builds out its fixed-income trading business, were below expectations.The shares rose 8.4 per cent to $13.34, their biggest one-day gain since April 2009.Knight generates much of its revenues from making markets in listed shares and buying order flow from retail brokerages, where it matches trades by individual investors.The company said it was increasingly having success using trading algorithms to hold shares for longer than a few microseconds to earn more per trade. That helped propel the jump in profitability. It captured 1.23 basis points per trade, up from 1.06 basis points in the fourth quarter of last year.“The revenue beat can primarily be attributed to a very healthy revenue capture in its market making business,” said Patrick O’Shaughnessy, an analyst at Raymond James who had predicted revenue capture of 1.08 basis points.A boom in exchange-traded funds also propelled Knight, as it makes markets in such funds. Assets in US ETFs were $929bn at the end of February, versus $678bn at the end of February 2010, according to BlackRock.“Knight is well positioned to benefit from the proliferation of ETFs,” said Thomas Joyce, chief executive, on the earnings call.“In the face of a decline in overall US equity market volumes, Knight’s volumes remained strong,” Mr Joyce said. “Retail investors were a little more active [than institutions].”This illustrates the challenge for the equity exchanges – such as Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange – as they fight competition from groups like Knight, Citadel, Getco and big broker-dealers that match trades before they reach the exchanges. Nearly a third of trades are now executed off-exchange.Knight’s revenues from equities were $266m, up from $219m, as average daily US equity trades grew 6 per cent versus the first quarter of 2010.By contrast, Nasdaq OMX, which reported earnings earlier on Wednesday, saw its gross revenues from trading decline as its volume of trades executed also declined. Its net revenues rose, however, as it paid less in rebates to customers.Knight said it saw gains in Europe after a technology outage at the London Stock Exchange during its transition to a new system.“We earned a lot of goodwill during the late February market disruption of the LSE,” said Mr Joyce. “As a result of Knight Link’s performance and reliability, we are making good progress, signing some larger firms in Europe as clients.”Mr Joyce also spoke out against regulations that would push more trading on to listed exchanges by forcing wholesale market makers, such as Knight, to improve the price of a trade in order to execute it off the exchange.“It is completely nuts to me that the regulators would try to curtail competition when the exchanges are going to become huge monoliths at some point,” said Mr Joyce.“Internalisation has been going on for several decades now,” he said. “[The exchanges] lost a lot of market share so now they are trying to tilt the field back in their favour. And I think given the competitive environment, that’s a completely irresponsible thing to do.”
403;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-20T16:44:07Z;Nasdaq OMX reports 19.6% rise in net income;;"Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator trying to break up an agreed combination of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, reported a record earnings-per-share of 61 cents for the quarter, helped by a big boost in options trading.However, operating expenses rose as a result of a string of acquisitions in trading technology and market surveillance.Net income rose to $110m in the first quarter, compared with $92m in the same quarter a year earlier, a rise of 19.6 per cent. That translated to earnings of 61 cents per share – Nasdaq’s best ever – after taking out one-time transaction costs, compared to 43 cents a year ago.The figures come as Nasdaq OMX is pressing its case, together with IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), that its $11.3bn cash-and-shares offer for NYSE Euronext is superior to a $9.3bn all-share deal already agreed between the owner of the New York Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse of Germany.While NYSE-D Börse would create a leading European futures exchange, NYSE-Nasdaq would create a dominant US cash equities exchange. Analysts have expressed concern that cash equities are a lower-margin, slower growing business.But Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, said that this quarter’s record earnings-per-share showed the earnings power of a cash-equities focused business. “A well managed cash equity and equity derivatives franchise can perform well on an absolute basis, it can also perform well versus derivative exchanges on a relative basis,” said Mr Greifeld on the earnings call.An uptick in interest rates, which will drive derivatives, will also reflect a stronger economy, he said. “Cash equities is the derivative of the economy of the market that it serves and its success over the medium and the long-term will be a multiplier of GDP growth,” he said.Revenues from trading and clearing – a mainstay of any exchange’s business – jumped 26 per cent to $195m after taking out fees paid to traders and exchanges, compared with the year previous figure. They were up 7 per cent on the fourth quarter.The boost was primarily in US options trading and clearing. Volumes for Nasdaq grew as it increased its marketshare from 21.3 per cent to 23.5 per cent, making it the largest US options operator. Revenues were $124m in the quarter, up from $73m a year ago.US cash equity revenues increased from $55m to $62m, but only net of rebates and fees, which were lower due to lower volumes than the same quarter a year ago. Revenues in issuer services and market technology also improved, bringing total group net revenues to $415m, versus $360m a year ago.A further argument used by Nasdaq in its counter-offer for NYSE Euronext is that the combined Nasdaq-ICE proposal will result in more cost synergies than the Deutsche Börse deal: $740m compared with around $400m promised by German-US operators.Mr Greifeld has also made much of his record in removing costs from the exchange businesses he has run, including the OMX Nordic network, acquired by Nasdaq in 2006.In the first quarter, Nasdaq OMX’s operating expenses rose by 12 per cent compared with the same quarter a year earlier, to $225m, from $201m.That was mostly due to higher expenses associated with the acquisition of FTEN, a company specialising in pre-trade risk management, of Smarts, which makes market surveillance systems, and of Nord Pool, a Norway-based electricity market.Overall group operating expenses increased by 4 per cent in the quarter compared with the fourth quarter.Nasdaq OMX and ICE this week stepped up efforts to try and persuade the board of NYSE Euronext to engage with it on their offer for the owner of the New York Stock Exchange.They submitted a fresh offer that involved agreeing to pay NYSE shareholders a $350m “reverse break-up fee” and pay the NYSE-D Börse break up fee of some $350m if the Nasdaq-ICE deal failed to win antitrust approval; secured $3.8bn in committed bank financing; and started to buy NYSE stock.Mr Greifeld said the fee was based on a study of 80 deals, and the percentage of NYSE’s market capitalisation it represented – about 3.5 per cent – was in line, and that his group had “zero inclination” to make it larger."
404;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-20T14:39:03Z;Bumper earnings set broad-based US rally in motion;;The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped up to its highest point since 2008 led by technology stocks after bumper quarterly earnings reports fromIntel and IBM lifted sentiment.Shares in Intel, the chipmaker, were up 7.8 per cent to $21.41 after reporting first-quarter earnings of 56 cents a share.This was ahead of the 46 cents expected by analysts and about 30 per cent higher than the same period a year ago.IBM’s results were similarly strong with its operating earnings climbing 21 per cent to $2.41 a share, ahead of the $2.30 expected.But the shares were down 0.4 per cent at $164.75 after IBM did not lift its full-year forecast as much as some investors had hoped. Others were concerned about the lower-than-expected new services bookings for the computer company.But the results from both companies were still strong, alleviating concerns that sagging consumer spending, flatter PC markets and disruption to supply chains from the disaster in Japan would dent a tech recovery.Elsewhere in the sector, Yahoo jumped 4.7 per cent to $16.87 on first-quarter sales and earnings that topped estimates.The internet search engine saw a 28 per cent drop in earnings from the same period a year ago but also reported an increase in audience size, pages viewed and time spent on its network of sites.Shares in Apple, the second-largest company in the world by market capitalisation, were up 1.4 per cent to $342.41, ahead of the release of its second-quarter earnings.All this left the S&P technology sector 2.4 per cent higher, the biggest rise on the index in seven months, and the Philadelphia Semiconductor index up 4.3 per cent.That helped the S&P 500 index jump 1.4 per cent to 1,330.36, erasing all the losses sustained earlier in the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.5 per cent to 12,453.54, a level not seen since June 2008. The Nasdaq Composite added 2.1 per cent to 2,802.51.Also helping sentiment in the wider markets was better-than-expected US housing data. Existing home sales rose at an annualised rate of 3.7 per cent in March, according to the National Association of Realtors, which was ahead of the 2.5 per cent expected by economists.Material and energy stocks bounced higher as commodity prices advanced amid a weaker US dollar.Alcoa, the aluminium producer, was up 1.2 per cent to $16.64 while Chevron, the energy group, added 2.3 per cent to $107.81. The S&P material and energy sectors were up 1.2 per cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively.Only banking stocks saw meaningful losses in the session after Wells Fargo’sfirst-quarter results disappointed the markets.The fourth-largest US bank by assets reported earnings 1 cent above expectations at 67 cents a share but revenues fell short, leaving the stock down 4.1 per cent to $28.83 at the close.The KBW banking index was down 0.5 per cent.AT&T, the largest US telecommunications group, reported 57 cents a share in first-quarter earnings, which was a 39 per cent increase from the same period a year ago, but broadly in line with expectations. Shares in AT&T, the first of the big US telecoms groups to announce its results, were down 0.6 per cent to $30.13 following the news.But the rest of the sector was higher with Sprint Nextel adding 1.3 per cent to $4.80 and American Tower putting on 3.2 per cent to $51.09. The S&P telecoms sector was up 0.4 per cent.Among industrials, United Technologies, the maker of Pratt & Whitney jet engines, added 4.3 per cent to $85.90 after it reported a forecast-beating 17 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings and raised its profit forecast. The S&P industrial sector was up 1.5 per cent.Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator trying to break up an agreed deal between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext, reported a 19.6 per cent jump in first-quarter net income as revenues rose across its businesses.Shares in Nasdaq fell 0.3 per cent to $27.32 but NYSE, the takeover target, added 1 per cent to $39.08.In deal news, AES, the Virginia-based global power producer, announced that it had agreed to buy DPL, a regional energy company. DPL rose 9.3 per cent to $30.16 while AES added 3.3 per cent to $12.88.
405;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-20T03:46:56Z;Quick View: Breaking down break-up fees;;Breaking up is hard to do – especially when someone is offering billions of euros to stay.Just ask shareholders of the warring participants in the most recent exchange consolidation battle, on the one side Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange, and on the other side NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse.In the original agreement unveiled in February, NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse agreed to pay €250m ($357m) to the other’s shareholders if one of them broke off the deal.It was meant to discourage rival bidders. Though the $9.4bn all-stock deal contained little premium for NYSE shares, the $357m fee is substantial, larger than the $288m break-up fee in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange-Chicago Board of Trade merger.Yet Nasdaq and ICE were not discouraged. They made an approach to NYSE to jointly acquire it for $11.3bn. Some shareholders approved of the higher bid, but wanted compensation for the risk that the deal would not close due to regulatory scrutiny. They also wanted to know they would be covered if NYSE was forced to pay €250m to Deutsche Börse.So Nasdaq and ICE have proposed a so-called reverse break-up fee, in which they would jointly pay $350m to NYSE if NYSE agrees to their deal – thus triggering the obligation to pay a fee to Deutsche – but authorities subsequently block it.In the fine print, they have critically also agreed to pay the NYSE break-up fee, too. In all, they are offering almost $700m in insurance, or roughly 7 per cent of NYSE’s market cap.Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James, points as a precedent to the recent AT&T bid for T-Mobile – a deal with its own antitrust shadows – in which AT&T offered $3bn, or roughly 7.5 per cent of T-Mobile’s market value.NYSE, however, stands to receive only the reverse $350m fee – the NYSE-D Börse break-up fee will be paid to Deutsche Börse shareholders.If the NYSE board looks at just the $350m reverse fee, it may not be compelling. Considering the whole $700m, it may be hard to convince Nasdaq and ICE to offer much more.
406;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-20T01:39:42Z;Ontario fears over LSE-TMX deal;;Canadian politicians have expressed concern that the “centre of gravity” in a proposed merger between the London Stock Exchange and TMX Group – operator of the Toronto and Montreal exchanges – could shift to London.They recommended ensuring equal Canadian and UK membership on any combined group’s board and measures to ensure that key exchange functions stayed in Canada.The comments came on Tuesday in recommendations by a select committee of the Ontario legislative assembly, one of the key bodies in Canada that have a say in approving the deal. Last week it gave its conditional support for the deal, leaving final reservations for publication on Tuesday.The LSE and TMX in February unveiled an all-share deal that would create a platform with the world’s largest number of mining company listings at a time of surging commodity prices.It comes amid a wave of exchange consolidation that also on Tuesday Nasdaq and IntercontinentalExchange of the US sent a strengthened bid for NYSE Euronext to the company’s board, which has already agreed a deal with Deutsche Börse.The final decision on the LSE-TMX deal rests with Canada’s federal government, which must determine whether the deal provides a “net benefit” as required by the country’s foreign investment law. Reviews are also under way by securities regulators in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta.Critics of the deal say it is less a merger than a takeover of TMX, which owns the Toronto and Montreal exchanges. Existing LSE shareholders would hold 55 per cent of the enlarged group’s capital and Xavier Rolet, LSE chief executive, would head the group.The committee said that witnesses at hearings it held were “not convinced that the proposal was a merger of equals”. It recommended that the board be split equally between UK and Canadian members, rather than being made up of seven Canadians, five UK members and three from Italy under the LSE-TMX proposal. The Italian board members would come from Borsa Italiana, which the LSE bought in 2007.The Ontario committee said witnesses had expressed concern about a provision of the merger agreement under which, at the end of four years, Canadian representation on the new board could be reduced from seven of 15 members to a minimum of three.The concerns reflect similar issues that dogged the ultimately failed attempt by SGX, the Singapore exchange, to buy the ASX Australian exchange.The LSE and TMX said: “We will review the report in detail and look forward to continued open dialogue with all stakeholders.”
407;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-19T23:43:16Z;Nasdaq-ICE make fresh offer for NYSE Euronext;;"Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange have raised
the stakes in their bid to buy NYSE Euronext, offering to pay the Wall Street-based exchange $350m if an agreed deal ­were to be blocked by regulators.The move comes little more than a week after the NYSE Euronext board rejected the $11.3bn approach from Nasdaq and ICE and backed NYSE’s already agreed $9.4bn merger with Deutsche Börse, citing concerns that the rival deal would not be completed.Nasdaq and ICE also touted their capacity to fund a takeover, saying that they had secured $3.8bn in financing commitments for a deal. The two exchanges now hope the NYSE board will reopen talks.“As we go through all the check boxes, we clearly are the superior offer,” Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, told the Financial Times. “We are in the lead in the pure economics and in committed financing. I am sure independent members of the board will come to the rational conclusion.”The groups also said that they would pay NYSE and Deutsche Börse’s agreed €250m ($358m) break-up fee as part of their offer. They further said they intend to purchase at least $66m in NYSE Euronext stock.Nasdaq and ICE’s higher offer has attracted the interest of some institutional shareholders, which would see Nasdaq buying the cash equities markets, which includes the New York Stock Exchange and Paris’s Euronext, and ICE buying its futures exchange, London-based Liffe.But the shareholders were hesitant to give their full support, people close to them have said, fearing Nasdaq and ICE would not be able to secure financial backing.Nasdaq said it had won commitments from Bank of America, Nordea Bank, SEB and UBS. ICE had agreements with a syndicate of banks including Wells Fargo and Bank of America.The two had said when they unveiled their bid on April 1 that they had not finalised bank funding as they were not at that stage ready to pay banks the fees needed to clinch funding, with people close to the companies citing the cost of doing so.The reverse break-up fee responds to antitrust concerns around Nasdaq and ICE’s deal, which would create a single dominant US company listings venue.The fee would be triggered if NYSE agreed to the Nasdaq-ICE bid, but saw it blocked by regulators. Mr Greifeld was in Washington on Monday speaking to US justice department officials.European regulators have said they will give a full review to the NYSE-Deutsche Börse deal, which would create a monopoly in listed European interest rate futures.The NYSE board said in a statement it would consider the revised offer. People close to the board said Nasdaq’s credit ratings, at the lower end of investment grade, were still of ­concern.Deutsche Börse said in a statement: “We are moving ahead with our integration planning and look forward to the successful completion of the strategic merger by the end of this year.”Nasdaq-ICE said its new offer to NYSE Euronext valued the exchanges operator at $42.67 per NYSE Euronext share, a 21 per cent premium to the value of the Deutsche Börse-NYSE deal. Its original offer was valued at $42.50.Mr Greifeld, speaking to the FT, denied reports that he had received indications from US antitrust officials that they would give a preliminary view on his deal in just 5 weeks.“I hope to hear something from the justice department [in due course], that’s my desire clearly,” he said, adding that he had a three-and-a-half hour meeting with department officials on Monday.He also gave further details of the proposed $740m in cost synergies that Nasdaq and ICE believe they can achieve, well above the $423m proposed by his rivals.Mr Greifeld said he would “rationalise” the data centres that both NYSE and Nasdaq use to house traders’ computer systems, increasingly the way banks, brokers and automated traders gain access to an exchange.Analysts have said this implies deep cuts in the cash equities operations at the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq and at Euronext’s four stock exchanges in Europe, moves that could provoke political and worker resistance.Asked what he would do with the two main data centres built recently by NYSE Euronext in Mahwah, New Jersey, and in Basildon, England at a total cost of $500m, Mr Greifeld said there would be one data centre in the US for the combined Nasdaq-NYSE.But he declined to say whether that would mean shutting the one in New Jersey or ending Nasdaq’s lease agreement with a third party for use of its data centre.Asked if he would shut Basildon, Mr Greifeld said: “We really need to get [due] diligence on that.” He said Nasdaq was unclear about similar Euronext infrastructure in Paris, where he has pledged to retain some businesses.He said he was likely to adopt the same approach to Paris and the three other Euronext centres of Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon that Nasdaq used when it took over OMX, the Nordic group of exchanges.“We adopted a local and global approach there,” Mr Greifeld said. “We created enough of an appeal in the Nordic marketplace to entice the London and global players to come there.“The opposite approach was taken by Euronext, where the lure of London has in certain ways eviscerated Paris as a financial centre,” he said. “We’d like to see if we can reverse that trend line and that means making sure that Paris has a financial infrastructure.”"
408;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-19T20:47:00Z;Goldman and J&J earnings lift Wall Street;;"Strong quarterly earnings results from Johnson & Johnson and healthy housing data helped the wider US markets pare some of the sharp losses seen in the previous session.Shares in the healthcare giant bounced higher after the company raised its annual earnings guidance and reporting better-then-expected first-quarter results, leaving the stock up 3.7 per cent at $62.69.The company reported a revenue boost thanks to a weaker dollar, but overall profits still fell 23 per cent from the previous year due to litigation and recall-
related charges. J&J was hit by $271m of charges related to its DePuy ASR, a hip replacement which had to be recalled. The stock had been losing ground since the start of the year, but after Tuesday’s gains is up 1.4 per cent year to date.Elsewhere in the sector, Forest Laboratories added 2.4 per cent to $34.10, helped by the strong results, while the wider S&P healthcare index was up 0.9 per cent.This helped the wider markets bounce higher, with the benchmark S&P 500 index closing 0.6 per cent higher at 1,312.62. This followed a 1.1 per cent loss in the previous session after S&P, the rating agency, surprised traders by lowering its outlook on US debt from “stable” to “negative”.Sentiment on Wall Street was helped by news that housing starts and permits for future home construction had risen by more than expected in March, rising 7.2 per cent from the previous month to 549,000.But the improvement was largely a bounce back from the sharply lower levels in February when the figure was depressed by the winter weather, and so did not have a profound impact in the session.The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.5 per cent to 12,266.75 while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.4 per cent to 2,744.97. “The market did react positively to some good earnings, but the gains were not dramatic as traders are in a cautious mood at the moment,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners. “The markets will likely stay in a tight 3-4 per cent trading range for the time being,” he added.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs reported profits down 72 per cent in the first quarter as the bank’s trading revenue declined and earnings were hit by a $1.64bn dividend payment to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway.These results were better than analysts’ had expected, but shares in the investment bank still lost 1.3 per cent to $151.86.This weighed many financial stocks, but failed to drag down the overall sector. Bank of America lost 0.6 per cent to $12.34 while US Bancorp fell 1.2 per cent to $25.25, but the KBW banking index was flat.Losses on the broader financial indices were pared thanks to Zions Bancorporation, which added 3.9 per cent to $23.85 after the bank reported its first quarterly profit in 2½ years, surprising investors who were expecting a loss.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Texas Instrumentslost ground after reporting lower-than-expected profits and revenues, becoming the first large chipmaker to report on the effect of the Japan earthquake on earnings. Texas Instruments said after the closing bell on Monday that two of its three Japanese factories were damaged in the disaster and warned that the biggest impact on revenues would take place in the second quarter. The stock fell 0.7 per cent to $34.54.After the closing bell Intel reported earnings of 59 cents a share, ahead of the 46 cents expected. IBM also reported earnings above expectations, with earnings of $2.41 a share, ahead of the $2.30 expected. Both stocks were up in after-hours trading.NYSE Euronext rose 1 per cent to $38.70 after Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange made a fresh offer for the exchange. Nasdaq and ICE fell 0.5 per cent and 0.4 per cent to $27.40 and $119.33, respectively.The materials sector saw some of the strongest gains on Wall Street led by steel stocks after Steel Dynamics reported strong first-quarter earnings and said that the current quarter looked “solid”. Shares in the steel producer were up 5.7 per cent to $18.46, while US Steel added 4.5 per cent to $52.74. The S&P materials sector added 1.8 per cent.Industrial stocks were also higherCaterpillar, the world’s largest earthmoving equipment maker by revenues, was up 2.1 per cent to $106.10.The energy sector was also higher. Halliburton, the oilfield services company, was up 4 per cent to $49.01. The S&P energy index climbed 1.1 per cent."

410;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-19T19:50:12Z;Antitrust issues haunt proposed D Börse-NYSE tie-up;;"When Deutsche Börse last tried to expand in Europe by bidding for the Euronext group of exchanges in 2006, it was met with derision from Hugh Freedberg, then chief executive of the target’s derivatives business.“This creates a European monopoly,” he said, arguing that by combining the Börse’s Eurex derivatives business with Liffe, Euronext’s derivatives arm, customers would be deprived of choice.Five years on, Mr Freedberg’s business is under the ownership of NYSE Euronext, which, with its merger partner Deutsche Börse, argues that there is no problem with the Eurex-Liffe combination.This curious about-turn might come back to haunt both exchanges as they try to persuade shareholders of NYSE Euronext of the superiority of their $9.4bn all-share merger over an audacious counter-bid, worth $11.3bn in cash and shares, from Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange.Indeed, the antitrust obstacles faced by Deutsche Börse/NYSE are potentially more complex than those faced by Nasdaq/ICE, as they contemplate combining the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange listings platforms.The Deutsche Börse/NYSE deal involves combining not only two big derivatives exchanges but also clearing houses, currently the centre of heated discussion in Europe over competition and access to such post-trade structures.That matters to NYSE Euronext shareholders, since an assessment of the relative merits of each deal will rely heavily on which of the two deals faces the least antitrust risk. In the US, Nasdaq is likely to face scrutiny over its plans to combine the NYSE and Nasdaq’s listings business.Bruce Weber, professor of information management
at the London Business School, says: “I think clearing as a complementary business to trading is far more interdependent and difficult to understand and disentangle than listings. Listing is a fairly straightforward business activity.”Last month, Joaquín Almunia, the European Union’s competition commissioner, said the Deutsche Börse/NYSE deal was a “complex case” that would be subject to “deep investigation”.The German-US side is expected to make several core arguments. First, they will argue that the exchange-traded element is only a small portion of the entire derivatives market and that competition will come from an expected proliferation of new swap trading platforms that will emerge from reforms of the over-the-counter derivatives markets under way in the US and Europe.They will also argue that the Eurex and Liffe offerings are complementary, rather than in competition with one another, and stress the efficiencies of having these traded in a single venue.Eurex offers futures on German government bonds, known as Bunds, while Liffe’s main product is euribor interest rate futures.Second, the two exchanges will stress that the derivatives marketplace is global and that not only is there a big competitor in the US in the form of the CME Group but that there are other operators globally.Indeed, competition has just started in futures trading in Liffe’s own backyard. This month, the London Stock Exchange took aim at Liffe and Eurex with its first serious push into futures trading, with futures on the FTSE index.And BATS Europe and Chi-X Europe, two rival trading platforms that will soon merge, are set to join the fray.Deutsche Börse/NYSE are also likely to argue that a precedent was set in 2007 when the US Department of Justice approved the take­over of the Chicago Board of Trade by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.That brought together the CME, dominant in eurodollar interest rate futures, with the CBOT, big in Treasury bond futures – similar to the Eurex-Liffe product mix. Together they control 98 per cent of US futures trading.Some observers argue that Europe needs a combined Eurex-Liffe derivatives platform as a counterweight to CME in the US.Deutsche Börse/NYSE and its advisers acknowledge, however, that their case is unusual in that it is running in parallel with EU OTC derivatives and clearing reforms that will substantially alter the environment in which exchanges and their customers operate.A key part of those reforms, known as the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, deals with competition between clearing houses in the
OTC derivatives markets.Awkwardly for the
German-US proposal, this has thrown a spotlight on exchange ownership of a trading platform and clearing house together in a “vertical silo”. Critics of the vertical silo argue that it locks out competitors.So far, proponents of the vertical silo appear to have convinced policymakers that this model has its merits. Meanwhile, people close to Deutsche Börse/NYSE say they are ready to consider some “mitigants” involving Clearstream, the Börse’s custody and settlement business, should it become necessary to offer some remedies to Brussels.But the key issue for Deutsche Börse/NYSE is time. Both exchanges have said they expect the Brussels process to take about a year. With NYSE Euronext shareholders set to vote on the deal in July, that may weigh on their minds."
411;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-19T16:39:17Z;SGX chief plays down failed offer;;Magnus Böcker, chief executive of the Singapore Exchange, said he was under no pressure to achieve a significant strategic deal following the collapse of an A$8.3bn (US$8.7bn) bid for the Australian Securities Exchange.Mr Böcker played down the prospects of another pan-Asian exchange deal emerging and said that the transatlantic exchange merger proposals on the table were mainly driven by European and North American consolidation.Reporting a 10 per cent fall in net profit to S$67m (US$53.8m), for the third quarter to March 31, largely because of costs of S$12m associated with the aborted ASX deal, Mr Böcker said on Tuesday he felt “no pressure at all” to deliver another deal.“I am here to deliver value to our customers and our shareholders, and I think that is a clear focus,” he said, dismissing suggestions that his job might be in jeopardy without another big deal.Mr Böcker, who touted the ASX proposal as a chance to build an Asia-Pacific exchange powerhouse, only to see it dismissed two weeks ago by the Australian government, said exchange mergers in Asia would be very difficult because of the fragmentation of rules, regulations and economic policies.He said the proposed merger between the London Stock Exchange and Canada’s TMX Group offered few synergies for customers, while the merger proposal between Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext and the competing $11.3bn bid for NYSE by Nasdaq OMX and Intercontinental Exchange, were “continental” rather than global proposals.“I think you need to see [the proposals] not as an isolated thing that is happening now, but as a trend over seven or eight years [of consolidation in the European and North American exchange markets],” he said.He added that the opportunities for organic growth and strategic co-operation short of mergers were greater in Asia because of the faster rates of economic growth there.SGX said operating revenue rose 10 per cent to S$169m, but net profit was affected by expenditure on initiatives such as new equipment intended to facilitate high-speed electronic trading as well as the ASX bid expenses. Trading volumes have recovered in the past two years after tumbling in 2008, as the financial crisis dragged the world’s economies into recession.Singapore’s benchmark Straits Times index sank by a record 49 per cent in 2008, then surged 64 per cent in 2009 and rose 10 per cent last year, as stimulus measures helped revive the global economy.Singapore Exchange shares dropped 1.6 per cent to S$7.95 on Tuesday.
412;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-18T23:13:43Z;SGX launches high-speed connections;;The Singapore Exchange has launched a high-speed data connection as investors in the US and Europe clamour for greater links to markets in the developing world and Asia.SGX said Monday it had signed up 50 market participants to rent space in its “co-location” centre, which will allow traders to execute transactions at speeds up to 250 times faster than traditional connections by plugging their trading systems directly into SGX’s data centre, which opened earlier this month.Exchanges around the world have been competing to win contracts to host the trading systems of high-frequency market makers and hedge funds as a way to gain trading volume while upstart venues have cut into exchanges’ traditional central role in trading.High-speed traders have recently been targeting countries outside the US and Europe, where volatility and trading volumes have slumped, and fierce competition among traders has squeezed the profits of out of many previously profitable strategies.“Customers can expect a trading environment with even greater market liquidity and velocity, thereby strengthening Singapore’s position as the gateway to Asia,” said Gan Seow Ann, SGX president.SGX has also developed a new trade-matching engine, called SGX Reach, which promises to make trades in less than 90 microseconds. It will debut in August.An effort by SGX to acquire ASX, the Australian exchange, hit a wall in Australia earlier this month when politicians rejected the deal. Exchanges, especially those that derive a large portion of their revenues from stock trading, have been aggressively trying to merge to build scale and attract traders through lower costs, with the notable example of Nasdaq OMX’s attempt to take over NYSE Euronext, which would involve slashing NYSE’s data centres and passing along cost savings to trading customers.Also on Monday, Barclays Capital released a survey of institutional investors that found rising demand for electronic trading of emerging-market fixed income securities and currencies.Among users of its electronic BARX platform, 57 per cent said they traded emerging market currencies and 33 per cent said they traded emerging market bonds in 2010, up from 51 per cent and 33 per cent, respectively in 2009.Almost all of the respondents – 1,300 institutional investors – said they expected to trade more of those products electronically. Three-quarters of the currency traders said that their top trading consideration was to have constantly streaming prices.“We have expanded our electronic trading platform …to meet our clients’ demand for emerging markets products,” said Kevin Rush, the London-based head of electronic distribution at Barclays Capital.Banks and brokerages have been competing aggressively to capture traders’ global flows, even as many of the biggest proprietary trading firms and hedge funds build their own systems or directly connect to exchanges such as SGX.Newedge chief executive Nicolas Breteau told the FT last week that among the brokerage’s top initiatives was expanding its linkages globally to attract more high-speed trading groups.
413;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-18T16:36:38Z;Quick View: NYSE scores a (small) win;;Niederauer 1-0 Greifeld?Last week was a more enjoyable week for Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext. His first win was his board rejecting the combined Nasdaq-IntercontinentalExchange bid. It allowed him to speak out in public about his preferred merger again.His second win came from his own company, which secured a notable coup with the listing of Sequans Communications, the French 4G chipmaker, listed on NYSE on Friday.Sequans’ choice for its New York listing was a little surprising. Paris has a healthy technology investment scene with many knowledgeable investors and plenty of companies large and small. As an aside, London as a listing venue was a non-starter. Investors’ regard for technology stocks is – with a few exceptions – at its lowest point in a decade.But the choice should trouble Nasdaq. While Sequans raised a relatively small $77m in gross proceeds, it has not been the first technology company in recent months to see its future on the Big Board.For the rest of the world, Nasdaq is regarded the natural home for technology companies, and the preferred venue for the industry giants Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple, Intel, Ebay and Baidu. Web groups Skype and Kayak will issue shares on the index later this year.Yet increasingly technology companies at home and abroad are choosing the Big Board. So far this year Interxion, Demand Media, NeoPhotonics and MagnaChip Semiconductor have opted for NYSE.The battle for listings of technology companies between Nasdaq and NYSE has become increasingly competitive in recent years as they look not only to gain new listings, but also pull listings from each other’s markets. Upcoming battles for LinkedIn, Pandora, RenRen, the Chinese social media group, will be interesting to watch.But the listing was noteworthy in another, perhaps more startling, way. Sequans’s move was, surprisingly, the first French company to list on NYSE since 2002.NYSE’s acquisition of Euronext in 2006 was supposed to help the New York Stock Exchange compete head-on with London, which had been beating NYSE in the listing of international shares in the middle of the decade. That no French company has until now listed on NYSE in the five years existence suggests that Nasdaq hasn’t suffered too badly from the merger.The unknown is whether is says more about NYSE Euronext or whether the way international capital is allocated is changing as rival centres like and London, Hong Kong vie with emerging hubs like São Paolo and Moscow.As the LSE pointed out five years ago: “There are many things that weigh on a company’s mind when it seeks a listing, and the market capitalisation of the exchange isn’t one of them.”Yet Nasdaq’s bid to break up the Deutsche Börse-NYSE merger plan rests in part on the ability to attract international companies. If it succeeds in buying the NYSE, it would then have to show it could thrive where rivals have failed.The performance of companies listing offers little encouragment for others to step forward. Interxion’s shares have barely moved since it listed in February and MagnaChip shares are marginally lower. Neophonetics shares and Demand Media have slumped by around a fifth.Sequans’s debut performance on Friday – when its shares tumbled 18 per cent in spite of a lowered price range – only adds to the uncertainty.
414;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-15T01:20:39Z;Nasdaq OMX appoints permanent CFO;;Nasdaq OMX has hired a new permanent chief financial officer, Lee Shavel, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch banker and key adviser in Nasdaq’s efforts to buy arch-rival NYSE Euronext.Nasdaq’s previous CFO, Adena Friedman, a long-time top company strategist, had left the company in February, just after NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse announced they planned to merge. At the time, Nasdaq was in the early stages of launching its offer to buy NYSE in a joint effort with the IntercontinentalExchange.Mr Shavel was head of financial institutions investment banking for the Americas. Bank of America Merrill Lynch has been a critical partner to Nasdaq and ICE’s $11.3bn cash-and-shares bid for NYSE Euronext, for which BofA Merrill and Wells Fargo have agreed to provide financing, if necessary. Nasdaq and ICE have not yet made a formal bid.During his 18 years at BofA and Merrill Lynch, Mr Shavel helped sell the International Securities Exchange, a US options market, to Deutsche Börse, with whom Nasdaq is currently wrangling to take over NYSE.He also helped sell the New York Mercantile Exchange to the CME Group, and Brut, an electronic trading network, to Nasdaq. He advised on initial public offerings for major exchanges and brokerages, including Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange.“Lee has been a valued adviser to Nasdaq OMX for the past seven years on a variety of mergers and acquisitions, funding and capital transactions,” said Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, in a statement.Mr Shavel will take over officially from Ronald Hassen, interim CFO, on May 23. Mr Shavel has also been named vice-president of corporate strategy.The departure of Ms Friedman had raised eyebrows, coming at a critical time for the company as its top rival planned to join with Europe’s biggest exchange group. Nasdaq has lost other top executives in recent years as its share price struggled and it lost equity trading market share to new market entrants.However, Ms Friedman left to take the same position at The Carlyle Group, a private equity firm that is mulling a transition to public company. It was an opportunity she wanted to pursue to be nearer to her family in the Washington area, where Carlyle is based, people with knowledge of her decision have said.
415;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-14T00:42:47Z;Shareholders may urge NYSE board to address Nasdaq deal;;Some shareholders in NYSE Euronext, which has agreed to merge with Deutsche Börse, may urge the company to consider a rival offer by Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange at the upcoming general meeting on April 28.NYSE Euronext has agreed to a friendly all-stock $9.4bn merger with Deutsche Börse, but also the target of an $11.3bn takeover proposal by Nasdaq and ICE, who would split the group’s equities and futures arms.All the groups’ chief executives have been meeting US shareholders, with NYSE and Deutsche Börse stepping up their efforts this week following the NYSE board’s rejection on Sunday of the Nasdaq-ICE offer.Some shareholders, notably those that also have large positions in Nasdaq and ICE shares, have expressed concern that NYSE board did not take the higher offer seriously enough, and are awaiting DB-NYSE to match or challenge their rivals’ promise of higher cost savings.“The opportunity to buy the New York Stock Exchange doesn’t come along every day,” said Rick Wetmore, portfolio manager at Turner Investments. “A premium has to be paid. This is an iconic global brand, and it’s being sold at a cyclical low.”Some of those institutions are weighing whether to vote on a proposal at the April 28 general meeting that would allow them to call a special meeting with their own agenda if 10 per cent of shareholders agree, people familiar with matter said.“There is noise around these issues, and voting for them would send a signal,” said a person familiar with several shareholders’ thinking.The measure, which has been proposed but failed the past two years, is not endorsed by NYSE, which said in a regulatory filing that it poses a “real risk of …diversion of management and financial resources”. It would also be subject to regulatory approval, and likely not be available in time for the merger discussion.The proposed DB merger is not on agenda at the general meeting. It set to be voted on at a meeting in early June.For NYSE, 50 per cent of shareholders are required to approve the deal. DB needs 75 per cent of its shareholders, a majority of whom are in the US, to agree. It plans to set a July deadline for investor approval.Reto Francioni, DB chief executive, has travelled to the US to speak to shareholders. Along with Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext chief, the two are arguing that their cost savings estimates were “conservative”. They also say they can achieve cuts without up to 1,000 job losses they say Nasdaq would require.One large institutional investor said that was a critical factor: “The only way Nasdaq’s deal can work is with lay-offs. I’m not sure how that will go down politically.”Mr Niederauer and Mr Francioni also say the Nasdaq-ICE proposal offers investors no protection – such as a reverse break-up fee – in the event that antitrust regulators reject the creation of a singular US listing venue. The DB-NYSE deal has a large break-up fee of $340m.Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James, said in a note on Wednesday that though he expected the DB merger to be approved, such a fee could “potentially make things more interesting” for Nasdaq and ICE.Nasdaq and ICE, which have not yet made a formal offer, are also continuing to meet with shareholders. Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq chief, has previously said that a combined NYSE-Nasdaq, which would compete globally rather than in the US – and therefore is not anti-competitive – would be a “direct benefit for New York City” by “ensuring New York is a financial centre, ensuring that we have continued job growth”.
416;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-12T23:52:40Z;ICE to open electronic platform in Brazil;;IntercontinentalExchange has made its first big move into Brazil by teaming up with one of the country’s most famous businessmen to create an electronic marketplace for power contracts.The world’s biggest bourses, which are fighting for pole position in a rapidly changing industry, have increasingly looked to emerging markets such as Brazil to get ahead of their competitors.Rival Chicago-based CME Group already has a strong presence in the Latin American country after forming a strategic partnership with the country’s exchange BM&FBovespa in 2008.ICE said on Tuesday it had formed its own partnership with Eike Batista, Brazil’s richest man, and other top executives to create BRIX, a new marketplace for electrical power contracts.“ICE was founded more than a decade ago to serve global energy markets, and we believe our history of providing transparency and market-based prices will bring important risk management tools to the Brazilian power industry,” said Charles Vice, president and chief operating officer.The electronic platform, which is set to open in June this year, follows an agreement with the country’s regulator last month to allow Brazilians access to ICE’s oil futures.At the same time, ICE is embroiled in a takeover battle in the US, where it has teamed up with Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange group, to take over the NYSE Euronext.ICE’s goal in that deal is also international expansion. In that proposal, in which ICE is contributing the majority of an $11.3bn bid, it would take control of Liffe, the UK-based European futures exchange.It would be ICE’s second big European deal, having acquired the International Petroleum Exchange in 2001, which was renamed ICE Futures Europe.Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE chief executive and former power trader himself, is a well-respected dealmaker, having built ICE into a formidable global exchange in just over a decade.Mr Sprecher and his counterpart at Nasdaq OMX, Robert Greifeld, have been reaching out to US shareholders of NYSE Euronext to convince them to back their deal, rather than NYSE’s proposed friendly tie-up with Deutsche Börse.Mr Sprecher told reporters in Brazil that his group had received a “great response” from NYSE shareholders and said he would “continue to talk to shareholders” as NYSE and DB hold their own talks.NYSE’s board rejected ICE and Nasdaq’s bid on Sunday. NYSE and DB believe their combined group, which would be the world’s largest exchange group, would be in a leading position to partner with exchanges in fast-growing markets like Brazil and Hong Kong.Trading groups and brokerages in the US and Europe are increasingly turning their attention to markets such as Brazil as opportunities compress in developed markets.Additional reporting from Reuters
417;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-11T20:47:43Z;Wall St energy shares hit by growth report;;News that Endo Pharmaceuticals was acquiring American Medical Systems helped lift the healthcare sector, but the wider markets lost ground, led by commodity stocks after the International Monetary Fund cut its growth forecasts for the US and Japan.The S&P healthcare sector saw the strongest gains on Wall Street, rising 0.5 per cent, after Endo announced a $2.6bn acquisition for AMS, a maker of medical devices. The deal is set to close in the third quarter of this year and is expected to create $50m in synergies by 2013.Shares in Endo rose 0.5 per cent to $41.06, falling back in late trading from earlier 5 per cent gains, while AMS shares surged 32.1 per cent to $29.50. Elsewhere in the sector, Biogen was up 7.2 per cent to $78.55 after a successful trial for its multiple sclerosis treatment while Forest Laboratories added 4.1 per cent to $34.21.But in the wider markets, the S&P 500 index lost 0.3 per cent to 1,324.46, adding to the 0.4 per cent losses on Friday. The energy sector saw the sharpest losses following the IMF report which reduced its forecast for US growth in 2011 to 2.8 per cent from 3 per cent.Cameron International, the oilfield services company, was down 3.5 per cent to $53.54 as oil prices lost ground while Baker Hughes lost 3.2 per cent to $69.31. The S&P energy sector was down 1.9 per cent.The material sectors also saw strong losses with Freeport-McMoRan, the copper producer, falling 3.1 per cent to $55.44 and Consol Energy, the coal miner, losing 4.2 per cent to $50.34.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed flat in the session at 12,381.11 while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.3 per cent at 2,771.51.Before the IMF report the markets were slightly higher with traders looking optimistically towards the upcoming earnings season. Over the next few weeks almost two-thirds of the companies in the S&P 500 will report their first-quarter earnings.“We look set to have a very healthy earnings season,” said Kate Warne, market strategist at Edward Jones. “Although I think that there will likely be fewer earnings surprises than in recent quarters.”Analysts are expecting that stocks on the S&P 500 will see earnings per share growth of 11 per cent in the first quarter from the same period a year ago, according to Bloomberg data. This is a significantly slower growth rate than the 36 per cent jump in the fourth quarter of 2010, but the growth is coming from a higher base.Alcoa, the aluminium producer, reported earnings that topped analysts forecasts after the closing bell on Monday.The company reported earnings excluding restructuring costs and other one-time items of 28 cents a share, topping the 27 cents expected by analysts. The stock was down 0.8 per cent to $17.77 ahead of the result.This week will also see earnings reports by JPMorgan Chase on Wednesday and Google on Thursday.There was more deal activity in the telecommunications sector. Level 3 Communications, the internet video and communications network operator, said it had agreed to acquire Global Crossing, the IP solutions provider, in an all-stock offer valued at roughly $1.9bn.The news sent shares in Level 3 up 18.1 per cent to $1.70 and Global Crossing up 68.7 per cent to $24.97.In other deal news, Tyco International jumped 3.3 per cent to $48.72 following unconfirmed reports that Schneider Electric was weighing up a takeover offer for the maker of security systems.Shares in NYSE Euronext, the largest exchange operator in the US, lost ground after its board unanimously voted on Sunday to reject the offer from Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange, which was intended to break up the planned merger with Deutsche Börse.In a statement, the NYSE Euronext board said the deal with Deutsche Börse would “create substantially more long-term value for shareholders, and is significantly more likely to close”.Shares in NYSE lost 2.9 per cent to $37.59. Nasdaq fell 1.5 per cent to $28.03.Viasystems Group, the electronics manufacturer, was down 2.7 per cent to $25 after saying that it expected “minor impacts” from the Japanese earthquake on the flow of supplies.Monsanto, which reported disappointing results last week, was up 1.4 per cent to $67.17 after the seed producer was upgraded by Deutsche Bank to “buy” from “hold”.
418;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-11T18:53:19Z;Exchange chiefs mount defence of planned deal;;The chief executives of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse are presenting shareholders with a defence of their proposed tie-up to fend off interest in a rival, higher bid to break-up the deal by Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange.Following the NYSE Euronext board rejection on Sunday of the joint Nasdaq-ICE $11.3bn cash and share bid for the company – versus the $9.7bn value of the Börse all-share offer for NYSE – Duncan Niederauer, chief of NYSE Euronext, and Reto Francioni, Deutsche Börse chief, plan to meet shareholders. This was difficult to do before the board’s decision, Mr Niederauer told CNBC.Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, and Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, have already been meeting shareholders. The rival bidders said on Sunday that they would step up their outreach to shareholders.Mr Greifeld said in a statement: “The feedback we have received from NYSE Euronext stockholders is very positive, and we would expect NYSE Euronext would, at the very least, meet with us and our advisors to discuss the merits of the proposed combination.”Nasdaq and ICE have touted the superior price and cost and revenue synergies from their deal, according to people familiar with the talks. Nasdaq would combine with the NYSE and Euronext stock markets, while ICE would take Liffe, the UK futures exchange owned by NYSE Euronext. Some shareholders have said they have a duty to consider Nasdaq and ICE’s larger offer. One portfolio manager at a large institution said he was disappointed at the NYSE Euronext board’s rebuff. “For better or for worse, we are charged by our investors to look for the best price,” this person said.One person said that ICE had also touted some $200m spare capacity in an authorised share buy-back, which could boost the value of its shares as an acquisition currency. A source close to ICE said the option existed, but it was not being considered.The NYSE board did not have a fiduciary duty to consider the higher offer, because the Börse-NYSE tie up is an all-share deal and termed a “merger of equals”, not a “sale of the company”. Only the latter would legally bind the board to consider other offers.In contrast to Mr Greifeld and Mr Sprecher’s tandem approach, Mr Niederauer and Mr Francioni were not in contact over the weekend. Mr Niederauer told CNBC that “we need to get better, particularly on [the Börse] side, at telling this great story that we’ve got to tell”.Mr Niederauer and Mr Francioni, who at this point are not expected to raise their bid, will argue that they can achieve greater cost savings than previously promised. Nasdaq-ICE said it could achieve savings of $710m, versus $426m outlined by Deutsche Börse-NYSE, which Mr Niederauer has called “conservative”.These people said that Nasdaq and ICE touted their history of creating merger synergies and raised questions about Börse and NYSE’s records.A dip in NYSE Euronext shares suggested traders had downgraded the likelihood of the rival bid succeeding. The shares fell 1.9 per cent on Monday, to $37.96, their lowest since the rival offer was unveiled.Additional reporting by Jeremy Grant in London and James Wilson in Frankfurt
419;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-11T13:46:44Z;Quick View: Discord between DB and NYSE?;Germany has much to learn when trying to sell a deal;If you don’t tell, you don’t sell.It’s an age-old saying but could this be an Achilles Heel in the proposed NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse combination’s sales pitch in the last week or so?This morning Duncan Niederauer, NYSE Euronext chief executive, was pretty open on CNBC in admitting that the two exchanges had a job of work to do in selling the story of their deal to shareholders.Here’s what he said: “I think we have a collective job to do that we haven’t been able to do for the last 10 days.” The last 10 days have been taken up by the emergence of a counter offer for NYSE Euronext from Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), and the NYSE board’s assessment of it which culminated in a rejection on Sunday.But here’s the really interesting bit. Mr Niederauer – in a clear reference to his counterpart Reto Francioni, Deutsche Börse chief executive – said: “We need to get better, particularly on your side, at telling this great story that we’ve got to tell.”It doesn’t sound to me that the New Yorkers feel that their German friends are doing a good enough job of selling this deal.For the past 10 days, the NYSE Euronext people have been in lock-down mode, unable to say much in public as the board has deliberated. But Deutsche Börse wasn’t constrained and could – should, it seems to me – have stepped up to the plate.We are dealing with two different cultures here. Deutsche Börse and its top executives are not known as the most open and communicative – at least on the media air waves. That’s not uncommon among German companies, which are still only now realising that investor relations is not always enough when it comes to communicating with shareholders. Media relations is often just as important since it’s another channel through to your shareholders.Contrast this with Mr Niederauer and his colleagues. They are (by and large) accessible and vocal and rarely miss a chance to talk up the NYSE’s business.Deutsche Börse did a miserable sales job back in 2002/03 when it was trying to persuade traders to use Eurex US, its (ultimately failed) Chicago-based futures exchange. Selling a business proposition is Job One in America. They do it very well over there.Case in point: the slide presentation that Nasdaq OMX and ICE made when they unveiled their deal. The sales pitch wasn’t a home run, but it hit quite a few bullseyes. And you wouldn’t put many exchange executives up against Bob Greifeld and Jeff Sprecher on the sales front (except Mr Niederauer, to whom it comes naturally, as well as his chief operating officer Larry Leibowitz).I understand Deutsche Börse last week hired top New York communications firm Joele Frank, Wilkinson Brimmer Katcher to help make its case in the US. And Mr Francioni is jetting to New York today and will be joining Mr Niederauer on a sales pitch.Better to get this right now, than have it part of a post-mortem when it’s all over.
420;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-10T23:09:25Z;NYSE chief defends merger plan with D Börse;;"Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext and potential chief of a combined NYSE-Deutsche Börse exchange group, on Sunday defended his deal from an attack by arch-rival Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange.Nasdaq and ICE have proposed a richer cash-and-stock takeover of NYSE, potentially breaking up the friendly all-stock combination that Mr Niederauer has agreed with his counterpart at Deutsche Börse, Reto Francioni.The NYSE board rejected that offer on Sunday, which would involve splitting the New York Stock Exchange from the Paris-based Euronext exchange and Liffe, the UK futures exchange owned by Euronext. Nasdaq would take NYSE and Euronext, and ICE would take Liffe.“The only factor that matters is that the proposal that we received would require us to dismantle the company. We felt that was a strategic mistake, and not in the best interest of shareholders,” Mr Niederauer told the FT.“We went through an exhaustive analysis to make sure we’re comfortable with the strategy, and we are, and the Deutsche Börse merger is consistent with that,” he said.There is much at stake for Mr Niederauer, who left Goldman Sachs to join NYSE Euronext, taking the top job in 2007. In the DB-NYSE deal he would stand to run the world’s largest exchange group; he would likely lose his role to Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq chief, if the rival bid succeeded.The Nasdaq-ICE group has been aggressive in arguing that its deal would save more money by combining like-for-like exchanges, $710m versus $426m in proposed savings by DB-NYSE. Mr Greifeld has argued that the NYSE-Euronext merger itself was poorly executed, and suggests the DB-NYSE merger could similarly fail to deliver.Mr Niederauer, who inherited that deal from his predecessor John Thain, bristled at the suggestion. “We take a little bit of offence about …our record. We’re comfortable with how [our shareholder return] stacks up,” he said.“We’ve reduced expenses by hundreds of millions while investing in clearing, derivatives and data centres. It’s hard to get the facts out there, but hopefully facts will prevail,” he said. NYSE reported a $600m run rate of annual cost savings in 2010 versus 2007 levels.He also said that his group was “if anything conservative” in its projection of cost savings from a DB-NYSE tie-up.“We like being ‘under promise’ and ‘over deliver’. While we thought about this combination for quite some time, we did not think it was in our collective interest to do a deep dive, there was too much risk of leakage. We agreed we would sharpen our pencils after the announcement, and we are now in the process of doing that,” he said.Nasdaq has also proposed slashing costs significantly in the US by dismantling NYSE’s efforts to build data centres, which in the past were criticised by analysts for being too expensive and underutilised by customers, to build data centres in Mahwah, New Jersey, and Basildon, UK.Mr Niederauer said that would be a mistake: “Mahwah is fully subscribed, and Basildon is nearly fully subscribed. We’ve been able to put everything inside that ecosystem and more will come with the DB merger. Why you’d want to unwind that is unclear to me.” NYSE has said it projects $1bn in revenues in that business by 2015.Meanwhile, there is “no question” regulatory issues stand in the way of both deals, Mr Niederauer conceded, declining to offer a prediction of what regulators might say. European regulators have said they will look closely at Deutsche Börse and Liffe creating a near-monopoly in listed interest-rate futures trading and clearing.However, Mr Niederauer said that potential antitrust hurdles for his rivals’ bid in Europe – as Nasdaq would take the Paris-based Euronext exchange, and ICE would take UK’s Liffe – had been understated.“There’s some execution risk in Europe that’s being overlooked – national interest risk,” he said.“What you just saw in Australia was a perfectly reasonable decision by a policymaker”, he said, referring to Australian authorities’ decision to turn down the Australian Stock Exchange’s proposed merger with the Singapore Exchange.”“I think it shouldn’t be lost on us that two companies are walking in and going country by country and deciding which institution to take. It is not a routine discussion,” he said."
421;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-10T22:28:07Z;NYSE rejects Nasdaq’s joint bid;;The board of NYSE Euronext unanimously voted on Sunday to reject the offer from Nasdaq OMX and the IntercontinentalExchange to break up its planned merger with Deutsche Börse, setting the stage for a tough fight for control of the US’s largest stock markets.At the same time, Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext, promised additional cost savings in the Deutsche Börse-NYSE proposed all-stock deal, and Reto Francioni, chief of Deutsche Börse, suggested other European exchanges could be included in the deal.In a statement, the NYSE Euronext board said the deal with Deutsche Börse, which has been in the works for several years, would “create substantially more long-term value for shareholders, and is significantly more likely to close”.Mr Francioni, who would become chairman of the joint group, told Neue Zürcher Zeitung, Switzerland’s main daily newspaper, that it was possible the Swiss and Spanish exchanges could be included in the merged group.“The main principle of the combinations we’re working towards with NYSE Euronext is that each cash equities market stays independent,” Mr Francioni said.“One could also include Spain and Switzerland,” he added.Nasdaq OMX Group and IntercontinentalExchange responded late Sunday to NYSE Euronext’s rejection of their joint proposed bid by reaffirming that their cash and stock offer is superior to Deutsche Börse’s.“The feedback we have received from NYSE Euronext stockholders is very positive, and we would expect NYSE Euronext would, at the very least, meet with us and our advisers to discuss the merits of the proposed combination,” Robert Greifeld, chief executive officer of Nasdaq, said in the statement.NYSE Euronext’s decision, which was not unexpected, sets the stage for a protracted battle for the fate of the US’s largest stock exchanges. Nasdaq and ICE are prepared to press forward with a hostile bid if they deem it appropriate, according to people close to their thinking.It would create a dominant European futures exchange and combine three US options markets. Nasdaq has teamed up with ICE, a large US futures exchange, to offer NYSE Euronext $11.3bn in cash and shares, a 19 per cent premium to the value of the Deutsche Börse-NYSE deal. Nasdaq would take the stock markets and ICE would take Liffe, the UK futures market owned by NYSE Euronext.Nasdaq has said that it could offer that price because it would slash costs by $710m, versus $426m in proposed savings by NYSE-DB.Some large NYSE Euronext shareholders have said privately they wanted to consider the higher offer.But Mr Niederauer, due to stay as chief of the combined Deutsche Börse-NYSE entity but not in the Nasdaq-ICE deal, speaking to the Financial Times on Sunday said his group’s initial savings estimate was “if anything conservative”.“We agreed we would sharpen our pencils after the announcement, and we are now in the process of doing that,” he said. It also said it would avoid antitrust difficulties in Europe, and believes US regulators would have all-American ownership for the NYSE.Euronext is made up of the Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon exchanges. The Swiss exchange is owned by SIX Group, a holding company that jointly owns Eurex, Europe’s largest futures and options exchange by volume, with Deutsche Börse. It has ramped up efforts to attract so-called high-frequency traders and last month became the first exchange in the world to link up with Liquidnet, a US-based operator of “dark pool” block trading facilities.The Spanish exchange, Bolsas y Mercados Españoles, already has a business relationship with Deutsche Börse. Since December it has operated, with the Börse’s Clearstream settlement unit, a trade repository – or electronic data warehouse – for over-the-counter derivatives trades. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse have not so far said what their planned deal would mean for the ownership of Eurex, but the platform is set for a key role in the combined group, the bulk of whose revenues will come from derivatives and clearing.
422;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-08T15:26:10Z;Quick View: What next for SGX and ASX?;;It was more of a bloody nose than a slap in the face.The rejection on Friday by Wayne Swan, Australia’s treasurer, of SGX’s bid for ASX, the Australian exchange as a “no brainer” makes you wonder why Magnus Böcker, chief executive of the Singapore exchange and his ASX counterpart Bob Elstone, tried in the first place.Not only did Mr Swan express his outright opposition to the deal but it emerged that the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission had been against it too.The concern was allegedly over Australia’s inability to exercise full “regulatory sovereignty” over ASX. Crucially, Mr Swan highlighted not share and derivatives trading, but the post-trade infrastructure underneath that: clearing and settlement.What puzzles me is that the two exchanges answered about 100 questions from the Australian treasury before even submitting their application to the Foreign Investment Review Board.If clearing and settlement was such an issue surely this would have been evident from the barrage of questions they got. And surely if they were challenged on this, they addressed them, or at least tried to?In the meantime, what now for Mr Böcker? There is a lot of speculation out there about SGX turning from predator to prey.Unlikely. While SGX’s shares have fallen by12 per cent since the day before the ASX deal was unveiled, you have to doubt whether the Singapore government would allow this scenario to happen (especially given the national interest precedent that Canberra has set for all exchange mergers by its decision on Friday).A more likely outcome is that SGX hunts elsewhere. The obvious – on paper – combination is to join the London Stock Exchange-TMX Group tie up, adding the Asian time zone to the deal and creating what would be the first exchange spanning global time zones.There are obvious “Commonwealth” synergies: a common language (English), legal system and business culture. Xavier Rolet, LSE chief executive, has thought about the “Commonwealth” exchange construct before now, in fact. (Although if he was interested in doing a deal on Thursday that might have been hard as he was in Mongolia, signing a deal to help grow the Ulan Bator exchange). But I don’t see this necessarily as a given.I don’t see SGX going after Nasdaq OMX either. Yes, Mr Böcker was the key figure in the Nasdaq acquision of OMX, the Nordic exchange network and knows Nasdaq well. And yes, SGX and Nasdaq share the same technology.Washington politicians were remarkably relaxed about the prospect of a German exchange – Deutsche Börse – taking over the New York Stock Exchange. But I think SGX taking over Nasdaq would almost certainly not be received the same way.The fact is SGX doesn’t need to do anything straight away. In fact, I question why this deal was even contemplated in the first place because there is a lot that SGX and ASX could have achieved without actually doing a corporate transaction.A comparison with the CME Group in Chicago helps to explain why. The owner of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has stayed conspicuously aloof from the merger mania, preferring to get on with building cross-listings and distribution arrangements with other exchanges in Brazil, Malaysia, South Africa and South Korea.This week, a “south-to-north connection” linking CME with the MexDer derivatives exchange went live. The idea is to give Mexican investors access to US benchmark futures contracts on CME’s Globex platform, and US investors access to MexDer’s products. All that’s involved is the establishment of a new CME telecoms hub in Mexico City, which MexDer’s customers then connect to their trading platforms.No need for approval from the Mexican equivalent of the treasury or FIRB. No fat fees payable to M&A bankers either. And a key objective of exchange mergers is met: growing and aggregating liquidity at both venues.SGX has already done some of this. It is likely to do more. Others in the region are doing the same: this week the Bombay Stock Exchange signed a memorandum of understanding with the Osaka Securities Exchange to “develop opportunities” including (you guessed it) cross-licensing of indices.As for the ASX, the future looks pretty mixed. It can continue to grow but it faces competition from Chi-X, and the fragmentation of the Australian share market is only just beginning.In its favour I will say that, of all the national exchange incumbents that have faced similar headwinds – like the LSE – the ASX has reacted more nimbly, not waiting until competition starts. It has a pretty convincing roadmap: attract high-frequency traders, build a data centre, offer colocation, cut fees. It has also set some pretty high charges for any outsider wanting to use its clearing services.But medium- to long-term, it looks isolated and growth-constrained. Mr Elstone’s contract is up soon and ASX will be needing a new chief executive. Who knows, maybe they will turn to Mr Böcker? For him, that might not be a bad way of putting behind him what is undoubtedly the biggest setback of his career.
423;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-07T21:26:22Z;Börse tie to NYSE focuses cuts on Europe;;Europe would bear the brunt of €300m in cost cuts planned by NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse as the two exchanges revealed details of how their scheme to create the world’s largest bourse came about.In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the two groups revealed that Reto Francioni, chief executive of the German exchange, contacted his NYSE Euronext counterpart, Duncan Niederauer, in August last year to revive earlier merger talks that had stalled in 2008.The 894-page filing is the first detailed look at the deal since the two exchanges unveiled it three weeks ago.Under the terms of the proposed deal, each Deutsche Börse share would be exchanged for one share of the new company, and each share of NYSE Euronext share would be exchanged for 0.47 shares of the new company. That would leave the new company 60 per cent owned by Deutsche Börse shareholders and 40 per cent by NYSE Euronext investors.However the deal faces a joint counter-bid from Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), two rival US exchange operators.They have made NYSE Euronext shareholders a $11.3bn cash-and-shares offer that would see the New York Stock Exchange combined with Nasdaq and the NYSE Liffe futures exchange in London absorbed by ICE.Nasdaq and ICE claim they can achieve synergies of $740m by stripping out costs more aggressively than the German-US combination – in 18 months, compared with their rivals’ three-year time frame.In the filing, NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse said the biggest share of their synergies – €98m, or 32.5 per cent of the total – would come from savings in European cash markets and derivatives markets, and US equity options.That suggests the axe will fall at the Euronext network of exchanges in Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon, and on NYSE Liffe. Frankfurt, home to the Börse’s Eurex futures exchange, is set to benefit by becoming a global derivatives hub in the combined group.Removing “duplicative operations and planned operating expenses” in the two groups’ clearing businesses will deliver 22.5 per cent of the overall synergies. NYSE Liffe’s London-based clearing house looks set to be replaced as part of the “progressive introduction” of the Börse’s own clearing systems. The remaining synergies will come from technology – at 26 per cent of the total – and corporate operations.NYSE Euronext’s board has yet to respond to the offer made by Nasdaq-ICE offer but is expected to address it as early as next week.
424;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-07T20:30:09Z;Nasdaq plays cost-cutting card;;Nasdaq OMX believes that it has a significant advantage over its rivals in its attempt to win the favour of NYSE Euronext shareholders – a proven ability to cut costs.Nasdaq, which along with the IntercontinentalExchange bid $11.3bn for NYSE Euronext, believes that it can cut the costs of running NYSE by $710m by combining like-for-like US stock exchanges.NYSE and Deutsche Börse say their proposed tie-up would cut costs by $426m, primarily in European futures and clearing across the markets.Robert Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq, has used his reputation as a cost-cutter to suggest that his track record is superior to his rivals’.However, there are complexities that Nasdaq does not lay out for shareholders, sparking questions from analysts.Nasdaq said that it integrated electronic exchange Instinet’s trading platform, acquired in 2005, in just nine months.Today, the INET platform runs all of Nasdaq’s exchanges globally, including OMX Group, acquired in 2007, and is at the heart of a lucrative business selling the software to other exchanges.By contrast, Nasdaq claims its rival was never able to integrate the NYSE and Euronext trading platforms, and did not achieve the targeted savings, resulting in a $1.6bn impairment charge in late 2008.“Greifeld and Nasdaq’s acquisition record in terms of price discipline and implementation ability is about as good as it gets,” said Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James.But NYSE Euronext’s leadership has changed since its merger was agreed in 2007. Then-chief John Thain left to run Merrill Lynch, replaced by Duncan Niederauer, a trading executive at Goldman Sachs, and his top deputy, Larry Leibowitz, then head of Americas equities at UBS, who became chief operating officer.It would be “a stretch to say that Duncan and Larry are not good integrators,” said Jamie Selway, a market structure analyst and managing director at brokerage ITG.In their time running NYSE Euronext, they have acquired the American Stock Exchange and Nyfix, a trading technology group.Both of those deals achieved synergies on time, according to financial reports. The NYSE deals also reduced its expense base by $600m versus 2007.Nasdaq also faces a challenge of combining many stock exchanges – six separate licensed exchanges – and not losing significant market share to alternative venues. Deutsche Börse and NYSE, via its Liffe futures market, are at less risk of that because they maintain near-monopolies in individual futures products.When Nasdaq acquired Instinet, there were few alternatives to the NYSE-Nasdaq duopoly for stock trading.Since then, BATS Global Markets and Direct Edge, exchanges backed by broker-dealers, have arrived and taken about 25 per cent of the total market.“When Nasdaq says this deal will be accretive, the numbers assume they will hold on to a lot of market share. But why will this time be different?” said Diego Perfumo, an independent analyst at Equity Research Desk.Nasdaq will attempt to retain market share partly by keeping each marketplace separate, in order to retain differentiation. However, this is similar to NYSE and Euronext’s strategy of building a common engine while not combining the exchanges’ order books.“The advice ‘people in glass houses should not throw stones’ seems appropriate,” said Mr O’Shaughnessy.Nasdaq could additionally see revenues fall in other business which would undermine cost savings.Nasdaq rents space from third-party data centres, versus NYSE’s expensive effort to build their own data centres in the US and UK. Nasdaq says it could handle all the markets’ capacity at its own centre, cutting costs sharply. But it would need to argue that NYSE’s $1bn in projected revenues by 2015 from selling data services is not realistic.Nasdaq also has a lower cap on fees paid by issuers to list on its market, $99,500 in comparison with $500,000 at NYSE. Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill, says that lowering to Nasdaq’s rate could reduce revenues by $50m. “Listing fees would be an area Nasdaq would need to delicately handle,” he said.
425;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-06T17:24:31Z;Hint of Prada as Nasdaq sets out antitrust stall;;When Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq OMX’s chief executive, was making the case for his counterbid for the owner of New York’s “Big Board”, he turned to an Italian handbag maker for help.Prada may seem an unlikely ingredient in any business case for combining Nasdaq OMX’s cash equities and listings business with that of NYSE Euronext, which runs the New York Stock Exchange.But for Mr Greifeld, the Italian luxury goods house is a key strand in his argument that the proposed merger of the two businesses should not face any antitrust issues.Prada chose to launch an initial public offering not in its home market of Milan, but in Hong Kong, to tap surging investor demand for luxury goods companies in a part of the world where the market for upmarket bling is growing fast.Mr Greifeld argued that this was the sort of company the US should have fought to attract to its exchanges. Since 1995, global listings in the US have fallen from 8,000 to 5,000, while listings on non-US exchanges grew from 23,000 to 40,000, according to Bernstein Research.Yet, because New York is home to two main listings venues, Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, the US was unable to compete strongly enough to win back IPOs choosing places such as Hong Kong and London, he argued. “We have a fractured message coming out of the US. We need to be competitive for large IPOs that we are not currently competing for,” Mr Greifeld said.His point is that the listings business should be seen as a global, not purely domestic business. Many analysts acknowledge that combining Nasdaq and NYSE’s listings businesses will be the key antitrust issue in a Nasdaq-ICE counterbid for NYSE Euronext, unveiled last week as a spoiler for NYSE Euronext’s already agreed deal with Deutsche Börse.But overcoming that hurdle will depend on whether US regulators will see competition in the listings business as global or whether they take a narrower, US-centric view.A combination of NYSE and Nasdaq would bring the US into line with places such as Britain, where one exchange, the London Stock Exchange, competes for listings with New York and Hong Kong.The global market argument has also been used successfully in other antitrust cases. In one of the last big domestic exchange deals scrutinised by the US Department of Justice, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s 2007 acquisition of the Chicago Board of Trade, the existence of global rivals to the combined group was one argument put forward by the CME.Yet with Nasdaq-NYSE, the antitrust issue is more nuanced and breaks new ground, some lawyers say.That is because most American companies considering an IPO are unlikely to look globally. They will want a choice of listings venues in the US, which would be removed if NYSE and Nasdaq combined.David Balto, a senior fellow at American Progress and an antitrust lawyer, says: “There are some aspects of competition which are clearly global, but the question is if you are a new American company doing an IPO and issuing stock, are there really significant alternatives?”Stephen Axinn, senior partner at Axinn Veltrop & Harkrider, a law firm, says: “The competition for domestic listings is the relevant issue.”In testimony to a congressional antitrust hearing last week, Larry Harris, professor of finance at the University of California, said a combined NYSE/Nasdaq “could have substantial pricing power in the listing business”. “Such concentration also could reduce innovation in listing standards, which might not be in the public interest,” he said.Other lawyers argue that US antitrust regulators typically are less interested in how a market is defined than whether customers are being offered fair prices. One said: “The question of reducing choice is not generally considered to be a value in and of itself that the antitrust laws protect. They protect the price and quality of the service.”Nasdaq argues that the listings business is already overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which must approve any changes to the fees charged by NYSE or Nasdaq for listings. That would limit the ability of a combined entity to charge monopoly-style rent, it argues.Moreover, Nasdaq is considering maintaining separate branding for the two listings platforms and keeping a two-tier pricing structure, people familiar with the matter say. Last month, BATS Global Markets, a smaller rival, said it planned to offer listings, in competition.The issue is likely to provoke heated debate in the US in coming weeks. Evan Stewart, managing partner in the New York office of law firm Zuckerman Spaeder, says: “I don’t think either side is taking a cut and dried view of this and there are lots of imponderables. Anyone who thinks these [exchanges] deals are going to get a pass in Europe and automatically get a pass from the American antitrust regulators doesn’t understand these issues very well.”Additional reporting by Matthew Kennard in Washington
426;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-05T20:53:51Z;Wall Street flat after Fed minutes;;The technology sector was in focus after Texas Instruments said it would buy National Semiconductor and Nasdaq OMX unveiled plans to rebalance the Nasdaq 100 index, helping the wider markets to tick higher for another day.The semiconductor sector was given a boost after Texas Instruments, the chipmaker, announced its biggest deal in more than a decade, with a $6.5bn all-cash agreed offer for National Semiconductor.The news sent shares in National Semiconductor up 71 per cent at $24.06 while Texas Instruments added 1.7 per cent to $34.69.Elsewhere in the sector, STMicroelectronics was up 2.7 per cent to $12.75 while Avago Technologies rose 3.5 per cent to $31.67. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index gained 2.3 per cent on the news.The wider technology sector was stirred by news that Nasdaq OMX Group was planning to rebalance the weightings on its Nasdaq 100 index for the first time since 1998.Microsoft, Intel and Cisco Systems were all up after it was announced that their weightings on the Nasdaq 100 would more than double when the changes come into effect on March 2.Microsoft advanced 0.9 per cent to $25.78 while Intel was up 1.1 per cent to $19.71 as fund managers buying the Nasdaq 100 will now have to increase their position in these companies. Cisco Systems, the network equipment maker, 0.9 per cent to $17.22.The biggest loser from the rebalancing was Apple, which will see its weighting in the index decline from more than 20 per cent to just over 12 per cent. It lost 0.7 per cent to $338.89.Elsewhere in the sector, Google was down 3.2 per cent to $569.09 after reports from Bloomberg that the US Federal Trade Commission is considering launching an antitrust investigation into the company’s dominance of the internet search industry. Overall, the S&P technology index was down 0.1 per cent.In the wider markets the S&P 500 was flat at 1,332.63, falling back from slight gains earlier in the session after the minutes of the most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting were released.The minutes held no surprises, but it did show that the Federal Reserve will not taper off its current $600bn round of asset purchases as they come to an end in June, but just bring the programme to a halt.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost less than 0.1 per cent to 12,393.90 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.1 per cent to 2,791.19.Sentiment in the wider markets was not helped by news that the US service sector has grown by less than expected in March, according to the Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-manufacturing activity.The index showed a reading of 57.3, down from 59.7 in February and short of the 59.5 expected. However, a reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector so the news was not terrible.Traders were also waiting apprehensively for the minutes of the most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting.The S&P 500 is now up 6 per cent in the past three weeks, bouncing back from the 6.4 per cent losses sustained following the onset of turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East.The index is still 0.8 per cent down from the mid-February high for the S&P before the geopolitical tensions began to affect the markets.The recent gains have occurred in very low volume trading, as some investors have decided to wait on the sidelines for geopolitical tensions to recede.March saw the lightest trading volumes on S&P 500 stocks since December 1999, according to data from LPL Financial Research.On Tuesday, the materials sector saw the strongest gains, with investors shaking off news that China had raised interest rates by 0.25 percentage points.Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, advanced 1.5 per cent to $56.61 while AK Steel added 3.6 per cent to $16.54. The S&P materials sector rose 1.1 per cent.Shares in Procter & Gamble were in focus after the world’s largest consumer goods company made its final exit from the food sector, selling its Pringles potato chip business to Diamond Foods for $2.35bn.The move sent shares in P&G down 1 per cent to $61.67, but shares in Diamond Foods rose 6.7 per cent to $61.06.Homebuilders lost ground after KB Home reported a 25 per cent decline in revenue in the first quarter. Shares in the Los Angeles housebuilder retreated 4.2 per cent to $11.69.Elsewhere in the sector, DR Horton declined 1.8 per cent to $11.26 while Beazer Homes slid 2.6 per cent to $4.51.Expedia, the online travel reservation company, was up 1.3 per cent to $22.72 after resolving a dispute with American Airlines which will allow it to resume selling the carrier’s tickets.
427;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-05T10:15:35Z;Schneller Blick: Frankfurt patient on NYSE prize;;Nasdaq and ICE’s interest in taking over NYSE Euronext is of course a potentially big complication for Deutsche Börse’s own plans to merge with NYSE. But anyone expecting the US partners’ proposed counter-bid to trigger an urgent reaction in Frankfurt got it wrong.Sure, the German group knows it is in a fight and may have to raise its offer along the road. But Deutsche Börse shows no sign of rushing to show its hand.At one level this is obviously appropriate: after all, the Nasdaq/ICE pitch is to NYSE Euronext investors, so it is up to that company to respond first, beyond Deutsche Börse’s bland statement that it believes its bid is still the best.But Deutsche Börse also hopes time will do it a favour by allowing investors and rating agencies to turn their attention to the weaker financial standing of the Nasdaq/ICE bid and chip away at some of its mooted merits.One of the private reactions from the Frankfurt side is that Nasdaq looks financially stretched. Nasdaq promises greater extra synergies – about $610m in cost savings – but says these will only be meaningfully accretive to earnings from 2013.And of course, as people on the German side also point out, Nasdaq/ICE have done no due diligence on NYSE – which is well under way in talks with Deutsche Börse. “Our bid is not just two guys on a video screen,” is how one person in Frankfurt puts it.The Nasdaq and ICE proposal admittedly creates a large US exchange operator. But Deutsche Börse is trying to make sure one question hangs in the air: does it give the NYSE the international presence that a combination with Deutsche Börse would?Nor does Deutsche Börse expect the Nasdaq and ICE proposal – which has wrapped itself in the Stars and Stripes to emphasise the advantages for the US – to get such a free ride in its home turf.After all, people in Frankfurt reason, synergies from the Nasdaq and ICE plans would mean significant job losses in New York, while corporate America – and anti-trust authorities – might prefer the US to maintain more than one significant stock listing venue. And the Nasdaq/ICE deal would amount to a break-up of NYSE: hardly the treatment that many influential US voices might prefer for the “iconic” institution.Some of this logic has valid counter-arguments, of course – including the view, aired here a couple of days ago, that US equities trading is still nowhere near a level to worry anti-trust authorities. And Deutsche Börse’s plans for NYSE Euronext face their own considerable anti-trust hurdles at the level of derivatives markets in Europe.But so far the message in Frankfurt is that there is no need to deviate from merger plans, which have been presented as a delicately weighted balance between Deutsche Börse and NYSE that give shareholders of the German group 60 per cent of the new company.Significantly altering that balance, perhaps by adding a cash component to Deutsche Börse’s offer, may not be easy and is not being considered at this stage, a person close to the company says.But one thing the German group could consider doing in conjunction with NYSE Euronext is revising its estimates of the cost synergies to be obtained from the deal. Some analysts have said they think the original €300m estimate is conservative – potentially giving the Germans some wiggle room if they want to find a little more for investors.Deutsche Börse is due a break-up fee of €250m/$340m if the NYSE deal does not go ahead – which people familiar with the German group hope will also persuade NYSE investors that the 19 per cent premium offered by Nasdaq and ICE is less attractive than billed.All in all, the prevailing view from Frankfurt is that the Nasdaq/ICE attention is not a crisis but a complication – and there are still plenty of them to come.Reto Francioni, Deutsche Börse’s chief executive, has said in other contexts that creating volume in some of his group’s businesses is “a marathon, not a sprint”. So it will also be with his attempted transatlantic merger.
428;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-05T09:26:53Z;Quick View: What next for Singapore and the ASX?;;Five months ago SGX kicked off the current wave of global exchange consolidation by unveiling a merger with ASX, its Australian counterpart.But on Tuesday the deal was effectively killed by federal treasurer Wayne Swan. He said he was “disposed” to rule that it was not in the country’s national interest. Although he said this was not his final decision, that’s more or less it.This is a bit of a shocker on two counts, even though the deal had run into political opposition the moment it was unveiled last October, and clearly had stoked national interest concerns.The last time a big deal was blocked in Australia was as far back as 2001 when Shell was trying to take over Woodside Petroleum.Second, the timing. It comes a week before the country’s Foreign Investment Review Board was due to make a decision under a statutory deadline timetable of 30 days. It’s unusual that a decision would be made before that deadline. There was even a further 90-day period baked into the process that won’t come into play either.The feeling in Canberra is that with so much on his plate, including a looming budget, Mr Swan felt he needed to decide this thing quickly and get it out of the way.The temptation will also be there to see this as a somewhat populist move. After all, the proposed SGX-ASX deal marked the first time that one country’s exchange was proposing to take over another country’s (aside from the Nasdaq takeover of OMX, the Nordic network of bourses, and the Vienna exchange’s purchase of Budapest and Ljubljana).So, what next? There are at least two implications for ASX.First, it puts the ASX back in play as exchange consolidation continues. Packs of bankers are roaming the globe trying to persuade exchange chief executives that they can not be left out of this game and need to do deals.The obvious play is to become part of the London Stock Exchange’s proposed merger with TMX Group of Canada, operator of the Toronto and Montreal bourses. That deal is a play on natural resources and mining listings, in which the two exchanges are world leaders. ASX is strong there too. And all three exchanges are in Commonwealth countries – same language, legal system. That’s compelling.But a deal would be hard given that Canberra’s already signalled it wants ASX to stay independent.Second, now that ASX looks set to stay independent, its shareholders will have to realise that it will never again be valued this highly. Its shares were at A$41.75 at their peak the day after the SGX deal was announced. It is a measure of the effect of political doubts that they have slumped back some way below where they were the day before the SGX deal was unveiled. ASX shares closed on Tuesday at A$33.70 compared to the A$34.96 they traded at before the SGX approach became public.At the same time, the ASX is about to feel the cold blast of competition in share trading as new entrants – like Chi-X - establish a beachhead for the first time in Australia. The ASX has done a good job of preparing itself for competition.But consider this scenario, suggested by Niki Beattie of Market Structure Partners, a London-based consultancy: what happens if a small privately owned trading platform like Chi-X takes a 30 per cent market share and then sells out to an Asian exchange. How does the Australian government react?At least with SGX the ASX had a strong partner that would have helped it grow in Asia and compete better at home.Both exchanges said they would continue to explore ways to co-operate. I think that even without a corporate merger, there is plenty that SGX chief executive Magnus Böcker and his ASX counterpart, Bob Elstone, can still do.Mr Böcker told me a few weeks ago at a Florida conference that this was “an opportunity-driven merger”, not driven by any regulatory changes. Both exchanges could still grow without merging, but could grow even faster together. If the deal didn’t work, they could still explore cross-listing of products, and shared distribution.Finally, back to the London Stock Exchange and TMX Group. They will be watching this very closely as their deal also faces a “national interest” test in Canada.On Monday an Ontario legislative committee investigating the LSE-TMX deal delayed publication of its report, which had been due to by Thursday. The committee’s findings are likely to play an influential role in decisions by the federal and Ontario government on whether to allow the deal to go forward. Under the Investment Canada Act, the LSE and TMX must show that the deal provides a “net benefit” to Canada.The lesson for all these exchange M&A deals is that no matter how much due diligence you do with your advisers on likely regulatory obstacles, it is almost impossible to predict and plan for political opposition.It will be interesting to see if this starts to infect the even bigger deals out there: Nasdaq OMX’s proposed joint counterbid with IntercontinentalExchange for NYSE Euronext, for one.
429;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-05T00:21:24Z;Nasdaq sets date for alpha options launch;;Nasdaq OMX is to launch a new type of options contracts this month that will allow investors to take a position on the performance of popular individual stocks relative to the wider market.The “alpha index” options, which are being launched on April 18, measure the outperformance or underperformance of individual stocks versus the general market and converts the difference into an index value.Nasdaq is hoping to attract interest in the product from both retail and institutional investors, which currently trade an over-the-counter version of the contract, or construct a similar position by buying combinations of listed options.Nasdaq OMX, which operates two of the US’s nine options-trading platforms, sees alpha contracts as one way to gain market share in the fiercely competitive US options market.“This gives you the value of Apple, for example, as Apple, as opposed to the value of Apple as the rest of the market moves around,” explained Eric Noll, executive vice-president of transaction services at Nasdaq OMX.“It will allow you to make an investment decision unrelated to the overall market,” Mr Noll said. “If my stock goes down 10 per cent and the overall market goes down 15 per cent, I’d still lose money. But with this product I would make money. Of course, the reverse is true – the stock could rise slower than the overall market.”Robert Whaley, a professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville who designed the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s widely watched Volatility Index or “Vix”, is one of the new creators of the new contract.The idea received regulatory approval last year and will launch based on the performance of 19 individual stocks – including Apple, Cisco, GE, Oracle, Google and Amazon – relative to the S&P 500 index.Mr Noll said the product could also be expanded to the performance of oil and gold relative to the S&P 500, while Mr Whaley has suggested it could also be used to track Treasury bonds and emerging market indices against the S&P 500, or individual stocks against their sector’s exchange-traded funds.Susquehanna, International Group, Wolverine and Citadel have agreed to be market makers for alpha options.
430;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-04T18:16:06Z;M&A: careful on the financing;Highly leveraged deals not in vogue;Yes to deals, but careful on the financing. That is a reasonable summary of the recent trends in mergers and acquisitions. In the first quarter of 2011, announced cash-only deals accounted for 53 per cent of the total deal value, the lowest proportion since 2001, according to Mergermarket. Whether or not shares are a good deal, cheap financing is not encouraging highly leveraged deals.Consider NYSE-Euronext. It agreed to an all-stock deal from Deutsche Börse and is considering a 66 per cent stock deal from Nasdaq and ICE. Cash is not king. Monday’s big deals may look different. Solvay for Rhodia (€3.4bn), Vivendi to Vodafone (€8bn) and Minmetals for Equinox (C$6.3bn) were all cash offers. But these deals are not efforts to stretch balance sheets.Solvay is just trying to improve a painfully flabby financial structure. The Belgian chemicals maker has €2.9bn of net cash (€5.7bn gross), but paid €146m of net interest expense in 2010 (23 per cent of operating profit), thanks to a 5.1 per cent interest rate on €2.8bn of debt. Even at a 44 per cent premium share price, French Rhodia will bring a better return than cash. Its product diversification, emerging markets exposure, greenhouse gas emission rights and synergies are also welcome.Vivendi’s acquisition of the minority interests in a French mobile phone partnership is more financially aggressive, as the company starts with €3.9bn of net debt. But more than half of the deal is funded by the €5.8bn sale of its stake in NBC-Universal. The company is determined to keep its triple B rating.And Minmetals? Equinox might stretch the balance sheet of the Hong Kong company making the actual offer. The ultimate backer, though, is the Chinese government, which has more low-yielding foreign cash than it knows what to do with.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
431;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-04T13:44:32Z;Turquoise and EuroCCP plan Spanish price cuts;;Turquoise, the European share trading platform, and EuroCCP, a European equities clearing house, setting the stage for a price war in the Spanish market as reforms remove long-standing obstacles to competition in the market.The two companies will build on recent domestic reforms, known as Title V, that simplify the regulations governing trading and settlement of securities not conducted on the national exchange.The changes are expected to reduce the costs of trading Spanish equities and open the market to foreign institutional investors and “high-frequency” traders three years after the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid) was enacted.Spain has remained largely insulated from competition that was unleashed by the directive. Previously trades had to be registered on Iberclear, the Spanish central securities depository owned by Spain’s national stock exchange, Bolsas y Mercados Españoles (BME). The arrangement has so far helped protect BME, which has a 98 per cent market share.The changes mean that investors no longer have to input a trade into the exchange’s system in order for it to be cleared. It removes the requirement for clearing houses such as EuroCCP to cross positions on the local exchange with a local broker. However industry observers say the reforms are another step towards a level playing field, rather than a profound shift in the market.EuroCCP said the changes would allow it to cut settlement fees for Spanish securities from €2.42 to €1, and for clearing fees to fall from €0.07 per side to €0.03 per side, up to 100,000 sides on a participant’s average daily volume.Turquoise, controlled by the London Stock Exchange, will also offer investors a three month pricing promotion to attract investor to trade Spanish stocks by cutting prices on its “maker-taker” model. Trading firms get paid rebates for “making” liquidity and customers are charged for “taking” liquidity.The “taker” fee will be reduced from 0.3 basis points to zero, while the “maker” rebate will be unchanged at 0.2 basis points. The promotion will last for three months or until a business does €100m worth’ of trades in a day.The move marks EuroCCP’s second incursion into the Spanish market after it agreed to provide clearing for Plataforma Alternativa de Valores Españoles (Pave) , a start-up Spanish alternative trading platform.“Spain is home to some of the most liquid stocks in Europe but Spain’s post-trade infrastructure rules have, to date, prevented the evolution of the type of competitive markets that have helped drive transaction volumes in other parts of Europe,” Diana Chan, chief executive of EuroCCP. “The Title V reforms, coupled with other initiatives currently under discussion, should help address this anomaly, resulting in more competition and increased liquidity for Spanish stocks.”EuroCCP is the European clearing subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC). It has struggled to attract clients as European Multilateral Clearing Facility, owned by Dutch government-backed ABN Amro and Nasdaq OMX, has taken the lion’s share of clearing business in the wake of Mifid.
432;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-03T20:38:59Z;Investors in NYSE face deal choices;;Shareholders in the NYSE Euronext have – potentially – an interesting decision to make.The $11.3bn counterbid by Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange for the NYSE offers investors a premium of about 19 per cent, based on Thursday’s stock prices, to the deal agreed with Deutsche Börse in February.But where New York’s tie-up with Frankfurt promised global scale, emerging markets exposure and a strong presence in derivatives, Nasdaq and ICE are instead asking shareholders to plump for old-fashioned consolidation, based around cost-cutting and management teams with a track record in delivering promised savings.Nasdaq and ICE’s spoiler bid includes the highly unusual feature of offering stock in two companies. As well as limiting the debt required, shareholders are being offered ongoing exposure to both the fiercely competitive cash equities business and a company focused on higher-margin derivatives trading.As well as about a third of the consideration in cash, investors get a stake in what feels like the past and the future of the exchanges industry.The first decision, however, falls to NYSE’s board. It must determine whether Nasdaq’s offer might lead to a “superior” proposal compared with the Deutsche Börse deal.That is not a choice purely based on value. NYSE’s team must also consider the relative risks of the two proposals, including the likelihood of antitrust problems. Deutsche Börse’s deal faces European resistance to combining the German group’s Eurex derivatives business with NYSE’s Liffe platform, while Nasdaq must justify putting together the two largest US listings venues.In addition, the fact that the Deutsche Börse deal was billed as an all-stock merger gives NYSE some additional flexibility under US law. The group has not – officially at least – committed to a sale and therefore is not yet obliged simply to find the highest price.Privately, NYSE’s camp concedes that Nasdaq’s proposal is one they must seriously consider. Aside from the higher price, Nasdaq and ICE say they have identified about $800m in total cost savings – double what the German exchange had laid out.Deutsche Börse will also be considering its next steps. Assuming NYSE bites, allowing Nasdaq and ICE access to the company’s private information, the German group faces a strategic quandary, argue some advisers.Bridging the gap between its proposal and the Nasdaq’s will be tough using only stock. On Friday, Deutsche Börse’s share price fell 1.38 per cent, aptly demonstrating how its own investor base might diminish its firepower.Adding cash to its offer – which the company has capacity to do – would risk upsetting the delicately constructed story around the NYSE deal, with its balanced board and dual headquarters. The deal would start to more clearly resemble a takeover of the US exchange by a foreign bidder.Should Deutsche Börse fight for NYSE, it has certain advantages. Under the terms of its deal, it has the right to match a competing proposal before NYSE’s board changes its recommendation and can demand that its deal is put to shareholders. It is also due a $340m fee if the deal does not go ahead.However, people close to the company argue that the German group may choose not to go into battle. While Deutsche Börse’s target for $400m in cost synergies was conservative, they add, the company probably cannot promise the $610m, before savings passed on to customers, that Nasdaq thinks it can achieve, with an extra $200m on offer from ICE.Given its rivals’ ambitious goal, the German group could let them take on the messy business of disentangling NYSE’s operations, instead looking for opportunities elsewhere.Turning to Asia is one possibility, where Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, after a long period of isolationism, is exploring its international options.Politicians, too, have thinking to do. While the Deutsche Börse deal caused some angst in Washington, a Nasdaq/NYSE combination is likely to involve more job losses than the German proposal – something the interlopers have thus far declined to elucidate.Charles Schumer, the Democratic senator for New York, on Friday expressed concern about job losses for the city. Nasdaq’s all-American solution still faces a long road to success.Additional reporting by James Wilson
433;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-02T03:33:06Z;Bold move by Nasdaq and ICE;;When the wave of exchanges mergers reached a peak of intensity five weeks ago with Germany’s Deutsche Börse proposing to merge with the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, Robert Greifeld quickly reached for the phone.The chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, rival to the NYSE Euronext, wanted to suggest making a counterbid with Jeff Sprecher, his counterpart at IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), a big US exchange.To many, his call may have seemed a long shot. The German-US combination would create the largest bourse in the world by most measures. Nasdaq is ninth-largest by its own market capitalisation, smaller even than the exchange in Singapore.Mr Greifeld admitted on Friday: “There was an air of disbelief and we certainly saw it as an opportunity that we had not anticipated.” But he and Mr Sprecher teamed up in brassy bid to break up the larger deal.Essentially, the two men are making a string of big bets. The first is that their proposal – which will not involve the two companies merging – will skirt a knotty antitrust issue that their rivals now face. Deutsche Börse and NYSE propose to combine their Eurex and Liffe derivatives platforms in Europe, creating a near-monopoly in these high-margin financial products. Brussels has already signalled a long and deep probe.But in a coup for Mr Sprecher, ICE would grab the Liffe business. That would give ICE a substantial presence in European derivatives and in the US at a time when expected interest rate rises are likely to drive volumes in key interest rate derivatives that are Liffe’s biggest contracts.Sang Lee, managing partner at Aite Group, a consultancy, said: “In my mind ICE looks the potential winner as it gives them an instant entry to derivatives outside the US. Liffe is not a small piece of the puzzle, it puts them on a par versus CME and Eurex.”Crucially, however, this would also maintain Liffe as an independent competitor for Eurex – neutralising the antitrust issue.London would benefit since the Liffe business looks set to be demoted under the German-US deal, where much of its operations could move to Frankfurt, designated the combined group’s global derivatives business hub.At the same time, New York’s position as a leading global listings venue would be strengthened by the proposed combination of Nasdaq and NYSE’s US share trading venues, of which the flagship is the New York Stock Exchange.Mr Greifeld would not say what jobs would be lost as a result of combining the two equities businesses – a potential political hot potato in the US. But he at least pledged not to close the NYSE trading floor.Nasdaq may not face antitrust problems in the US either. While combining the share trading of NYSE and Nasdaq unifies the two biggest platforms in New York, combined they will still only account for 52 per cent of US share trading, according to Thomson Reuters.With US regulators concerned that share trading may be dispersed across too many trading platforms, Mr Greifeld has cleverly read the regulatory mood. “There’s an opportunity to begin to reassemble liquidity and renew investor confidence in US equity markets,” he told analysts.Yet, for NYSE shareholders, the decision will be whether the allure of cash and shares in ICE and Nasdaq outweigh the all-share offer from Deutsche Börse.ICE, the world’s fourth-largest exchange and one of its most profitable, is a strong business. Nasdaq is exposed to the lower-margin cash equities business but analysts credit Mr Greifeld for cutting costs.Rich Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, said, “They’ve made this game interesting. It’s higher risk-higher reward [than New York-Deutsche Börse] but they’ve made the numbers credible because there’s more overlap in the businesses and you can’t discredit them.”Until NYSE responds to the offer, none of this theory can be put to the test.So far, according to Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James: “The only clear winner here is NYSE Euronext shareholders …It’s shaping up to be a soap opera”.Lex
434;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-01T23:38:43Z;US exchanges in $11bn NYSE bid;;Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange have challenged a plan to create the world’s largest exchange, making an $11.3bn offer for NYSE Euronext weeks after it had agreed a merger with Deutsche Börse.Friday’s counter-bid, which Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq OMX chief executive, described as “an unexpected opportunity”, suggests that a wave of exchange consolidation triggered five months ago has entered a new phase. The world’s biggest bourses are fighting for pole position in a hyper-competitive industry confronted with regulatory changes.The battle for NYSE will also shape the fates of the world’s leading financial centres. Nasdaq-ICE’s cash-and-share offer would bolster New York’s position as a global listings centre, while strengthening London’s position in derivatives.Nasdaq OMX and Atlanta-based ICE are proposing to pay $42.50 a share for NYSE Euronext – 19 per cent above Deutsche Börse’s all-share bid. It is also 27 per cent higher than NYSE Euronext’s share price on February 8, the day before the owner of the New York Stock Exchange said it was in talks with its German rival.According to Nasdaq OMX and ICE, their spoiler bid would create “a unified US equities market” and “ensure that the US is better able to compete globally in a rapidly changing international market for equity trading and capital-raising”.“Our industry is undergoing a period of historic change,” Mr Greifeld added. “During the last five years, more than 90 per cent of the top 100 global listings chose not to list in the US, depriving US investors of the opportunity to easily invest and trade in these companies.”If successful, the deal would also give ICE a US futures business to compete with the CME Group in Chicago and Deutsche Börse in Europe.“We have the backdrop of a new regulatory regime sweeping the world and these markets are changing as we speak,” said Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive. “Bob [Greifeld] and I will be able to set the example … as to how [these] businesses should be formed as we move towards greater transparency and a better market structure.”In the wake of the global financial crisis, leaders from the G20 nations advocated reforms that would move previously opaque derivatives trading on to formal trading platforms, to be processed by clearing houses.Under their proposal, ICE would buy NYSE Euronext’s futures businesses, known as NYSE Liffe, while Nasdaq OMX takes over NYSE’s remaining operations including the Euronext group of stock exchanges in New York, Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Lisbon, as well as its US options business.As a result, Nasdaq OMX would acquire a presence in pan-European share trading which combined with its existing Nordic business, would be able to challenge Deutsche Börse and the London Stock Exchange. Nasdaq and NYSE, meanwhile, would merge their trading, listings, options and market technology businesses.Nasdaq and ICE plan to finance the acquisition through cash-on-hand and a combined $3.8bn “financing commitment” from a syndicate of banks led by Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The two exchanges said they could save $740m within three years. Neither disclosed how many jobs could be lost, although Mr Greifeld pledged not to close NYSE’s famous trading floor.Standard & Poor’s placed the credit ratings of NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq on watch pending the outcome of the bid, saying the combined company would have about $6.5bn in debt and warning that the “key credit metrics, at least initially, would not be those of an investment-grade company”.NYSE Euronext shares were up 12.6 per cent at the close. Nasdaq was up 9.25 per cent but ICE dropped 3 per cent.Nasdaq and ICE said they believed they could “secure EU competition clearance in contrast to the expectation of a deep and extended probe for the proposed Deutsche Börse’s transaction”.Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext would together dominate European derivatives trading by controlling Liffe and Eurex, the Börse’s futures exchange. But that dominant position is likely to be a key part of European antitrust scrutiny of the NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse deal.Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Evercore Partners are advising Nasdaq OMX, while ICE has retained Lazard, Broadhaven Capital Partners and BMO Capital Markets.
435;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-01T21:05:37Z;US equities rise after positive jobs data;;The second quarter of the year kicked off on a high note after better-than-expected non-farm payrolls data, while elsewhere on Wall Street shares in NYSE Euronext were in focus after news of a second bid for the exchange.Shares in the largest stock exchange in the US were up 12.6 per cent to $39.60 after rivals Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) made an $11.3bn cash and share offer for NYSE, only weeks after it had already agreed a merger with Deutsche Börse.The rival bid is offering $42.50 a share for the company, representing a 19 per cent premium over Deutsche Börse’s offer last month.It is still far from clear which bid, if any, will actually go through – which explains why the stock did not jump the full 19 per cent.Shares in Nasdaq were up 9.3 per cent to $28.23 on the news while ICE lost 3.1 per cent to $119.75. In Europe, shares in Deutsche Börse also lost ground.In the wider markets, the S&P 500 closed up 0.5 per cent to 1,332.41 following a strong non-farm payrolls number, helping the index to post a 1.4 per cent gain over the week.Data by the US Labor Department showed 216,000 jobs were formed in March, better than the 190,000 expected and the largest increase in jobs since May. Unemployment fell to 8.8 per cent from 8.9 per cent.“The data reinforce the widely accepted view that the US economy is gaining momentum, which ultimately bodes well for risk assets,” said Joseph Tanious, market strategist at JPMorgan Funds.But “as the economy improves the Fed is less likely to keep this accommodative monetary policy in place”, said Mr Tanious.That concern was given weight in the session by Charles Plosser, the Philadelphia Fed president, who said interest rates may have to go up in the “not-too-distant future” to limit inflation.“The employment data [have] encouraged the hawks at the Fed, but there are still many fewer of them and so it is likely that the earliest rates will go up will be the fourth quarter this year and more likely early next year,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent to 12,374.75 in the session, also helped by a strong ISM number suggesting US manufacturing was expanding at a robust pace.The Nasdaq Composite added 0.3 per cent to 2,789.60. The Dow and the Nasdaq were up 1.3 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively over the week.In corporate news, Ford Motor reported a 19 per cent gain in US sales from March 2010, overtaking General Motors as North America’s top-selling carmaker. Shares in Ford were up 1.7 per cent to $15.16.The previous session saw the close of the best first quarter in the US markets since 1998, with the S&P 500 rising 5.6 per cent in the three-month period.These gains were in spite of headwinds from Middle East turmoil, the eurozone sovereign debt crisis and the Japanese disaster.The markets have generally been inclined to shrug off such bad news to date this year and to focus on positive indicators at a broad sense of optimism about the US economy.But markets have been volatile, falling 6.4 per cent in four weeks on worries about Japan and the Middle East, before bouncing almost all the way back in the following month.This week saw markets similarly resilient in the face of mixed economic data. For example, figures from the Conference Board on Tuesday found consumer confidence slumped in March on gloom about the economy. But the markets were still up 0.7 per cent on that day.Both the weekly employment number and housing data during the week were also disappointing, but the markets still strode forward.Among stocks in focus was Berkshire Hathaway, which fell 1.8 per cent to $83.65 at news that David Sokol, a leading contender to succeed Warren Buffett as chief executive, had resigned only weeks after the investment company agreed to purchase Lubrizol for $9bn.Mr Sokol had traded in and out of Lubrizol stock before recommending it to Mr Buffett.Elsewhere Valeant, an acquisitive speciality pharmaceutical company, was up 18.5 per cent to $53.26 over the week after saying it was making a $5.7bn hostile offer for Cephalon, another drugmaker. The target company added 31.3 per cent to $76.04 over the five days.
436;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-01T19:41:29Z;Nasdaq / ICE;Hopes of seeing off another nasty foreigner;George Washington was also aided by ice as he famously crossed the Delaware River to rout the British in 1776. This time America’s Nasdaq OMX has patriot IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) by its side as it hopes to see off another nasty foreigner. Certainly Nasdaq and ICE’s attack shows Washington-style gusto. Its cash and share offer for NYSE Euronext is a fifth higher than that implied by the so-called merger with Deutsche Börse and a 27 per cent premium to the target’s undisturbed price.Like Washington’s advance, the Nasdaq bid appears strategically bonkers compared with the Deutsche Börse deal. The latter has the potential for genuine size and geographic breadth. More importantly, NYSE shareholders would suddenly become all-powerful in high-margin derivatives, with a combined 37 per cent of revenues coming from derivatives and clearing. By acquiring NYSE, in contrast, Nasdaq doubles down in highly competitive cash equities trading and would emerge with only a combined 13 per cent of revenues from derivatives.As industry consolidation continued, Nasdaq had to do something or risk being a footnote in exchange history. On its side are an expected $610m of total annual cost synergies and a better track record than Deutsche Börse in delivering them. Taxed and capitalised, that equates to an equity value of 1.5 times the size of the premium Nasdaq and ICE are offering above the undisturbed equity capitalisation of NYSE.Even at only half the size, the cost synergies from the Deutsche Börse deal also exceed the premium offered. If nothing else, that suggests – assuming that the cuts are delivered – that NYSE shareholders should hold out for more money, whoever it comes from. Normally, more generous terms from Deutsche Börse would be enough to see off Nasdaq. But with national flags waving and regulators mobilising on both sides of the Atlantic, this battle has only just begun.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
437;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-01T18:09:34Z;Plain-speaking operators forge alliance;;Around the exchange sector, there will be little surprise that a bid to break up the NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Borse merger is being launched by Robert “Bob” Greifeld of Nasdaq OMX, and Jeffrey Sprecher of IntercontinentalExchange.The two plain-spoken men share reputations as aggressive consolidators. Both have previously made hostile, though failed, bids for rivals, Mr Greifeld for the London Stock Exchange, and Mr Sprecher for the Chicago Board of Trade.On Friday, they said they had learnt from past efforts and that their joint $13.3bn bid to split NYSE Euronext was driven in part by their personal partnership.“I think we both became more and more convinced we had the right partners,” Mr Greifeld said.Mr Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq since 2003, was an outsider to the clubby world of New York exchanges, having formerly been an executive at a west coast technology company. Leaning on his experience, Mr Greifeld acquired Instinet, the electronic marketplace, in 2005, and the OMX Group of Nordic exchanges in 2007. The failed bid for the LSE in 2006 raised questions about Mr Greifeld’s leadership, as Nasdaq and LSE had previously discussed a mutual partnership. Nasdaq has also lost key executives under him. But he has continued to charge ahead, launching new equity marketplaces in the US and buying the PHLX options market.Like Mr Greifeld, Mr Sprecher began his career elsewhere, in the power industry in the 1980s. He developed important ties with Wall Street, which enabled him to found ICE in 2000, take the company public in 2005 and entering the credit default-swap clearing business by establishing ICE Trust in 2009 in consortium with the big dealer banks. In just over a decade, ICE has become a critical financial institution and demonstrated Mr Sprecher’s skill as a dealmaker, with moves for the International Petroleum Exchange in London in 2001 and the New York Board of Trade in 2007.While his bid to break up the Chicago Mercantile Group’s merger with CBOT in 2007 was unsuccessful, Mr Sprecher said he came away with a higher profile and forced his main competitor to increase its offer price.
438;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-01T17:03:18Z;ICE-Nasdaq bid: What they are saying;;"Nasdaq OMX has teamed up IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) to make an $11.3bn offer for NYSE Euronext. Here is some early comment on the deal.Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX: “I never thought we’d get the opportunity to bid for NYSE. I was surprised when we got the chance. We will deleverage in around 18 months, then look at a capital return programme that could include dividends.“We think these steps will be positively received by all. We’re keeping the NYSE floor. There should be no scepticism about that statement.”“The synergies comes from consolidating the platforms. We have the ability to process every transaction on our processors.”Jeff Sprecher, chief executive and chairman of ICE: “I have become convinced that this is the right thing for the market and the right thing for ICE shareholders. This merger is about who can take cuts out of the business. Bob [Greifeld] and I have engineered a deal that does it much better.”On the creation of ICE-NYSE LiffeJeff Sprecher: “I see Liffe better as a nimbler competitor to Deutsche Börse and CME Group. It would also allow London to remain a competitor on the derivatives world. It would be creating a strong global derivatives player but not a dominant one. It would bring [into Europe] a new asset class of interest rates clearing.”Diego Perfumo, analyst at Equity Research Desk: “The New York-Deustche Borse deal didn’t change the landscape for ICE. But when somebody like Nasdaq comes in, it creates an opportunistic deal for ICE. The deal terms are will within what synergies ICE can achieve. They may be paying a bit more than expected, but they are getting more too, such as parts of the equity derivatives business. ICE and Liffe have significant cost synergies in Europe, and some potential revenue syergies in the US as well. Oil traders can now trade interest rate derivaitves with them, too.”On prospects for a renewed offer from Deutsche BörseAnalysts at Citi: “Deutsche Börse could support €666m additional borrowings, or $940m, which is 27 per cent above valuation before the Deutsche Börse offer. Adding in 50 per cent existing on balance sheet cash resources, we believe Deutsche Börse could offer an extra $6 per share, enabling them to match Nasdaq-ICE’s offer. Nasdaq/ICE is targeting $740m synergies by the end of the third year – $540m from Nasdaq/NYSE combination, $200m from ICE/Euronext. This compares to Deutsche Börse’s €300m cost synergies and €100m revenue synergies. But we believe Deutsche Börse and NYSE were lowballing the synergies achievable.”Market share and effect on US equity tradingThomson Reuters: Nasdaq and NYSE Euronext account for 51.75 per cent of all reported US equity trading in 2010. That is almost 5 times the size of the next biggest exchange, BATS, with 11.45 per cent.Additionally, the data shows that in global terms the combination would represent 33.7 per cent of all reported activity in US, European & Asia stocks compared with the 22.4 per cent share that the combination of Deutsche Börse & NYSE Euronext represents.Anthony Conroy, head of trading at BNY ConvergEx said: “One centralised exchange would help alleviate the fragmentation of US equity trading.”Sang Lee, managing partner at Aite Group: “In the short team, it makes sense to consolidate US cash equities trading and a combined Nasdaq and NYSE would give them a decent position in US equity options.”“The move by Nasdaq is not a surprise and you have to think both NYSE and Deutsche Börse have a contingency plan to counter this.”“In my mind ICE looks the potential winner as it gives them an instant entry to derivatives outside the US. Liffe is not a small piece of the puzzle; it puts them on a par versus CME and Eurex [part of Deutsche Börse].“For shareholdersDiego Perfumo, analyst at Equity Research Desk: “As a shareholder, I might feel more comfortable waiting for someone like LSE or Singapore to come in and buy Nasdaq in two years, avoiding the significant execution risk in integrating the platforms and trying to deleverage.”Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James: “The only clear winner here is NYX [NYSE] shareholders. We are sceptical about the upside for Nasdaq OMX…. Although Nasdaq OMX will certainly be able to create substantial synergies and more operating scale, an acquisition of NYSE Euronext’s US equities and options businesses would represent a doubling down on businesses that are currently out of favour with investors.”“Another failed hostile bid might be frowned upon by [ICE] investors,” he added."
439;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-01T16:16:09Z;Quick View: Does Nasdaq-ICE move make sense?;;"“Seizing the NYSE Euronext Opportunity”.That is the headline on one of 34 slides that Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange are showing to persuade analysts of the merits to their plan to bust up the NYSE Euronext-Deutsche Börse deal.It is bold and brassy – typical of both Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq chief executive, and Jeff Sprecher, his counterpart at ICE.The length of time that it took for Mr Greifeld to show his hand after his rival, Duncan Niederauer at NYSE Euronext, did his deal with Deutsche Börse’s Reto Francioni had many wondering if he really did plan to try and break up the deal.With $2.1bn of debt on Nasdaq’s balance sheet, many wondered if Mr Greifeld could pull something off, even with the aid of ICE and bank financing that is not yet fully committed. Only weeks ago Mr Sprecher was on the record saying how hard it was to break up mergers that already have been agreed. He seemed to be signalling he had doubts. Something must have happened since then, because he now has none.But does the Nasdaq-ICE plan stack up? It is actually a pretty clever play on three counts, quite apart form the fat premium that NYSE Euronext shareholders are being offered (which includes cash, unlike the DB/NYSE deal).First, it should pose far fewer regulatory issues than the DB/NYSE deal.On the US cash equities side, Nasdaq would combine with NYSE’s business, creating a single pool of liquidity. Some might suggest a US antitrust issue here, but I would not jump to that conclusion.The story of US cash equities market structure in the very recent past has been one of fragmentation – excessive fragmentation, in the minds of many including Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Mary Schapiro. Since the “ flash crash” she repeatedly has said that this has made it hard for investors to navigate markets and know what they are dealing with.By bringing Nasdaq and NYSE together – in effect re-aggregating liquidity – Mr Greifeld would be reversing that trend. Regulators will like that. And a combined Nasdaq/NYSE would still only account for just more than half of US equity trading – nowhere near enough to be a worry to antitrust people. Let us not forget that there are plenty of competitors in share trading - such as BATS Global Markets, Direct Edge, brokers and dark pools.Second, Mr Greifeld argues that the US needs a bigger listings champion at a time when the US has seen its leadership eroded here. Fair enough. Why have Nasdaq and NYSE continue to compete to drive listings to the US when you have London with a free run out of the UK. Then there’s Asia, and on the analyst call, Mr Greifeld cited the potential listing of Prada, the Italian luxury goods group, in Hong Kong as a missed opportunity.Also, competition is on the horizon in the US listings business, thanks to the announcement only the other day BATS plans to launch a primary listings platform. Mr Greifeld told me how “grateful” he was to BATS for that.Third, unlike the DB/NYSE deal, this sidesteps completely any antitrust issue over derivatives in Europe. ICE would take London-based Liffe, continuing its existence as a standalone business, while DB/NYSE will probably face a deep and lengthy antitrust probe of its plan to create a virtual monopoly in European derivatives in the form of Eurex and Liffe.And at the same time it gives ICE a big derivatives presence in Europe, where ICE already has a clearing house in London. That will be boosted by plans, unveiled by Mr Sprecher on a call, to expand into interest rate swaps clearing. At the same time, ICE will take over NYSE Liffe US, which has just started competing against CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, in interest rate and Treasury bond futures.For Europeans, this will all look like the consolidation of US ownership of European market structures. But there is little they can do about it; that is not an antitrust issue.Nasdaq OMX has been slipping down the rankings of global exchanges and is the most leveraged of its peers. But Nasdaq is still investment grade, and the cash flow from this proposed deal, Mr Greifeld says, will get his business back to “normal capital velocity” 18 months after the proposed deal has closed.Mr Greifeld has a record as a deal maker, cost-cutter and integrator. So does Mr Sprecher. Both men admitted on Friday that their proposed deal “fell into their laps” after they saw the DB/NYSE tie-up. As opportunistic as it may look, it might just work."
440;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-04-01T01:09:07Z;New York markets cancel ETF trades;;Nasdaq OMX and NYSE cancelled trades in 10 exchange-traded funds after their prices plummeted in early trading on Thursday, raising questions about measures implemented to safeguard investors against sharp market swings after last year’s “flash crash”.The exchanges cancelled certain trades that occurred in 10 of 15 Focus Morningstar ETFs that launched on Wednesday, said a spokesperson for Scottrade Financial Services, the ETFs’ sponsor.The trades occurred early in the session when prices dropped by as much as 98 per cent after a human processing error at Knight Capital Americas, a market maker for the ETFs.The net asset values of the ETFs and the value of the underlying securities and shareholders were not affected, Scottrade said.On its website, Nasdaq said it cancelled trades in FocusShares ETFs that were executed between 9:54am and 9:56am that were more than 10 per cent away from the day’s trade before the erroneous order or the previous close if no trades occurred prior.Nasdaq and NYSE declined to comment.After the flash crash in May of 2010, when US equity markets plummeted in a matter of minutes, exchanges agreed to implement trading curbs for stocks and ETFs designed to prevent sudden and sharp changes in the price of securities. The Focus ETFs were not included because they launched after these initial measures were rolled out.ETFs experienced some of the greatest falls in price during the flash crash. ETFs account for about 30 per cent of trading volumes on US exchanges on any given day but they made up about 60 per cent of the “broken” trades that were subsequently cancelled on May 6.A report by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission after the flash crash identified an unusually large sell order sent into a market already skittish amid worries about the Greek debt crisis. That caused some liquidity providers to withdraw from the market and prices to swing wildly.ETFs are investment funds whose shares trade on an exchange like a stock. They hold baskets of assets that typically track a market index. The Focus ETFs are based on stock indices published by Morningstar, the research group.
441;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-03-29T20:01:33Z;BATS takes on New York with new platform;;BATS Global Markets, operator of the third-largest US stock exchange, has confirmed it will launch a market for primary listings in the fourth quarter, opening a new front in its challenge to the dominance of the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.The company said it had submitted draft rules to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US regulator, and expected to make a formal filing and public comment shortly.The move comes as the future of incumbent US exchanges has been thrust into the spotlight by a recent rash of mergers.Deutsche Börse, parent of the Frankfurt exchange, plans a tie-up with NYSE Euronext, parent of the New York Stock Exchange.Nasdaq OMX has also held discussions with bankers about launching a rival bid for NYSE Euronext, which could create a single dominant US listing exchange. Nasdaq and NYSE currently compete fiercely for listings.“We believe there is a need for an alternative listing venue in today’s market, which has only been heightened in recent weeks as legacy exchanges weigh different merger and acquisition strategies,” said Joe Ratterman, president and chief executive of BATS Global Markets.“In addition, market conditions have become increasingly favourable to companies looking to gain access to the capital markets so we’re excited to launch our listings business later this year,” he said.BATS has also said it will consider launching a primary listings venue in London, once it absorbs Chi-X Europe under a deal unveiled last month.Since its creation six years ago, Kansas-based BATS has grabbed market share in the US from Nasdaq and the NYSE by offering lower fees and faster trading. It has about 10 per cent of trading in US stocks.Last month it agreed to buy Chi-X Europe to create the largest pan-European share trading venue by volume and intends to add derivatives trading to the platform in coming months.In the past years, companies’ shares in the US and Europe have increasingly traded away from the exchange where they are listed, on exchanges such as BATS and Direct Edge as well as alternative venues such as “dark pools”. Market regulations allow any venue matching the best price to execute a trade.That fragmentation creates an opportunity, said Timothy Quast, managing director at ModernIR, which advises issuers on how their shares trade. “In today’s trading markets, any entry point will do. If BATS is cheaper and provides substantial trading data, they’ll do okay.
442;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-03-17T22:24:45Z;ICE chief cools talk of merger disruption;Such break-ups are ‘hard to do’, says Sprecher;IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), a US operator of commodity and derivatives exchanges, sought to damp speculation about its possible involvement in an attempt by Nasdaq OMX to break up the planned combination of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse saying such break-ups were “hard to do”.Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, said at a conference in Florida that ICE had “great experience” with disrupting deals. ICE in 2007 tried and failed in a bid for the Chicago Board of Trade, which had recently agreed to be sold to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. That bid eventually went through, creating what is now CME Group.“We have great experience with this and we see that breaking up other people’s mergers is hard to do,” Mr Sprecher told the Financial Times at a Futures Industry Association conference in Florida. “There has to be a really compelling proposition for shareholders and the markets.”However he would “neither confirm nor deny” whether he was involved in an attempt, led by Nasdaq OMX chief executive Bob Greifeld, to pull together a bid for NYSE Euronext, in an attempt to prise it away from Deutsche Börse.The US and German exchange operators last month unveiled an all-share deal that would see Deutsche Börse shareholders control 60 per cent of a new holding company, with NYSE Euronext shareholders holding the rest.People familiar with the matter said Mr Greifeld was locked in talks with bankers aimed at securing financing for a bid that would involve buying the cash equities and options business of NYSE Euronext.They said that Mr Greifeld believes the merger synergies outlined by the US and German operators of €300m ($420m) do not go far enough and that he could take more costs out, faster. “His cost-cutting would be taken more credibly,” one said.The people also said Mr Greifeld believed that NYSE Euronext shareholders may be more likely to consider an alternative offer given that NYSE Euronext’s shares have fallen in value by more than 9 per cent since the deal was unveiled, to just over $35 on Thursday, valuing the company at $9.3bn.However, Nasdaq’s shares have fallen sharply this week alone, and are down 12 per cent at $24.50.Craig Donohue, chief executive of CME Group, told the Financial Times: “I really do not think that bigger is better. What do you achieve through these types of transactions?”
443;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Boca Beat: ICE gives the show a 2007 feel;;If the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) is about to launch a counter-offer for the derivatives business of NYSE Euronext, as part of a joint effort with Nasdaq OMX to break up the planned Deutsche Börse/NYSE Euronext deal, ICE chief executive Jeff Sprecher was giving away almost nothing on Monday night.Standing at the bar at the Boca Raton resort on the first night of the Futures Industry Association’s annual conference, all Mr Sprecher would say was: “I can’t say anything, I can’t legally anyway.” And that wasn’t just because company spokeswoman Kelly Loeffler – who is also his wife – was standing next to him.We may know later whether reports of a Nasdaq-ICE break-up are proven correct. But this, and the fate of the other two exchange mergers, were just about all that delegates were talking about as the conference prepared for record attendance. At 850 registered, this puts FIA Boca back up to levels last reached before the financial crisis in 2007.That year Mr Sprecher stole the show with a surprise counter-offer for the Chicago Board of Trade in an attempt to break up an agreed offer from CME Group. So when it comes to breaking up exchange M&A deals, Mr Sprecher certainly has form at Boca.As far as the idea goes, some analysts are coming round to the idea of a Nasdaq/ICE move, having previously been colder than lukewarm. Rich Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill, tells FT Trading Room: “I think [Nasdaq OMX chief executive Bob] Greifeld believes he needs to take part in the current consolidation. But I am still sceptical.”On Monday, Ed Ditmire, an analyst at Macquarie, noted that while Nasdaq’s relatively indebted position means it cannot bid for NYSE Euronext by itself – current NYSE market capitalisation is also about double that of Nasdaq – by teaming up with ICE “each can bid for portions of NYSE Euronext which best mirror their own business, creating high overlaps/cost-synergies”.He thinks Nasdaq/ICE could put a $45 a share offer on the table, with Nasdaq paying $20 per share for NYSE excluding its Liffe European derivatives business, while ICE could pay $25a share for Liffe.Liffe would give Mr Sprecher a big European presence that he currently lacks. He could leverage his ICE Europe clearing house, which is already well-established, and steal a march on the CME in Europe. No coincidence, perhaps, that CME on Tuesday announced a date for the launch of clearing at its new London-based clearer.Mr Sprecher could also be making a very shrewd gamble on what happens on the regulatory front in Europe. We already know that European antitrust authorities are going to take a long, hard look at the planned combination of Liffe and Eurex under Deutsche Börse-NYSE Euronext proposal.If Brussels decides that it doesn’t like the idea of a derivatives powerhouse with interest rate futures at both ends of the yield curve, and thinks therefore that Liffe and Eurex should not be owned by the same operator, then having clear interest from ICE in ownership of Liffe may give regulators one more reason to look at the landscape this way.And in the US, a combined Nasdaq-NYSE would recreate market share in US cash equities in a single liquidity pool, just as BATS Global Markets is starting to look more of a threat with its recent Chi-X Europe deal, ambitions in Brazil and the possibility of an IPO. Plus Nasdaq-NYSE would be a US-US deal, which would make Chuck Schumer, senior Democratic senator for New York, no doubt happy.Meanwhile as exchanges duke it out, regulators are grappling with Dodd-Frank implementation and budget squeezes. Or so you would think.In an unusual twist, it turns out that four out of five Commodity Futures Trading Commission commissioners are attending FIA Boca. Yet the fifth commissioner, Gary Gensler, the chairman, is not. Instead, he will deliver his keynote address via video link-up from Washington, DC.Normally Mr Gensler attends in person. But this year he apparently wants to demonstrate that he is keeping a tight rein on CFTC spending by declining to travel to Florida.Besides, Mr Gensler will not have a ringside seat on the action should Mr Greifeld and Mr Sprecher decide to liven things up.
444;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Nasdaq sounds out bankers on NYSE bid;;Nasdaq is edging closer to a possible hostile offer for the New York Stock Exchange and has been sounding out bankers about a financing package for a bid.People familiar with the situation said that no decision had yet been made and Nasdaq could shy away from what would be an ambitious attempt by the smaller exchange to break up its rival’s agreed deal with Deutsche Börse.But Nasdaq was working with its advisers, led by Bank of America and Evercore and could shortly agree funding for a counter-offer to the deal announced last month, these people added.Nasdaq could finance the bid with about $5bn in debt organised by Bank of America, DealReporter news service reported. Intercontinental Exchange, the Atlanta-based futures exchange, could be lined up to buy the Liffe business, worth about $5bn. Nasdaq and ICE declined to comment, as did the banks.Nasdaq shares fell 3 per cent to $26.37. NYSE Euronext shares rose 4.52 per cent to $36.55.Attempting to break up the NYSE’s all-share deal with Deutsche Börse would be a high-risk move. The existing deal contains a sizeable break-up fee of €250m ($340m). Deutsche Börse would also have certain rights to match a competing proposal. Nasdaq is already among the most levered of the major exchanges and additional debt could put downwards pressure on its triple B credit rating.Observers have also questioned the merits of Nasdaq doubling down in US cash equities. Most exchange groups are bulking up in higher-margin businesses such as derivatives and clearing.However, Nasdaq has found itself short of options since its rivals began pairing up last year.The London Stock Exchange is pursuing a combination with TMX Group, operator of the Toronto and Montreal bourses, while in Asia SGX, the Singapore exchange, is hoping Australian regulators will approve its deal with Sydney-based ASX.Nasdaq may be emboldened by the perception that US regulators would be receptive to an attempt to keep the NYSE in American hands. However, putting together the pair’s listings businesses could raise antitrust challenges of its own.“There is something that appeals to the patriot in us that would wish to see a Nasdaq acquisition of the NYSE and save it for the Americans,” said David Weild, head of capital markets advisory at Grant Thornton and a former Nasdaq vice-chairman.
445;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-03-14T11:48:06Z;Tech Beat: Post-trade race is on;;Icap’s establishment of a venture capital fund shows a new technology race for post-trade services has begun.Called Euclid Opportunities, the UK interdealer broker is promising seed capital and mentoring to early-stage companies. Icap has declined to say how much it is committing to the fund but it is believed to be several million pounds.It is a bold move for an established financial services company to move to support grass-roots development in the technology sector but the biggest surprise is that Icap feels the need to create a fund. The group has long been an active acquirer of tech companies to fill in gaps in its business. This move suggests limits have been reached.“Euclid will bridge the gap between underfunded technology innovators and the needs of stakeholders in today’s financial markets,” said Steve Gibson, managing director of the fund.These seem to be the perfect conditions for a technology venture capital fund to exploit: a mature cash-rich industry faced with significant regulatory changes urgently needing to invest and upgrade their technology.But emerging financial technology companies have historically been of little interest to the venture capital industry. They can offer little in the way of trading flow or access to potential customers – the world’s largest financial groups.As Ascendant, a UK venture capital firm points out, early-stage money has been coming back into the UK and Irish technology sectors. Last year more UK and Irish companies received more capital than in 2009. But the more high-profile businesses, such as internet/wireless services, clean technology, software and semiconductors, are the ones taking the lion’s share of the funds.For Icap, the rationale seems to be clear. If the market can’t fill the gap, perhaps it needs to be pushed along. Analysts say the opportunity is huge.Regulators in Washington and Brussels are writing rules for legislation that will radically reshape market structures. It is likely that over-the-counter (OTC), or privately-negotiated, derivatives will be moved on to exchanges or other electronic platforms. This will increase pricing transparency in such markets, parts of which were blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis, so the argument runs.Icap is competing with rivals such as GFI Group, BGC Partners and Tullett Prebon in the OTC markets. They attempt to match buyers and sellers of financial instruments such as bonds or swaps.Post-trade services, particularly clearing, have emerged as a key part of reform, with regulators insisting that as many OTC products as possible be processed through clearing houses as well. A clearing house stands between two parties to a trade, guaranteeing that the trade goes ahead even if one party defaults.In a report last month analysts at Morgan Stanley said the most compelling structural growth stories in the industry would be banks and market-structure providers that could position for the move of OTC markets to electronic platforms.“We see this transformation of the $453 trillion OTC swaps market as perhaps the critical issue for banks and market infrastructure providers to assess,” said Bruce Hamilton, analyst at Morgan Stanley.He forecast the emerging swap execution facilities (SEFs) and trading of OTC derivatives would be more likely to be provided by IDBs rather than exchanges, given dealer preferences and current liquidity pools.“We expect electronic migration to favour the infrastructure players with strong technology innovation and first-mover advantage,” said Mr Hamilton, forecasting double-digit growth for the electronic business models of interdealer brokers.“Identifying solutions to the challenges of tomorrow is one way that Icap can remain at the forefront of innovation in the post-trade space,” said Mark Beeston, chief executive of Icap’s Portfolio Risk Services.Mr Beeston himself came from a start-up, having founded T-Zero, a credit derivatives trading platform, in 2005 before it was bought by Intercontinental Exchange in 2008. It is now known as ICE Link.The rapidly changing rules have led to a scramble for new technology to fill in the gaps by established brokers and exchanges.Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator, last year bought FTEN, a privately held US company, while Markit bought QuiC, although both small companies specialise in pre-trade risk management.But the fact that Icap is not only developing these projects in-house shows how market regulation and technology is moving so fast that even recognised technological innovators cannot keep up.Faster and cheaper technology in the past decade ushered in profound changes in the equity trading market in the US and Europe. That period brought about Getco, Liquidnet, Triana (later bought by Icap), Bats Trading and Chi-X Europe. The race to create those who will disrupt the OTC and post-trade world is under way.
446;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-03-09T15:16:28Z;Icap to launch venture capital tech fund;;Icap, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, is to launch a venture capital fund aimed at start-up companies developing technology to specialised parts of the financial industry such as post-trade services.Called Euclid Opportunities, the fund will offer seed capital and mentoring to early-stage companies that are developing new technology for post-trade services, such as clearing and settlement. Icap declined to say how much it was committing to the fund.Regulators in Washington and Brussels are writing rules for legislation that will reshape market structures. Many want over-the-counter (OTC), or privately-negotiated, derivatives to be moved on to exchanges or other electronic platforms to increase pricing transparency in such markets, parts of which were blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis.Clearing, a key post-trade service, has emerged as a key component of derivatives reform, with regulators insisting that as many OTC products as possible be processed through clearing houses as well. A clearing house stands between two parties to a trade, guaranteeing that the trade goes ahead even if one party defaults.“The rate of regulatory reform in global financial markets is driving unprecedented demand for new approaches, methods and practices,” said Mark Beeston, chief executive of Icap’s Portfolio Risk Services. “Identifying solutions to the challenges of tomorrow is one way that Icap can remain at the forefront of innovation in the post-trade space.”The changing marketplace has led many of the biggest operators to snap up small specialist technology firms. Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator, last year bought FTEN, a privately held US company specialising in pre-trade risk management while Markit bought risk analytics business QuiC.“Euclid will bridge the gap between underfunded technology innovators and the needs of stakeholders in today’s financial markets,” said Steve Gibson, managing director at Euclid.
447;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-03-03T21:06:31Z;Brussels casts shadow over bourse plan;;"For the past three weeks speculation has swirled around Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext over who – if anyone – might try and break up their plan to create the world’s largest exchange.The German and US exchange groups, operators respectively of the Frankfurt and New York Stock Exchanges, have agreed a $25bn all-share deal that would create a behemoth with four times the revenues of the London Stock Exchange or Nasdaq OMX.But another threat to the combination could be emerging from the corridors of power in Brussels.In recent weeks, a furious lobbying battle has broken out over financial reforms being pushed by the European Commission that are part of G20 efforts to clean up the financial system after the crisis.Just as the Dodd-Frank law in the US forces over-the-counter derivatives to be traded on exchanges and other electronic platforms and insists that they be processed through clearing houses, so Europe is working on similar reforms that imply profound changes to the way market structures – such as exchanges and clearers – operate.They include the “vertical silo”, a term that refers to an exchange that owns its own clearing house – such as Deutsche Börse.Market participants have long opposed silos because they wield pricing power over market participants, derived from control of a clearing house that also helps prevent rivals from successfully offering competing products.Yet, the reforms are casting a shadow over the silo. In recent weeks, changes have been made to the European Commission’s proposals for overhauling OTC derivatives markets that would ensure clearing houses must accept contracts for clearing from any trading venue in an open and competitive way – not only OTC derivatives, but exchange-traded derivatives as well.Hitherto these financial instruments – which provide one of the Börse’s two biggest revenue streams – had been left unaffected.And this week the top official in charge of developing the reforms – known by the acronym “Emir” – said they should be extended to exchange-traded derivatives, adding weight to efforts to challenge the vertical silo.This has raised the prospect of Deutsche Börse and other vertical silos opening up to competition, potentially undermining the valuation of the Börse’s clearing business Eurex Clearing.Rich Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill in New York, says: “The vertical integration of clearing houses with their respective trading platforms has been key to the high valuations the derivatives exchanges have enjoyed.”Under the terms of the deal between the Börse and NYSE Euronext, a new holding company would be created that would be 60 per cent held by Börse shareholders, with NYSE Euronext holding the rest.Much of the €100m ($139m) in revenue synergies that the groups propose stem from streamlining their derivatives businesses and benefiting from the use of Eurex Clearing.If the silo were to come under threat, investors would have to lower their valuations for the Börse, analysts say, changing the dynamics of the merger.Yet, Deutsche Börse has made its case for the preservation of its model persuasively in Brussels, sources say, even as proponents of competition – such as the banks that are customers of exchanges – push back.Rainer Riess, a managing director at the Börse, says: “In the clearing space we’ve always said in general that we are open to competition, but we just believe that it needs to be in an efficient manner.”Sharon Bowles, a British MEP who chairs the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, says: “This is a battleground and I’m not sure that we’re going to win it, but I am still fighting for it. We should broaden Emir out to
listed derivatives [to create] a level playing field.”The silo is also central to whether the merger will be approved by European antitrust authorities. NYSE Euronext said last week it expected a probe and that it would be “intense”, but that it would not pose problems for regulators.At stake is whether European antitrust authorities will take the view that it is time to force competition in exchange-traded derivatives and challenge silos, or whether they believe that, in the interest of European competitiveness with the US, they can accept the silo in the form of a the Börse’s Eurex exchange and NYSE Euronext’s Liffe London futures exchange. The US has silo in the form of CME Group, the Börse’s main rival in derivatives.Andrew Bowley, managing director of electronic trading product management at Nomura, said: “Actions that allow competition have got to be the best outcome.”"
448;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-03-03T19:08:25Z;Anger as exchanges raise closing auction fees;Outcry among banks and brokers that are their biggest customers;"Two of Europe’s largest exchanges have raised the fees they charge for traders dealing during the end-of-day auction, provoking an outcry among banks and brokers that are their biggest customers.The moves by NYSE Euronext, which operates bourses in Amsterdam, Paris, Brussels and Lisbon, and Nasdaq OMX, which runs exchanges in Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland, come as exchanges have been forced to lower fees amid stiff competition from rival platforms such as Chi-X and BATS.These cuts have applied mostly to trading that happens between the opening and closing auctions. By contrast, at these auctions – which take place only at established exchanges and usually last five minutes – fees have risen.The auctions are used to set a “reference price” at the beginning and end of each day. Traders and investors need that reference price at the beginning of the day to set a general direction for prices, taking into account news and data from overnight. At the end of the day the auction is used by asset managers and dealers to reconcile multiple open positions.The action by exchanges has generated controversy because market participants have little choice but to be in the auction. “Exchanges have pricing power, and now they are exercising it. Nobody’s going to be happy about it at all. It will increase costs for investors,” said a senior trader at a US bank in London. A senior trader at a different bank said: “They are doing this because they know they can, and we are being gouged.”Trading volume tends to rise at the end of the day as market participants rush to take advantage of the five-minute auction to clean up positions. Trading activity – or liquidity – is usually higher in auctions than in the continuous trading that takes place between the auctions, making the activity rich pickings for the exchanges that charge a fee for each transaction.Nasdaq OMX raised its fees, effective on Wednesday, by about 20 per cent. NYSE Euronext raised its fees in December.The situation has been exacerbated as the amount of trading that takes place in the auction has risen sharply in the past 12 months. According to Thomson Reuters, trading volume in opening and closing auctions across Europe is 54 per cent higher, accounting for 6.2 per cent of total daily volume this month, compared with 4 per cent in January last year.Ashok Krishnan, head of execution services for Europe, Africa and Middle East at BofA Merrill Lynch, suggests a fair balance between auction fees and those charged for continuous trading: “There should be harmonisation of pricing and no egregious price
differences between the auction and continuous trading.”"
449;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-03-03T09:33:17Z;ASX faces rival as Sydney’s markets open;;"Chi-X Global, operator of share trading platforms in Canada and Japan, could start operating in Australia by October under a timetable for allowing competition in the country’s equities markets unveiled by the securities regulator.The move is the clearest sign yet of when the ASX exchange will face the first challenge to its monopoly since Canberra gave the green light to the concept of competition in share markets last year.It also makes Australia the latest market to open up to a wave of competition that has swept Europe, Japan and Latin America as new types of trading platforms emerge to challenge national bourses. Last week BATS Global Markets, a Chi-X Global rival, said it was exploring ways to enter the Brazilian market, dominated the BM&FBovespa exchange.It also comes as ASX is pursuing a tie-up with SGX, the Singapore exchange, which would help it deal with competition.On Thursday the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (Asic) set out its timetable for the introduction of market competition, including steps “required for the commencement of operation of Chi-X Australia”, which has applied for a licence to operate in the country.“This will give effect to the government’s policy to support competition between exchange markets in Australia,” Asic said.Shane Tregillis, Asic commissioner, said the industry had said it would need at least six months from when Asic issued its “final market integrity rules for competition”, which it issued on Thursday. That means Chi-X could start trading in October,“The timetable also depends on market operators and market participants taking all necessary steps to get ready for competition over the coming period,” Mr Tregellis said.ASX said it was “well positioned to operate within the proposed competitive environment”. It has implemented a flurry of new initiatives in recent months, including adopting a faster trading system from Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange and trading technology operator.But it also warned that the “competition benefits of service innovation and lower transaction fees” were “unavoidably accompanied by greater complexity and the risks that attracts”.“It is essential that the new regulatory framework provides adequate safeguards to manage those risks,” the exchange said.The ASX’s comment appeared to be a reference to the side-effects of market fragmentation, such as a proliferation of market data, that European markets have seen since the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid) introduced competition into European share markets.ASX said that in coming months it would start operating a new data centre offering traders “colocation”; deliver ASX PureMatch, a new trade execution facility designed for high frequency traders; and continue to develop large order execution facilities, such as VolumeMatch, for institutional customers seeking to do large trades anonymously – as in “dark pools” in other markets.Asic said market operators and participants would need to prepare for a “multi-market environment”.Before Chi-X’s launch, Asic said ASX and Chi-X would have to make “operating rule and system changes, put in place procedures for simultaneously halting trading, for use of common stock and broker identifiers and for the sharing of certain data, and link to the nominated clock for synchronisation.Participants intending to connect to Chi-X would need to amend their order routing and back office systems and prepare to comply with Chi-X operating rules, the new “common market integrity rules” and the new market integrity rules specifically for the Chi-X market.Chi-X would also need access to clearing and settlement services, which will likely mean Chi-X considering how to pay ASX’s clearing house for the privilege, or find another clearing solution – which currently does not exist in Australia.Earlier this month ASX issued a notice on its website giving details of a new “trade acceptance service” – effectively allowing rival trading platforms to use its clearing house.But it set an initial application fee of A$10,000, and an annual “service fee” of $450,000 under a contract that would have to last for a minimum of three years. That would mean Chi-X paying $1.35m for clearing.Asic said it would “continue to work closely with market operators and market participants during the coming months, including on industry testing and related issues to ensure a smooth transition to competition takes place”."
450;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Nano View: Exchange arms race reaches new speeds;;In the time it has taken to read this sentence, electronic traders around the world will have carried out millions of trades in shares, derivatives and foreign exchange in – literally – nanoseconds.Until last week measuring the speed at which trades zip around exchanges and other trading venues was limited to 1,000th of a millisecond, in a measure called a microsecond.To get an idea of how fast a microsecond is, the blink of a human eye takes 300 milliseconds and one millisecond is 1,000 times faster than a microsecond.Now, a Dublin-based trading technology called Corvil has come up with a way to measure trading that happens in a nanosecond, which is substantially faster even than a microsecond. A nanosecond is 1,000 times faster than a microsecond.Donal Byrne, Corvil’s chief executive, says trading speed has risen by 500,000 times since 2007. “If you were to see a similar improvement in the speed of cars from today then we would have cars in 2014 travelling at 5m miles per hour,” he says.The London Stock Exchange last week installed a new trading system, provided by a Sri Lankan technology company it bought in 2009, for its UK equities order book. The maximum speed – or latency, in the jargon – of trading it allows is 125 microseconds, which makes it marginally faster than Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange, and BATS Exchange.Yet how is this arms race in speed good for markets overall?It’s well known that markets are full of “high-frequency” traders and other types of proprietary traders using computer algorithms. What matters to these market participants is getting to a trade before anyone else - hence the obsession with speed.That incentive is what is driving heavy investment by exchanges in building data centres, where such traders can place their computers, programmed with algorithms, only metres away from the exchange’s trading system.Such traders often say they provide liquidity that otherwise might not be there. There is some merit to that argument, but it isn’t the whole story.Asset managers, which account for huge amounts of trading, are increasingly uneasy about the role of high-frequency traders. They generally have long-term horizons with stocks, whereas ultra-fast traders rarely take a view on company fundamentals and are merely interested in getting to the bets price first.Yet these two actors find themselves having to co-habit, uneasily, in market structures that are increasingly obsessed with speed.There is a sense in which exchanges – which are mostly for-profit these days – have lost sight of the average investor’s needs in their rush to embrace the speed freaks in the market.In Spain, the Bolsa y Mercados Españoles has made a virtue out of retaining the country’s network of regional exchanges, including in Bilbao and Valencia, even as it gears up for high-frequency traders. Why? Companies that list feel the need to have a relationship with the exchange, and to keep tabs on how their shares are traded.A nanosecond is the last thing on their minds.
451;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-02-25T04:29:03Z;Osaka bourse chief warns on regulation;;Michio Yoneda, chief executive of the Osaka Securities Exchange, has warned that regulation in Japan is hindering the development of the country’s multiple bourses, in comments that come amid a wave of global consolidation.Mr Yoneda told the Financial Times that when he joined the OSE 11 years ago from the Bank of Japan he was expecting Japanese exchanges to be “more cutting edge”, but that the industry was “extremely behind” as it was protected by regulation.“With regulation it’s easy also for those being regulated,” Mr Yoneda said. “If [they] are protected they can get by without doing anything. This has continued to be an excuse, creating this current situation. We must change it.”Mr Yoneda’s comments come as exchanges engage in consolidation across time zones, raising questions about Japan’s role as one of the world’s largest markets. That role is likely to be limited for now given that the TSE, which dominates equity cash trading with a 90 per cent share, has said that it plans no cross-border equity alliances while it is not listed.Moreover, under regulations, foreign entities are not allowed to own more than a 20 per cent share of a Japanese bourse. This means at best, any serious cross-border consolidation would have to involve multiple offshore partners, or a takeover from the Japanese side.Much needed consolidation at home also remains difficult. The ruling Democratic party last year announced a plan to consolidate Japan’s financial, equity and commodity exchanges into a “comprehensive exchange” – an idea floated but never realised many times in the past.A lack of progress between the various ministries about who and how such an exchange should be regulated is raising serious doubts whether it will move forward this time either.Other regulations and a complex tax system have hampered the growth of areas such as remote membership and rules introduced in the 1990s meant Singapore overtook the OSE as the largest trader of Japanese Nikkei futures.Mr Yoneda said he would do what he could within existing regulations. The OSE has had to be one of the more innovative in the country due to it being the only one listed and therefore having to answer to shareholders, and also because of its relatively small size.It introduced longer trading hours and derivative products ahead of the much larger TSE, and took over the small cap market, Jasdaq, in the first exchange merger in Japan. It is in talks with Nasdaq OMX on potential projects, but Mr Yoneda said plans had yet to be drawn up.The OSE and the Tokyo Commodity Exchange, or Tocom, said separately they are eyeing closer co-operation, which could include one possibility – though there are no formal discussions – of sharing trading systems in the future. Both have recently introduced their respective Nasdaq OMX-developed platforms, for which hardware and some software could be shared in future upgrades.
452;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-02-24T15:54:10Z;Quick View: A fly on the wall at Nasdaq;;There are many on Wall Street – and beyond – who would love to have been in Rich Repetto’s shoes this week.The analyst at Sandler O’Neill, a veteran observer of the exchanges industry, snagged a meeting with Nasdaq OMX top brass, giving him an inside peek at the group’s thinking just as everyone wants to know whether the group will make a grab for NYSE Euronext – or do something else, or do nothing at all.In a note to clients just published, Mr Repetto does not quite get the answer to those questions – at least not clear answers. Adena Friedman, the chief financial officer who quit unexpectedly last week, was not giving the game away.But he did glean some insights and, with the benefit of some interpretative context, had some very interesting things to say.First, people should not get hung up on the idea that Nasdaq may be looking at doing a single big deal, was one line. The group has a history of tackling quite complex deals involving a number of parties. For example, Mr Repetto cites a 2005 deal in which Nasdaq, Silver Lake, the private equity group, and Bank of New York teamed up to acquire Instinet, the broker. Nasdaq got the trading platform now known as Inet, Silver Lake acquired the agency brokerage operations of Instinet (later sold to Nomura in 2006), and Bank of New York bought Lynch, Jones & Ryan.As Mr Repetto put it: “Nasdaq does have in its DNA complex transactions from the past.”Second, the message seems to be that Nasdaq sees opportunity in consolidation (as opposed to threats), in particular in how long it will take some of the other deals out there to get regulatory approval. Not to mention “lengthy integrations”, as Mr Repetto noted.“Two businesses that were specifically mentioned were US options trading and market technology,” he wrote. “In US options, a consolidation of exchange ownership could lead to a recalibration of market share, plus there could be integration issues as Deutsche Börse has yet to transition International Securities Exchange to the Eurex platform (or NYSE Euronext’s ‘UTP’ technology following a merger).”As a third point, I would add that we need to look at Nasdaq’s shareholder base for some clues as to what might be in the works. On Wednesday Börje Ekholm, the chief executive of Investor, the holding company of Sweden’s Wallenberg family, joined the board of Nasdaq OMX as a new member.In December, when Nasdaq OMX was repurchasing shares from its largest shareholder Borse Dubai, Investor quietly raised its stake in Nasdaq OMX to over 10 per cent. That makes Investor the second largest shareholder in Nasdaq OMX after Dubai.Intriguingly, at the time Mr Ekholm said it was an attractive deal for Investor’s shareholders to become one of the biggest shareholders in Nasdaq OMX, which he said had “very strong market positions and a unique brand in the industry”.Like a Stieg Larsson novel, the plot thickens …
453;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-02-24T14:09:56Z;Nasdaq is running out of options;;Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq OMX’s chief executive, faces an uncomfortable reality.The wave of consolidation that has swept the exchange business this month has left him with little choice but to talk through his options with bankers at Evercore Partners and Bank of America Merrill Lynch.But Mr Greifeld’s business is too small and too indebted to acquire most other big exchanges. Nasdaq has a market capitalisation of $5.5bn which would mean it could only realistically consider a solo bid for BME, the Spanish exchange, or Bursa Malaysia.His options are limited, since the exchanges with which Mr Greifeld might have considered doing a deal have already found partners.Deutsche Börse plans to combine with NYSE Euronext, the London Stock Exchange is pursuing a tie-up with TMX Group, operator of the Toronto and Montreal bourses, while in Asia SGX, the Singapore Exchange is hoping Australian regulators will approve a combination with Sydney-based ASX.One option Mr Greifeld is exploring involves breaking up the Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext deal, although bankers regard this as a long shot.The exchanges closest in size to Nasdaq are the LSE and TMX and Nasdaq could theoretically consider breaking up that deal, having targeted LSE with a failed hostile bid in 2006.But the relative weakness of his own business means Mr Greifeld is not only handicapped as an aggressor, but also a questionable attraction for any acquirer.Nasdaq has made strides in trying to diversify from low-margin, highly competitive US cash equities trading. A push into options has seen Nasdaq draw level with the Chicago Board Options Exchange, for years the largest US options exchange by market share.Recent acquisitions, such as the purchase of FTEN, a specialist in pre-trade risk management systems, also helped drive revenue up 8 per cent to $400m in the fourth quarter, over the same period a year earlier.But analysts are still cautious on whether Nasdaq can increase revenues fast enough to hit Mr Greifeld’s target of $2bn by the end of 2013. Derivatives and clearing – the two most lucrative parts of the exchange business – account for 18 per cent of group revenues. Yet at NYSE Euronext derivatives alone accounts for 33 per cent of revenues.And there are concerns over the size of Nasdaq’s net debt of $2.1bn, making Nasdaq the most leveraged of any of the larger exchanges, limiting its room for manoeuvre. Nasdaq did not return a call seeking comment.Moreover, Mr Greifeld has made some big bets that have not turned out well. He has tried repeatedly to build a pan-European equities presence, only to see his latest foray – a bid for Chi-X Europe – knocked back after Chi-X agreed to a deal with rival BATS Global Markets.While CME Group, the Chicago-based exchange operator, and ICE are making progress in taking advantage of the landmark Dodd-Frank financial reforms, Nasdaq has yet to see results from a clearing house it set up for interest rate swaps.Mr Greifeld has not been helped by the defection of a string of top executives weakening management at a crucial time. Adena Friedman, chief financial officer, quit unexpectedly last week.There have also been big changes in Nasdaq’s shareholder base. Investor, the investment vehicle for Sweden’s Wallenberg family, raised its stake to just over 10 per cent recently as Borse Dubai was cutting its stake to 17 per cent.On Wednesday, Borje Ekholm, Investor chief executive – and a former McKinsey consultant – joined the Nasdaq board as a new member. Mr Greifeld will need all the expertise he can get.
454;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-02-18T19:11:00Z;BATS enters big league with Chi-X merger;;"From his headquarters in Kansas City, Joe Ratterman can hardly believe that, as of Friday, the company he runs will soon account for more share trading in Europe than the London Stock Exchange.BATS Global Markets began life in 2005 as a technology project to make trading faster and more efficient; the brainchild of Dave Cummings, now owner of Tradebot, an algorithmic trading firm. Mr Ratterman was head of business development at Tradebot and a close associate of Mr Cummings.Now it has taken a big step towards rubbing shoulders with the biggest names in the exchange world in a week that has shaken those established groups to the core.BATS has agreed to combine with Chi-X Europe, which already accounts for 25 per cent of trading in FTSE 100 stocks, in a share swap that values BATS at $1.2bn. An initial public offering is seen as a next step.The two platforms share five of the same shareholders in Getco, one of the world’s largest proprietary trading firms, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.They were set up less than five years ago to compete against incumbent exchanges as a way of pressuring them to lower fees and improve their technology. The effect has been impressive.In continental Europe, Chi-X accounts for 16 per cent of trading in shares, involving names such as Pernod Ricard and Siemens, with BATS on 5.6 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters. Combining them puts them level with Euronext.Meanwhile, a wave of mergers has swept the exchanges with the LSE reaching across the Atlantic in a planned tie-up with TMX Group, operator of the Toronto and Montreal bourses.Deutsche Börse, the German exchange, unveiled details this week of its plan to combine with NYSE Euronext, operator of the New York Stock Exchange. This would create a colossus with revenues almost four times bigger than the LSE or Nasdaq OMX.Mr Ratterman’s BATS group will still be dwarfed by the as-yet unnamed group. But to have become a venue where more shares are traded on a pan-European basis even than Deutsche Börse and (on good days) Euronext, surprises even him. BATS started competing in the US against NYSE and Nasdaq in 2006, and has captured 10 per cent market share of all US stock trading.Mr Ratterman says he had no idea when he started out that BATS would expand into Europe, let alone become the largest platform there. “None at all. We were going in to slay the dragons – NYSE and Nasdaq – and we were just heads down, plugging away at that. Then we looked up two years later and we did 2bn shares [in trading volume]. We were also a quarter of the size of the LSE and – holy cow – I had no idea we’d do that,” Mr Ratterman says.He is disdainful of the big exchange mergers happening around him. “Looking at these larger deals I just don’t see any synergies. I just see two organisations getting bigger.”Not content with taking on these exchanges in the US and Europe, BATS is also looking at Brazil. This week, it teamed up with a Brazilian asset manager to explore how to set up a trading platform to challenge BM&FBovespa, the country’s dominant exchange.Yet, as successful as BATS and Chi-X have been as share trading platforms, the exchanges – although burdened with far higher staff levels – are creating diversified businesses through their mergers, bulking up in products, such as derivatives.The combined BATS Chi-X Europe, as the new group will be known, plans to move into derivatives, according to Mark Hemsley, BATS Europe’s chief executive, but plans are not yet finalised.Offering market listings is also on the agenda, Mr Ratterman says. He acknowledges that the proliferation of new trading venues that only offer trading in a company’s shares, not the primary listing as exchanges do, has “decoupled” the markets.“That’s an area that we have looked at and we are learning what issuers get from listing on exchanges and how we can provide something differentiated.”"
455;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-02-18T18:28:21Z;Derivatives next step for Chi-X after BATS deal;;"BATS Global Markets, operator of the third largest stock exchange in the US, on Friday said it was considering a move into derivatives in Europe after finalising a deal to merge with Chi-X Europe to create the largest platform for share trading in Europe by volume.Mark Hemsley, chief executive of BATS Europe, the US-based company’s European platform, told FT Trading Room: “This year will be about integrating our companies and cash equity platforms. However both companies have ambitions in other products and derivatives is one of the obvious ones.”The move caps a week of frenetic consolidation among global exchanges, with Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext revealing details of a plan to build the world’s largest bourse, and the London Stock Exchange tying up with Canada’s TMX Group.It also shows that the exchanges’ smaller rivals are also bulking up to challenge the incumbents in cash equities trading. European exchanges have already lost significant market share to platforms like Chi-X Europe and BATS Europe, the European arm of BATS Global Markets.In Europe, competition has shrunk exchange revenues by 15 per cent since 2008, according to a report by Morgan Stanley and Oliver Wyman, a consultancy, published on Thursday.Joe Ratterman, president and chief executive of BATS Global Markets, said: “This transaction joins two successful and innovative market centers and will be a tremendous boost for competition in pan-European trading in the face of increasing consolidation among incumbent exchanges.”The latest combination would hand more than a third of trading in British blue-chip stocks to BATS, a company founded in Kansas City in 2005. It would also create a bigger competitor to NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse in French, Dutch and German stocks.In the US, BATS operates two stock exchanges and last year launched an options exchange which competes against eight others in the country. BATS this week signalled it had further ambitions, agreeing with a Brazilian asset manager to explore setting up a stock exchange in Brazil to rival BM&FBovespa, the incumbent.The Chi-X deal, yet to be approved by regulators, is being structured as a share swap, and values BATS Global Markets at $1.2bn, one person said. It also values Chi-X Europe at around $360m. BATS will initially pay $300m in cash, with an earn-out for Chi-X shareholders over a number of years based on its performance.Mr Hemsley - seen as front-runner to head the combined group in Europe - said: “One of the attractions for our shareholders is they had a chance to get equity participation rather than cash participation.”Some smaller investors in Chi-X will have their stakes cashed out. None of the banks that have stakes in Chi-X or BATS is being cashed outBATS Global Markets is widely expected to seek a stock market listing. Its combination with Chi-X Europe is seen by industry experts as a way of helping achieve a stronger transatlantic presence, and hence valuation, ahead of an IPO.Getco, a Chicago-based proprietary trading and market-making firm, would be a key beneficiary as it is a shareholder in both BATS and Chi-X.Chi-X Europe was launched in 2007 in response to the Mifid (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) rules enacted by the European Commission that broke exchange monopolies.Since then it has vaulted past many of Europe’s exchanges by offering faster trading and lower fees, sparking a price war in European share trading that mirrors similar developments in the US when BATS and Direct Edge emerged to challenge the NYSE and Nasdaq.Chi-X has captured 26 per cent of FTSE 100 share trading, second after the LSE, and 15 per cent of trading in continental European shares. BATS Europe has more than 9 per cent of the FTSE 100 and 5.3 per cent of continental sharesA combined BATS and Chi-X Europe creates a stronger competitor to the LSE, which has seen its market share in FTSE 100 shares fall to 55 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters.However neither BATS Europe nor Chi-X Europe has a derivatives business, nor do they control their clearing, which are both key aspects of many large exchanges’ business models.Mr Hemsley, a former executive at Liffe, the futures exchange operated by NYSE Euronext, said that the combination of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext “might actually help us” by creating a derivatives business with a 90 per cent market share in Europe.“If that’s allowed to happen by the regulatory and competition authorities there has got to be a quid pro quo which, in my mind, is that clearing in derivatives is opened up to multiple trading platforms and the contracts themselves are made fungible,” he said.As well as Getco, shareholders in Chi-X include Instinet, the brokerage arm of Nomura of Japan, a number of banks; Citadel Securities, and proprietary trading firm Optiver, based in the Netherlands. Chi-X and BATS share five of the same shareholders in Getco, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.BATS Global Markets was advised by Broadhaven Capital Partners, through Beech Hill Securities, with legal advice from Davis Polk & Wardwell and Macfarlanes. For Chi-X Europe, Lexicon Partners acted as financial adviser with Slaughter and May and Alston & Bird serving as legal advisers. Instinet retained Financial Technology Partners, a boutique advisory firm."
456;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-02-17T22:56:29Z;Quick View: Why CME will not go for NYSE Euronext;;"Duncan Niederauer has for the first time addressed the lack of a counter-bid for NYSE Euronext, since the exchange operator he heads unveiled its tie-up with Deutsche Börse to create the world’s largest exchange. At a briefing with the Financial Times in London, I asked him if he was surprised that the CME Group had not yet showed its hand or tried to break up the party. Some media have reported that the Chicago-based CME – possibly with Nasdaq in tow – was preparing a counter-strike.He answered: ”We saw the same rumours you saw. You’ve also seen the statements by the CME since then. I’m personally not surprised given the complexity of our business.”Mr Niederauer would not comment further. But to anyone who has followed the exchange business, it should come as no surprise that the CME has not yet come in. For a start, buying NYSE Euronext would be a can of worms for the CME, even if getting NYSE Liffe, its futures exchange, has its attractions.The last thing the CME wants is to be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is what would automatically happen if it bought an exchange – or even parts of one – that operate a stock or options exchange – as NYSE Euronext does. The SEC oversees stock and options exchanges while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates futures.Many people say that the CME has got the CFTC pretty much where it wants it to be on many issues that matter to the Chicago derivatives guys. The SEC would be a whole other ballgame and not nearly as …friendly. At least there is the risk of that, so why go there and become SEC regulated?Secondly, CME really is not interested in cash equities. In fact, Chicago views cash equities with the disdain that the New Yorkers used to have for Chicago’s derivatives business (until they realised that’s where the margin, growth and excitement are). Some analysts seem to be coming around to the view that no counter-bid is likely. On Thursday, Patrick O’Shaughnessy of Raymond James downgraded NYSE Euronext to “market perform” from “outperform”, on the grounds that a bidding war was “unlikely”.He added: “There are only a small number of exchanges with the size to make an unsolicited bid for NYSE Euronext, and some of the possible combinations tossed around have serious flaws. Furthermore, the modest premium that Deutsche Börse is paying for NYSE Euronext relative to our standalone fair value estimate, as well as the value creation for NYSE Euronext shareholders from the proposed synergies, will create a high hurdle for a competitive bid.”As further back-up for his thesis, he mentioned that Bernie Dan, former chief executive of the Chicago Board of Trade – taken over by CME in 2007 – thinks a takeover is unlikely.The other reason why CME is unlikely to make a move is the “F-word”: fungibility. This refers to the ability to open up one futures contract on one exchange at its clearing house and close it out at another and its clearing house – currently not permitted in the US. The CME would like to keep it that way, since this is largely how it maintains a 98 per cent market share in financial futures. If CME were to buy NYSE Euronext – and thus Liffe – there is a threat that the antitrust issue could be reopened – the one that raised its head briefly when Mr Dan was selling the CBOT to the CME.So, while I would never say never, I think the CME sits tight for now. It has enough on its plate anyway. Its last earnings showed a cost base running ahead of itself. It really needs to get on with further building its business outside the US, which it has made a pretty good start at with what it is doing in Brazil and Mexico and the alliances with exchanges there. It has just received approval for a London clearing house. We wait to see what products it will clear there.A combined NYSE Euronext/Deutsche Börse will dwarf CME Group on many counts, but is it really being the biggest that matters? Shareholders do not care; they just want returns from a scale business that is run efficiently on a global basis. And that is what the CME has every prospect of being.If there is a question in this for anyone, it is for Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX. The partners you might have been able to do a deal with already have hooked up with the remaining others – SGX with ASX; NYSE Euronext with Deutsche Börse and the London Stock Exchange with Canada’s TMX Group. Over to you, Bob."
457;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-02-17T19:51:26Z;NYSE and D Börse set $340m break-up fee;;NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse, who agreed a merger earlier this week, have set a price of €250m for abandoning the deal in favour of another combination.The large break-up fee is meant to discourage rivals from attempting to break up the deal, which is being done as a stock swap with only a nominal premium being paid for NYSE Euronext shares.Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill, says the fee “looks reasonable but at the same time substantial”. He said the fee of €250m, or $340m, was larger than the $288m break-up fee in the CME Group’s merger.Investment bankers have privately suggested that other groups who will see their competitive positions challenged by the new entity, notably CME Group, could attempt to step into the deal with its own bid for NYSE Euronext, either on its own or in combination with Nasdaq OMX.CME and Nasdaq have denied the rumours. Terrence Duffy, CME chief executive, told CNBC that he had not spoken to Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext.The stock swap will see 0.47 shares of NYSE Euronext and one share of Deutsche Börse exchanged for one share of a Netherlands-based holding company that will own the combined group. At NYSE’s current stock price of $37.14 and Deutsche’s price of €57.89, that implies a premium of less than $1 a share for NYSE.The small premium has also encouraged some speculation that it would not be prohibitively expensive for a larger exchange group, such as Brazil’s BM&FBovespa in Brazil or Hong Kong Exchanges Clearing Corporation, to step in.The Brazil exchange’s market capitalisation is $14.6bn, while Hong Kong’s market cap is $23.1bn. That compares to the $9.7bn value for NYSE Euronext.“We believe the three already announced cross-border exchange deals could drive further consolidation, but we believe this would be a 2012 event at the earliest and only after these deals get regulatory approval and have good visibility into promised synergies,” said Niamh Alexander, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, in a note to clients.But NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse have been in discussions for several years, according to people close to the deal, and are loathe to consider other alternatives.The two companies have carefully arranged the combination to preserve leadership roles for NYSE Euronext executives, including Mr Niederauer who will be chief executive of the combined group, while giving Deutsche Börse a majority of the seats on the board.“The value creation for NYSE Euronext shareholders from the proposed synergies, will create a high hurdle for a competitive bid,” said Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James.Mr O’Shaughnessy downgraded NYSE Euronext’s shares to market perform, from outperform, citing little risk of another bidder emerging to drive up shares.
458;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-02-16T00:51:47Z;Niederauer reassures ‘Big Börse’ traders;;Duncan Niederauer spent the best part of an hour on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, mingling with traders and being interviewed ahead of one of the most symbolic announcements of his – and the NYSE’s – time on Wall Street.NYSE Euronext was about to give details of its combination with Germany’s Deutsche Börse, creating the world’s largest exchange group.That will create a business far removed from the images that TV viewers see, of the few floor traders that make up NYSE Euronext’s overall share trading business these days.As they punched deals into their hand-held devices, a far bigger deal was being unveiled in New York and Frankfurt: a new exchange whose revenues would be almost five-times bigger than those of rival Nasdaq OMX, be dually headquartered in New York and Frankfurt and controlled by a board made up mostly of executives from the German exchange.A takeover? Mr Niederauer was doing his best to play that down.A name for the new beast will not be decided for two months, he said, even though some on the floor already liked the “Big Börse” – a riff on the Big Board. “Some of the traders on the floor are hoping we get Oktoberfest [the Munich beer festival] as a day’s holiday,” he joked.At least the traders heard reassurances that the floor would continue to be a part of the new business. They trace their heritage back to the men who met under the Buttonwood tree near what is now Wall Street in 1792, marking the exchange’s unofficial founding.“The trading floor’s not going anywhere,” Mr Niederauer said.The floor has become marginal as more trading has become electronic, but NYSE maintains it as a location for brokers to get a sense of trading activity and as a marketing tool to attract listings.“Do we acknowledge that small part of our business that is so iconic to our position? Yes. Do we acknowledge that it is challenged competitively? Absolutely,” Mr Niederauer said.Kenneth Polcari of Icap, a 28-year floor veteran, said: “Emotionally, it’s kind of sad to see NYSE change so dramatically, but we’re on the verge of an exciting opportunity.”Traders were also optimistic the new markets NYSE was bringing through its deal with Deutsche Börse would extend the reach of the small brokerages who still populate much of the floor.“We don’t have many international clients,” said Bernie McSherry of Cuttone & Company. “Now maybe we can change that.”
459;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-02-15T19:26:06Z;D Börse and NYSE unveil deal terms;;Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext have formally unveiled their plan to create what would be the largest stock and derivatives exchange run from dual headquarters in Frankfurt and New York.The move caps a week of frenetic merger activity among the world’s exchanges, but also carries the threat of counter-bids with speculation centred on CME Group, the new group’s main rival.In New York, the German and US groups appeared to have neutralised a backlash against the prospect of the New York Stock Exchange being absorbed in a group whose majority shareholders are from Deutsche Börse.Charles Schumer, senior Democratic senator for New York, said: “There are many things to like about this announcement, especially that it will open up new markets to NYSE and keep New York the world’s leading financial centre.”NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse said they were aiming to achieve extra savings of “at least” €100m ($135m) from the combination, in addition to synergies of €300m sketched out last week, through cross-selling of products. The combined group would have revenues of $5.4bn, and pro forma 2010 earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation of $2.7bn.The transaction would be structured as a combination of Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext under a new Netherlands-based holding company, which would list in Frankfurt, New York and Paris.Duncan Niederauer, the NYSE chief executive, will take the same role at the combined group. He said the name would not be DB-NYSE. “It won’t be ‘The Big Börse’ either. It’s still under discussion.”CME Group said it would “continue to monitor ongoing developments … and the implications of those developments on our long-term growth strategy”. The German-US combination would provide the biggest global rival for the CME Group, which dominates trading and clearing of interest rate futures, the biggest US financial futures contracts.A merged Deutsche Börse-Euronext would bring together similar European futures contracts traded on NYSE Liffe, NYSE Euronext’s London-based derivatives exchange, with Eurex, the Börse’s derivatives exchange.Questions are also gathering over the fate of Nasdaq OMX, whose chief financial officer Adena Friedman resigned unexpectedly late on Monday. Its market capitalisation of around $5.5bn makes it far smaller than the other three.Under the terms of the proposed deal, each Deutsche Börse share would be exchanged for one share of the new company, and each share of NYSE Euronext share would be exchanged for 0.47 shares of the new company. That would leave the new company 60 per cent owned by Deutsche Börse shareholders and 40 per cent by NYSE Euro-next investors. Nine of the merged group’s 17 board members (apart from the chief executive and chairman) would be appointed from Deutsche Börse and six from NYSE Euronext.Reto Francioni, chief executive of Deutsche Börse, would be chairman of the merged group.Shares in NYSE Euronext opened down 4.1 per cent in New York at $37.83, while Deutsche Börse shares were down 0.7 per cent at €60.88 in Frankfurt.The proposed merger is subject to approval by a majority of NYSE Euronext shareholders and by 75 per cent of Deutsche Börse shareholders. It would also require the blessing of competition and financial, securities and other regulatory authorities in the US and Europe.Deutsche Börse was advised by Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan Securities, while Perella Weinberg and BNP Paribas acted for NYSE Euronext.
460;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-02-14T23:03:20Z;CME signs up dealers for swap clearing;;CME Group announced on Monday that is has signed up a group of 10 global swap dealers as founding members for its clearing service for over-the-counter interest-rate swaps.This brings together a host of big dealers with buyside investment firms including BlackRock, Citadel, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Pimco. Since the CME clearing service was launched last October, it has cleared just under $1bn in gross notional value.The dealers include: Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays Capital, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Nomura and UBS.Over-the-counter clearing is a critical part of CME’s growth plan for the next few years.The company’s leadership has been targeting international customer growth as central to its business – focusing its efforts, for example, on its new European clearing house.However, with last week’s revelation that NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse are planning to merge, such initiatives could be curtailed. That would place even more pressure on CME to make OTC clearing a success.One uncertainty is regulation. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is still crafting rules to govern the OTC market and it will be difficult for clearing houses to garner much volume before the shape of those rules is clear.More fundamentally, questions remain about how much business the dealers will put through CME’s clearing house and the profitability of clearing OTC transactions. CME scrapped a previous attempt to establish a trading platform for credit-default swaps after failing to garner dealer support.CME faces a battle to clear swaps with LCHClearnet in interest rates and ICE Trust in credit derivatives. International Derivatives Clearing Group, a clearing house backed by Nasdaq is also trying to gain traction with clearing interest-rate swaps.NYSE Euronext in conjunction with the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation is also pushing ahead with plans to offer clearing for interest-rate futures.Terry Duffy, CME Group executive chairman said: “The non-binding term sheet entered into today provides additional momentum and further demonstrates dealers’ commitment to support our solution and reduce systemic risk in the market.”Under Dodd-Frank, the US financial regulatory reform legislation, ‘standardised’ swaps must be cleared through a Derivatives Clearing Organisation or DCO. In turn a cleared swap must trade on a Swap Execution Facility, with large blocks that are cleared, reported to an exchange or SEF.The CME hopes ultimately to allow traders to cross-margin OTC contracts with its benchmark futures.
461;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Nasdaq top executive to leave;;Adena Friedman, a long-time top executive at Nasdaq OMX Group, is leaving to join a private equity group.Her departure comes at a critical moment for Nasdaq, which is facing a rapidly changing competitive landscape amid an announced merger of the London Stock Exchange and TMX Group, and a pending union of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Börse.Ms Friedman has been chief financial officer of Nasdaq since 2009, playing a critical part in the acquisition of OMX, the Nordic exchange, and PHLX, the US options exchange. In a previous job at Nasdaq she played a role in acquiring Island ECN, now called INET.“She had done an outstanding job at Nasdaq,” said Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill. “There’s going to be a lot of interesting financial scenarios to evaluate in the near future, so they will need to replace her quickly.”She will join the Carlyle Group in Washington DC as chief financial officer. A source familiar with the situation said that Ms Friedman had planned to leave Nasdaq before the recent merger announcements.Ronald Hassen, senior vice president at Nasdaq, will become interim CFO, the company said in a statement.This is the latest in a series of departures from Nasdaq’s top ranks over the past few years as it has struggled to regain its pre-crisis valuation following a decrease in its market share of equities trading.Chris Concannon, the head of Nasdaq’s abandoned equities clearing effort, and Darren Mulholland, a top executive in its technology group, left in 2009.David Warren, Nasdaq’s former CFO, who also left in 2009, will return as a special adviser to Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive.Mr Greifeld faces the difficult challenge of steering Nasdaq into new businesses, such as derivatives clearing and growing its options trading volumes, as well as protecting its franchise cash equity listings and trading market.Analysts suggested that the likelihood of Nasdaq being involved in a transaction have increased.Christopher Allen, analyst at Evercore Partners, said: “Nasdaq is in a decent spot. The deals getting announced create a scarcity value in this space.”However, he said that on its own, the changes in the US market do not necessarily imply a deal is required.The new NYSE-Deutsche Börse entity would not add market share in US equities, but could challenge Nasdaq’s options group, the market leader in the fourth quarter of 2010.The new entity would combine NYSE Arca Options, NYSE Amex Options, and the International Securities Exchange, in which Deutsche Börse controls a stake.Together they would represent 40 per cent of US options trading volume, but the individual exchanges are expected to still compete against each other. Banks and customers have also expressed concerns about a concentration of market power.“That combination could result in market share loss,” said Mr Allen.
462;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-02-14T09:41:59Z;Exchange mergers;Shareholders should focus on the risk of political intervention;"Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext should announce the terms of a merger any day now. Rather than worrying about the new entity’s name, shareholders should focus on the risk that politicians could throw a spanner in the works. Two grounds might prompt them to get involved.First is competition. Second is the desire of financial centres to defend their patch. Both suggest that this merger, like past exchange mergers, could become a political saga, with attendant arbitrage opportunities.Cash equities barely present any antitrust issues as rival electronic platforms have made the trading business highly competitive. But US options might be a problem. The merger would combine the second and third-largest options businesses by volume, with about 42 per cent of the market. But the market is competitive, with the Chicago Board Options Exchange and Nasdaq offering significant alternatives, so antitrust regulators will not necessarily get involved.European futures are more problematic. Between them, Deutsche Börse’s Eurex and NYSE’s Liffe have a 90 per cent share while barriers to new entrants are high. This seems a deal breaker.But the exchanges can cite the merger of the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a combination similar to Eurex-Liffe, as a precedent. Further, the CME Group wants to compete in Europe; the new exchange could argue that a new goliath is needed to keep the established one in check. A forced divestment of one of the futures exchanges is not, therefore, inevitable, but cannot be ruled out.Nationalism may be more dangerous. This new exchange has significant businesses in New York, Frankfurt, London and Paris. It will be hard to cut 12 per cent of the combined cost base, as announced, without leaving one of these worse off. Financial nationalism is anachronistic for this global business, but it is nevertheless dangerous.E-mail the Lex team in confidence"
463;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Call for security ‘conditions’ on exchange tie-ups;;Robert Menendez, a US senator, said there should be “conditions” put on any global exchange tie-up to ensure that cybersecurity concerns are addressed.Mr Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey where many exchanges’ servers are located, cited the recent news of hacking attacks against Nasdaq OMX, which acknowledged that “suspicious files” were detected on one of its web sites.“We should be looking at whatever we develop in terms of cybersecurity protection to be incorporated as a condition to any merger,” said Mr Menendez in a conference call.In a proposed merger between NYSE Euronext, based in New York, and Deutsche Börse, based in Frankfurt, some of the trading businesses and servers would be located in Europe.“Agencies have to work together, so both require notification procedures as a requirement of any merger,” he said. “There are questions about cyber attacks on foreign companies and whether they could get to US exchanges, and the notification of those attacks.”Mr Menendez repeated his call, originally made in a letter earlier this week to Mary Schapiro, US Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, for a “thorough investigation into the risk to our nations’ financial infrastructure”.That letter asked the SEC to consider what measures if any should be required of exchanges and other financial groups to report instances of cyberterrorism to investors.“Investors [in an exchange] should know what’s happening, to the extent they’re under cyberattack, and whether those breaches have material consequences,” he said on Thursday.He also said in the next few weeks he planned to reintroduce the Cybersecurity Enforcement Act, a bill passed last year by the US House of Representatives with bipartisan support but which was not taken up by the Senate.The bill would dedicate $600m through 2014 to government programmes to prevent and research cyberterrorism at financial centres, oil refineries and other critical infrastructure.Nasdaq OMX said it found no evidence that files on its Directors Desk web site, which stores documents for corporate boards, were affected by the attack. It also said the Directors Desk site is not connected to its trading systems.Some experts say the dangers of market structure breakdowns, such as the “flash crash”, are greater than cyberterrorism.“The biggest concern over trading venues, as we saw with the ‘flash crash’, which could certainly have caused political or economic instability, is something going wrong with an algorithm,” said John Bates, chief technology officer of Progress Software, which builds real-time data monitoring systems for financial groups.
464;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-02-10T09:33:57Z;Exchange fever;Politicians should leave the NYSE-Deutsche Börse merger well alone;There are end games and there are end games. Five years ago, the scrap between the NYSE group and Deutsche Börse for control of Euronext, and Nasdaq’s attempt to buy the London Stock Exchange, appeared to be the end game. Now we know different. On Wednesday, the LSE said it would merge with TMX, operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange. The subsequent revelation that Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext were in advanced merger talks then put that deal in the shade.The first end game involved acquisitions at silly valuations (the NYSE’s earnings multiple peaked at about 66, according to Bloomberg data), backed by overblown growth stories. Politicians treated exchanges as a matter of national importance.The Dow Jones Global Exchanges index is still 46 per cent below its peak. The new end game recognises the changed reality for exchanges. These are mergers of equals which – despite gaudy public relations packaging – are about cutting costs. Investors seem fine with that, judging by the 16 per cent pop in NYSE Euronext’s shares after its talks were announced, and the positive reception for the LSE-TMX deal.What has changed? The first “end game” valuations reflected the credit bubble, of course, but also unrealistic expectations for the sector’s profitability, as it enjoyed an unsustainable one-off upward shift with the move from mutuality to a for-profit model. Alternative trading systems are increasingly eating their lunch, making cash equities – exchanges’ highest-profile business – virtually irrelevant. Technology ensures that stock exchanges are no longer natural monopolies, so the best approach for incumbent is to bulk up and focus on derivatives, particularly futures, where entry costs remain prohibitive.Where next? Investors must make sure that the NYSE-Deutsche Börse numbers stack up. It must face EU and US antitrust scrutiny. But beyond that, politicians should leave well alone. These are not strategically vital companies.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
465;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-02-09T15:54:47Z;LSE / TMX;Merger should benefit both parties unless there is a commodities fall;The London Stock Exchange has never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity. Its merger with Canada’s TMX, operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange, partially reverses this dismal pattern. The transaction is low-risk, and will work out well if the commodity boom keeps going. But it is not as great an opportunity as the many the LSE spurned, and neither is it as great an opportunity as the market currently seems to believe.Downside risk is not great. The two exchanges are a good fit, and have bent over backwards to include everyone in the new management. They combine the two biggest venues for listing mining companies, giving them the superlatives companies like to spout when unveiling a merger. The valuation, close to market, is uncontroversial. Projected synergies of £35m in the first two years, out of LSE’s 2010 cost base of £350m, sound plausible.Revenue “synergies” (projected at £100m per year by the fifth year) should, as always, be taken with a pinch of salt. TMX might help the LSE redress its historic weakness in derivatives. The LSE’s MTS platform might help Toronto to build a business in government bonds. None of this should be relied on.Further, revenues might be hurt by a commodities downturn, while the LSE’s price/earnings multiple of 25, double Nasdaq OMX’s and richer than either the CME or NYSE Euronext, enshrines hopes for a continued boom. Wednesday’s 10 per cent rise in LSE’s share price suggests the market thinks TMX is worth more, and might yet prompt a rival bid. But none of this affects the underlying common sense of the transaction.Buying Liffe, or selling itself to Nasdaq for twice its current share price, would have been far better deals for the LSE. But at least it has grasped one of the few remaining opportunities in an almost consolidated sector.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
466;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-02-09T03:38:21Z;Cyber-attack raises SEC questions;;US lawmakers have questioned the Security and Exchange Commission’s ability to fight cybercrime after the attempted hacking of the Nasdaq OMX stock exchange.In a letter to the SEC, Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey said that the “disturbing information” about the hacking raised questions about the regulator’s preparedness to fight such attacks.Nasdaq acknowledged this week, after a report in the Wall Street Journal, that it had detected “suspicious files” on the website of one of its subsidiaries last year, but that investigators had asked the exchange not to reveal it until February.Nasdaq said the attack was not directed at its trading and exchange systems but at Directors Desk, a service that allows corporate board members to share and collaborate on documents over the internet. Nasdaq said it had no evidence that any documents had been compromised.Mr Menendez called for the agency to launch an investigation into the vulnerability of US exchanges. “Although Nasdaq’s trading platform was reportedly not affected by this particular example of hacking …I have much broader concerns about the implications of this data security breach for market trading and future financial crises,” he said. Nasdaq declined to comment, as did the other exchanges contacted.US representatives Spencer Bachus of Alabama and Scott Garrett of New Jersey also sent a letter to Nasdaq, the SEC and several other exchanges and regulators, urging that the breach “should be treated seriously” even if it had not affected the trading system.“At a time when investor confidence remains fragile, the hacking of a network that contains nonpublic inside, material information that could be used illegally to gain a trading advantage is especially disconcerting,” they wrote. Mr Menendez asked the SEC to consider “what policies, if any, are in place concerning when exchanges and other trading companies are required to publicly report information of security breaches”.Nasdaq said it had immediately alerted US authorities when it discovered the suspicious files late last year, but people close to the investigation have said that the US Secret Service might have been tracking the breach for at least a year. The US Department of Justice had also asked Nasdaq not to reveal the attack until this month.The agencies could not be reached for comment. The New York-based cybercrime unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is said to be leading the inquiry, but could also not be reached for comment.
467;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-02-09T01:07:27Z;LSE hopes TMX will turn its transatlantic vision into reality;;"For as long as many in the City can remember, the London Stock Exchange has been prey, stalked by some of the world’s biggest bourses.Clara Furse’s tenure as chief executive was marked by a grinding battle to fend off hostile takeover attempts by Deutsche Börse and Nasdaq OMX of the US, eager to snap up a trophy among world exchanges.Yet Dame Clara’s successor, Frenchman Xavier Rolet, is now on the cusp of doing a deal with an exchange operator in Canada.If advanced talks between the LSE and TMX Group , operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange, lead to a deal, the combined entity would still rank only seventh behind NYSE Euro-next, Deutsche Börse, CME Group of Chicago and even the Brazilian and Hong Kong exchanges, measured by the exchanges as listed companies. So why is this happening?The 210-year-old bourse has suffered as upstart trading platforms such as Chi-X Europe, formed in 2007, have cut the LSE’s share of trading in FTSE 100 stocks to below 60 per cent – a far cry from its near-monopoly position of a few years
earlier.The LSE has also long lacked two crucial pieces of business that its rivals developed while it was distracted by takeover attempts: derivatives and clearing, both lucrative additions to the share trading business that have helped boost multiples at the LSE’s rivals.Mr Rolet has certainly shaken up the LSE since he came on board in May 2009, slashing headcount by more than 10 per cent, buying a Sri Lankan technology company whose trading systems are being installed throughout the exchange, in part to attract the “high-frequency” traders that are now the lifeblood of most mature exchanges.He is also working on a plan to launch equity derivatives, setting the LSE up for a head-on clash with NYSE Liffe and Eurex, the Deutsche Börse futures arm, both of which dominate derivatives in Europe.Yet those moves alone are unlikely to deliver on Mr Rolet’s ultimate goal of restoring the LSE to top table of global exchanges.By picking TMX Group, Mr Rolet has spotted something big: mining and resources.Both bourses are home to a huge number of mining and resource company listings – the key attraction of the deal.The two together would have more company listings than any other exchange – more than 6,300, compared with NYSE Euronext’s 4,500. And that would create a resources behemoth at a time of high commodity prices and unprecedented activity in exploration.TMX Group has for some time been viewed as a logical partner for the LSE.An early sign of the flirtation between London and Toronto came back in March 2009, when they agreed a “strategic partnership”.The challenge will be to turn the transatlantic vision into reality, as long as the mining and resources boom lasts."
468;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-02-08T22:36:31Z;Nasdaq looks to derivatives to boost margins;;Outside the office window of Robert Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, the global exchange operator, progress on the Ground Zero rebuilding is visible, with the Freedom Tower up to 40 storeys.Mr Greifeld, meanwhile, is presiding over Nasdaq’s own transformation, from a stock exchange to a more diversified group, the fruits of which he hopes will soon be visible to investors.US equity trading volumes have declined and margins have been squeezed by competition from upstart exchanges and venues such as BATS Exchange and Direct Edge.But Nasdaq’s shares hit a 2½-year high this week – its 40th anniversary – following full-year results that showed it generated more revenues from derivatives than equities for the first time in its history, which also resulted in record earnings for the fourth quarter.Mr Greifeld, who has run Nasdaq since 2003, says the most recent quarter marks “a watershed”. Nasdaq, like its peers, has been attempting to diversify away from low-yielding equities into derivatives, which provide higher margins in a faster-growing market.Mr Greifeld says he is expecting an upswing as investors return to higher-yielding stocks from low-yield but less-risky fixed income investments. “We look forward to enjoying the change of investor psychology,” he says.But Nasdaq’s rebound is not yet complete. Post-crisis, it has seen its share price trail that of its rival NYSE Euronext. The shares are up 32 per cent since the market bottom in March 2009, versus an 86 per cent rise for NYSE and a 75 per cent rise in the S&P 500 index.While NYSE engineered a 2007 merger with Euronext, operator of exchanges across Europe, Nasdaq has made several smaller acquisitions in recent years. It began with OMX, the Nordic exchange group acquired for $3.7bn in 2007, and PHLX, the US single-stock options market, acquired for $652m in the same year.More recently, Nasdaq has launched an over-the-counter derivatives clearing house and a power market in the UK.That has been an expensive and difficult strategy at times. Costs have risen sharply, with Nasdaq recently forecasting expenses for 2011 that exceeded analysts’ estimates. Its total debt-to-operating earnings ratio is higher than that of rivals NYSE Euronext and CME Group.Last year, Nasdaq closed Nasdaq OMX Europe, its attempt to build a pan-European share trading business, after it attracted persistently low volumes. Nasdaq also lost out to BATS Global Markets, parent of BATS Exchange, in the running to buy Chi-X Europe, a much larger pan-European trading platform than the failed Nasdaq venture and which is now the second largest trading venue in Europe.None of that seems to bother Mr Greifeld. “There are not many [exchanges] making much money in pan-European trading today,” he says.Nasdaq also sold $367m in debt to finance a repurchase of its shares held by Borse Dubai. Diego Perfumo, analyst at Equity Research Desk, said: “That is what you see in a mature business. They are using balance sheet leverage because operating leverage in trading is minimal, with so much competition and traders demanding big rebates.”Mr Greifeld sees opportunities to reverse that perception of maturity in derivatives. With equity derivatives, he aims to build on the growth of its single stock options market – which took top market share in the US, beating rival Chicago Board Options Exchange – by launching higher-margin proprietary products.“We see what CBOE has done with the Vix and its proprietary indices, and it’s our job to innovate,” says Mr Greifeld.Nasdaq will this year launch options on its Alpha index, which was created by the same economist who developed the Vix volatility index for CBOE. It has also invested in expanded services for stock issuers, such as investor relations and tools for corporate boards, as a way to fend off a more aggressive campaign by NYSE to win US listings, especially in the technology sector.“It’s been a high-revenue growth opportunity for us,” says Mr Greifeld.However, it has also increased Nasdaq’s exposure to cybercrime, already a concern for exchanges. It was revealed last week that Directors Desk, a cloud-based tool for corporate boards to share information, was hacked into last year. Nasdaq said the attack did not lead to any documents being stolen and did not threaten its trading systems.Mr Greifeld sees opportunities in the technology around market structures, such as surveillance and pre-trade risk management, increasingly a focus for regulators as they seek to ensure that high-frequency trading does not jeopardise market systems. Last year, Nasdaq acquired FTEN, a US provider of pre-trade risk software, and Smarts, an Australian group that tracks market data for regulators.“[Market] surveillance is not adequate, at the regulator level, the broker-dealer level, the exchange level,” he says. “We didn’t buy Chi-X, we bought FTEN and Smarts, and we obviously feel pretty good about that.”
469;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-02-07T21:33:33Z;Hacking fears raised by Nasdaq OMX attack;;Nasdaq OMX’s confirmation that it has been targeted by hackers has thrown the spotlight firmly on IT security at the world’s exchanges, a crucial part of many countries’ capital markets.But does that mean it is possible for hackers, even cyberterrorists, to bring down an exchange, causing financial mayhem?Nasdaq said over the weekend that it had discovered “suspicious files” on servers, but that these were unrelated to its trading systems. It said that its “web-facing” application, called Directors Desk, was “potentially affected”.Breaking into an exchange’s trading system would be extremely hard, experts say, because exchanges have developed multiple layers of security to stop that happening. They involve complex software protocols and the use of algorithms that constantly, and randomly, change security codes.Many exchanges run on a separate private network, often with its own computing language. To trade on the London Stock Exchange, for example, one must be a member or be given access via a broker, known as “sponsored access”.Any new trading firm would then have to mesh their networks to the trading venue. Each layer requires extensive background checks and testing. “There are controls for anything that is fundamental to trading between buyer and seller,” says Bob Fuller, a director of Fixnetix, a trading technology company.A more plausible threat is one where an exchange is bombarded with trades from a pre-programmed computer algorithm. The “flash crash” in US markets last year was triggered by an algorithm in the futures markets which malfunctioned, sending the Dow Jones average down 1,000 points – and back up again – in 20 minutes.Safety catches known as circuit-beakers are now in place to help prevent a disaster. Last week Mary Schapiro, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said the agency was now looking beyond that and considering tougher brakes known as “limit-up/limit-down style trading parameters”.Yet the attempted hacking on Nasdaq has sparked broader concerns about information security, particularly for data that can be stolen and used for insider trading. Last week, trading on Europe’s carbon markets resumed after the alleged theft of €30m ($40.7m) of carbon trading permits from national registries.In the Nasdaq case, it was an online registry that was targeted, called Directors Desk. The service is a web-based “cloud” application that stores data of thousands of Fortune 500 companies that are only supposed to be accessed by authorised users such as the directors of the companies themselves. In other words, it is a rich mine of market-moving, inside information.No details of how the alleged hacking into Europe’s carbon emissions permits have emerged but experts suspect that passwords used by corporate traders such as cement groups and manufacturers have been passed to sophisticated organised criminals.“This is definitely something that is targeted based on a specific reward,” says William Beer, director at One Security, the IT security practice at PwC, a consultancy group.Directors Desk is an example of a phenomenon that is growing at exchanges: offering extra services, often web-based, as a way to attract companies to list. Nasdaq offers these under a package it calls “corporate solutions”, including a service aimed at company investor relations staff that integrates corporate shareholder communications, capital market information and “board-level reporting” – all on one computer screen.Yet the vulnerability of Directors Desk has highlighted tension between the competitive pressures exchanges are under to offer such services online, and the risks that they can be hacked for insider trading. “It’s a question of what people are willing to put in a semi-secure area to promote business,” says a senior executive at a rival European exchange. “It’s also a question of what is at risk when someone gets into that environment.”NYSE Euronext has a similar service called eGovDirect.com but it was taken down last week for maintenance and has yet to return. NYSE said the issue was technical and not related to the Nasdaq issue. “We take any potential threat seriously and we are continually working to ensure that our systems operate at the highest levels of security and integrity,” it said.Experts say web-based services act as a back door for hackers and, as in the carbon market, one of the most lucrative ways is by hacking existing, credible and normally trustworthy names. As new products like computer tablets emerge, the proliferation of internet-based “apps” makes hacking more likely.“Two major developments that are creating risks for clients are the cloud and mobile,” says Mr Beer. “[Exchanges] are trying to have that flexibility. But it’s introducing new risks.”“It was inevitable,” says Justin Magruder, chief executive of Noetic Partners, which builds trading data systems. “Virtualisation is a relatively new application and is very complex. My assumption is that most clouds are vulnerable because of the sheer number of access points, and many have already been hacked. We just don’t hear about it.”Directors Desk, the website that was the source of the attempted hacking at Nasdaq, is part of a suite of corporate services that Nasdaq offers to attract issuers to its marketplace, writes Telis Demos.Nasdaq acquired the company in 2007. It provides web-based collaboration tools to some 5,000 companies, enabling executives and board members to share documents, communicate and vote on proposals.On its website, it says it complies with international security standards, “providing multiple levels of protection to guard our clients’ confidential data against undesired access”.On Monday morning, Directors Desk sent out a message to clients acknowledging the attempted breach, but said that no files were compromised.“Clients right now are probably doing a damage assessment, asking what’s up there that could hurt them,” said Wayne Matus, a partner at Pillsbury.
470;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-02-07T11:11:04Z;Quick View: Now it’s Euronext’s turn;Battle over European equities is brewing;It looks like a nice little battle is brewing over the Euronext markets.On Friday Turquoise announced it was cutting the fee it charges traders for coming to its platform and matching orders that are already resting there, awaiting execution, for Euronext stocks.The promotion, which will take effect on March 1, will reduce the fee for so-called “aggressive” trading in all Euronext shares offered on Turquoise from 0.3 basis points to 0.25 basis points.Natan Tiefenbrun, commercial director of Turquoise, says that by cutting the fee for aggressive trading, Turquoise will be ranked higher in the pecking order at brokers’ smart order routers, increasing the chance of aggressive orders coming to the platform. This will offer brokers increased probability of execution for their clients’ limit orders, and so should also encourage the posting of more “passive” liquidity.The price war in European equities had quietened down in recent months. It looks like it may be flaring up again.But two things in the background are just as interesting. One thing is what Euronext has been doing with its prices and the other is the disruptive effect of the arrival in the Paris markets of Equiduct.Since it launched quietly Equiduct – controlled by Citadel Securities, the Chicago-based fund manager and securities broker – has made some impressive inroads in French stocks. That must be irritating, if you’re Euronext.A quick glance at the market-share statistics pages on BATS Europe’s website shows that Equiduct has captured 1.28 per cent of the CAC 40, and 2.91 in the next 20 biggest CAC stocks – ie: the mid- and small-caps.The numbers sound small, but this is not bad for a platform that’s only been around for a short time. It also shows that its message is getting through to the small- and mid-sized brokers and banks that handle a lot of retail order flow – Equiduct’s targets.The trajectory looks encouraging in volume terms: Equiduct claims to have handled €1bn in November, rising to €2.6bn last month and apparently believes it can double that next month. It is also in talks with new potential members, such as French and Italian online brokers, about joining.Meanwhile Euronext has not made many friends with some recent actions. On February 1, it switched the way its charges for small- and mid-cap stocks, charging high-volume users a mixture of “ad valorem” or a flat fee.Sources tell me it also raised fees on the trading of small caps on Euronext that are not listed on any other venue – captive business, in other words. It also raised fees on its auctions. And last week it told customers it would unilaterally reduce the increments by which share prices are allowed to fluctuate – so-called “tick sizes” – on Dutch and French blue chips shares from next month.Euronext issued a statement saying: “The changes is our fee structure were done to align them with the industry standard by lowering tariff on the most liquid stocks and encourage the continued liquidity on our order book which results in superior market quality in terms of depth of quote and time at the European Best Bid/Offer.“We believe that auctions provide the fairest and most efficient mechanism for determining the opening and closing price of a security. The price discovery mechanism for determining the opening or closing price of a security via the auction processes provides substantial value to users and is priced differently from the continuous trading session.”At the same time Euronext has been doing the rounds of small and mid-sized French brokers and banks about to go live on Equiduct talking about ways in which Euronext could offer similar pricing and functionality, possibly imported from the US where the parent group is already using it, those sources tell me.Euronext’s dilemma is that it is a platform with multiple different types of participants, so a tariff structure that appeals to one segment of them may not appeal to another. This is an Achilles heel that Equiduct is no doubt trying to exploit, since it is first and foremost an aggregator of retail order flow from mid-sized continental European banks and brokers. It’s a problem that many “legacy” exchanges have, in fact.Nasdaq OMX has got around this by creating highly differentiated new segments, such as PSX, launched in October as a way of targeting block orders that are heading to “dark pools”. In Europe, the London Stock Exchange has Turquoise, which no doubt can be differentiated from the main LSE order book accordingly as well.Euronext still has over 65 per cent of CAC 40 stocks. And its pan-European volumes were up 44 per cent from December to their highest level since May last year.Yet Patrick O’Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James, said in a note on Friday: “We are a bit concerned about the long-term trend of falling market share for the firm, as its share of exchange-traded volume in Euronext-listed stocks fell 1.7 per cent on a sequential monthly basis and remained below 70 per cent for the fourth straight month.”The battle has only just begun.
471;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-02-06T19:40:49Z;Exchanges on high alert after hacker attack;Officials investigate cyberattack;Nasdaq OMX, the global exchange operator, said it had been targeted by hackers who breached its system but did not compromise its trading operations.The attack is the most recent in a string of worrying events, including attacks on Europe’s carbon trading market, but early evidence suggested that it was possibly related to corporate espionage rather than a cyberattack on the US financial market.People familiar with the investigation said they were not yet aware of the intended target of the attack, which was originally reported by the Wall Street Journal.Nasdaq said its trading systems were not targeted. The attack came in the form of “suspicious files” known as “malware”, pointed at its Directors Desk service, a web-based application where some 5,000 companies store documents for board members, raising fears that the target may not have been Nasdaq, but a company that uses the service.The files were detected late last year, and Nasdaq says it immediately contacted forensic groups and US law enforcement agencies. The files were deleted and Nasdaq says there is “no evidence” that information on Directors Desk was accessed by hackers. Directors Desk’s systems are not connecting to the trading systems, Nasdaq said.The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s New York cybercrime unit, along with the US Department of Justice’s Southern District of New York is investigating the attack. Nasdaq said it is co-operating with officials on an ongoing inquiry.“We continue to evaluate and enhance our advanced security controls to respond to the ever-increasing global cyber threat and continue to devote extensive resources to further secure our systems,” Nasdaq said in a statement.Industrial espionage is a top concern of US intelligence and law enforcement, who say the theft of corporate secrets is far more pervasive than most Americans realise.Directors Desk is designed for use by members of corporate boards, who often review confidential documents related to corporate strategy and discussions of mergers and acquisitions under consideration.Such troves could quickly be turned into millions of dollars by trading in options or stock in companies about to be acquired, or by parties seeking an edge in negotiating a deal.In one case last year, a big US-based consumer products group abandoned talks to acquire a Chinese company for a sum in the “low billions” of dollars after discovering that its executives’ e-mails had been accessed, with the trail leading back to China, said Christopher Glyer, a manager at security group Mandiant.Exchanges say that while attempts by hackers to target them are not unusual, no major breaches have been reported. The London Stock Exchange considered the possibility of “sabotage” after a recent trading halt, but ultimately concluded it was due to “human error”.Last week, however, the operators of Europe’s carbon emissions trading markets suspended business in their spot emissions contracts after the European Union said its carbon trading platform had come under attack from cyber-thieves. But the danger of manipulating trading systems is remote, said Bob Fuller, a director of Fixnetix, a financial technology consulting group.“There are controls for anything that is fundamental to trading between buyer and seller,” he said.
472;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-02-02T21:12:20Z;Nasdaq OMX boosted by derivatives surge;;Nasdaq OMX saw a sharp boost to its shares after its fourth-quarter revenues from US derivatives exceeded that from US stock trading.The transatlantic exchange group’s shares, like those of its close competitor NYSE Euronext, have tumbled in recent years while it lost market share to off-exchange venues and start-up trading platforms.In response, Nasdaq has tried to shift its business toward options and technology. Investors have greeted the shift cautiously, with Nasdaq’s shares trading at an average discount of 12 per cent to the S&P 500 before Wednesday’s results.But the shares shot up 4.7 per cent to $26.51 on Wednesday, to their highest level in just over two years after Nasdaq said US derivatives trading net revenues, which includes Nasdaq’s options markets, grew to $42m in the three months to December 1, up 35 per cent over the quarter last year.That exceeded the $37m in total revenues in US cash equities, which grew from $29m in revenues from a year ago after Nasdaq adjusted its rebate rates to traders. Nasdaq’s overall share of US trading in the quarter declined from 24 per cent from 20 per cent a year ago.For the full year, Nasdaq’s revenues were $265m for derivatives and $255m for cash equities, the first time derivatives produced more revenues than stocks in the exchange’s history.“Nasdaq continued to demonstrate the benefits of diversification away from US equities,” said Rich Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill.Bob Greifeld, chief executive, pointed to efforts such as the acquisition of the North American Energy Credit and Clearing Corporation, a clearinghouse for the power and gas markets, last year.Revenues from the International Derivatives Clearing Group, a US interest-rate swap clearinghouse launched in 2008, also improved as more swaps are cleared in anticipation of the Dodd-Frank reforms.“In derivatives, we have a lot of different growth initiatives, and we are optimistic about a number of them. They clearly worked in the fourth quarter, and we hope they continue to work going into 2011,” Mr Greifeld told the Financial Times.Overall group revenues, net of rebates and other fees, were $400m in the fourth quarter, up from $369m a year ago, and better than analyst expectations of $384m.Group earnings tripled thanks to a one-time tax boost after a restructuring and job cuts during the quarter, from $43m to $137m. Earnings per share rose from 20 cents per share to 69 cents, against analyst forecasts of 51 cents.Nasdaq cautioned that its costs for the coming year would rise following recent acquisitions. Operating expenses for the coming year would be between $920m and $940m after recent small acquisitions of Smarts, the Australian market surveillance software group, and FTEN, the pre-risk trade management group.“While expense guidance was above our expectations, it seems to be due in part to the impact of certain acquisitions and foreign exchange, and not to any real loss of Nasdaq’s famous expense discipline,” said Ed Ditmire, an analyst at Macquarie Securities in New York.For the year to December 31, revenues fell from $2.9bn to $2.7bn while net income rose from $266m to $395m. Earnings per share rose from $1.25 to $1.91.
473;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-01-30T18:09:18Z;Nasdaq OMX lures trades to platform;;Nasdaq OMX has captured up to 1 per cent of total US share trading on a new type of platform that aims to lure large blocks of trades back on to exchanges.The claim by Eric Noll, head of US trading operations at Nasdaq OMX, comes as regulators are questioning the effects of off-exchange trading – including “dark pools”, where orders are matched anonymously – on overall market transparency.This week the European Commission will consider industry feedback on its plans to overhaul the rules that have helped allow off-exchange venues to proliferate. The review of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive is the first time Brussels has examined the effects of the directive on share trading since it was introduced in 2007.The overhaul is focusing on ways to increase the transparency of public share price reporting and proposes a new regime for the trading of over-the-counter derivatives that mirrors reforms in the Dodd-Frank act, passed by the US Congress last year.Off-exchange trading has grown as large traders have shied away from exchanges and other “lit” venues – so-called because prices are displayed before trades are matched. Off-exchange venues post prices only after trades are done, reducing the risk of investors revealing their hand to the wider market in advance.So-called “dark pools” executed a record 12 per cent of market trading volume in December, according to Rosenblatt Securities, a broker.Nasdaq OMX set up PSX three months ago as a way of attracting some of those large orders back to its platform.Mr Noll told the Financial Times that PSX accounted for as much as 1 per cent of total US market volume on some days since its launch. PSX executes the largest trading orders before the most recent ones posted, which has been the typical model for lit platforms.The average size of a trade on PSX is also 30 per cent larger than trades on Nasdaq’s traditional market, the exchange says, signalling that it has attracted such institutional orders.Mr Noll said that “rather than wait for regulatory change, we’re trying to provide it ourselves”.Nasdaq has also launched a new programme in response to worries about “quote stuffing”, when a high-frequency trader submits and then quickly cancels a quote to tease out other traders’ intentions.Worries about the practice arose after the “flash crash” in US share markets last year. A report by US watchdogs found that such illusory quotes may have played a role in the event. Some high-frequency traders, however, have questioned whether the practice is widespread.The new Nasdaq scheme will pay a rebate to traders who only cancel one or fewer quotes for every 10 submitted. “We believe high-frequency traders provide valuable liquidity. But there are also things we can do to extend quote length and make the core experience better,” said Mr Noll.Additional reporting by Jeremy Grant in London
474;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-01-28T23:58:43Z;Nasdaq indices suffer data feed outage;;Nasdaq OMX said its index data feeds were disabled for an hour early on Friday morning, though trading on the Nasdaq marketplace itself was not disrupted.Nasdaq’s indices, including the Nasdaq 100 and the Nasdaq Composite, did not publish pricing data from the market open until 10.25am New York time on Friday. They eventually opened lower, matching a broader market decline.The outage only affected indices, which are not tradable, and not the data on prices of individual stocks. Tradeable products based on the indices, such as exchange-traded funds, were also unaffected, according to traders.“It was a non-event,” said a proprietary trader who trades Nasdaq stocks.However, the exchange said it would cancel options trades on the Nasdaq 100 index and “mini” index, which is traded on the CME Group’s exchanges, from between 9:45am, when the problem began, until 10.25am, when the data resumed.Options traders may have relied on index data to make trading decisions.The outage began in Nasdaq’s Global Index Data Service system, which disseminates data for indices based on Nasdaq and Philadelphia Stock Exchange, or PHLX, which is a subsidiary of Nasdaq, securities. By 10.06am, it had switched to a backup calculator.The “flash crash” on May 6, during which the market collapsed 6 per cent briefly before rebounding, was not the result of a data outage, though a delay in market data from the New York Stock Exchange did lead many market-making firms to back away from the market, according to US regulators’ report on the event.
475;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-01-26T06:54:09Z;Singapore to adopt pre-trade risk controls;SGX takes Asia lead addressing high-speed trading impact;The Singapore Exchange is to become the first Asian bourse to introduce pre-trade risk controls aimed at minimising the danger of a crash caused by high-speed electronic traders with direct access to the market.The announcement reflects a growing focus among regulators on the issues raised by high-frequency trading, which uses computer algorithms to trade shares, derivatives and foreign exchange contracts at high speed.It also comes ahead of the SGX’s planned introduction in August of Reach, a new S$250m (US$195m) trading system that it says will be the world’s fastest, with a “door-to-door” order response time of 90 microseconds.To put that in context, the blink of a human eye takes 300 milliseconds, and one millisecond is comprised of 1,000 microseconds.The initiative will impose fresh limits on the number of contracts that can be traded within a given period by companies with direct access to the exchange’s trading engine, usually through a broking house that is a clearing member.Clearing members will also be required to agree and monitor limits with direct traders on the mix of long and short positions that can be taken, and on credit arrangements for trading on margin.The controls are in line with recommendations made by the Futures Industry Association, and are intended to help reduce the risk of a major trading incident that would disrupt markets, such as the “ flash crash” in the US last May.Although that incident was not blamed on high-frequency trading, the sudden plunge and rebound in the Dow Jones average within minutes in one day highlighted the potential dangers of rapid automated trading.The introduction of the controls is also understood to reflect concern within the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the island state’s central bank and financial regulator, about the potential for high-speed trading mishaps.However, the new rules may also help the SGX attract more high-frequency traders – an increasingly profitable market segment that accounts for about 30 per cent of trading on the exchange’s derivatives market and three to five per cent of equities trading.This is because the imposition of a uniform pre-trade risk control system will put all direct access traders on the same trading basis, eliminating potential variations in risk management among clearing members that could have affected trading speeds.Gan Seow Ann, SGX president, said the initiative would “strengthen our marketplace by enhancing the capability of our members and their customers to manage risk exposure more effectively. It will further promote direct access to the SGX trading platform, thereby widening our market reach and distribution.”The SGX announcement follows the acquisition by Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator, of FTEN, a privately held US company specialising in pre-trade risk management. The deal was seen as a reflection of the increasing focus on pre-trade risk control.The SGX said its new rules for pre-trade risk controls would take effect in the derivatives market by the third quarter of this year.
476;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;TechBeat: In an interconnected world, location matters;;Interxion’s plan to expand capacity in its London datacentre, with funds from its upcoming New York listing, will provide a glimpse into the trading floor of the future.From a featureless office on Brick Lane just east of London’s financial centre, the Dutch-based data centre operator runs one of the City’s most critical technology sites.Inside, it hosts an ever-growing community of brokers, exchanges, technology companies and telecommunications providers in what is shaping up to be the stock exchange of the future.A further, larger expansion of the site is planned and with it an insight into the changing role of a data centres for financial services companies. In popular consciousness, most know that open outcry pit where traders shouted at each other has long since passed into history but what has replaced it less known.For the last fifteen years the explosion of global telecommunications networks has combined with cheaper and more powerful computer chips to allow banks, brokers and institutions to trade rapidly beyond borders. Now, however, it seems the future of trading depends on location, location, location.While technology companies work to reduce the time it takes for an order to be executed and recorded – known in the industry as latency – by improving the efficiency of software, cables and microchips, hundreds of milliseconds of time can be shaved off the process by physically locating customer servers literally right next to exchange servers, a process known as “co-location” or “co-lo”.As more firms place their equipment in the same location as exchanges, it creates a “virtuous circle” attracting other telecoms and technology firms to the site. In effect it becomes a virtual marketplace which mimics a traditional open outcry trading floor but in which trading is automated.The data centre itself is almost becoming a commodity as they are all laid out with the same sorts of specifications. Increasingly, what makes a data centre special is who chooses to live there. What is not a commodity is who can woo whom.Owning that connectivity hub, whether by control of the physical infrastructure, or by bringing trading firms in through the door, is the goal of technology companies.Interxion has more than 100 trading and investment firms at the site, including NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX, Bolsas y Mercados Espanoles as well as more than 80 sell side and proprietary trading firms, 10 market data providers and 36 telecoms carriers. Rival Telecity has energy traders and while financial services accounts for only 10 per cent of its revenues, that is up from zero five years ago.Competition around London, Europe’s largest trading zone, has been further intensified after NYSE Euronext and the London Stock Exchange both opened up their data centre to third-party providers of co-location services.Exchanges have realised that they can not only charge handsomely for customers to use their centre but also that there might not be enough traders who might want only to connect to the host exchange’s own markets. Connecting to other exchanges and trading platforms is also an economic necessity.But if there’s a downside for the owners of the infrastructure, it’s actually opening the market up for regional and small brokers in Europe unable to afford the connections to multiple trading and clearing platforms that are increasingly required to tap into trading liquidity. They can choose whether they need to have co-location services or can get by with “proximity services”, where they put servers in a data centre operated by a third party, usually location quite close to the exchange’s data centre.Although they are effectively outsourcing the execution of trades to a third party, it allows them to focus on their relationships with clients - the one area smaller players in the market can excel and historically, their strongest suit.Especially if their definition of “deepening the client relationship” involves a late-night curry on Brick Lane.
477;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-01-23T19:16:15Z;NYSE woos Silicon Valley to catch next wave of listings;;The New York Stock Exchange has its eyes set on Silicon Valley, where a wave of technology companies such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Zynga are expected to go public over the next 18 months.NYSE missed out on the first internet boom, with Ebay, Amazon and Google all choosing to list on the Nasdaq, NYSE’s chief rival. Those companies built the Nasdaq’s reputation as the de facto home for public tech groups.Now NYSE is looking to avoid making the same mistake twice. It has embarked on a major marketing campaign in Silicon Valley, where many tech companies are based.It has bought billboard advertisements along Highway 101, the main thoroughfare between Silicon Valley and San Francisco, and has doubled the size of its Silicon Valley capital markets team, which works to attract new listings.“The old NYSE was not even pitching businesses in Silicon Valley,” said Douglas Chu, head of NYSE’s western region. “We just assumed that when they got big enough they would come over. That never happened.”Nasdaq is still the preferred home for new US tech listings. Last year, Tesla, the electronic car maker, chose to list on Nasdaq, even though GM and Ford are on NYSE.Nasdaq has already won listings from Skype and Kayak, whose IPOs are also anticipated later this year.Nasdaq has long had a presence in Silicon Valley, with offices on Sand Hill Road and San Francisco.It touts its corporate services, such as web-based seminars for executives working at public companies for the first time.While listing fees for smaller companies are similar, for bigger companies Nasdaq caps fees at $99,500 a year. NYSE fees can be up to $500,000.“It’s not about the bell ringing, it’s about what happens when the bell stops ringing,” said Bob McCooey, head of listings at Nasdaq.Last year NYSE won 40 per cent of tech IPO listings, its best market share since at least 1995, according to Dealogic.NYSE recently won the listing for Demand Media, an online content company that is slated to go public on Tuesday. It also boasted the best performing IPO of 2010, China’s Youku.com, a streaming video web site similar to Hulu.The intense competition begins years before a company goes public, as exchange executives try to build relationships with entrepreneurs and likely IPO candidates.But the decision on where to list can be a personal one. “Sometimes strong founders go can go in a different direction than management wants,” said Mr McCooey.NYSE’s Mr Chu, a former technology banker, said his team was actively pitching potential IPO candidates in Silicon Valley.

Investigators were looking into the thefts, which occurred after hackers gained access to computer systems and transferred credits to other accounts.The market’s biggest exchange, BlueNext, began to restrict trading on Wednesday morning and then halted it before the Commission’s announcement.While spot trading ground to a halt on Thursday, companies were still dealing in futures contracts, which account for the majority of the ETS’ volume.Participants in the fledgling market said the security breaches raised fears they might receive stolen allowances that they would later have to forfeit.Keiron Allen, BlueNext’s director of marketing, said the market had been “battered by the scandal”.The Commission put the size of the theft at as much as €30m, which constitutes the first attempt to quantify losses from a string of recent attacks.Launched in 2005, the ETS is the largest carbon-trading scheme in the world, with turnover reaching more than €90bn last year. The scheme covers more than 10,000 industrial installations in the EU’s 27 member states, plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.The thefts have revealed the disparity in security standards among national registries where allowances are maintained.Investigators are still examining the latest attacks. Maria Kokkonen, a spokeswoman for the Commission, said authorities believed they were co-ordinated but were still uncertain of their origin.Additional reporting by Mary Watkins

480;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-01-20T14:35:24Z;Carbon exchanges halt spot trading;;Operators of Europe’s carbon emissions trading markets have suspended business in their spot emissions contracts after the European Union said its carbon trading platform had come under attack from cyber-thieves.Exchanges such as ICE Futures Europe, Nasdaq OMX Commodities Europe and Paris-based BlueNext were among those which halted trading in two contracts - the EU emissions allowance (EUA) daily futures and the United Nations- supervised carbon emission reduction (CER) daily futures contracts.LCH.Clearnet, the UK-based clearing house, suspended clearing of spot EUA and CER markets and added it would not register any transactions in the markets until further notice.The widespread closures raised fears the entire market structure in emissions trading was now compromised.The EU’s emissions trading system is facing the longest disruption in its history after authorities suspended trading for a week as it seeks to combat attacks by cyber-thieves. The Commission revealed late on Wednesday that emissions allowances worth €7m (£5.9m) had been stolen from an account in the Czech Republic. Recent days had seen accounts in Austria, Poland, Greece and Estonia also hacked, the Commission said.The EU trading system is the world’s most successful cap-and-trade system, limiting nearly half the bloc’s carbon emissions by allocating a fixed quota of EUAs to factories and power plants.ICE Futures Europe, the region’s largest emissions trading exchange, confirmed it had halted trading until January 27. In a circular to members, ICE, the London energy exchange operated by the Intercontinental Exchange of the US, said: “an undesirable situation or practice is developing or has developed” and the group was taking legal advice.It also said ICE Clear, the clearing house owned by Intercontinental Exchange, would be allowed to determine whether to suspend deliveries of contracts open at the close of business on Wednesday.BlueNext, the French group founded by NYSE Euronext and Caisse des Depots, added that it plans to quarantine suspicious credits to protect its members.Nasdaq OMX Commodities said it was monitoring the situation to ensure that “orderly trading and clearing” could take place. Separately, the exchange said it would begin trading UK power futures from the end of January.However Germany’s European Energy Exchange, in which Eurex, the futures arm of Deutsche Börse, has a stake of over 46 per cent, said trading had continued as normal as its spot and derivatives markets were only affected to a small degree by the suspension of the EU commission.It added that sales of allowances were only valid if they were covered by the existing European Commodity Clearing holdings of trading members. Only German EUAs are being deposited in the ECC registry account. “Therefore it is nearly impossible that EUAs from hacking attacks are traded on the EEX,” it said..
481;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-01-12T23:30:59Z;Interxion unveils plans to float on NYSE;;Interxion has filed plans with US regulators for a stock market listing to fund a large expansion plan and give the Dutch data centre provider an enterprise value of up to $1bn.The group, one of Europe’s largest data centre providers, is planning to offer 18.6m shares at $11-$13 in a float on the New York Stock Exchange, a Securities and Exchange Commission filing confirmed. A complex deal will also see it undertake a five-to-one reverse stock split around the time of the offering.Interxion’s long-mooted plans to list in the US is nevertheless a blow to London, where its closest European peer, Telecity, is listed. The Dutch group has 28 data centres in 11 European countries and particularly attracts financial services firms looking for a premium location in the City of London.Interxion specialises in co-location services, in which brokers place their servers next to the exchanges’ servers, to shave crucial milliseconds off the time it takes for trades to be done.As more firms place their equipment in the same location as exchanges, it creates a “virtuous circle” attracting other telecoms and technology firms to the site. In effect it becomes a virtual marketplace which mimics a traditional open outcry trading floor but in which trading is automated.At its City of London site, it has more than 100 trading and investment firms at the site, including NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX, Bolsas y Mercados Espanoles as well as more than 80 sell side and proprietary trading firms, 10 market data providers and 36 telecoms carriers.However the Dutch group has been seeking to extend its business in the US amid high demand from trading firms and brokers to find the fastest possible trading network connections. In November it signed a venture with New York-based Telx to help co-location customers locate expansion space on the other side of the Atlantic.The net proceeds of up to $190m from the sale of 16.5m shares will be used to build new data centres and extend existing ones, including an expansion of Interxion’s City of London site. A further 2.3m shares will be sold by existing shareholders, including former chief executive Michel Boussard.Will Wallis, an analyst at Numis Securites in London, said the indicated list price meant Interxion’s post-flotation enterprise value would be between $870m-$1bn. For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, Interxion made an operating profit of €34.3m ($45m) from revenues of €152.8m. That compared to an operating profit of €24.5m and revenues of €126.6m for the same period a year earlier.The group is 58 per cent-owned by Baker Capital, the US investment group, and the holding is expected to fall to less than 50 per cent following the offering. BofA Merrill Lynch, Citi and Barclays Capital will act as joint bookrunning managers for the offering.
482;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-01-12T22:36:57Z;LCH.Clearnet targets American launch;Plan to begin clearing of interest rate swaps next month in US;LCH.Clearnet, Europe’s largest independent clearing house, plans to launch clearing of interest rate swaps in the US next month, setting the stage for a battle between clearers for dominance of the largest over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market.Sweeping financial regulation, enshrined in the Dodd-Frank act in the US, is forcing much of the derivatives market on to exchanges and other types of trading platforms, as well as through clearing houses to help safeguard the system against the fallout from a big default.A clearing house stands between two parties to a trade, guaranteeing that a transaction goes ahead even if one party defaults.Regulators have until July 15 to finalise rules laying down how the industry should comply with Dodd-Frank, including defining what derivatives must be cleared and how clearing houses should be governed.On Thursday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures watchdog, had been due to decide how the boards of clearing houses, also known as central counterparties (CCPs), should be filled to prevent any one group– such as dealer banks – having too much influence. The vote was delayed at the last minute, however.Roger Liddell, LCH.Clearnet chief executive, said the London-based clearer would not need to wait for the new regulatory regime.Pending approval from the UK’s Financial Services Authority, its SwapClear unit would start offering clearing of swaps to asset managers, hedge funds and other non-bank users of such derivatives in the US early next month.“Some clients want to be ‘early adopters’ in clearing so we will be ready before July 15,” Mr Liddell told the Financial Times. “We’ve got clearing members lined up.”Last week, LCH.Clearnet appointed Floyd Converse, a former Merrill Lynch banker, to a job based in New York spearheading the clearer’s push into the US.The new SwapClear service will pit LCH.Clearnet against CME Group, the Chicago-based futures exchange and clearer which launched interest rate swaps clearing in October. International Derivatives Clearing House, a swaps clearer controlled by Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange, has also launched a service.While much of the focus on reforming the derivatives markets has been on credit default swaps – seen as having exacerbated the 2008 financial crisis – the focus of the clearers is on interest rate swaps, a market that is 10 times bigger.The launch of swaps clearing before the implementation of rules around Dodd-Frank has been finalised is a sign of the pressure on clearers to put their offerings in the market. Banks and large non-bank user of OTC derivatives, such as Freddie Mac and Freddie Mae, the US mortgage lenders, are scrambling to build new systems to allow them to connect to CCPs. One banker said: “There is so much work to be done that people want to get started as quickly as they can. They can’t wait until July.” Standard & Poor’s, the rating agency, this week expressed concern that the wave of OTC derivatives business “could unsettle the competitive equilibrium in the US clearing industry”.
483;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Osaka to make trading 20 times quicker;;The Osaka Securities Exchange is preparing for the launch of a significantly quicker trading system next month with the introduction of a series of new services, including fee cuts, aimed at luring more investors to the market.The moves by the OSE, Japan’s largest derivatives market, are the latest in a series of technology upgrades sweeping Asian exchanges as they gear up for competition from alternative trading platforms, such as Chi-X Global, which launched in Japan last year.Such platforms are similar to those that emerged in the US some years ago, and Europe more recently, that forced exchanges to speed up their systems.The OSE is adopting technology from Nasdaq OMX, the US-based exchange operator, that has also provided new trading systems for SGX, the Singapore exchange, and ASX, the Australian exchange, in recent months.The OSE wants to bring its derivatives trading system up to global standards to help it better compete with exchanges such as SGX, a stiff competitor in trading Japanese derivatives such as Nikkei 225 futures.The services the OSE plans to introduce include a market making programme, lower fees, extended trading hours and reduced tick sizes – that is, the increments by which prices are allowed to move up or down.The OSE’s trading lunch break will be cut and the existing evening session will begin 30 minutes earlier. The exchange also said it would reduce the tick sizes for Nikkei 225 stock index options to Y1 from Y5 for options with premiums of Y50 and less.The new trading system, which the OSE calls J-Gate, will cut order processing speed to five milliseconds from the current 100 milliseconds. It will also be able to process 12,000 orders a second from the current 800.The OSE has said it needs overseas partnerships to create products and improve its reach outside Japan, given its relatively small size. The exchange signed a memorandum of understanding with Nasdaq OMX two years ago to expand the OSE’s cash and derivative markets. Both exchanges are in preliminary talks about the possibility of setting up a new exchange.Relative to the size of the Japanese economy, derivative trading remains very small, particularly among Japanese individuals who are holders of some of the highest savings in the world.With time being of the essence for traders, the OSE has also said it plans to move its matching engine from Osaka to Tokyo as most of its clients are based in the Japanese capital.Such a move would eliminate the 20 milliseconds transmission time between the two cities, and create more arbitrage opportunities between the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s cash equities market and the OSE’s Nikkei 225 futures and options products.
484;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2011-01-05T19:19:47Z;Deutsche Börse eyes joint clearing with rivals;;"Deutsche Börse, operator of one of Europe’s largest clearing houses, has talked to rival clearers about consolidation in cash equities clearing as a revamp of the region’s securities post-trade business appears imminent.Clearing, viewed as the mundane processing of trades on stock and derivatives exchanges, has moved centre stage following the financial crisis as regulators insist on a greater use of clearing houses in the opaque derivatives markets.The clearing of equities in Europe has for months been on the verge of change as three clearing houses and their national regulators try to produce a mechanism under which they could together provide market participants with a choice on where their trades are sent for clearing.The concept, known as interoperability, has been pushed since 2007 by the European Commission as a way of lowering post-trade costs across the region, which are about eight times higher than in the US.A clearing house stands between two parties in a trade, acting as buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer to ensure that transactions proceed if one side defaults.While cash equities clearing in the US is undertaken mostly by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the same process is undertaken in Europe by multiple clearers which market participants say is too complex and expensive.Market participants are also often locked into using a clearer that has a working relationship with one particular exchange or other trading platform.The clearers include LCH.Clearnet, based in the UK; European Multilateral Clearing Facility (EMCF), owned by ABN Amro and Nasdaq OMX; Euro CCP, a DTCC unit, and Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia, part of Borsa Italiana, itself owned by the London Stock Exchange.Eurex Clearing carries out all clearing of equities trades in Germany and has been lukewarm over interoperability, which would involve it allowing rivals to clear German stocks.Progress on interoperability has been stalled for months as the three clearers involved, EMCF, Euro CCP and X-clear, a Swiss clearer, have tried to assuage regulators’ concerns that three-way linkages between clearers could trigger a domino effect if one clearer were to default.Rainer Riess, managing director at Deutsche Börse, said that interoperability “tends to introduce systemic risks”.“We are very open to European solutions. We believe that consolidation in that space could be useful for the market. We are in no hurry to move but we are open to seeking consolidation where it is useful,” he told the Financial Times.Asked which clearers the group was talking to, Mr Riess said: “Nobody I’d like to discuss at the moment.”He added: [Consolidation] is an area I expect we’ll see a little bit of movement on this year.”Consolidation among clearers could happen first at EMCF, whose majority owner, ABN Amro, started talks last year with DTCC and Euro CCP about a possible sale of its stake."
485;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-12-29T22:34:56Z;Liquidnet in talks with 13 exchanges;;Liquidnet, the largest independent operator of “dark pools”, is in talks with 13 stock exchanges in Europe, Asia and Latin America about forging reciprocal deals aimed at boosting volumes for both types of trading venue.The development is a sign that the lines are blurring between exchanges and other kinds of trading venue, as fierce competition is prompting former rivals to co-operate.Dark pools specialise in handling large blocks of shares, with prices posted publicly only after deals are finalised.They are run by independent operators such as Liquidnet, by banks – which call them “crossing networks” – or in rare cases by exchanges themselves.Growth of dark pools is being fuelled by “high-frequency” trading, which has sliced orders into ever-smaller sizes on stock exchanges and other platforms.That is causing asset managers and other institutions to direct their typically large trades to dark pools to minimise the risk of prices moving against them and, in some cases, to avoid their orders interacting with high-frequency traders.Exchanges, where trading is increasingly dominated by high-frequency traders, are losing out, as such orders leech away to dark pools.Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator, in October became the first exchange to try to lure those orders back by launching PSX, where Nasdaq pays incentives for traders to post large orders.John Barker, head of Liquidnet’s international business, said that while most exchanges were looking to develop some kind of dark pool, they were “not experienced”.“They don’t necessarily have the understanding of what they are building. So we are saying: ‘why would you even want to instigate building your own dark pool. We are successful, we are block pool, you can just plug in’. The synergies are absolutely ideal,” he told the Financial Times.Mr Barker declined to name any exchanges. Liquidnet operates dark pools in 38 markets, including Germany, France, Britain, Poland, Israel, Malaysia and Mexico. He said talks had been going on “probably for the best part of the year”.“We’re close to hopefully doing a deal with some of them,” Mr Barker said.Under the proposed arrangements, the exchange would plug in to Liquidnet, allowing members of an exchange – such as local brokers – to create block orders and see if they find matches among Liquidnet’s large number of institutional customers, such as asset managers.Mr Barker said: “This is an absolute win for them and a win for us.”
486;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-12-23T19:29:23Z;BATS and Chi-X eye new landscape;;The proposed merger of BATS Europe and Chi-X Europe to create Europe’s largest share trading venue caps a remarkable rise for both companies.Talks had been under way with four US bidders for the past four months over the sale of UK-based Chi-X Europe, before focusing on exclusive talks with Kansas-based BATS Trading. Discussions are set to run until February 11, sources have indicated.Valuations have not been disclosed, although analysts have questioned whether any of the companies would be willing to pay the mooted $300m price tag, since Chi-X only became profitable this year.However, according to one source, Chi-X Europe was valued at $360m, with $60m of that to be paid in two instalments of $30m in 2012 and 2013 if it meets certain targets.That valuation would give BATS a total value of $1.2bn.A combination of the European operations of the two start-up businesses – neither of which existed six years ago – is likely to mean that one in three shares in British blue-chip stocks will be conducted via the new company.The radically changed share trading landscape in Europe would mark a coup for Joe Ratterman, the chief executive who founded BATS in the US in 2005.Aided by legislation, established exchanges and new entrants on both sides of the Atlantic have begun to redefine share trading far from the image of traders on the floor of an exchange.Both BATS and Chi-X have benefited from the liberalisation of financial markets by the European Commission in 2007.Its Markets in Financial Instruments Directive was intended to break the monopoly of national exchanges, spur competition and lower trading costs across the region.It allowed for the creation of MTFs – multilateral trading facilities – and Chi-X Europe and BATS Europe were set up in response.They used low fees and faster trading systems to win market share from incumbents, forcing them to lower fees and adopt faster systems themselves.However, MTFs were backed by some of the banks and proprietary trading groups that have been and continue to be the exchange’s biggest customers.They saw the creation of MTFs as a way of making trading cheaper and more efficient across Europe.Nevertheless, Chi-X has taken just more than 25 per cent of FTSE 100 share trading, second only to the London Stock Exchange. It also accounts for 15.4 per cent of trading in continental European shares, placing it second after NYSE Euronext and ahead of Deutsche Börse, according to Thomson Reuters.BATS has captured a 10 per cent market share in Europe, similar to its impact in the US. Analysts say the deal could attract more business and allow the merged group to take further market share.The combination of the two businesses would give Getco – a shareholder in both of them – a key position in share trading in Europe. The US proprietary trading group would also get access to a substantial amount of trading flow in the region, and is likely to attract new customers.“The combined entity will likely be more profitable as well if, as we suspect, significant cost synergies are available. This will likely lead to more investment in both the equity business and initiatives to move into derivatives,” said Ed Ditmire, an analyst at Macquarie Securities.Among the rebuffed bids was one from Nasdaq OMX, which meant another failure by the US exchanges group to build a pan-European trading presence.Alasdair Haynes, Chi-X’s chief executive, has already indicated that the UK group would push into derivatives to boost margins and intensify competition with rivals such as Deutsche Börse as well as NYSE Euronext.Such a move would again pit it against the LSE, which has also indicated it will look to break into derivatives trading.But analysts point out that BATS is likely to be focused on a market listing.“We would expect the BATS/Chi-X combination to have a greater focus on profitable growth,” said Mr Ditmire.
487;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-12-22T17:48:50Z;Investors warm to potential of Baltic states;;From his high-rise office overlooking the bustling streets of central Tallinn, Andrus Alber, chairman of the local Nasdaq OMX-run stock exchange, has a bird’s eye view of vigour returning to the Estonian economy.The recovery is equally visible on computer screens inside the exchange operator’s headquarters, showing rising stock prices and increasing trading volume.“Volume is still down since the crisis but we’re seeing foreign investors starting to come back,” says Mr Alber.It is a similar story in neighbouring Latvia and Lithuania, with all three stock markets rebounding strongly since the bursting of a regional credit bubble two years ago. This helps explain the presence of several Baltic-focused funds among the world’s best performing emerging market fund managers of 2010.Trigon Top Picks, an Estonia-based fund with $10m under management, ranks high on the list with growth of 45 per cent. Others include East Capital, a Stockholm-based investment company focused on eastern Europe, whose Baltic fund has expanded by 40 per cent.The surge in Baltic funds reflects a growing conviction among investors that, having been some of the first European countries hit by the global financial crisis in 2008, the Baltic states are now ahead of the curve in recovery.Estonia registered economic growth of 5 per cent in the third quarter, burnishing its reputation as the star Baltic performer ahead of the country’s entry into the eurozone on January 1. Recovery has been much slower in Lithuania and Latvia, which received a €7.5bn bail-out from the International Monetary Fund in late 2008. But both have returned to growth in spite of continued fiscal austerity.Marcus Svedberg, economist at East Capital, says the re-election of Latvia’s centre-right government in October was an important signal to investors that the region was committed to turning its economies around.The stock market recovery started last year even as the region was still in the grip of Europe’s deepest recession.Total return from the East Capital Baltic fund in 2009 was 20.9 per cent, compared with a 9.9 per cent increase in the benchmark index.Investing in the Baltics still involves a fair amount of risk and sometimes frustration. Low liquidity is one of the biggest problems, forcing East Capital to stop accepting new investments for a period recently when demand was threatening to outstrip the supply of stocks.Mr Alber predicts Estonia’s entry into the eurozone next month will spark increased interest among foreign investors as a symbol of regional recovery and integration with the richer economies of western and northern Europe.
488;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-12-20T17:59:11Z;Dubai plans to hold on to LSE stake;;The Dubai government said on Monday it had no intention of disposing of its stake in the London Stock Exchange, denying reports that neighbouring Abu Dhabi had offered $1.5bn (£966m) for the stake.Ahmed al-Tayer, head of Dubai International Financial Centre, denied that Borse Dubai, which controls a 20 per cent stake in the LSE and 17 per cent in Nasdaq OMX, had received an offer for its stake in the LSE. In a statement, he said Borse Dubai was not looking to dispose of its investment in the LSE.The speculation came after Borse Dubai last week sold back around half of its shareholding in Nasdaq OMX to the US exchanges operators and Investor AB, the listed investment vehicle for Sweden’s Wallenberg family. It was part of complex transaction to refinance $2.5bn of debt maturing in February. Dubai remains the largest shareholder in the LSE.Reports had suggested that Abu Dhabi, the oil rich capital of the UAE, of which Dubai is the second largest member, would buy out Borse Dubai as part of an existing plan to merge the Abu Dhabi and Dubai stock exchanges. Before Monday’s denial, officials and bankers had also thrown cold water on the reports.Earlier this year, however, sources in Abu Dhabi said there were tentative talks for the capital to buy Borse Dubai, relieving the Dubai entity of its debts, as part of plans to merge Abu Dhabi exchange with Dubai financial market to form a national bourse.Since then, Dubai has sealed agreement on a $25bn restructuring of debts at the separate Dubai World conglomerate, reducing pressure to sell assets to meet debt repayments.But Dubai still has to face debt maturities of as much as $18bn next year as it deals with an overall debt mountain of around $110bn.Mr Al-Tayer reiterated that Borse Dubai had successfully completed an early loan repayment and debt restructuring last week.
489;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-12-17T18:50:03Z;Quick View: Whose move in the Chi-X end game?;;By next week, and possibly earlier than that, Chi-X Europe could be under new ownership.It’s been four months since the pan-European trading platform – or exchange, if you prefer how Chi-X now describes itself – went public with news that it had been approached by an unnamed party about a possible bid.Since then four US-based groups have shown interest: BATS Global Markets, operators of BATS Europe, a Chi-X rival, Direct Edge, Nasdaq OMX and NYSE Euronext (although in a video interview Duncan Niederauer, the group’s chief executive, says it would be going too far to talk of an actual bid, which I find a little odd.)Direct Edge is a BATS rival and owned 31.5 per cent by Deutsche Börse’s International Securities Exchange US options platform, with Citadel, Knight, the US broker, and Goldman Sachs collectively with under 20 per centNo matter what happens, this is a big moment, not merely in the European trading landscape. It has broader ramifications for the way global exchanges are positioned competitively. That’s largely because the bidders happen to be US-based.Chi-X came from nowhere in 2007 – the year Mifid was enacted – to become the second largest exchange, effectively, in Europe (even though technically it is still a “multilateral trading facility”, or MTF – an “exchange lite” designation created by Mifid.)Chi-X has more than 25 per cent of trading in FTSE 100 stocks and, on a pan-European basis, is second only to Euronext in market share. That means more share trading takes place on Chi-X Europe – 16.5 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters – than on Deutsche Börse, or 11.9 per cent.It is still not widely enough appreciated – including among the wider investing public – that this much share trading takes place on Chi-X.According to a funky tool called the Fragulator, produced by trading technology company Fidessa, only 25 per cent of trading in Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, takes place on the LSE these days. The rest happens on Chi-X Europe and other venues. Another chunk is done over the counter.By buying Chi-X, someone thus has a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to buy market share in Europe and change the game radically. For a US operator, this would be a huge leg-up in Europe.For NYSE Euronext Chi-X would give the US group a quarter of all trading in UK blue chips, posing a serious challenge to the London Stock Exchange.NYSE Euronext already has strengthening its position in the UK, building a vast data centre for “colocation” of proprietary traders 30 miles outside London (in Basildon). It has moved its electronic cash equities trading system from Euronext in Paris to Basildon, announcing plans for a primary listings platform to attract global IPOs. It also gave notice to LCH.Clearnet that it intends to sever remaining ties that its derivatives clearer, Liffe Clear, has with LCH. Clearnet. The signals are surely there: NYSE Euronext sees London as its European hub, not Paris.Yet that does not make NYSE Euronext more likely to get Chi-X. After all, why would Mr Niederauer write a cheque made out to Chi-X shareholders, only to find that a) they stop using the platform and b) they go off and set up another MTF of their own? And as I write this, it seems NYSE Euronext may not be in the running. Direct Edge is understood not to have made it to the second round of bids last week.Chi-X Europe’s shareholders are: ABN Amro, BNP Paribas, Citi, Credit Suisse, Getco, Goldman Sachs, Instinet, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Société Générale, UBS, Citadel, Getco and Optiver, the Dutch proprietary trading firm.For Nasdaq OMX the attraction of buying Chi-X is obvious. It has made repeated failed attempts to build a pan-European cash equities business. Its latest, Nasdaq OMX Europe, folded in April after 18 months. Chi-X would be a way to finally get in the game. Nasdaq’s share repurchase move this week “limits the ability of Nasdaq OMX to pursue major M&A deals”, according to Chris Allen of Ticonderoga Securities. But that depends on whether you think Chi-X Europe is a “major” deal, at a price tag of north of $300m.What puzzles me is that, when in October I asked Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq OMX chief executive, whether he needed a pan-European presence in cash equities, he answered: “No, definitely not”. Does he then see Chi-X as a derivatives platform that could be used together with the Nordic exchange? Derivatives is certainly where Chi-X is headed, as its chief executive Alasdair Haynes, says in an interview we posted on Friday on FT Trading Room.That leaves BATS. A BATS bid does have the advantage of significant overlap between shareholders in Chi-X and BATS, meaning it should in theory be easier to get people around a table in favour of a BATS proposition. They share five of the same shareholders: Chicago-based proprietary trading firm Getco, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.And if you are Nasdaq, how do you structure a deal so that, with such a common shareholding, you ensure that the trading flow doesn’t migrate elsewhere?The key shareholder here is Getco. If – as many suspect – BATS is to do an IPO, then rolling up BATS Europe (11 per cent FTSE 100 market share, 6.8 per cent Europe without the UK) with Chi-X Europe would make a listing that much more attractive. And with Getco a substantial shareholder in a pre-IPO BATS, it could stand to do very well.Getco would also get access to a substantial amount of order flow in Europe, transforming its presence in the region into something very interesting indeed.Yet whoever gets hold of Chi-X will have to do something with it. As Mr Haynes rightly says in our interview, it’s not enough to be a “one-trick pony” offering cash equities trading.One of the sticking points in the bidding process, I understand, is who gets what jobs if Chi-X were to be sold. BATS seems likely to give the top job to Mark Hemsley, current chief executive of BATS Europe, which would put Mr Haynes out of a job. Perhaps his prospects are better served by another bidder. Considerations like this tend to distract boards, and I understand there is a bit of this going on now.It is time for things to be put to Chi-X Europe shareholders. The next move in the exchange consolidation game has been long coming, and it’s time for the next move.
490;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-12-17T12:32:13Z;Chi-X Europe eyes move into derivatives;;Chi-X Europe, the pan-European trading platform, is targeting a move into equity derivatives as it looks to undercut lucrative revenues streams from Europe’s established exchanges.It comes as the London-based group finalises its sale in a move which is likely to reshape the trading landscape in Europe and signal a shift in power among the region’s exchanges. Since its launch in 2007 Chi-X has grown to handle more share trading volume than any other venue after Euronext.Its move into derivatives would signal a push for the newly-profitable group to boost margins and move it to the ranks of rivals such as Deutsche Börse as well as NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX, the two US-based exchange operators. The London Stock Exchange also indicated last month it would look to break into derivatives trading.“At some point in time we will move into the derivatives space. A one-trick pony is not something you can be in this day and age,” Alasdair Haynes, chief executive, told the Financial Times.Asked on progress of the bidding, he said: “Being approached should always be seen as flattering. People want to buy you as they regard you as a success. But all I can say is that the process is ongoing.”Industry experts question how outsiders like the LSE or Chi-X could break into equity derivatives in Europe, now dominated by Eurex, the derivatives arm of Deutsche Börse, and NYSE Liffe, the futures and options unit of NYSE Euronext.Mr Haynes accepted it was a tough market to break into. “If you look at the derivatives market, there are certain specific areas of the derivatives market, in the equities space, I think there is a dissatisfaction with price people pay and the vertical model that is there. I think that there is a way of coming in and doing it at a materially cheaper price and changing the model.”Mr Haynes has a background in derivatives from a stint as head of global equity derivatives at HSBC. He was also on the board of the London Traded Options Market, which the London Stock Exchange sold to the London International Financial Futures Exchange – now part of NYSE Euronext, the transatlantic exchange group.His comments come amid the final decisions surrounding the ownership of the group are being made. BATS Global Markets, NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX all tabled fresh offers for Chi-X ahead of a deadline a week ago for “second round” bids.Chi-X Europe’s largest shareholder is Nomura of Japan. While no official announcement of a sale has been made, people familiar with the matter say Nomura and some other shareholders are keen to sell, now that Chi-X has achieved significant market share.For a bidder, buying Chi-X would give the new owner a dominant presence in European cash equities trading, larger than that of the London Stock Exchange or Deutsche Börse.
491;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-12-16T21:05:17Z;Borse Dubai in Nasdaq OMX sell-off;;Borse Dubai has sold about half of its stake in Nasdaq OMX, raising $672m towards the refinancing of a $2.45bn loan maturing in February.The emirates exchange holding company is understood to have taken a significant loss on the investment. Observers said the sale was concluded at $22 a share compared with Dubai’s original purchase price of about $42 in 2008 when it took a 28 per cent stake in Nasdaq OMX as part of complex transaction involving various assets swaps.Borse Dubai failed to conclude a strategic sale of its assets, forcing a quick sale ahead of the maturity of its $2.45bn loan. The government holding company for Dubai’s two stock exchanges also raised $428m via a new three-year facility arranged by Nomura and Emirates NBD, Dubai’s biggest bank, towards the refinancing of debt facility.Investment Corporation of Dubai, the government holding company that controls Borse Dubai, has extended the remaining $1.35bn of the HSBC-led $2.45bn facility.Borse Dubai will remain as Nasdaq OMX’s largest shareholder with a 15 per cent stake after the deal after selling part of the stake to Investor AB, the listed investment vehicle for Sweden’s Wallenberg family, pending regulatory approval.Investor, the publicly listed holding company of Sweden’s powerful Wallenberg family, said it would pay $175m for 8m shares in Nasdaq OMX, increasing its stake to 9.7 per cent. Börje Ekholm, Investor’s chief executive, said it was an attractive deal for the company’s shareholders to become one of the biggest shareholders in Nasdaq OMX, which he said had “very strong market positions and a unique brand in the industry”.Investor was the biggest shareholder in OMX, the dominant Nordic exchange operator, when it was bought by Nasdaq in 2008. In addition to Stockholm, Nasdaq OMX also operates exchanges in Helsinki, Copenhagen, Reykjavik, Tallinn, Riga and Vilnius.Investor previously held 9 million shares in Nasdaq OMX, or 4.6 per cent of the outstanding stock, after buying shares for about $180m in the past year, it said.Nasdaq OMX plans to repurchase almost $500m worth of its own shares from Borse Dubai, which also has a stake in the London Stock Exchange. Nasdaq plans to help finance the buy-back by raising $370m in debt.“Borse Dubai …has been able to achieve its financing objectives while retaining substantial economic interest in Nasdaq OMX,” said Mohammed al-Shaibani, ICD’s chief executive.The deal comes as the emirate’s debt restructuring efforts pick up. Dubai International Capital, a government-related investment arm, agreed with creditors to restructure about $2.5bn in debts. Dubai, which owes $110bn, is grappling with about $18bn in debts that mature next year, after sealing an agreement to restructure its thorniest debt problem at conglomerate Dubai World.The commercial hub is starting to recover from a recession triggered by the global financial crisis and the pricking of its real estate bubble.
492;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-12-15T23:38:59Z;Nasdaq seeks to cut super-fast trading risk;Importance of technology highlighted with FTEN acquisition;"Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator, highlighted the increased importance of technology designed to reduce risks in super-fast trading by acquiring FTEN, a privately held US company specialising in pre-trade risk management.FTEN is majority owned by Outfitter Ventures, a Silicon Valley-based private equity firm; FTEN management and employees; and Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Credit Suisse, with collectively less than 25 per cent.The acquisition – the terms of which were not disclosed – comes as regulators in the US and Europe focus on high-frequency trading, a type of trading practice that uses computer algorithms to trade in and out of shares, derivatives and foreign exchange at high speed.The concern is that brokers allowing high-frequency traders access to exchanges by their membership of the exchanges should have ways to ensure that such traders are not taking undue risks that could cause problems for the wider financial system.Exchanges as well as brokers are under increased pressure by regulators to ensure they have robust risk management systems in place to prevent mishaps, especially after the “flash crash” in May. While not blamed on high-frequency trading, the sudden plunge and rebound in the Dow Jones average in minutes in one day highlighted the effects of rapid automated trading.Eric Noll, head of transaction services at Nasdaq OMX, said: “As part of a rapidly changing regulatory landscape, there is heightened emphasis on controlling risk, as a result, broker dealers are seeking real-time risk solutions that facilitate and improve the investment process.”The need to be able to monitor risks in trading positions quickly has been emphasised by the growth of high-frequency trading, not only on share trading but also derivatives and FX.Market participants are seeking tools that provide real-time, low latency enterprise-wide risk management, market awareness and control. FTEN’s technology provides broker-dealers and their clients with the ability to manage risk more effectively in real-time, which leads to better utilisation of capital as well as to improved regulatory compliance.Ted Myerson, chief executive of FTEN, said: “We recognised early on that demand for pre-trade risk management tools would dramatically increase as the regulatory environment evolved and the need for comprehensive risk controls moved from niche to mainstream. The transaction with Nasdaq OMX gives us the ability to broaden the scope of customers we can reach in the US and tap into its international network of exchange partners.”In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission recently proposed that brokers offering their customers - often high-frequency traders - access to exchanges should ensure that they have adequate pre-trade risk management systems in place to deal with risk."
493;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-12-15T17:06:32Z;Equiduct volumes hold as ProCapital joins;;Equiduct is on track in December to at least match its trading performance of the last few months as it signed up another French retail broker to its pan-European trading platform.Peter Randall, chief executive, told the Financial Times that the group was on track to “at least” beat the €820m of volume it traded in October, although the festive period meant it was unlikely to top the record volumes in November, when it traded more than €1bn in a single calendar month for the first time.It comes as it confirmed ProCapital, a subsidiary of Compagnie Financiere Du Credit Mutuel, would join its platform as it looks to build a retail investor-focused exchange to rival Europe’s established players like NYSE Euronext, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse.The addition of new clients and more trading volumes has capped a year in which momentum has begun to build at Equiduct. A year ago it did not have any trades but the average value traded on its market has climbed in the last five months to €61.8m in November.Equiduct’s view is that retail investors across Europe are starting to become aware that better prices were sometimes available on new share trading platforms that have emerged to challenge the established exchanges.The group was initially launched last year as a European “multilateral trading facility”, or MTF, but failed to gain significant market share. Citadel Securities, part of the US financial services group founded by Ken Griffin, then took a controlling stake with the aim of turning it into a pan-European platform for share trading aimed at smaller investors.The idea was to replicate what Citadel has done in the US through its investment in Direct Edge, which has grown to become one of the top four exchanges in the US, along with NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX and BATS Global Markets.However for all its momentum, volumes at Equiduct are still only a fraction of traditional exchanges such as LSE or Euronext or Deutsche Borse. It has also hired Stuart Rutherford to prepare for further expansion.Other shareholders in Equiduct include Knight, the US broker, Börse Berlin and Belgian entrepreneur Jos Peeters.
494;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-12-13T15:59:27Z;Burgundy makes Verizon complaint;;Verizon, the US telecommunications group, has been reported to Sweden’s competition authority over allegations that it has barred a rival of Nasdaq OMX, the New York-based exchange operator, from its network infrastructure.Burgundy, a Stockholm-based trading platform owned by several of the biggest Nordic financial institutions and which competes with Nasdaq OMX’s Nordic stock exchanges, said Verizon was “choosing sides” in the trading industry by allowing Nasdaq OMX exclusive access to a data centre in Sweden.The dispute highlights how data centres are becoming controversial parts of market infrastructure amid a technology arms race in share and derivatives trading. This is intensifying as exchanges, banks and brokers compete to build the fastest and most efficient trading platforms in an era when transaction speeds are measured in split seconds.Traders locate their computer trading systems in data centres in order to be close to an exchange’s trading system, shaving crucial microseconds off the time taken for trades to be done. Regulators are trying to ensure that operators of data centres allow access to them free of discrimination between types of market participant. While exchanges operate their own data centres, many are also run by independent operators such as Verizon, Nasdaq-listed Equinix and Interxion, a large European data centre specialist.The use of data centres for this purpose is a relatively recent development. But the phenomenon is growing amid the rise of “high-frequency” trading, where traders use computer algorithms to trade in and out of shares and derivatives at high speed.Verizon’s data centre, near Stockholm, is not only used by Nasdaq OMX but also by most of the country’s biggest banks and brokers, allowing them to connect directly to Nasdaq OMX’s trading platform.Burgundy claims that by barring rival operators from the facility, Verizon is allowing Nasdaq OMX to execute transactions at a lower cost and higher speed. “We have been forced to find an alternative data centre 5km away from our customers and, in high-frequency trading, 5km is an eternity,” said Olof Neiglick, Burgundy’s chief executive. “It could be the difference between offering a competitive service and being left out.”Mr Neiglick said Verizon was initially keen to accept Burgundy’s business and the pair signed a contract in September. But the US company later cancelled the deal and informed Burgundy it had a “one exchange” policy in its data centres.He said he could not prove Verizon had come under pressure from Nasdaq OMX but noted that the US exchange operator was a big customer of Verizon in North America and Europe.Verizon and Nasdaq OMX declined to comment. People familiar with Verizon said it would be unusual in the exchange industry for more than one operator to share the same data centre.Burgundy, whose owners include large Scandinavian banks such as Nordea, SEB and Danske, was launched last year as a challenger to Nasdaq OMX, which dominates the Nordic trading landscape.Mr Neiglick said Burgundy would meet competition regulators this week to press the case that Verizon is abusing its position as the main data centre provider to Sweden’s trading community.“With high-frequency trading it is becoming more and more important for an exchange to be physically close to its customers’ machines,” he said. “Verizon is choosing sides on who can compete. If this is the new norm, data centres need to be regulated.”Additional reporting by Jeremy Grant in London
495;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-12-10T17:29:05Z;US trio make fresh bids for Chi-X Europe;;BATS Global Markets, NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX have tabled fresh offers for Chi-X Europe, the pan-European trading platform, ahead of a Friday deadline for “second round” bids, two people familiar with the matter said.The outcome of the battle for control of Chi-X Europe will signal a huge shift in power among exchanges and other operators of trading systems in Europe because Chi-X handles more share trading volume than any other venue after Euronext.In London, over a quarter of FTSE 100 stocks trade on Chi-X, which was set up three years ago by a group of banks and proprietary trading firms, including Getco of the US, to challenge national exchanges in Europe.That was made possible by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid), which will soon be overhauled under sweeping revisions unveiled by the European Commission this week.Chi-X Europe’s largest shareholder is Nomura of Japan. While no official announcement of a sale has been made, people familiar with the matter say Nomura and some other shareholders are keen to sell, now that Chi-X has achieved significant market share.For a bidder, buying Chi-X would give the new owner a dominant presence in European cash equities trading, larger than that of the London Stock Exchange or Deutsche Borse.The LSE would be especially vulnerable if NYSE Euronext were to win the bidding, since it would, at a stroke, give the US-based group the second-largest share of trading in UK stocks, putting pressure on the UK exchange. NYSE Euronext has gradually been pressuring the LSE in the UK in other ways, most recently by announcing plans for a UK-based platform for international company listings, by building a vast data centre in Essex, outside London, and relocating the trading system the group uses for European cash equities trading to that data centre.People familiar with the matter say Chi-X had been expecting bids of £200m-£300m, but that “some bidders feel a more realistic number is that in US dollars”, one said.Both US exchanges are believed to have tabled “aggressive” bids in recent days. Bats and NYSE Euronext declined to comment. Nasdaq OMX was not immediately available for comment. Chi-X Europe also declined to comment.A second person said Direct Edge, BATS’s main rival in the US, had also made a bid in the first round. Direct Edge, in which Citadel and Knight are investors, did not join the early wave of initiatives to set up trading platforms in Europe in the wake of Mifid.A bid for Chi-X is seen by some industry experts as its last chance to enter Europe.Nasdaq OMX’s interest in Chi-X comes in spite of comments by Bob Greifeld, chief executive, in October, that he saw no need for the group to have a pan-European presence in cash equities.Asked by FT Trading Room at the World Federation of Exchanges annual meeting in Paris whether Nasdaq needed such a presence after shutting down its failed Nasdaq OMX Europe trading platform earlier this year, Mr Greifeld said: “No, definitely not.” He said Nasdaq would grow in Europe by expanding its Nasdaq OMX Nordic business, and by expanding in the UK power market.
496;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-12-08T12:54:16Z;Quick View: Mifid gets muscles from Brussels;;"“Most institutions find it difficult”.This was how “Mifid” was once described, jokingly of course, by former Chi-X chief executive Peter Randall.He was referring to how unclear the European Commission’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive was when it came to things such as defining “best execution”. Discussion of Mifid’s weakness in this regard was conference fodder for a good two years.Those days are over. With publication on Wednesday of its “Mifid review”, the European Commission has turned Mifid from being a somewhat flabby, principles-based directive into quite a different animal.It is now an all-encompassing set of rules that leaves little room for doubt. When previously it was possible to debate what Mifid meant, the burden of proof is now firmly on market participants to explain why they think they don’t fall under the new-look Mifid, as it has been proposed.Maria Velentza, the Brussels official leading the review, often used to say there would be no “Mifid Two”, implying that the directive would only be tweaked. Somewhere along the way that changed, and what we have is a Mifid Two – on steroids.As Stephen Fletcher, financial regulation partner at Linklaters, the law firm, put it: “The Commission has today blown out of the water any notion that the Mifid review would only lead to minor tweaks, and many of the proposals have the potential to have major implications for firms and markets.”Take broker crossing networks. While it’s true that we expected the definition of bank “dark pools” to be tightened, it’s laid out now quite clearly.Automated trading – including “high-frequency” trading (HFT) is to be “defined in a broad manner”. Anyone involved in HFT will have to be authorised as an investment company (once certain “quantitative thresholds” are defined). Algorithms will have to be explained to regulators.In fact, this is far more prescriptive than anything we’ve seen out of the US. There, regulators seem more concerned with sorting out immediate deficiencies in equity market structures that were highlighted by the “flash crash” – fine-tuning a system of circuit breakers, or possibly imposing market-making obligations on certain types of trader, for instance.The wider market structure issues raised in the “concept release” by the Securities and Exchange Commission in January are still being discussed at the staff level within the SEC. That is, when they have breathing space to do so given the crushing priority of getting the Dodd-Frank rules done by July 15 next year.The thing that’s really driving Europe is a focus on increasing transparency. That’s not to say this is absent from the US debate – you only have to count how many times the T-word appears in speeches by Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to see that.But there is a real drive in Europe to force more transparency into the system. Gone is the orthodoxy under the old Mifid that competition is necessarily a good thing; transparency and fairness are the new watchwords- and rightly so.This applies as much to cash equities as to derivatives. Much of the shrillest rhetoric has come from France, where politicians seem to think all OTC activity should be proscribed and move on to exchanges.The European Commission doesn’t go that far. But the Mifid review does propose extending pre- and post-trade requirements to depository receipts and exchange-traded funds. Broker crossing networks are to be re-regulated as a separate category – not something we have seen come out of the US yet. It’s a sign that dark pools are being targeted earlier and more aggressively than in the US.Bob Greifeld and Duncan Niederauer, respectively chief executives of Nasdaq OMX and NYSE Euronext, picked up on this at a Goldman Sachs conference this week. They felt Europe was coming down harder on OTC activity than the US, pointing out that Brussels was more focused on the effect of “dark” markets on the “lit” markets. I don’t think this was simply them talking up their book as exchanges either.Mifid Two would also impose position reporting requirements for traders of commodity derivatives – a big move for a region where as recently as a year ago there was no discussion of lack of transparency in these markets.Brussels also goes further than the US in OTC derivatives, proposing that pre-trade information on trading in “non-equity instruments” be published “in a continuous manner”.Europe’s equivalent of “swap execution facilities” (SEFs) in the US will be required to “provide for real-time and continuous updating of available and actionable trading interest” – an exchange-like model if ever there was one. Any company executing OTC trades should provide pre-trade quotes that “reflect current market value” and make those available to the public. There is no discussion of extra capital requirements to conduct this sort of business, as in the US. Transparency is the battering ram.So is this a victory for the exchanges, which have been lobbying heavily using the transparency card? Not completely. There is no outright proscription of OTC activity. There are a lot of sensible provisions that keep in mind the need for OTC and exchange-traded activity to live side-by-side.But what is striking is how it’s being proposed to equip regulators – and pan-European ones, British authorities please note – with an array of powers to back up this transparency agenda. Take section 9.1, which says Esma (the planned European Securities and Markets Authority) should be empowered to ban certain financial instruments “indefinitely”. Again, not a whisper of this that I know of in the US."
497;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-12-03T16:21:01Z;Exchanges see November boost from derivatives;;Some of the world’s largest trading venues saw a solid uptick in volumes in November as investors sought out derivatives, especially in commodities, to hedge against the uncertain economic outlook.Monthly statistics from the world’s leading exchanges and trading venues showed year-on-year sequential improvements at CME Group and Eurex, the derivatives arm of Deutsche Börse as investors on both sides of the Atlantic looked to offset risk.Commodity derivatives have proved a hot spot, amid continued volatility in demand and supply in raw materials from cotton to copper and energy.Robert Ray, head of international products and services at CME Group, operator of energy exchange Nymex and of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, told a conference this week in London that commodity traders were back “putting on positions” as they had done before the financial crisis of 2008. Grain contracts had been “on a tear” because of supply and demand issues.“In many cases the fundamentals haven’t changed. In commodities and metals you’re seeing a re-establishment of positions,” he told the FOW Derivatives World conference.IntercontinentalExchange, the US exchange operator, saw record futures volume of more than 300m contracts, beating last November’s record of 262m.Average daily volume across its futures exchanges rose 26 per cent to 1.4m. Growth was driven by agriculture and energy futures, while its European futures business stablished an open interest record of 3.7m contracts on November 9, it said.CME Group, operator of the largest futures exchange in the US, saw average daily volume rise 31 per cent in November, up 31 per cent from November last year and 24 per cent higher than October this year, as it benefited from investor concern about the Federal Reserve’s latest quantitative easing cycle.The group said November represented the highest monthly average daily volume since September 2008, outside of the 16.8m contracts averaged in May when the “flash crash” took place. Volumes at its commodity futures rose 47 per cent compared to November last year while interest rate futures rose 46 per cent and metals rose 34 per cent.Deutsche Börse said a combined 221m contracts traded on Eurex and the International Securities Exchange, the US options exchange it bought in a $2.8bn deal in 2007.In Asia, derivatives volume at the SGX Singapore exchange increased 22 per cent year-on-year to 5.4m contracts, with average daily volume of 264,929, up 18 per cent year-on-year.Trading volumes for the main cash equities trading venues of the US and Europe, like NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX and the London Stock Exchange, are set to be announced next week. The results are expected to be far more downbeat, as typified by NYSE Euronext. Its average daily volume of cash products has risen only 5 per cent year-to-date on 2009 levels while its US business has dropped 22 per cent.The securities market on SGX saw a 46 per cent rise in market turnover to $40bn for November, up 46 per cent year-on-year.The global strength of the derivatives business has made it all the more urgent that the London Stock Exchange pursue its planned foray into equity derivatives, which it announced in June.
498;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-11-29T16:07:23Z;Fese appoints Jochumsen as new president;;The Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE) has appointed Hans-Ole Jochumsen as its new president as the trade association for the region’s established bourses prepares for a deep regulatory review of financial market structures.Mr Jochumsen, also president of Nasdaq OMX Nordic and executive vice president of Nasdaq OMX Group, will head the group for the next two years as the European Commission reviews and implements its Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid).The FESE acts as a trade body for Europe’s stock exchanges and its stance on some of the biggest issues in the industry has provoked controversy. The London Stock Exchange withdrew last year shortly after FESE criticized the off-exchange activities of large banks – so-called dark pools. It was taken as a sign that not all exchanges shared the same view, with some seeing their interests increasingly aligned with the same banks.An attempt in September to define the size of the over-the-counter (OTC) equity markets in Europe at a public hearing on Mifid at the European Commission in Brussels was also challenged by other industry participants.“With an industry undergoing major transformation, I believe that it is more important than ever that the FESE continues to work with other parties in the financial industry to develop fair, transparent and open markets leading to economic growth and investor confidence,” said Mr Jochumsen.Deirdre Somers, chief executive of the Irish Stock Exchange, has been named as vice president of the group. Mr Jochumsen and Ms Somers replace Spyros Capralos of the Athens Exchange and Michael Buhl, CEO of the CEE Stock Exchange Group.
499;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-11-22T16:08:36Z;Quick View: Just an ICE-breaker?;LCH.Clearnet denial does not end US group’s interest in clearing;Is ICE buying LCH.Clearnet?A report in Britain’s Guardian – sourced, by the look of it, from a single “stakeholder” – says LCH.Clearnet has rebuffed a £400m offer from ICE, or IntercontinentalExchange.According to a statement from London-based LCH.Clearnet later on Monday, it has “not received an approach of any sort in relation to its ownership”.Let’s step back a moment.I have long wondered when Jeff Sprecher, ICE chief executive, would make a move into clearing of over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate swaps, having taken the lead among clearing house operators in pushing into clearing of credit default swaps (CDS). The opportunity in rates is far bigger given that the market is 8-10 times bigger than CDS.And his main rival, CME Group, upped the ante a few weeks ago by launching its long-awaited rates clearing business. LCH.Clearnet is itself expected by year-end to launch its interest rate swaps clearing service, aimed at the “buyside” – hedge funds and the like – while International Derivatives Clearing Group, controlled by Nasdaq OMX, is bringing up the rear with its own effort (not much traction there yet).So rates is where the action is.But an approach for LCH.Clearnet makes little sense. If you are interested in rates clearing, you need to be looking at doing a deal with the banks that clear their dealer-to-dealer business through SwapClear. It is notionally part of LCH.Clearnet but its revenues largely go to the banks that run it via OTC Derivnet, a curious governance mechanism that rarely gets mentioned.LCH.Clearnet – without the SwapClear piece – is essentially a clearer of products for the London Metal Exchange, and of cash equities for a dwindling group of customers. NYSE Euronext has announced its intention to stop using the clearer for cash equities and to set up its own Paris-based operation, while the London Stock Exchange has hinted that it might quit using LCH.Clearnet for UK cash equities clearing as well. LCH does have a nice business clearing things like OTC container freight contracts (it cut its fees for this by 40 per cent this month), natural gas in the US and, er, fertiliser swaps. But that, collectively, is not enough to secure LCH.Clearnet’s future.In any case, the mooted price tag of £400m is something like a 15 per cent premium to the book value of the group, at a time when its client base is evaporating.Also, such a valuation implies that OTC clearing really is the money-spinner that people started out thinking it would be because of the current regulatory reforms – ie the push for OTC derivatives clearing in the Dodd-Frank Act in the US and in the European Market Infrastructure Regulations (Emir) proposals by the European Commission. As Mr Sprecher himself has noted, the regulatory burden now faced by operators of new business in market structures – like OTC clearing – is substantial. He has had to make room in his offices for regulators who are monitoring what goes on. That costs money.Yet it does make sense for Mr Sprecher to talk to the OTC Derivnet banks. He pioneered the “mutualisation” model that is increasingly taking hold as exchanges figure out how to work with their biggest customers (the banks). His CDS clearing operation is a revenue-share deal with the big banks in CDS. Why not do the same, or similar, with rates? For it to work, however, there would have to be some ability for big buyside players to get a seat at the table too. But then Mr Sprecher is one of the most respected operators in the business.The interesting thing about the LCH.Clearnet statement is that the clearer has plausible deniability on the story, given that it is possible that an approach by ICE was made to SwapClear or some of the OTC Derivnet banks. Just a thought.Watch this space.
500;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-11-18T23:29:41Z;LSE eyes derivatives boost as it sets launch;;The London Stock Exchange is aiming for a quadrupling in revenue from derivatives trading with the launch in the first half of next year of equity options on its Turquoise pan-European trading system.Xavier Rolet, chief executive, has said the LSE must expand into derivatives and clearing to boost margins and restore it to the ranks of rivals such as Deutsche Börse as well as NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX, the two US-based exchange operators.The LSE is also battling an erosion of its market share in traditional cash equities, which account for 15 per cent of revenues, at the hands of smaller operators such as Chi-X Europe.As it unveiled first-half results the LSE said that it had stabilised market share in the FTSE at about 62 per cent. Average daily value of UK cash equities fell 7 per cent in the six months to the end of September to £4.9bn and revenues from UK cash equities fell 18 per cent to £44m as the exchange cut prices to attract customers.Pre-tax profits rose 26 per cent to £100.2m, partly as the LSE attracted more initial public offerings.However, Thomson Reuters data showed that the LSE’s share has slipped to 52 per cent in recent weeks.Separately, market share in cash equities trading on its Turquoise platform has suffered in recent weeks in part to customer unease over the effects of a recent outage, which disrupted the launch of a faster trading system.The exchange called in the police after it determined that the outage was caused by human intervention, possibly under “suspicious circumstances”.Industry experts question how the LSE can break into equity derivatives in Europe, now dominated by Eurex, the derivatives arm of Deutsche Börse, and NYSE Liffe, the futures and options unit of NYSE Euronext.However, Mr Rolet said that with roughly 80 per cent of equity derivatives in the region traded over-the-counter there was an opportunity to gain share.“It’s hard, but not impossible. The UK equity options market is illiquid and if you look at the equity options market on Eurex it's not always that liquid,” he said.The LSE operates Russian, Scandinavian and Italian derivatives businesses but they account for only 6 per cent of group revenues. Mr Rolet said he was aiming for “somewhere in the region of 25 per cent”. He did not give a timetable.Derivatives clearing will be provided by LCH.Clearnet and Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia, the clearing house of Borsa Italiana, acquired in 2007.The interim dividend is 8.8p (8.4p) and the shares closed up 30½p at 747½p.
501;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-11-12T20:09:06Z;Nasdaq OMX to launch Nordic hybrid dark pool;;Nasdaq OMX, the transatlantic exchange operator, will next week launch a hybrid “dark pool” for cash equity markets in the Nordic region as the industry continues to explore ways to exploit the controversial venues in spite of regulators’ warnings of a potential clampdown.Called Nordic@Mid, it will allow investors from Monday to trade cash equities in Stockholm, Copenhagen, Helsinki and Iceland on the exchanges in a hybrid of an exchange and a dark pool.Dark pools are a type of block trading platform where large institutions such as asset managers can place large orders in the hope of finding a match. Trades are matched in private and prices only revealed once the trade has been completed.Institutions have sought them out for large orders as sophisticated computer-generated algorithms chop orders on exchanges into smaller sizes, meaning large blocks cannot be matched easily. The hybrid is anther way exchanges with publicly-available prices are trying to attract volumes of large trades back to their venues that have increasingly going to standard dark pools operated by competitors of the exchanges.The new Nordic hybrid is similar in concept to one launched last month by Nasdaq OMX in the US, known as Nasdaq PSX, and to Xetra’s Midpoint Match platform. TMX Group of Canada also plans a similar platform. On Thursday the BMV exchange in Mexico unveiled similar plans.Dark pools are seen by many in the industry as the modern electronic equivalent of the old telephone-brokered markets but regulators have threatened to curb their activities amid questions over transparency. They have questioned whether too much pricing of shares takes place away from standard, or “lit”, markets like exchanges.Nasdaq OMX said the platform would be classified like a regulated market under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid), meaning it is required to publish the trades done on it and the price.The launch by Nasdaq OMX will be the second dark pool to be launched in Europe in six days, following UBS with its own dark pool, UBS MTF, on Tuesday.“With Nordic@Mid, institutional investors are now able to execute large block trades efficiently and market neutrally on Nasdaq OMX Nordic exchanges, which are by far the biggest Nordic liquidity pool,“ said Hans-Ole Jochumsen, president of Nasdaq OMX Nordic.Last year Nomura said it would reveal publicly what trades had been done in an effort to “remove the mystery” from the increasingly controversial trading facilities.
502;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-11-08T23:23:18Z;SEC passes ‘stub quote’ rules;;The US Securities and Exchange Commission approved new rules effectively banning “stub quotes”, and warned that out-of-control trading algorithms were still a risk to market stability.The new “stub quote” rules are the most recent a series of changes that aim to rationalise a marketplace which has been split order flow between traditional exchanges, such as NYSE, and newcomers such as so-called “dark pools”, internal brokerage execution platforms and high-frequency trading proprietary trading shops.Stub quotes, or resting price orders on a stock at a penny or $100,000, played a key role on May 6. When market makers stopped trading, these resting quotes were the only prices remaining, which led the S&P 500 index to drop 6 per cent in a matter of minutes.In a test programme, set to launch December 6, the SEC will adopt rules proposed by the major exchanges that require all quotes on stocks in the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 indices, as well as many exchange-traded funds, to be within 8 per cent of the national best bid and offer.Other proposed rules include a ban on unfiltered market access by trading groups, announced last week, and circuit breakers, which halt trading when prices move more than a set percentage away from the market price.The SEC’s proposals have thus far been welcomed by the industry, which shares many concerns about market structure.”Most of the world views our market structure as a joke,” said Larry Leibowitz, chief operating officer at NYSE Euronext, during a panel discussion at the annual meeting of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.“Our market is too fragmented. The challenge is, how much competition is too much competition,” he said. However, there is disagreement about what further changes are needed.Speaking at the Sifma meeting, Mary Schapiro, SEC chair, said she was still concerned that automated trading programs known as algorithms can “go crazy”.“Should they be programmed with throttles to slow them down?” she said.Members of the industry did not share her fear that further rules, such as the SEC pre-approving algos, would be needed. “We’ve taken away the concerns of a runaway algo,” said Eric Noll, executive vice-president of transaction services at Nasdaq OMX.Mr Leibowitz said: “It’s hard to see regulators looking at code, that’s not feasible.”
503;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-11-04T21:53:08Z;Need for consistent market structure to avoid ‘flash crash’;;Mandating equity market-makers to quote bids and offers at all times would not prevent a repeat of the “flash crash”, according to US options industry leaders.In the wake of the May 6 “flash crash”, when markets plunged and rebounded within 20 minutes, some in the equities industry have suggested that market-makers should be obliged to provide bids and offers throughout the trading day, in order to prevent dramatic price drops and spikes.On May 6, many big market participants simply withdrew from the market when prices started to drop in earnest.However, the heads of the US options exchanges - which, unlike the equities markets, have market-maker obligations - agreed at the Futures Industry Association annual Expo in Chicago that the system would be unlikely to hold in the event of a “flash crash” sequel.Gary Katz, head of the International Securities Exchange, owned by Deutsche Boerse, dismissed the suggestion that US regulators should focus on creating incentives for market-makers.“When the market begins to fall like that, there are no incentives big enough to persuade market-makers to catch a falling knife,” Mr Katz said.Tom Whittman, president of Nasdaq OMX, which operates one of the biggest US options-trading platforms, agreed. “Market-makers wouldn’t have stayed in the market on May 6,” he said. “They’d rather pull out and pay a fine.”Ed Boyle, who runs NYSE Euronext’s options business, said the “flash crash” indicated there were bigger and more serious structural issues for regulators, such as the existence of “dark pools” for share trading.“There has to be a more consistent market structure than simply incentives for market-makers,” Mr Boyle said.Bill Brodsky, chief executive of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, said the Securities and Exchange Commission’s report on the “flash crash”, which pinpointed a single trade by Waddell and Reed, a Kansas City-based firm, was suspect.“The SEC never figured out what happened on May 6,” Mr Brodsky said. “The SEC report just doesn’t add up in my view.”On a separate panel at the FIA conference, Scot Warren, managing director of equity index products at CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, attacked the SEC’s flash crash report for pointing a finger at Waddell and Reed in its report.“It’s abhorrent that the client name was released,” said Mr Warren, on whose exchange Waddell and Reed made trades identified by the SEC.Bob Hill, vice-president of NYSE Euronext, said exchanges and regulators were having frequent meetings about how to proceed with reforming the financial markets following the “flash crash”.
504;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-11-04T15:04:36Z;CBOE aims to claw back market share;;The head of the US’s largest options exchange said on Thursday that the company would claw back market share as it fights to retain the top spot in a crowded and highly competitive market.Bill Brodsky, chief executive of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), said the company’s new fully electronic options-trading venue would enable it to stop the gradual erosion of its market share in recent years.The CBOE, which had its initial public offering in June , was the first and remains the largest options-trading platform. However, the two options exchanges operated by Nasdaq OMX have in recent months claimed a bigger slice of the options market.That indicates how the CBOE’s position has gradually eroded in the face of increasingly aggressive competition from rival exchanges, which have lured traders with attractive fee structures.CBOE’s market share dropped to 26.6 per cent last month, down from 30.8 per cent last year, according to the Options Clearing Corporation, which clears for all nine US options exchanges.Mr Brodsky said the dwindling market share was due to low trading volumes across the industry. “Our market share tends to grow when the markets are active …we haven’t had that,” he said.The CBOE chief added that the company expected to reclaim lost ground through C2, a fully electronic exchange launched last week that mimics the “maker-taker” fee model successfully adopted by several other options-trading venues.CBOE is hoping C2 will enable it to reclaim some business from rivals that have particularly courted algorithmic trading firms, which make up an increasing share of the market.At the CBOE’s main exchange in Chicago, fees are charged according to a traditional “payment for order flow” system in which customers trade for free, but market-makers pay a fee that is redistributed back through them to pay broker-dealers for providing customer order flow.However, the fastest-growing exchanges in recent years are those using “maker-taker” fees, a model adopted from the equities market in which trading firms get paid rebates for “making” liquidity by posting limit orders and charges customers for “taking” liquidity with market and marketable limit orders.C2 gives CBOE a traditional and an electronic maker-taker platform, a structure it hopes will enable it to emulate the pricing flexibility enjoyed by NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX, each of which operates two US options exchanges.Mr Brodsky made his remarks as CBOE reported profits for the third quarter which beat Wall Street’s expectations, as the company was boosted by new trading access fees even though trading volumes fell from last year.CBOE made a net profit of $20.5m, up from $19.2m in the same period last year. However, on a per-share basis, earnings fell from 21 cents to 20 cents, since there were 13 per cent more shares outstanding in the last quarter. Excluding extraordinary items, CBOE earned 26 cents per share, ahead of analysts’ average forecasts of 22 cents.Shares in CBOE were down 0.1 per cent at $23.98 by mid-morning in New York.
505;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-11-02T11:46:10Z;NYSE Euronext hit by slow share trading;;NYSE Euronext, the transatlantic trading venue, reported third-quarter earnings ahead of expectations as growth in its technology business offset slow share trading on equity markets.In the three months to September 30, the group said revenues fell 3.5 per cent to $599m as it was hit by the weakness of the euro against the dollar. Earnings fell from $138m, or 53 cents a share, to $121m, or 46 cents per share, in the quarter.NYSE Euronext focused on cutting costs, with the industry struggling with flat markets and becalmed trading as investors shunned equity markets. Last week, rivals such as Deutsche Börse of Germany, Nasdaq OMX and Canada’s TMX Group all highlight the softness of equities trading.“Our results in the third quarter reflect the impact of dampened transaction revenue due to slow overall industry volumes,” said Michael Geltzeiler, chief financial officer.Turnover from equities trading and listing fell 9 per cent but its technology business, which develops platforms and systems for trading venues around the world, saw revenues rise 20 per cent to $113m.The group’s derivatives arm, which accounts for nearly a third of revenues and more than 40 per cent of profits, were hit by steep declines in trading volumes, which fell 25 per cent in Europe and 22 per cent in the US.Net revenues at the unit fell 5 per cent to $188m, hit by adverse foreign exchange fluctuations and a 10 per cent fall in turnover from its European business.Earnings at NYSE’s technology arm were boosted by last year’s $144m acquisition of Nyfix, a US company that sells software allowing asset managers and hedge funds to communicate trading intentions to their brokers and banks. Its IT services arm also faces a potential hit to revenues after a US court of appeal last week turned down a request from NYSE Euronext to continue to charge for ArcaBook, its market data product.NYSE Euronext also said Smartpool, the European dark pool it co-owns with HSBC, JP Morgan and BNP Paribas, had seen strong growth in the quarter, with the number of trades increasing from 541,000 in the second quarter to 855,000.Dark pools are trading venues set up to handle large orders that investors prefer not to place with standard stock exchanges or alternative trading platforms, for fear of revealing their trading intentions.
506;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-10-29T14:31:26Z;Nasdaq OMX earnings beat expectations;;Nasdaq OMX, the transatlantic exchange trading venue operator, beat expectations as it increased its share of the options market, which offset weaker equity trading.The group also refused to rule out further acquisitions in a sector that is considering a fresh round of merger and acquisitions in the wake of the SGX Singapore Exchange’s $8.3bn bid for the ASX Australian Stock Exchange.“We are in scale business and when there are opportunities for scale against a relatively fixed cost environment, it is very appealing,” said Adena Friedman, chief financial officer. However she cautioned that time zones and the regulatory environment would be a factor in the group’s considerations.The New York-based group said revenues rose 7 per cent to $372m while net income for the quarter rose from $89m a year ago to $101m. The group included a write-off of $4m related to restructuring and job cuts.Earnings results from rivals such as Deutsche Börse of Germany, broker ITG of the US and Canada’s TMX Group this week have highlighted the softness of equities trading markets. Faced with competition from alternative trading venues in the US and regulatory change, Nasdaq is seeking to claim a piece of the market for clearing over-the-counter derivatives.“Despite lower industry trading volumes, we delivered exceptional results this quarter,” said Bob Greifeld, chief executive. “The scale of the Nasdaq OMX business model leaves us well positioned to achieve our stated goal of generating annualised net revenue of $2bn by the end of 2013.”The group, which bought Swedish exchange OMX in 2008 runs exchanges in North America, the Nordic countries and the Baltics. Shares in Nasdaq rose 50 cents to $21.45.Nasdaq OMX would not comment on the bid by SGX for ASX. The group provides technology to both platforms. However the bid is widely seen as a harbinger of accelerating consolidation among markets around the world and yesterday TMX Group, operator of the Toronto stock exchange, indicated it wanted to be part of the consolidation.Nasdaq OMX’s total market share of the US options market rose from 25.1 per cent in the second quarter to 28.8 per cent in the third quarter. Its Nordic European derivatives-based revenue rose 11 per cent on higher volumes while Nasdaq OMX PHLX and Nasdaq Options Market platforms reached their highest-ever market share on a quarterly basis at 23.7 percent and 5.1 percent, respectively.Investors have been pulling funds from US markets since the “ flash crash” of May 6, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped nearly 1,000 points in 20 minutes.Data from the Investment Companies Institute, the US-based trade group which measures domestic equity mutual funds flows, have marginally improved in the last couple of weeks. Nasdaq OMX added that its equity market share fell from 22.8 per cent to 22.3 per cent.“Competitive headwinds against a more muted market backdrop are likely to dampen further top-line and earnings growth,” said Howard Chen, an analyst at Credit Suisse.Derivative trading and clearing net exchange revenues fell from $69m in the second quarter to $60m in the third quarter as it paid out more in liquidity revenues, while European derivatives trading weakened.Nasdaq owns a majority stake in the International Derivatives Clearing Corporation, which has been seeking to clear and settle interest rate swaps by converting them into economically equivalent futures contracts for the past two years.Ms Friedman said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were also continuing to test clearing through IDCC using a “shadow portfolio” of swaps. The two government-sponsored enterprises are major players in the interest rate swap market, using them as hedging tools against interest rate fluctuations.
507;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-10-28T18:30:35Z;Pressured exchanges evaluate options;;If one word describes the US equity options industry, it is “fragmented”.First, liquidity has fractured, following the introduction in 2007 of penny pricing, an initiative by the Securities and Exchange Commission to quote options prices in one-cent increments rather than the traditional 5-cent or 10-cent jumps.This has meant that for all but a handful of the most liquid stock options, the size of displayed bids and offers has plunged – to 10- and 20-lots when they were formerly in the thousands.But the market itself has fragmented, with sharp growth in recent years in the number of options exchanges. On Friday, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the original and still the biggest options exchange, will add to this fragmentation with the launch of C2, an all-electronic trading platform taking the total number of US options exchanges to nine.The increase in the number of exchanges has made the options marketplace fiercely competitive, with rivals fighting tooth-and-nail for fractions of market share. Some exchanges accuse others of forgoing profitability so as to increase their slice of the business. The single-minded pursuit of market share has made some aspects of the industry look dysfunctional.C2’s launch has prompted some to ask what benefit yet another exchange brings to the market and to pose the broader question of how the industry can “grow the pie” by attracting more volume, rather than cutting it into ever-smaller pieces.For the CBOE – which had its initial public offering in June – the new venture holds out the possibility of clawing back some of the market share it has lost in recent years.Part-floor-traded, part-electronic, the exchange’s fee structure is a traditional “payment for order flow” system in which customers trade for free, but marketmakers pay a fee that is redistributed back through them to pay broker-dealers for providing customer order flow.The exchange has lost market share in part because of the growth of electronic exchanges with “maker-taker” fees, a model adopted from the equities market in which traders get paid rebates for trades which are deemed to “make”, or add overall liquidity to the exchange. By contrast, traders are charged for trades that “take” liquidity off the exchange.To try to steal back some of this market, the CBOE will also adopt “maker-taker” fees for C2. It hopes this will enable it to appeal to the algorithmic traders who are increasingly important in the market, and is locating C2 in New York to attract the high-frequency traders based there who currently focus on equities.By having both a traditional and an electronic maker-taker platform, the CBOE aims to emulate the pricing flexibility enjoyed by NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX, each of which operates two US options exchanges.Yet by launching with popular options on stocks such as Ford, AT&T and McDonald’s, using a fee model already used by several other exchanges, some say the CBOE is bringing little new to the market.“We’re not growing the market with adding another exchange, I will confess that,” says Ed Tilly, CBOE executive vice-chairman, “but this enables us to handle all our customer needs from an order-handling perspective.”The CBOE is trying to appeal to existing customers for whom certain strategies can be executed more efficiently and cheaply on C2, as well as to avoid having to route orders to other exchanges when it does not have the best pricing. Yet there is a danger that the new platform could end up cannibalising trading volume from its parent exchange.“If it’s simply a fully electronic, high-speed, technology-enabled platform that replicates what exists already, it’s going to steal market share both from their competitors as well as from CBOE,” says Andy Nybo, head of derivatives at the Tabb Group.That points up a central criticism of the way the overall market has evolved. In seeking market share, some industry experts say, exchanges are engaging in a range of practices that are harmful to the overall industry.Through their fee structures, some exchanges are in effect paying customers to trade with them, taking a loss in order to increase volumes. Exchange groups such as Nasdaq OMX, NYSE Euronext, BATS and now the CBOE can afford to subsidise unprofitable trading platforms for the time being, but the phenomenon raises the question of the sustainability of that model – even if options volumes return to their pre-crisis growth rates.The International Securities Exchange, one of the biggest options-trading platforms, accuses rival Nasdaq OMX’s PHLX market of inflating its volumes by allowing “dividend trades”, in which professional traders profit at the expense of retail investors who fail to convert options into shares in time for dividends.A further 10 per cent of the market is thought to be simply high-frequency traders arbitraging fees between the exchanges to collect rebates without actually using options as part of an investing strategy.While exchanges continue to squabble over market share, experts say the industry needs innovative product offerings to expand overall volumes. One important innovation would be if C2 were to introduce electronic trading of “SPX” – options on the S&P 500 index, a hugely popular proprietary product now principally traded in the CBOE’s biggest trading pit in Chicago.Mr Tilly says that proposal is being reviewed by regulators, with a launch targeted for next year. However, he could face significant opposition from the CBOE’s own trading floor, where traders would not be keen to see their wide spreads contract on an electronic market.“That pit has long resisted any idea of going electronic,” says Mark Longo, a former SPX trader who now runs the Options Insider, an options education website. “They have a monopoly now – if you want to trade SPX you have to come to the floor and trade their wide markets. The CBOE might have a big internal fight on their hands there.”www.ft.com/tradingroom
508;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
509;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-10-27T18:33:39Z;ABN Amro to begin interest rate swaps clearing;;ABN Amro Clearing, part of the Dutch bank group, will begin to handle clearing interest rate swaps from December as it fights for a slice of the world’s largest over-the-counter derivatives market.The group, which cleared 3bn in derivatives contracts last year, said it would offer instant access to OTC products across multi-asset classes.Financial reform legislation on both sides of the Atlantic will make clearing of standardised derivatives mandatory by the end of 2012, and while regulators work out the details, trading platforms, banks and clearing houses are lining up to be the key infrastructure providers.CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, announced two weeks ago that it was planning to clear interest-rate swaps. The International Derivatives Clearing Group, a clearing house backed by Nasdaq OMX that has processed some $400m-worth of interest-rate swaps is also looking for a slice of the market. Further competition is set to come from LCH.Clearnet, the UK-based clearing house, which expects to launch clearing in coming weeks.A bank such as ABN is aiming to handle OTC trading on behalf of the buy-side firm.“It is because we are unconflicted and not a dealer that we are confident we can succeed,” said Jan Bart de Boer, chief commercial officer at ABN AMRO Clearing Bank. He added that it would provide tough competition for rivals. “There is a very small group of firms who have the balance sheet and capability,” he said.Interest rate swaps account for about 75 per cent of the OTC derivatives market. They are financial instruments where, for a defined period, a pre-agreed fixed interest rate is swapped for a floating interest rate. They are often used to protect their users, often industrial companies, from the impact of interest rate changes on borrowings and are also used by asset managers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage lenders, and used speculatively by banks.Clearing has been pinpointed by regulators as a way to reduce counterparty and systemic risk in the OTC market. There was an estimated global exposure of $418 trillion on interest rate swaps market globally in 2008 according to the Bank of International Settlement. A clearing house stands between two parties in a trade, stepping in to ensure a deal is completed even if one defaults.
510;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-10-26T17:00:44Z;SGX’s $8.3bn bid tests Asian consolidation;It is already beginning to look like a deal that may not make it, writes Kevin Brown;The Singapore Exchange’s $8.3bn bid for the Australian Stock Exchange is probably the only deal that could be done today to consolidate Asia’s bourses in the face of surging competition from alternative platforms. But with the ink hardly dry on the offer document, it is already beginning to look like a deal that may not make it.The bid marks an important moment in Asia’s snail-like process of coming to terms with the fragmentation of securities trading as dark pools and other alternative platforms arrive from the US and Europe.So far, the new platforms have been handicapped by the region’s multitude of country-based regulatory regimes, which make it difficult for new entrants to build scale. But Magnus Böcker, the energetic chief executive of the SGX, is right in judging that national rules will not hold the competition at bay for ever. The only answer is for the traditional exchanges to get bigger and cheaper before they are overwhelmed.The takeover would achieve that. The combined exchange would be the world’s fifth biggest by market capitalisation, with more listings than any Asian exchange except Mumbai’s BSE. It would have the region’s biggest markets in real estate investment trusts and exchange-traded funds and the most derivative products.The deal could also act as a trigger for regional consolidation. By presenting itself as an international exchange, the combined entity might be able to persuade other bourses to join up. Yusli Mohamed Yusoff, head of Kuala Lumpur’s Bursa Malaysia, has already said he is open to fresh ideas. The momentum might also trigger fresh progress on a putative south-east Asian stock trading initiative involving Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam.If the bid succeeds, both exchanges could break out of their rich but small domestic markets to attract initial public offerings aimed at pools of Asian capital outside China and Japan. There is no reason why the $17.85bn IPO of AIA or the primary Asian listing of Prudential could not have come to the combined entity instead of to Hong Kong. Big Asian companies might choose it instead of the London Stock Exchange or Nasdaq.Yet the circumstances of the bid are peculiar. It is only possible because SGX trades at a significantly higher price- earnings ratio than ASX – about 26 times compared with 17. The Singapore Exchange is under-leveraged compared with its peers, and is highly cash generative. As a result it is able to afford a cash and shares bid that offers a premium of 37 per cent to ASX shareholders. The premium rises to a massive 45 per cent on a six-month, volume-weighted average price basis.The ASX has the added incentive of having just lost its monopoly following the provisional licensing of Chi-X, which is expected to launch a competing exchange shortly. It is hard to see another such opportunity arising in similarly propitious circumstances. Yet the deal faces several major obstacles, including requiring shareholder approval in both countries and a long list of regulatory requirements.SGX thought it had this taped. According to a person with close knowledge of the transaction, there have been “a lot” of informal contacts with regulators, whose initial response was sympathetic. That is in line with Australia’s openness to foreign capital in general, and its conversion to exchange competition in particular. Singapore Telecommunications and other Singaporean companies have been allowed to acquire Australian assets in the past.The big issue, though, will be political. Tough questions are already being asked about the Singapore government’s 23.5 per cent shareholding in SGX, even though the shares are not voted. Australian parliamentarians are also linking the bid to Singapore’s controlled media and limited civil liberties. Bob Katter, an independent MP, called the proposal “lunacy on a grand scale”. Senator Bob Brown, leader of the Greens, said the ASX would be “subjugated to Singapore”.In normal times this might not matter. A determined government could simply ignore the critics. But Australia’s Labor government lacks a majority in both houses of parliament. Complaints from small parties would not matter much if the Liberal/National party opposition coalition backed the deal. But Joe Hockey, its spokesman, has also signalled unease that “our major regional competitor is buying out our main stock exchange”.If the government tries to lift a legal cap of 15 per cent on foreign ownership of the ASX its parliamentary critics will almost certainly force a vote. Tempers may cool, but rejection looks entirely possible. That would derail the deal and crush Mr Böcker’s hopes of transforming the SGX. It would also be a major setback for hopes of rational consolidation in the Asian exchanges industry.Kevin Brown is the FT’s Asia Regional Correspondentkevin.brown@ft.comwww.ft.com/insidebusiness
511;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-10-25T22:41:46Z;Chinese internet video site set for IPO;;Tudou, one of China’s leading video websites, is preparing an initial public offering with hopes of raising at least $100m, amid fierce competition in the sector.The company said it expected to complete the IPO on the Nasdaq exchange within the next six months – a schedule that would make it the first Chinese internet video site to go public.Youku, the company’s main competitor, has indicated in the past that it aims to go public, but has declined to comment on timing and size of a potential IPO.People close to the planned Tudou deal said it aimed to raise up to $150m. The company has hired Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank to advise it on the listing.Both Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank declined to comment.The plan comes as China’s state media are muscling into the country’s Rmb4bn ($601m) internet video industry, which has so far been dominated by privately owned groups. Tencent and Baidu, China’s two largest internet companies, have also started online video services.Behind Tudou and Youku, Ku6, a group that was recently acquired by Shanda, the internet gaming company, is the third-largest player.“Going public is an unavoidable path for the Chinese internet video sites,” said Zhao Xufeng, an analyst at iResearch.“The IPO will strengthen Tudou in the current fierce competition in the Chinese internet video market,” said Tang Yizhi, a researcher at Analysys in Beijing.According to Analysys, revenues in the sector were worth Rmb621m in the third quarter, an increase of 148 per cent over the same period last year. The research house’s statistics show Youku as the market leader with about 17 per cent and Tudou as number two with about 13 per cent.iResearch, another Beijing-based internet research firm, forecast the industry’s revenues to reach Rmb4bn for the full year.Advertising accounts for most of the video sites’ revenues.Tudou is backed by a number of venture capital firms.In August, Tudou raised $50m in a private placement with Temasek, the Singapore state investment fund, accounting for $35m.Gary Wang, Tudou’s chief executive, told the Financial Times then that he intended to spend the money on the company’s infrastructure and more own content in order to counter new competitors.
512;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-10-25T16:37:46Z;Böcker pursues gateway vision;;If it goes through, the Singapore Exchange’s audacious A$8.4bn ($8.3bn) bid for the Australian Stock Exchange will catapult Magnus Böcker from the sidelines of the global exchanges sector to the centre.Mr Böcker, the Swedish chief executive of SGX, would head a combined exchange that would rank fifth in the world in terms of global market capitalisation, and would boast more listings than any other Asian exchange except the BSE in Mumbai.Yet he arrived at the SGX only 10 months ago, at a time when the suggestion that it might shortly win the approval of its Sydney rival for a takeover bid would probably have raised a hollow laugh at the exchange’s swish headquarters in central Singapore.SGX officials say his time in the chief executive’s chair has been a rollercoaster ride as he first articulated a vision for remaking the exchange as a gateway to Asia excluding China, and then set off in hot pursuit of it.The pattern is not new for the intensely competitive, marathon-running Mr Böcker, 49.He pulled off a series of similar mergers this decade as head of OMX, the Nordic Exchanges Company he helped to create from several separate north European exchanges.He then presided over OMX’s merger with Nasdaq in 2008, becoming president of Nasdaq OMX before joining SGX in December last year.Crucially for the ASX deal, Mr Böcker is close to senior figures at the Australian exchange, some of whom he has known since 1995 when OSX began providing technology to the Sydney bourse.Whether the deal goes through or not, the ASX is set to lose its effective domestic monopoly next year, with the entry of Chi-X Australia.
513;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-10-25T10:13:01Z;SGX and ASX confident of tie-up success;;An A$8.4bn (US$8.3bn) bid by the Singapore Exchange for its Australian counterpart is unlikely to be blocked by regulators in spite of significant Singapore government involvement, according to top officials of both bourses.The agreed bid faces a raft of regulatory hurdles, including approval from the Australian securities regulator and the federal government, which must agree to lift a 15 per cent cap on foreign ownership.The regulators are expected to scrutinise closely the Singapore government’s 23.5 per cent stake in the Singapore Exchange, which dwarfs the next largest shareholding of 4.9 per cent, owned by the Tokyo Stock Exchange.However, Magnus Böcker, chief executive of the Singapore Exchange, and Robert Elstone, his counterpart at the Australian Stock Exchange, said on Monday that “informal soundings” suggested the deal would be allowed through.Both refused to elaborate on the soundings. However, Mr Elstone said: “By definition, if they had been negative in character, Magnus and I would not be sitting here today.”Mr Bocker said the voting rights attached to the Singapore government’s shareholding had not been used, and the stake was not relevant to the regulation of the exchange by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. The shares are held through a special purpose vehicle set up when the exchange was listed.If it succeeds, the deal would create Asia’s second-largest listing venue, behind the Bombay Stock Exchange but ahead of both Tokyo and Hong Kong. It would have the region’s largest listings of exchange-traded funds and real estate investment trusts, and the biggest derivatives platform.The merged exchange would be the world’s fifth-biggest by market capitalisation, at about $12.3bn, and Asia’s second-largest after Hong Kong, currently valued at about $24bn.However, the deal was received badly by investors in Singapore, where SGX shares closed down 6 per cent at S$8.950. ASX shares surged 19 per cent to A$41.75, the biggest rise since November 1998.Under the deal announced on Monday, SGX plans to buy the Australian exchange via a scheme of arrangement using a mix of cash and shares. It will pay A$22 cash and 3.473 new SGX shares for each ASX share, valuing the ASX at A$8.4bn, or A$48 a share. The deal is pitched at a 37 per cent premium to Friday’s price.Although the deal is described as a merger, the headquarters of the joint company would be in Singapore, and the SGX would appoint 11 of 15 directors to the joint board. ASX shareholders would have 36 per cent of the combined entity with SGX shareholders holding the remainder.Mr Böcker would become chief executive, with Peter Hiom, deputy chief executive of the ASX, as his deputy. Chew Choon Seng, chairman elect of the SGX would be non-executive chairman of the combined entity, with David Gonski, chairman of ASX, as deputy. Mr Gonski would remain chairman of a subsidiary ASX board with a majority of Australian directors.The bid for the ASX caps a series of initiatives by the SGX since Mr Böcker, the Swedish former president of Nasdaq OMX, took over in December last year. These include an arrangement confirmed on Friday with Nasdaq OMX that allows companies to list on both exchanges via American Depositary Receipts.SGX has also significantly expanded its commodities business, and announced plans to attract high-frequency traders by building the world’s fastest trading engine and to offer bond trading to retail investors.It recently won a licence from the MAS to launch a “dark pool” joint venture with Chi-X, the trading platform operator.SGX is being advised by Morgan Stanley. UBS is advisor to ASX.
514;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-10-25T09:45:49Z;Quick View: A high-speed challenge;;Guys, enough already!On Monday, Nasdaq OMX said it had introduced the world’s fastest trading system with the rollout in its Nordic markets of Genium Inet, the group’s spanking new trading system.Latency? Less than 100 microseconds.This comes only a week or two after the London Stock Exchange claimed it had the fastest trading system in the world after launching MillenniumIT’s new system on Turquoise.The claim then was 126 microseconds. No, not 125, but 126. Just so we’re clear on that.And out of Asia, we will soon see SGX match the Nordics when it rolls out Genium Inet as well. (But of course the more interesting news out of Asia on Monday is the Singapore exchange’s bold move to take over ASX in Australia).A few months ago Algo Technologies said that it had, in a laboratory environment, managed to get latency down to 16 microseconds.The arms race in trading speed is now absurd.Of course, we know that it all has to do with high-frequency trading strategies. But to the average punter it beggars belief that trading at these speeds a) matters and b) is good for capital formation generally.I have yet to hear a decent explanation from an industry practitioner for this. So here is an invitation: if you can explain, in a few hundred words, why speed is a force for good in markets, email me below and we will publish the best response.But hurry.

515;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-10-25T05:01:31Z;SGX shares slip on ASX takeover plan;;Shares in SGX, the Singapore exchange, fell nearly 7 per cent after it unveiled an agreed A$8.4bn (US$8.2bn) offer for Australia’s ASX in a deal that would create Asia’s second-largest exchange group.Under the plan announced on Monday, SGX plans to buy the Australian exchange using a mix of cash and shares as competition and the growth of electronic trading is forcing the region’s players to consolidate. It will pay A$22 cash and 3.473 new SGX shares for each ASX share, valuing the ASX at A$8.4bn or A$48 a share.ASX shares rose as much as 25 per cent to A$43.89 after they resumed trading on Monday. The deal is pitched at a 37 per cent premium to Friday’s closing price of A$34.96.A combined group would be the fifth largest exchange in the world, behind Deutsche Börse, and second in Asia after Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing, as measured by the market capitalisation of the exchanges as listed entities.While both SGX and ASX are profitable neither can grow much beyond their domestic markets by staying independent, analysts say. Niki Beattie, managing director of The Market Structure Practice, a London-based consultancy, says: “Strategically long-term, in terms of surviving in the Asian market, they have both got to do a deal. And they are probably the least contentious partners for each other.”The SGX has in recent months stepped up links with other exchanges as part of its strategy to be what it calls “the Asian gateway”, including agreeing on Friday an arrangement with Nasdaq OMX to offer companies opportunities for listing on both exchanges.ASX has been upgrading its trading systems and fee schedules to deal with competition from alternative platforms and to attract the high-frequency traders that are flocking to Asia.Such competition has taken a toll on exchanges in the US and Europe, where the London Stock Exchange has lost 45 per cent of its share of trading in FTSE 100 shares to platforms such as Chi-X Europe – whose sister company Chi-X Global is set to start offering share trading in Australia in coming months.Both SGX and ASX share the same trading platform, provided by Nasdaq OMX. There is also little overlap between each other’s products, making them a good fit. They also share the same language and legal system.For ASX, a deal would allow it to expand its distribution and “plug into Asia”, a source at one of the exchanges said. “At the senior management level there is a meeting of minds. They appreciate they need to make some tough hard decisions to move the business forward.”The two biggest ASX shareholders are Perpetual, a fund manager with 4.98 per cent, and National Australia Bank with 3.1 per cent, according to Bloomberg.Any deal would mark a victory for Magnus Böcker, SGX chief executive, in his ambition to turn the city-state’s bourse into one of the dominant exchange operators in Asia.He is a former head of OMX, the operator of exchanges in the Nordic region, and was a key figure in its acquisition by Nasdaq of the US. He is expected to be named chief executive of a new holding company, if the deal is approved by shareholders.SGX shares were last trading 5 per cent lower at S$9.04, having fallen as much as 6.7 per cent earlier.
516;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-10-22T09:53:56Z;SGX set to launch $6bn offer for ASX;;SGX, the Singapore exchange, is preparing to launch a takeover offer of more than A$6bn ($5.8bn) for its Australian counterpart, ASX, as early as Monday in a deal that would combine two of Asia’s biggest exchange operators.Shares in SGX and ASX were suspended from trading on Friday afternoon, with the Australian group adding it was in talks about a “possible business combination”.ASX did not name the party that had “reactivated confidential discussions” but people close to the situation said Robert Elstone, ASX chief executive, had held merger talks with Magnus Böcker, his SGX counterpart. One of those people cautioned that SGX may hit delays and an offer may not materialise.The deal is a sign that both exchanges recognise they cannot rely on their domestic markets for growth in a region where markets for stock, futures and options trading is growing faster than US and European markets for the first time.It comes as Asia is seeing share trading fragment away from established national exchanges as nimbler competitors emerge and “high-frequency” traders flock to the region in search of trading opportunities.Such trends have already swept western markets and have prompted both ASX and SGX to upgrade their trading systems and offer new platforms to cater to these traders in recent months. This week, SGX admitted Getco, one of the world’s largest proprietary trading firms, as a member.The two exchanges also share the same technology platform, provided by Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator. Also on Friday, SGX and Nasdaq OMX said they had expanded a co-operation agreement and would now allow companies listed on each market to cross-list on the other, as well as providing dual listing opportunities for new initial public offerings.Mr Böcker said: “The partnership …will bring a wider selection of investment choices to our investors and offer companies access to an enlarged pool of investors. This strengthens our Asian gateway strategy.”The SGX placed its shares in a trading halt “pending release of an announcement”. It did not make any further comment.ASX shares rose just under 3 per cent to A$34.96 before they were put into a trading halt.“ASX does not have any information to disclose at this time but has observed an increase in the ASX share price,” it said. “A party has recently reactivated confidential discussions with the ASX concerning a possible business combination. ASX believes that the discussions remain confidential but in light of the potential for speculation is concerned to manage its [continuous] disclosure obligations.”UBS is an adviser to ASX.Any deal faces significant regulatory hurdles in Australia. The country’s authorities may demand some level of Australian management and board representation, while management’s headquarters is also likely to be a thorny issue.ASX has a market value of nearly A$6.1bn compared to SGX’s S$10.5bn.The Australian exchange is a monopoly in its local market but is due to face competition next year after Chi-X Global was awarded preliminary approval for a market licence by the Australian government.The ASX has in the past held merger talks with SGX and Deutsche Börse. It has also had discussions with the London Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange.An ASX takeover needs approval from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Reserve Bank of Australia and Canberra.Australia’s Corporations Act also limits any one shareholder from owning more than 15 per cent of ASX although that cap can be lifted by the government without an act of parliament.
517;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-10-17T22:26:41Z;CME wins swap-clearing support;;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and other big users of the $350,000bn interest-rate swaps market will back the CME Group’s swap-clearing house, a move that is likely to boost the exchange’s chances of breaking into this potentially lucrative new business.CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, is expected to announce details of its interest-rate swaps clearing plans on Monday. The exchange declined to comment, but people familiar with the plans said that the CME’s clearing push is being backed by 10 leading banks and six large users of the market, also called the “buyside”. These are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-backed mortgage financiers, and investors Pimco, Wamco, Citadel and BlackRock.Financial reform legislation has targeted the privately-traded derivatives market, with new laws requiring large parts of these derivatives to move to clearing houses. At the moment, these contracts are backed by individual derivatives dealers, which exposes the financial system to risks if one of the dealers goes under.The use of clearing houses is supposed to mitigate such risks because the losses that would follow a default of a big derivatives dealer would be absorbed by all the members of the clearing house.Interest-rate swaps are the largest part of the OTC derivatives market. They are used to place bets on the direction of interest rates and also to hedge investments and debts that are sensitive to interest rates. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are big users of interest-rate swaps. Their participation in the CME clearing house, as well as that of other big investors, will ensure that the CME gets clearing business. International Derivatives Clearing Group, a clearing house backed by Nasdaq OMX, is also pushing for business, and has processed some $400m worth of interest-rate swaps.The 10 dealers expected to participate in clearing swaps with the CME include: Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Nomura and UBS. BlackRock said it was planning to participate in clearing swaps with the CME as it is part of an advisory committee consisting of buyside firms. Other investors and banks declined to comment.Additional reporting by Suzanne Kapner in New York
518;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-10-17T17:29:37Z;Quick View: At last a real debate about exchanges’ role;;"Last week the World Federation of Exchanges held its annual meeting in Paris.It was the first time they’d opened the event up to the press. And a good thing too. Exchanges are at the epicentre of the market structures debate, which itself is undeniably a public policy issue now.So it was useful to have representatives of 52 of the world’s bourses gathered in the InterContinental Paris Le-Grand hotel (in business since 1862, the year the San Francisco Stock and Exchange Board was founded, incidentally).WFE has long been a talking shop for the exchanges. Most years they moan about competition – from new start-ups and between the exchanges – and how unfair it all is. This year was different, those attending said. Of course the exchanges talked up their own book, and had a go at over the-counter (OTC) trading. You would expect that.But there was also a real debate about market structures and exchanges’ role in them that ought to get regulators and market participants listening. As Deirdre Somers, chief executive of the Irish Stock Exchange, told me: “It was a lot more collegiate this year. We actually talked about useful stuff.”Essentially it boiled down to one question: what is an exchange for, what is its social value?The usual answer is: a venue where companies, or issuers, can raise capital reliably and where prices on their secondary markets are formed with a maximum of transparency and where investors, big and small, can trust that this process is working fairly for them.It is hard to have faith that this is any longer the case. Take companies. At the moment, a company’s shares may be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, but they are traded across a multitude of venues ranging from other “newbie” exchanges like BATS Exchange, ECNs (electronic communications networks), dark pools and broker networks. The growth of algorithms and high-frequency trading (HFT) has added to the number and type of market participants.On the one hand this is good; it adds to liquidity. On the other hand, if I am a company CEO or investor relations officer, do I really understand where and how my company’s shares are traded these days? Probably not.Antonio Zoido, chief executive of Spain’s BME exchange, said: “Ask the issuers. Do they want to be traded on all these venues? They don’t even know they are being traded on all these venues!”For that CEO again, does it matter that a high-frequency trader is not interested in company fundamentals, especially if so many of my shares change hands between these players? We don’t yet know the answer, but CEOs need to be asking questions.Thomas Kloet, of TMX Group, owner of the Toronto exchange, put it like this: “The group that I don’t think we’ve heard enough from is the issuer community. What I think they don’t realise is that eight guys in a garage can trade their stock and effectively print [trade-report] that stock. It’s about the image of the company. I think that’s a pretty material issue.”French finance minister Christine Lagarde honed in on the technology aspect, meaning the extent to which trading technology has become so sophisticated that there were now “difficulties in responsibility and accountability” – what she termed “techno-compatibility”, bringing a concept to life through word association in a way that the French do so well.Atsushi Saito, of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, came up with the perfect T-shirt slogan for anyone in the business worried about this: “We should use technology, not be used by technology”.Robert Greifeld, CEO of Nasdaq OMX, picked up on the role of market-making, saying there had been a “decade-long march away from the privileges and responsibilities” of participants and market-makers – a reference to the role now played in market-making by some high-frequency traders.But it took keynote speaker Thomas Peterffy, chief executive of Interactive Brokers, to say the unsayable: the way markets are now fragmented was “a complete mess”.He was particularly exercised by the extent to which – as he claimed – orders were no longer being sent to exchanges but instead being sold to “internalisers” matching retail orders against their own. It was so bad, he said, that “there is no real supply and demand at the exchanges any more”.Whether this last point is true, the dysfunctional state of market structures threatens irreparable damage to the public’s trust in the way markets function. That was brought into sharp relief by the flash crash of May 6. Billions of dollars have been pulled out of US equity markets since then. It would be a mistake to think that this merely is down to investor’s concerns with the US economy.Duncan Niederauer, CEO of NYSE Euronext – the event’s main sponsor – said that as far as issuers were concerned, this could have a direct effect on capital-raising: “If we’re not careful where this takes us is the attractiveness of quoting in the public markets will dissipate.” There was some discussion about whether exchanges should simply become trading venues. Yet this would imply throwing overboard the role an exchange has in looking after issuers. None of the exchanges seemed to want to go there.So who do the exchanges blame for creating the “mess”? The regulators, of course.Xavier Rolet, CEO of the London Stock Exchange, questioned the “central dogma of efficiency” that drove regulators to unleash competition through the creation of “Reg NMS” in the US and “Mifid” (the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) in Europe.I think he and others that take this tack are right. Competition has had undeniable unintended consequences – and I’m not just referring to the “flash crash”. Mary Schapiro, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has rightly started discussing others in her speeches focused on market structures. (As an aside, the US options exchanges were rather pleased with themselves, pointing to their part of the markets as evidence that it is perfectly possible to have fragmentation and competition and, as Gary Katz of International Securities Exchange, called “a level playing field”.)But it is important to recognize that exchanges, even as they rail against how market structures are morphing, are only too happy to reap the benefits by rolling out data centres, offering “co-location” services and tweaking their tariffs to make them more amenable to the HFT crowd. I don’t recall a single panel at the WFE event on these issues, or even the barest mention of this.Exchanges will need to have an answer for this, because if they don’t, their other messages will simply carry less credibility. To put it mildly."
519;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-10-14T22:38:48Z;CME to start interest-rate swap clearing;;CME Group, the US’s biggest futures exchange, plans to begin clearing interest-rate swaps on Monday as it attempts to break into the largest over-the-counter derivatives market.Although the exchange group did not make any official statement and a spokesman would not confirm the launch, people familiar with the situation said that the CME was hoping to launch with the support of some of the biggest dealers in the contracts.Financial reform legislation will make clearing of standardised derivatives mandatory, and clearing houses are lining up to capture this new business.The CME faces competition for the market from LCH.Clearnet, the UK-based clearing house, which for the past decade has been clearing dealer-to-dealer swaps and has also targeted this year to extend its SwapClear service to the US.Another competitor is the International Derivatives Clearing Group, a clearing house backed by Nasdaq OMX that has processed some $400m-worth of interest-rate swaps.One big New York-based derivatives dealer said that it was looking at the possibility of clearing interest-rate swaps through the CME once the system was up and running.The CME has long said that it wanted to launch interest-rate swap clearing by the end of the year, and has said that it is negotiating with dealers including Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Nomura and UBS. It could also involve investors from the buy side.Chris Allen, an analyst at Ticonderoga Securities in New York, said that volumes were likely to be slow at first. “This will probably be something of a ‘soft launch’,” he said. “There’ll be a lot of testing, some contracts will go on, but I wouldn’t expect it to be like flipping a light switch and all of a sudden the thing takes off.”Clearing interest-rate swaps presents a potentially lucrative opportunity for the CME. Outstanding contracts in the interest-rate swap market are valued at $349,000bn globally – some $112,000bn of which is US dollar-denominated, according to Ticonderoga’s figures. Of that, OTC derivatives industry experts estimate that about 70-80 per cent of contracts are eligible to be cleared.A key factor in who dominates US interest rate swaps clearing will be decisions by users of derivatives, or the “buyside”, which includes hedge funds, pension funds and government-backed mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.“An issue for buyside clients is that they prefer to have exposure to a US based entity,” said Alexander Yavorsky, senior analyst at Moody’s Investors Service.“The likely winner in the US interest rate swaps market will probably be the clearing house that ultimately gets picked by big users like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.”
520;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-10-12T16:24:04Z;Greifeld says no repeat of ‘flash crash’;;The “flash crash” that sent shares plunging in the US five months ago could not happen again in the same way given safeguards since put in place, but the use of trading algorithms had to incorporate more “robustness” in the way they were used, the chief executive of exchange operator Nasdaq OMX, Robert Greifeld, said.His comments came as the severe markets disruption on May 6, which has led to a loss of investor trust in the way US market structures work, has become a headache for regulators. A report by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission this month blamed a single computer trading algorithm for triggering a 1,000 point fall – and subsequent rebound – in the Dow Jones average.A new system of industry-wide circuit breakers has been in place since the crash, although regulators have said further measures may be necessary.“The actions that have been taken so far have eliminated [the possibility] that the same set of circumstances will create the same result,” Mr Greifeld told the Financial Times at the World Federation of Exchanges annual meeting. He said that market systems needed to “hold ourselves to a higher standard”.Asked if that meant a flash crash of any kind was still possible, he said: “We don’t foresee it right now but we’re spending a lot of time basically ‘war-gaming’ what can happen in any number of situations.”“Everybody who has an algo has to have a standard of robustness to the [computer] code. That’s half the job, so you can leave it [the algorithm] alone [to operate],” Mr Greifeld said.Exchanges heads at the meeting have complained that regulations allowing competition in equity markets in the US and Europe has led to trading liquidity becoming fragmented across too many venues – something that the SEC has also highlighted as an issue.In Europe, Nasdaq recently closed its pan-European trading platform, one of a handful that have sprung up to challenge established exchanges. Speculation has persisted that Nasdaq may try and get back into pan-European equities, possibly by buying Chi-X Europe, the largest such such platform.Asked if Nasdaq needed a presence in pan-European equities, Mr Greifeld said: “No, definitely not.”Nasdaq is meanwhile expanding its Nordic-based derivatives business, and has recently reconfigured its clearing business there to make it more attractive to European users.Mr Greifeld said: “You’re going to see the derivatives market be a driver of growth in Europe.”In the UK, Nasdaq recently launched a spot power exchange. He said Nasdaq planned to launch derivatives on the spot power contracts by the end of the year. “There would then be a natural evolution to gas products,” he said.At the same time Nasdaq’s 22 per cent stake in European Multilateral clearing facility (EMCF), a clearing house that clears for Chi-X Europe and other so-called “multilateral trading facilities”, puts the group at the centre of possible consolidation of cash equities clearing houses in Europe.The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation has said it is in talks with EMCF about taking a possible stake, which sources say is part of a bigger deal involving the combination of EMCF with Euro CCP, the DTCC’s European clearing house, to create a new European clearer for equities.Asked what Nasdaq’s role is in the proposed combination, Mr Greifeld said: “We’re prepared to be part of anything that will assure lower-cost clearing in Europe. But nothing’s come to my desk that I have to consider.”
521;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-10-12T12:57:03Z;Thai exchange welcomes high-frequency trading;;The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has become the latest exchange in Asia to embrace high-frequency trading by inviting bids for a contract to replace its trading system with one that would cut trading speeds and provide a new surveillance and market data services.Charamporn Jotikasthira, exchange president, said on Tuesday a “request for proposal” went out last week seeking bids from companies interested in the business.His comments came as Nasdaq OMX said it had agreed with the Thai exchange to extend for a further five years a technology agreement that already provides the Bangkok bourse’s futures platform with a Nasdaq trading and clearing system.The Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX), a wholly owned subsidiary of the SET, started trading in 2006.Mr Jotikasthira said the request for proposal covered “the entire trading of cash and derivatives products” and should be finalised by February. This would ensure “continuity” between now and the installation of the new, group-wide trading platform.“The aim is to be able to attract global money from all new types of participants,” Mr Jotikasthira told FT Trading Room at the World Federation of Exchanges annual conference. Asked if this included high-frequency traders, he said: “Definitely.”He added that anything the Thai exchange would do to attract such traders would also involve installing risk systems that were “robust enough” given the lessons of the “flash crash” in US markets.Foreign investors make up 37 per cent of the holdings in Thai shares, while 19 per cent of daily activity, or turnover, stems from foreigners, Mr Jotikasthira said. Cash equities provide around 80 per cent of the SET’s revenues. The rest comes from derivatives and other products.Veerathai Santiprabhob, chief strategy officer, said the exchange planned to launch five year government bond futures next week, to be followed by money market interest futures next month.
522;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-10-11T17:17:20Z;LSE claims quickest trading speed;;The race to have the fastest trading speed passed a new milestone on Monday after the London Stock Exchange said it was using the quickest share trading system in the world to drive one of its share dealing platforms.Xavier Rolet, chief executive, said that trades in pan-European equities on its Turquoise trading platform were taking place in 124 microseconds, since the system went live last week. That is faster than Nasdaq OMX and double the average of the fastest speeds on platforms operated by BATS Global Markets.It is also a sign that exchanges and trading venues are still pushing their systems to operate faster, even as rapid-fire trading has come under intense scrutiny after the so-called flash crash in US markets in May. Fast trading systems are attractive to high-frequency traders at banks, hedge funds and specialist proprietary trading firms to get to trades faster than rivals.The US futures regulator meets today to discuss the role of sophisticated technology in trading, including what, if any, further measures are needed to stop trading spinning out of control at the hands of rapid computer programmes, or algorithms.The LSE’s new system was developed by MillenniumIT, a Sri Lankan technology company that the UK bourse bought last year as part of a plan to overhaul its technology. Mr Rolet has said that the LSE needs a faster trading system as it fights competition from smaller rivals such as Chi-X Europe and BATS Europe, operated by US-based BATS Global Markets. Both are heavily used by proprietary traders.Mr Rolet said cutting the speed of trading – known as latency – would help bring volume to the exchange, especially from proprietary traders using algorithms, or rapid computer programmes.“The algo guys are now reconfiguring their algos to take advantage of our lower latency,” he told the Financial Times at the World Federation of Exchanges annual meeting.Asked how long the LSE could hold on to any additional volume before a rival developed a faster system, Mr Rolet said: “It’s clearly an arms race. But we expect to hold on to it for a while because we’ve already mapped out the next generation of improvements.”The LSE will switch to using the Millennium system for its larger main UK share market in November. Latency usually refers to the time taken from when a client keys in an order to that order being processed in an exchange “matching engine” and the client being told of the outcome.Tony Weeresinghe, chief executive of Millennium, said the 124 microseconds was the time taken from the moment when a client input an order to the exchange and the message coming back to the client.
523;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-09-22T01:08:43Z;US exchanges move to ban ‘stub quotes’;;Proposals to eliminate extremely high or low “stub quote” share price quotations, blamed for exacerbating the impact of the May 6 flash crash, have been drawn up by the leading US stock exchanges.The draft rules from the owners of the biggest US equity markets, submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission for formal approval, come ahead of a report expected next week into the causes of the 20 minutes of wild price gyrations on May 6.The report by the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission is expected to highlight a number of factors that contributed to the flash crash, rather than identify a single issue. One factor likely to feature in the report is “stub quotes” – quotes that are deliberately set at a huge variance to share prices by market makers to satisfy their obligation to maintain a two-sided market for both buyers and sellers of a stock.By placing bids as low as a penny and offers as high as $999,999, the market makers can satisfy this technical obligation without providing liquidity in a stock.The May 6 crash moved stub quotes from the realm of arcane market feature into the regulatory spotlight, after the sudden short-term loss of liquidity led to some stocks plunging to prices of a few pennies, triggering the stub quotes.The SEC and CFTC’s preliminary report into May 6 said that stub quotes “are not intended to be executed and effectively indicate that the market maker has pulled out of the market. Their presence at the top and bottom of order books on May 6 may have led to a very large number of broken trades.”Owners of leading exchanges, including NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX and BATS have now proposed rules that would effectively ban stub quotes, instead requiring market makers to quote within a specified percentage of the best price.“We think it is a step in the right direction and one that we’ve long supported,” Randy Williams, at BATS Trading, said. “We are hopeful that we will see other market structure changes soon, such as the implementation of a limit up/limit down functionality.”Ray Pellecchia, of NYSE Euronext, said its proposed rules to eliminate stub quotes on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex marked “a first step toward more consistent market-maker obligations across markets”.The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, in a comment on proposed changes to its own rules to reflect the new quotation requirements, said it believed the move “could prevent the execution of numerous transactions at stub quote prices, such as those on May 6 2010”.
524;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-09-19T18:13:17Z;Nasdaq OMX to launch new platform;;Nasdaq OMX will launch a new US equities trading platform that aims to attract large orders that would normally go to so-called “dark pools”, in the latest sign of bourses battling competition from alternative trading systems.Exchanges have been trying to find ways to stem the flow of liquidity to dark pools, which allow matching of orders anonymously, with prices made public only after deals are done.High-frequency traders, who use computers to trade rapidly in and out of shares, derivatives and foreign exchange, have flocked to exchanges and alternative trading venues, driving down average trade sizes.That has prompted many investors to turn to dark pools to get large orders carried out.Nasdaq said the new platform, set to be launched on October 8, was a “direct response to some of the market developments this year”.These developments have split the equity market between exchanges and other platforms that offer pre-trade price displays, a so-called “lit” model, and “dark pools” where prices are only revealed when trades are done.Ted Kaufman, a US senator, said last month that this trend meant that “much of the deepest and most valuable order flow has retreated from the ‘lit’ public markets to dark trading venues”.Eric Noll, Nasdaq OMX’s head of transaction services, told the Financial Times the company was troubled that the markets had “effectively bifurcated over time into one that’s used by end users”, such as asset managers, “and one that’s used by professionals [high-frequency and other traders]”.Nasdaq’s new platform – known as PSX, for which it has regulatory approval – aims to attract traders wanting to carry out large orders by offering incentives for such orders to be posted.Typically such incentives are offered to traders to post orders of any size, which has so far been attractive to high-frequency traders eager to get to the best prices as fast as possible. That is known as the “price-time” model of incentives. Mr Noll said the time had come to offer a “price-size” model, where traders wanting larger orders done could also get incentives.“There is increasing competition among professionals . . . What we’re aiming to do with PSX is change the dynamics of market participation by incentivising size, and therefore the liquidity in securities, as opposed to having to access liquidity in dark pools,” said Mr Noll.Kevin Cronin, director of global equity trading at Invesco, an asset manager, said: “In today’s markets … the difficulty of trading large blocks of stock has increased due to challenges that have been created by developments within the US equity market structure. The new PSX price-size model provides an innovative solution to this challenge and comes at a crucial time.
525;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-09-14T19:41:04Z;Edwards up for sale as market revives;;A rebound in the semiconductor industry has prompted the private equity owners of Edwards to hire investment banks to handle a £1.5bn auction of the company that supplies vacuum technology to the world’s biggest chipmakers.Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs have been appointed by CCMP and Unitas Capital, the former US and Asian buy-out arms of JPMorgan, to advise on strategic options for Edwards.The move comes after the company hired Matthew Taylor and David Smith, the recently departed bosses of JCB and Jaguar Land Rover, as its new chief executive and finance director in preparation for a probable sale.The auction is expected to start in a few weeks’ times and is likely to attract interest from other private equity groups and trade bidders, particularly in Asia, where the company earns most of its revenues.An initial public offering of the business, possibly on the Nasdaq index in New York or on the London Stock Exchange, is also being considered, though this is seen as a backup option if the auction fails to drum up enough interest.Edwards, part of the BOC gases group when it was bought by Germany’s Linde in 2006, is the world’s leading supplier of vacuum technology for industrial and scientific applications, such as semiconductor and flat-panel television production.The 91-year-old company, which is based in Crawley and employs 3,000 staff, supplies the world’s 10 biggest semiconductor manufacturers and generates 60 per cent of its sales from Asia, mainly South Korea, Japan, China and Taiwan.In the three months to June, Edwards had $52m of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, with sales nearly doubling to $242m. Under private equity ownership, it has disposed of non-core assets, including chemical, parts cleaning and bearing businesses, generating about $100m.It has invested heavily in its south-east England sites, where its research and development and gas abatement operations are based.
526;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-09-14T09:56:08Z;Singapore to launch ADR trading platform;;The Singapore stock exchange is preparing to launch an international board primarily trading American Depositary Receipts in Asian companies with a combined market capitalisation of more than $600bn.The board, to be named GlobalQuote, is the first of its kind in Asia and is to open on October 22 in co-operation with Nasdaq OMX, the US technology-focused exchange and the Bank of New York Mellon, which will act as the depositary bank, according to an announcement on Tuesday.GlobalQuote will offer Asian investors their first chance to buy and sell securities in Nasdaq-quoted companies such as China’s Baidu and Suntech Power Holdings through an exchange platform during the Asian day – these stocks are not listed in their home countries.SGX is also trying to attract investors trading in Asian companies listed on the Hong Kong and Shanghai exchanges, both of which open later and close earlier than the Singapore bourse. Chew Sutat, the exchange’s head of corporate and market strategy, said the new board would give Asian investors the option of trading ADRs round the clock for the first time, as well as offering instant trading opportunities at both ends of the trading day for stocks quoted on the China exchanges.Mr Chew said the SGX expected the move to add liquidity in the stocks and for the exchange to win “a decent market share”. However, he did not expect SGX to attract business that would otherwise have been done in Hong Kong or Shanghai.The SGX said 19 ADRs would be included in the initial launch, including Aluminum Corp of China, China Mobile, PetroChina and Netease, the software company. Nine of the stocks are currently traded only in the US, with 10 listed in Hong Kong. The exchange said it hoped to eventually add Korean, Taiwanese and Indian ADRs. Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX said GlobalQuote was a “unique” platform.“We also believe it will add significant value to our US-listed companies in Asia who can increase their exposure amongst the Asian-Pacific investor community by giving them access to local companies within local trading hours,” he said.Harsh Wardhan Modi, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase in Singapore, said in a note to clients that the introduction of ADRs could increase the exchange’s trading volumes by about 5 per cent. He said the nine companies without an Asian listing had a combined average daily trading volume of $1.1bn over the past three months.GlobalQuote is one of a series of initiatives launched by SGX since the appointment in December of Magnus Böcker, a former president of Nasdaq OMX, as chief executive.SGX, which has failed to match Hong Kong as a home for listings by big Chinese companies, has significantly expanded its commodities business, and announced plans to attract high-frequency traders by building the world’s fastest trading engine and to offer bond trading to retail investors. It is also preparing to launch a “dark pool” joint venture with Chi-X, the trading platform operator.The Singapore bourse said it would also list on GlobalQuote a handful of other international stocks that are traded in but not listed in Singapore, including Genting Hong Kong, a unit of the Malaysian gaming and entertainment group, and AV Jennings, the Australian developer.
527;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-08-25T18:17:59Z;Plus set to relaunch as derivatives exchange;;Plus Markets has unveiled a plan to turn the small-cap listings and price-reporting platform into a fully fledged stock and derivatives exchange.The plan, which follows a strategic review that started in March, pits Plus against the London Stock Exchange, Chi-X Europe and other trading venues already competing for business in execution.Plus said the move would allow it to offer “an innovative exchange venue in London, which brings together primary and secondary market listings, with trading flow from the retail and professional investment communities, across multiple asset classes”.Shares in Aim-listed Plus, closed up 0.15p at 1.88p.Since its relaunch in 2007, Plus has set itself up as a platform that charges for data, while deals done by UK marketmakers are reported for free. In spite of a long and successful battle to allow Aim stocks to be traded on Plus, it has struggled as listings have dried up and share trading volumes have stagnated.Cyril Theret, who became chief executive in March, said Plus would seek £10m in funds from potential new users to build a trading platform aimed at generating trade execution revenues. Plus has £10.7m in cash reserves.Planned for launch next year, the platform would trade interest rate swaps under a derivatives exchange licence that Plus has received. Plus had also entered into a licence agreement with the FTSE index, owned by the LSE and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, to launch what Plus called “this new range of multi-currency interest rate swaps products”.At the same time, Plus will abandon the technology it uses – provided by the Swedish OMX unit of Nasdaq OMX, the exchange operator – to provide price reporting for marketmakers. Instead, it will develop its own price-reporting technology based on systems developed by Algo Technologies, a private US-based trading technology company whose chief executive, Hirander Misra, was until recently chief operating officer at Chi-X.The intention to develop interest rate swaps products comes as there are expectations of a wholesale shift of over-the-counter derivatives such as swaps to electronic trading platforms as a result of financial regulations in the US in June, and expected from Brussels next year.It is also to create a form of corporate bond product, expected to launch in the first quarter of next year.Plus’s strategic shift comes as European regulators review the performance of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or Mifid, which liberalised share trading in 2007. Bureaucrats are working towards a revised version of Mifid, which the industry has dubbed Mifid II.Plus said the changes would give it “a comparative advantage over other market infrastructure participants such as multilateral trading facilities that are trading facilities only”.
528;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-08-24T18:55:31Z;Hot demand for private internet companies’ stock;;On August 5, an unnamed investor made what many may consider a good bet – he bought a small stake in Facebook, the fast-growing social networking site.However, as a private company, Facebook has not disclosed details of its financial performance and the $76-a-share the investor paid has raised eyebrows from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. The trade gave Facebook an implied valuation of $33.7bn, making it worth more than most companies on Nasdaq.The implied valuation is more than triple what it was in April and when Facebook took its last round of financing in 2009, it was valued at $6.5bn.The spike in prices is driven by a big mismatch in supply and demand, prompted by the decision by some of the better-known private tech companies, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Zynga, to delay going public while the market for IPOs remains shaky.The appetite for shares in private online ventures exists because a new breed of investors has created funds with the sole purpose of acquiring stakes in these companies. The fierce competition among them to own even a tiny slice of some of the hottest operators in Silicon Valley is driving prices up.“This is a stock market,” says Mark Heesen, president of the National Venture Capital Association. “In an environment [where] you have 500 point swings, you can win and you can lose.”On SecondMarket, a site that matches buyers and sellers of private company shares, there is $350m in active listings. Of the nearly $300m in transactions on the site since April 2009, 40 per cent has been for Facebook stock.This active trading of secondary shares brings fresh challenges for these companies. Security and Exchange Commission rules say that a private company should have no more than 500 shareholders, a high proportion of which are usually employees.Facebook has assigned a right of first refusal to existing shareholders in an attempt to keep the total number of investors down. Tiger Global, the hedge fund and an existing Facebook shareholder, is said to be buying Facebook stock at $60-a-share at the behest of the company. Facebook declined to comment, while Tiger Global could not be reached for comment.LinkedIn, too, is trying to clamp down and has said that for the remainder of 2010 there should be no secondary share sales unless the buyers are existing shareholders, according to Adam Oliveri, head of private company markets at SecondMarket. LinkedIn declined to comment.Another SEC rule says that buyers and sellers of private company shares should have access to the same data about the company’s financial performance. This leaves employees looking to sell their shares with two options: either disclose non-public material data about their employer and violate confidentiality agreements, or risk breaking SEC regulations.In an attempt to head off any potential legal troubles, in April Facebook instituted an insider trading policy that stated that no employee could sell stock on the secondary market outside specific trading windows set by the company.Nevertheless, these measures appear to have done little to reduce trading, with activity picking up in recent months.Some analysts caution that these investments are being made without sound financial discipline. Bo Brustkern of Arcstone Equity Research, which analyses private companies, says investors’ desperation to own the stock can lead to imprudent actions.“Purchasers may be willing to pay a premium for access to private stock they would not otherwise have, thus overpaying.”But with demand outstripping supply, many investors are betting and winning with trades in the secondary market.“The great majority of shares purchased on our platform a year ago have seen substantial gains,” says Greg Brogger, founder of Sharespost, another website that matches buyers with sellers.Ken Sawyer, founder of Saints, a private investment firm, acquired two batches of Facebook stock in 2008 and has already reaped the rewards. “We bought at significantly lower prices than what it is now selling for,” he said. “We’ve sold a very small percentage of what we acquired and made almost our investment back.”Mr Oliveri believes private technology companies could further tighten up their rules in an attempt to put an end to the intense secondary trading.“It’s possible that in the future companies will exercise more contractual control,” he says.Watchdogs, too, may take a closer look at the market. “There’s going to be more regulatory scrutiny because there’s going to be so much more transaction volume,” Mr Oliveri adds.But until that happens, many investors who are sitting on much sought-after Facebook stock appear convinced that once the social networking site goes public it will become one of the most valuable internet companies around.“We still hold some Facebook stock,” says Mr Sawyer. “We believe over time that it will trade at higher valuations than where it is today.”
529;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-08-23T23:14:52Z;Chi-X receives approach from ‘third party’;;"Chi-X Europe, the pan-European share trading platform, said on Monday it had received an approach that could lead to an offer being made for the company.It said the “enquiry” from an unnamed third party “may not lead to an offer for the whole or partial sale of the company”.A sale of the company could lead to a big shake-up of Europe’s share trading markets.In recent months there has been speculation that interested bidders for Chi-X, which was been for sale periodically in the past 18 months, would be Nasdaq OMX and Deutsche Börse. Neither would comment on Monday night.Industry experts have also suggested bidders might come from specialist private equity funds, or further afield involving exchanges in Brazil or Singapore seeking a European foothold.Nasdaq OMX in April abandoned an 18-month attempt to break into pan-European share trading by announcing the closure of Nasdaq OMX Europe.That business was one of six so-called “multilateral trading facilities” (MTFs) that sprang up in the wake of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, a Brussels rule that broke the monopolies of established national exchanges in Europe, allowing competitors to emerge.Chi-X’s shareholders are Nomura, with 34 per cent through its Instinet brokerage business; BNP Paribas; Citi; Credit Suisse; Goldman Sachs; Merrill Lynch; Morgan Stanley; Société Générale; and UBS, as well as Citadel, Getco and Optiver, three of the world’s largest market-making firms.It was also set up as an MTF, in 2006. Launched a year later it quickly overtook Deutsche Börse, the London Stock Exchange’s UK markets and the Spanish exchange to become the second-largest European bourse by turnover this year.Chi-X offers trading in 1,200 blue chips across 23 indices and 15 main European markets, as well as exchange traded funds and exchange traded commodities. It also operates a “dark pool” block trading facility called Chi-Delta.In the UK, Chi-X accounts for 25 per cent of trading in FTSE 100 shares and was a key factor in forcing the London Stock Exchange to cut fees and upgrade its trading systems.Chi-X was expected on Tuesday to start the process of appointing bankers to advise on any formal offer. Analysts suggest Chi-X Europe could be valued at $200m-$300m.John Woodman, Chi-X Europe chairman, said: “This interest in Chi-X Europe is a result of our track record in becoming a major European exchange over the last three years and our move into profitability in 2010.“We were not seeking a transaction and the option of remaining independent would allow us to build further value for shareholders,” he added.Nasdaq OMX already has 22 per cent of European Multilateral Clearing Facility (EMCF), which acts as clearing house for Chi-X Europe."
530;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-08-11T21:51:13Z;Financial markets: Derivative dilemmas;Reform seeks balance of rules and rewards;Ari Bergmann is putting the finishing touches to a course he will begin teaching at New York University in a few weeks. Yet, in spite of his best efforts, much of the curriculum cannot yet be written. That is because of a big battle that is about to explode, on Wall Street and in the deepest bowels of Washington.Mr Bergmann will teach people ranging from investors to corporate treasurers how to spot financial risks and how to manage them. The tools used to do this are derivatives, which he first traded in the 1980s – contracts whose value is linked to a financial instrument, from the rate of interest paid on US government bonds to the price of oil.The derivatives market is one of the biggest in the world. At the end of last year, contracts with a face value of $636,431bn were swirling around the world’s financial system, according to the Bank of International Settlements. Just 3.4 per cent of the total were traded on exchanges. The rest – $614,674bn worth, equivalent to nearly 10 years of global economic output – were agreed and traded in private markets, under terms struck directly between the buyers and sellers.Over the next year, an entirely new rulebook is to be drawn up for this privately traded part of the financial markets, also called over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. President Barack Obama’s signature on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act on July 21 started the countdown. The legislation covers many parts of the financial system. Title seven – the part that deals with derivatives – is “among the most far-reaching and controversial sets of statutory changes” included in the new laws, according to lawyers at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.But whereas in theory the business is about to be revolutionised, in reality any changes will be preceded by bitter haggling over precisely what the rules prescribe– and proscribe. Crucially for banks, investors and the future health of world economies, just how far-reaching the outcome will be depends in large part on the decisions made by the two Washington regulators who will police a market that grew dramatically in recent decades without direct oversight.The two – the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) – have increased their staff numbers in anticipation of the rule-writing and their huge extra enforcement duties. For the most part, the rules have to be written by July 2011. These are regulators that usually write just a handful of new rules every year but, thanks to the new legislation, there will be more than 100 definitions and rules to get through. “Many of the key terms in the derivatives legislation are either undefined or are left for the regulators to fill in,” says Cadwalader.The root cause of the financial crisis involved losses on risky US mortgages. The entire global financial system was exposed to these mortgages after hundreds of billions of dollars of complex securities linked to them were sold to investors from Illinois to Iceland. Derivatives were the building blocks for those securities.The degree to which derivatives had created a dangerously interconnected financial system became clear amid the collapse of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and AIG in 2008. A default by one bank at the centre of a tangled web of derivatives contracts could paralyse the entire financial system, because the derivatives could become worthless if the bank writing the contract went under.“In the wake of the recent financial crisis, over-the-counter derivatives have been blamed for increasing systemic risk,” said Federal Reserve Bank of New York staff in a paper earlier this year. “OTC derivatives serve a vital role in financial markets but deficiencies in the market design and infrastructure allowed for misuse of these instruments, exacerbating the recent financial meltdown.”Regulators have swept in to restore confidence in markets before. After the crash of 1929, the SEC was set up to police the equity markets and create structures that would reassure investors the cards were not stacked against them. The CFTC, with its roots in commodity markets, has done the same for exchange-traded futures. Now, the regulators will try to do the same for derivatives markets.“The Wall Street reform bill will for the first time bring comprehensive regulation to the over-the-counter derivatives marketplace,” says Gary Gensler, chairman of the CFTC. The new rules will “lower risk, promote transparency and protect the American public”, he adds.Under the new regulations, the derivatives world will be divided in two. On one side will be those products that are widely used, simple in structure and actively traded: standardised derivatives. Those will be pushed on to clearing houses to make the financial system less vulnerable to the default of a big derivatives dealer.Clearing houses can reduce counterparty and systemic risks by standing in the middle of trades – though there of course remains a risk the clearing house itself may fail. The clearing house has a pool of capital and collects collateral and margin – up-front payments against possible losses. If these resources are not enough to cover a default by a member, the others are supposed to cough up.Cleared derivatives will also have to be traded on electronic systems – although exactly how those systems will be defined, and how quickly and frequently price information has to be made public remains to be resolved. Mr Bergmann, who advises investors on derivatives strategies, says public pricing would reduce the chances that buyers – such as municipalities or small pension funds – would overpay. Customers who pay banks too much would soon know if the value is lower than they thought. If the contracts are centrally cleared, they would have to come up with an extra margin to pay the clearing house as soon as the price falls. “Mispricing of derivatives has often not been discovered until it is a disaster,” says Mr Bergmann. “In theory, with widespread clearing people will know about it before it becomes a disaster.”Once regulators determine what part of the OTC derivatives or swaps markets has to be cleared, the remaining part will also be policed. No one knows what proportion will be uncleared, or what the targets are, although for all derivatives the more heavily regulated exchange-traded futures market provides the likely standard. “Look at the way futures have traded on exchanges,” says Viral Acharya, professor of finance at NYU’s Stern business school. “Similar practices, in one way or another, will be applied to OTC derivatives under new regulations. There will be more capital required, less leverage and less opacity.”How regulators decide the clearing houses should hold the collateral against trades, and the extent to which derivatives users can offset positions against each other, will also be key. Banks have built huge internal clearing systems in recent decades, divisions usually called “prime brokerage”. Through these, big institutional investors or hedge funds can buy and sell all kinds of financial instruments – from bonds to credit derivatives to currency swaps to commodity investments – and offset them against one other. If an investor has to pay for each part of the trade – usually called a “leg” – having to hand over cash for each piece could add up. If the positions are offset, the trade can be done much more cheaply.“We still don’t know what kinds of trades will be profitable or which of our customers will have to change their investment strategies,” says the head of prime brokerage at one big bank.These questions about the costs also mean that the risks of the clearing houses and the business model behind them cannot be properly worked out – leaving investors in limbo. “When we use a clearing house, we have to be able to make a case as to why we think they are financially sound,” says the head of trading at one of the biggest institutional investors. “We cannot determine this until we know what the new rules will be.”There is a lot to play for. According to Tabb Group, the biggest derivatives dealers generate revenues of $40bn a year from the OTC business.As the rules are rewritten there will be much behind-the-scenes jostling as current derivatives big-shots – which include all the Wall Street banks – try to hang on to market share and newcomers try to muscle in. “This is a big business opportunity,” says Larry Tabb, chief executive of Tabb Group.The cast of characters embraces not only big banks such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Barclays Capital and Deutsche Bank but exchanges such as CME Group, Nasdaq OMX, NYSE Euronext and Intercontinental Exchange, which want clearing business. It also includes smaller banks and brokers that are trying to expand their derivatives business, for instance Nomura and Jefferies, as well as inter-dealer brokers including Icap, and other financial groups that want to get into clearing or trading, from Tradeweb to State Street to tiny start-up brokerage firms.The outcomes will affect investors, banks and companies that use derivatives extensively for hedging. The end result will also depend on what happens in Europe. “A lot of these things won’t work well if one centre applies rules that are not as strict,” says Mr Arachya.With the answers to the questions about the future shape of the derivatives markets now in the hands of staff and commissioners at the regulators, the CFTC’s Mr Gensler says CFTC and SEC teams have already met five or six times since the legislation was passed. A series of public hearings is expected to be held from September onwards.The potential for turf wars is of concern, as is the possibility of disruption to investment and trading activities. “The enormity of the proposed changes could result in both short-term pain for users of swaps and participants in the derivatives markets generally, and long-term unintended and undesirable changes in the marketplace,” say lawyers at Jones Day. “The extent to which the rulemaking process will provide the necessary clarity will depend in part on how well the CFTC and SEC are able to work together in areas of potentially overlapping jurisdictions.”Whatever the case, the coming months will determine what is ultimately discussed in Mr Bergmann’s course about risks and markets. Not for nothing is the biggest section in his course outline entitled: “Derivatives: weapons of mass destruction or weapons of mass protection?”
531;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-08-09T04:01:28Z;LSE’s Turquoise heading into profit;;Turquoise, the share trading platform acquired by the London Stock Exchange six months ago, is ahead of schedule on reaching profitability and is also likely to be used to spearhead the LSE’s push into pan-European derivatives.The developments are a boost to the LSE at a time of anaemic trading volumes in equity markets generally. They also come as Xavier Rolet, the LSE chief executive, faces pressure to expand its small derivatives presence.The LSE’s rivals – NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX and Deutsche Börse – have large and growing derivatives businesses. This is helping to offset squeezed margins in cash equities trading, where competition is fierce.David Lester, Turquoise chief executive, said the platform’s “dark pool” trading facility – which allows anonymous trading of large blocks of shares – had done better than expected.“We didn’t expect the dark [pool] revenue [to grow] so quickly,” Mr Lester said in a video interview with the Financial Times. Asked when it would be profitable, he said: “I would say we are about just under half way there.”Turquoise was set up by nine investment banks in 2007 as a way of forcing the LSE’s fees down by providing competition.It is one of a handful of alternative trading platforms that emerged to challenge Europe’s exchanges as a result of the Mifid reforms enacted by the European Commission in 2007. Others include Chi-X Europe and BATS Europe.Turquoise was lossmaking when the LSE took a 51 per cent stake in the platform in March.The rest is held by nine of its founding shareholders – Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, UBS, BNP Paribas and Société Générale – as well as Barclays, JPMorgan Cazenove and Nomura, which became shareholders in March.The LSE said in March it would fund the new venture “within an agreed framework for the first 24 months”. It did not reveal any target for profitability.Turquoise offers trading in nearly 2,000 securities across Europe, including Czech and Hungarian shares. Since April it has also offered trading in 175 US-listed securities. It claims a market share in pan-European stocks of 4-5 per cent.Asked whether Turquoise would be used as the LSE’s derivatives platform, Mr Lester said: “It will certainly be one of them. We are still working it through with the shareholders of Turquoise in terms of what the build-out would look like.”The LSE already has a small Nordic and Russian derivatives business called EDX.Mr Lester said Turquoise could use the Sola derivatives trading system that the LSE recently licensed from TMX Group, operator of the Montreal derivatives exchange and Toronto Stock Exchange.“If Turquoise is going to be in derivatives it will take a licence for that platform [and] pass through into whatever clearing arrangements we need,” he said.New products launched on the platform would be derivatives on the FTSE index, “other European indices [and] also new product from the FTSE franchise”.The LSE owns the FTSE index business jointly with Pearson, owner of the Financial Times. “The FTSE franchise …is the second-biggest international global benchmarking business,” Mr Lester said.“We think that can be a product factory to bring new product to Turquoise, potentially to EDX, and to grow out in derivatives,” he added.The average daily value of UK shares traded on the LSE in July was 7 per cent higher than the same month last year, at £3.7bn ($5.9bn), figures published on Friday showed. The average daily number of trades was up by 8 per cent.
532;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-08-06T02:26:05Z;CBOE blames high costs for missing targets;;CBOE Holdings, operator of the Chicago Board Options Exchange, yesterday missed analysts’ estimates for the second quarter due to higher costs, with net income falling 11 per cent in its first earnings release as a public company.The owner of the largest US options exchange, which went public in June, reported net income of $24.9m for the second quarter, or 27 cents per share, missing the estimate of 29 cents per share.Excluding one-time expenses for index options litigation and severance, earnings were 28 cents a share. Revenue rose 3 per cent to $112.6m from $109m for the quarter.Transaction fees, which contribute the majority of the company’s revenue, rose 16 per cent.“While our overall performance was impacted by certain items, fundamentally it was a solid quarter,” said Alan Dean, the chief financial officer.He added that the exchange would “continue to focus on maintaining tight control over expenses” and that management was “optimistic about our ability to leverage our cost structure and the scale inherent in our business model”.The exchange’s shares were down 7.3 per cent to $24.76 at midday in New York, and hit their lowest since the initial public offering in mid-June. The stock has fallen nearly 24 per cent from its closing price of $32.49 at the end of its first day of trading.The second-quarter earnings shortfall comes as exchange volumes have dropped in July ahead of typically slower trading conditions in August.While volumes at the CBOE rose 13 per cent during the second quarter from the same period in 2009 and were up 17 per cent on the first quarter of 2010, daily average volume slipped 6.5 per cent in July from June.The competitive battle for trading US equity options has intensified this year, with Nasdaq OMX and NYSE Euronext’s options markets gaining share due in part to aggressive pricing models for providers of liquidity.Mr Dean said there was a limit to the extent to which options exchanges could cut fees since, unlike cash equities exchanges, they could not rely on the revenue boost that increases in market share – produced by pricing incentives – could deliver.“If an exchange generates 5 per cent market share they really can’t lean on that market data revenue to offset a zero or negative rate on transaction fees,”he said.
533;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-08-02T22:02:41Z;Instinet launches dark pool for options;;Instinet, the agency brokerage, announced on Tuesday that it is launching a non-public or “dark” venue for executing small and large positions in US equity-listed options.The platform will be called Instinet Options CBX and will provide more competition in the burgeoning so-called dark liquidity space, where trades are negotiated away from public exchanges.While dark pools flourish for equities in conjunction with the four main public exchanges – NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX, BATS Exchange and Direct Edge – the structure for equity options is different, with trading spread across eight exchanges.All orders that are privately matched for options must ultimately be shown across option exchanges and printed onto a consolidated tape for all investors to see, which means dark pools for equity options cannot truly exist.But the industry is attempting to bring some of the elements of non-public trading into the sector as privately matching buyers and sellers can facilitate large blocks being traded and lower costs of execution.The CBX is fully automated and electronically matches buyers and sellers of options, and then routs that trade to an exchange in order for it to print at the agreed price. This means that in some cases the agreed trade on CBX could be “stepped in on” by another investor who wishes to trade at the same price.Instinet says its routing of trades is designed to send them to exchange venues where there is a lower likelihood of the matched trade being ‘”stepped in on”.Instinet says its platform has launched with an established base of liquidity and, unlike other options dark pools, is targeted to clients trading all order sizes rather than those just looking to trade large blocks. That should appeal to high frequency traders, who prefer small trading sizes, as well as institutional investors who look at bigger trade sizes.John Duffell, chief strategy officer at Instinet said: “Our clients tell us that they would find value in an agency-operated options liquidity pool that provides price improvement opportunities for orders of all sizes.”The new platform will position Instinet against other equity dark pools operated by Pipeline and Ballista Securities, which focus on block or large orders.“We are poised to apply our experience and insights in cash equity markets to US listed options markets as they continue evolving,” said Jonathan Kellner, president of the Americas at Instinet.“While there are key market microstructure differences between equities and options, the main contributor to providing best execution to our clients in any asset class lies in the seamless and stable interaction between the EMS, algorithms, smart routing, and crossing networks,” he added.
534;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-07-27T22:13:18Z;Nasdaq OMX profits in surprise jump;;Nasdaq OMX surprised investors as earnings for the second quarter were boosted by better stock and option trading and exceeded expectations.The exchange said transaction revenues rose 20 per cent or $31m to $186m for the second quarter of 2010, compared with the same quarter a year ago as option trading reached a record in the US, with a total market share of 25 per cent.Net income for the second quarter of 2010 was $96m, or $0.46 per diluted share, compared with $61m, or $0.28 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2010, and $69m, or $0.33 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2009.Adjusted earnings were 52 cents a share, compared with the analysts’ average estimate of 49 cents a share, while net revenue rose 6 per cent from the second quarter of 2009 to $390m.Nasdaq’s stock closed up 2.6 per cent at $19.49 on Tuesday, down from an early rise of 5.8 per cent to $20.10. For the year to date, Nasdaq’s stock is off 1.7 per cent, compared with rival exchange NYSE Euronext, whose stock is up 14.8 per cent so far in 2010.“Continued operating discipline, expense management and more in the way of active capital management measures were all encouraging,” said analysts at Credit Suisse. But the bank added they are neutral on the stock.“While management execution remains on track, more in the way of active capital management efforts are encouraging and valuation is attractive, we remain on the sidelines given continued competitive headwinds in the US and European equities markets leading to more challenging top-line growth prospects.”Meanwhile, Richard Repetto, analyst at Sandler O’Neill + Partners said Nasdaq’s stock is attractive at 8.9 times the firm’s 2011 earnings per share estimate of $2.20.“Yes, the equities business is commoditised, but Nasdaq demonstrated pricing power as revenue capture increased for the first time in two years,” he said.Nasdaq has bought back $200m of its shares since March and announced an increase of $100m in the program with its earnings results.While cash equity net revenues rose 68.8 per cent during the quarter, the exchange’s share of US equity market trading dipped 22.8 per cent in the second quarter versus 23.9 per cent in the first quarter. Its share of US equity option trading, however, rose to 25.1 per cent during the second quarter of 2010, up from 23.8 per cent in the first quarter.Derivative trading and clearing net exchange revenues were $69m for the second quarter of 2010, up $8m, or 13 per cent, from the first quarter.With the passing of financial reform legislation, Nasdaq is seeking to claim a piece of the market for clearing over-the-counter derivatives.Nasdaq owns a majority stake in the International Derivatives Clearing Corporation, which has been seeking to clear and settle interest rate swaps by converting them into economically equivalent futures contracts for the past two years.Earlier this month, IDCG cleared a $6m swap trade with a maturity of six years between a broker dealer and an asset manager, according to brokers in the swaps market.
535;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-07-27T07:34:46Z;Nasdaq OMX buys Smarts as surveillance heats up;;Smarts Group, the privately-held Australian company that provides market surveillance systems to exchanges, regulators and brokers, was on Tuesday snapped up by Nasdaq OMX, the US-based exchange operator.The move comes amid an increasing focus on the need for pre-trade risk management checks and electronic market surveillance systems in the wake of the “flash crash” in US markets in May.Nasdaq said the purchase was part of its strategy “to diversify its commercial technology business and enter the broker surveillance and compliance market”.Anna Ewing, Nasdaq OMX’s chief information officer, said: “Efficient surveillance operations are imperative to ensure integrity in today’s financial markets, and Smarts allows us to capitalise on the growing demand for surveillance technology products in exchange, regulator and broker markets worldwide.”Smarts was founded by an academic, Mike Aitken, and two research students at University of Sydney in 1994. The company’s first commercial customer was the Russian central bank. Mr Aitken, who has been chairman of the company, will stay on in an advisory role.Last month, Smarts signed up US-based IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) to install a market surveillance platform, making ICE the Australian company’s largest derivatives customer.Other companies providing similar services include MillenniumIT, the Sri Lankan technology company recently acquired by Nasdaq rival the London Stock Exchange, and Redkite, a UK-based company.
536;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-07-20T20:40:46Z;Direct Edge to shake up exchange order;;Direct Edge, which on Wednesday officially joins the select club of official US equity exchanges, is intent on further shaking up the established order.The new exchange can date its presence as an electronic communication network or ECN back to the late 1990s, but it is only in the last few years that Direct Edge has become a major presence in the US equity trading space as the market has become highly automated and dominated by electronic market makers, or so-called high frequency traders.Direct Edge has seen its share of overall US equity trading volume climb from about 2 per cent to as high as 12 per cent, boosted in part by its owners, who include Citadel, Knight and Goldman Sachs.In the course of migrating its systems and customers to its new exchange system, Direct Edge has seen its market share drop in recent weeks, but the company views this as a temporary consequence of the overhaul.Propelling Direct Edge’s rise in recent years has been its electronic trading system finding favour with high frequency traders and its aggressive pricing model versus the other three exchanges: NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX and BATS.The battle for market share will only intensify with Direct Edge officially becoming an exchange and having its new systems up and running.“The move from being an ECN to a US regulated securities exchange has been accompanied by upgrading our trading technology and infrastructure which we believe will enable us to broaden our footprint versus the legacy exchanges,” said Bill O’Brien, chief executive officer at Direct Edge.“I’m optimistic that continued growth is possible with better infrastructure and new technology,” he added.As technology has transformed the business of trading shares, the rise of Direct Edge and that of BATS Exchange reflects a desire among big banks and broker-dealers for more competition among exchanges.NYSE and Nasdaq, the two long entrenched US equity exchanges, have seen their market share drop in recent years as trading has become fragmented across more venues.“The rise of Direct Edge is a remarkable story as they can be traced back a long way to an ECN that popped up in the late 1990s,” said Sang Lee, managing partner at Aite Group. “Now with more than 10 per cent of daily market volume they are a major player.”“Technology and its pricing model have played a part, as has the relationship with its owners such as Citadel, Knight and Goldman Sachs,” added Mr Lee.The company pioneered the use of flash orders for electronic equity trading which sparked intense scrutiny and criticism from rivals, regulators and Capitol Hill last year.Direct Edge is owned by a consortium that includes the International Securities Exchange with a 31.4 per cent holding. Knight Capital Group, Citadel Derivatives and Goldman Sachs each have a stake of 19.9 per cent.Mr O’Brien said it was certainly possible at some point in the future that they could look at a public listing for the exchange.“We are working to build an enduring company over time and an IPO could be one of the important milestone towards achieving that goal,” he said.Expansion into other asset classes and regions such as European equities are being monitored by Direct Edge, but Mr O’Brien said they were following a disciplined approach and will only pursue opportunities where the exchange can add value.“When we look at opportunities for expansion it must be sustainable for both us and our customers,” he said.
537;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-07-14T16:06:59Z;Dubai consolidation gains mixed reviews;;In what is being portrayed as a landmark consolidation, stocks listed on Nasdaq Dubai are now being traded on the same system as the local Dubai Financial Market.As of this week, clearing, settlement and custody are based on the DFM system although the two exchanges retain separate identities.The exchange authorities are describing the new arrangements as an outsourcing rather than a merger. But professionals say that, either way, the pairing is not so far attracting the retail money that had been hoped for.“A merger brings with it a connotation that everything is merging – and that is not happening,” says Jeff Singer, Nasdaq Dubai chief executive. “We are retaining our identity as an exchange. We are still being regulated by our regulator, the DFSA [Dubai Financial Services Authority], and we are still in the DIFC [Dubai International Financial Centre] and our laws are governed by common law and a judge.”Because of the traditional summer lull, Mr Singer says it is difficult to tell from trading volumes whether the consolidation is having an effect. Emaar, the most widely traded stock on the DFM, “routinely” trades 100m to 200m shares a day. On Tuesday it traded just 5m shares.“What is encouraging is that we are seeing a lot more brokers in the trading . . . We are seeing a whole host of names that we haven’t seen before,” Mr Singer says.Nasdaq Dubai was launched as the Dubai International Financial Exchange in 2005. It is based in the offshore DIFC and regulated by the DFSA.It is the only exchange operating derivatives in the region and has a large market for Islamic bonds, or sukuk. But it has failed to attract a critical mass of traders and listings.In December, the DFM announced that it was buying two-thirds of Nasdaq Dubai from Borse Dubai and Nasdaq OMX, the international exchange group.Brokers, however, say the outsourcing arrangements may be less successful than hoped. This is because, they say, only Nasdaq Dubai members have access to stocks listed on both exchanges.Fourteen brokers are licensed by both Nasdaq Dubai and the DFM but more than 90 trade only on the DFM. While the 90 can see the stocks listed on Nasdaq Dubai they still have to go through the Nasdaq Dubai licensing process to trade.Moreover, the institutional investors that traded on Nasdaq Dubai typically did so by Euroclear, the settlements group. Now they are having to obtain national investor numbers – “client NINs” – as used on the DFM. This is at best a bureaucratic process – at worst it detracts from the sought-after liquidity, the brokers say.“Institutional investors are not happy with the move because it was easier to trade on Euroclear,” says a dealer at a Dubai-based brokerage who asked not to be named.“In the first two days of trading liquidity dried up because clients are in the process of transferring their shares [to NINs] ,” the broker says. “The idea is that . . . it [the outsourcing] opens up the stock to more retail investors, but not all brokers have access to the stock – only Nasdaq Dubai members.”
538;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-07-07T13:58:25Z;BNY Mellon to become clearing member of IDCG;;Bank of New York Mellon said on Wednesday that it will become a clearing member of the International Derivatives Clearing Group (IDCG), which is focused on interest rate swaps, the largest sector of the over-the-counter derivatives market.The move comes at a time when the battleground for clearing derivatives is heating up as the pending US financial reform bill mandates that standardised swaps, such as those for interest rates, be cleared by a central counterparty, or CCP, which is designed to lower systemic risk.“With the rapid changes occurring in the clearing and settlement process for derivatives, our clients want a capable, stable partner that has membership in clearing organizations like IDCG to support their growing and evolving trading needs,” said Sanjay Kannambadi, chief executive officer of BNY Mellon Clearing.To date, IDCG has only shadow cleared swaps, and traders say it needs to attract support from established dealers in order to gain critical mass.Garry O’Connor, chief executive officer of IDCG, said: “The ascension of clearing members from the banking community is an important step forward for IDCG, and demonstrates the market’s broader movement towards our clearing solution.”IDCG is seeking to clear and settle swaps by converting them into economically equivalent futures contracts and has attracted the support of NewEdge and MF Global, two leading non-bank futures commission merchants or FCMs.IDCG is majority-owned by Nasdaq OMX and BNY Mellon holds a minority stake in the clearer.The main CCPs of interest rate derivatives are LCH.Clearnet, the CME, IDCG, Eurex in Germany and Brazil’s Bovespa.Seperately, IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) said on Wednesday that the cumulative gross notional value cleared by its credit default swap clearing houses surpassed $10,000bn during the week ending July 2.In the US, ICE said it had cleared $6,000bn of CDS indices (CDX) and $272bn in single-name CDS, resulting in open interest of $435 bn. ICE Clear Europe cleared €2,400bn in iTraxx indices and €379bn in single-name CDS, resulting in €371bn of open interest.
539;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-07-07T11:22:33Z;Hexagon buys Intergraph of the US for $2.1bn;;Hexagon, the rapidly expanding Swedish measurement technology company, unveiled on Wednesday one of its largest acquisitions to date – a $2.1bn cash purchase of Intergraph Corporation, a US-based software provider.The Hexagon share rose sharply on the news and by mid-morning on Wednesday was trading 9.17 per cent higher at SKr110.70 on Stockholm’s Nasdaq OMX Exchange.Hexagon is among the world’s leading companies in the field of measurement technology while Alabama-based Intergraph is a specialist in computer-aided design and geospatial intelligence software.Ola Rollén, president and chief executive of Hexagon, said in a statement that the Intergraph purchase was an exciting step forward for the company. “With the acquisition of Intergraph we are able to seamlessly connect the real world with maps or drawings. By adding Intergraph’s technologies to our product offerings, Hexagon will be able to create new exciting solutions that will change the way our customers operate in several industries worldwide,” he said.The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions, is on a debt-free basis. Pre-tax synergies are expected to amount to about $30m in 2011 and $40m in 2012. Cash integration, transaction and refinancing costs are not expected to exceed $65m and will be charged immediately after completion.Hexagon said on Wednesday that it had already secured commitments to finance the acquisition and refinance its existing €1bn revolving credit facility.It also said it is planning an $850m rights issue as soon as practicable after completion of the Intergraph purchase. Subscription commitments for more than 50 per cent of this offering are already in place with Melker Schörling, its board chairman who controls about half the share capital, and other leading shareholders having pledged to take up their allocation.
540;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-06-23T21:06:04Z;Quick View: Crunch time for derivatives reform;;It is crunch time for derivatives reform in America.On Thursday, lawmakers will take the House of Representatives’ financial reform bill, put it together with the Senate’s version and try and come up with a workable compromise between the two, before sending it to the president’s desk to be signed into law.But it is also crunch time for America’s ability to strike the right balance between redesigning the architecture of these markets – the structures that will play such a big role in how they will work – and ensuring healthy competition in the new world order.I’m referring of course to the “Lynch” amendment.We haven’t heard much about it since it sneaked into congressman Barney Frank’s bill back in December. At the time it struck fear into the boardrooms of clearing houses like LCH.Clearnet, the London-based clearer.It proposes that, in order to limit OTC dealer influence over clearing houses, swap market participant control over them be capped at 20 per cent. The aim is to stop dealers having undue influence over what can and can’t be admitted to a clearing house for clearing, if for commercial reasons that suited them.Since LCH.Clearnet is overwhelmingly owned by some of the main dealers in – for example – OTC interest rate swaps, it would effectively be shut out of offering its OTC clearing services in the US.The Senate took a different tack on how to deal with ownership and conflicts of interest, leaving it up to the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the two markets regulators, to decide how best to deal with any that may arise.The assumption was that the Lynch amendment was probably dead. But it turns out that there is a real possibility that some version of it could end up in the final piece of legislation that will emerge from the “conference” process on Thursday, at which the House and Senate will hammer out a compromise between the language in each bill that satisfies both chambers.The issue affects more businesses than LCH.Clearnet. It also applies to “boards of trade” – ie: exchanges like ELX, the fledgling futures exchange backed by Wall Street banks – and “swap execution facilities” (SEFs) like Tradeweb, an OTC rates, credit and money market trading platform majority owned by Thomson Reuters but over 20 per cent held by 10 dealer banks.If it makes it into the final legislation the Lynch amendment – or language like it - could also affect The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, which is building a clearer known as New York Portfolio Clearing in joint venture with NYSE Euronext. DTCC has over 300 shareholders, most of which are banks and broker-dealers.There is nothing wrong with finding ways to limit undue dealer influence over market structures like clearing houses and SEFs. There has to be a check and balance on the power of dealers who enjoyed a lucrative franchise in the OTC derivatives markets that was heavily predicated on keeping most everyone else in the dark about how they were priced.But slapping an arbitrary cap on dealer control of market structures is not the right way to go about it. Why 20 per cent? Who came up with that figure, and on what basis?It also smacks of protectionism. It is an open secret on Capitol Hill that the Lynch amendment has been cheered on by Nasdaq OMX, whose nascent interest rate clearer, International Derivatives Clearing Corporation, would stand to gain from any difficulty that LCH.Clearnet would have offering its services in the US. Both are vying for a slice of the anticipated wave of OTC interest rate swaps used by big users such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, once legislation is finalised. Shut out LCH.Clearnet and most of the business is likely to go to a US provider.The Europeans, as they work on broadly similar OTC derivatives reforms, do not even consider ownership caps in their proposals, which were issued for a one-month public consultation last week. Instead, they deal with conflicts of interest through ensuring proper corporate governance is in place. What’s wrong with that, if it is also properly policed by regulators?At a time when the US makes much of the need for financial reforms to be crafted with a transatlantic consensus in mind, the adoption of an arbitrary ownership cap on market structures would send a poor signal to the rest of the world. The Senate got this right in the first place.
541;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-06-22T00:34:04Z;Nasdaq OMX starts Swedish rate swap clearing;;Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator, has launched the first clearing house for Swedish interest rate swaps in another sign of the push to require that over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives be processed through clearing houses.The first contracts were cleared in Stockholm on Monday between SEB, the Swedish bank, and the Swedish National Debt Office.The involvement of a public agency in the launch signalled Swedish government support for the push to bring more transparency to derivatives trading– one of the main targets for regulatory reform in Europe and the US since the global financial crisis.The move also highlights efforts by Nasdaq OMX to bolster its position in interest rate swap clearing in anticipation of the expected regulatory push for more OTC clearing. The group also controls International Derivatives Clearing Corporation, a nascent US-based interest rate swaps clearer.Interest rate swaps are one of the largest parts of the OTC derivatives market, 10 times bigger than credit default swaps.Central counterparty clearing is already available for swaps denominated in Swedish krona through SwapClear, the biggest international clearing house for interest rate swaps. But Nasdaq OMX said its service was the first dedicated to the Nordic market.“This service will reduce the administrative burden and, more importantly, bring with it a reduction of counterparty risk for market participants and thereby improve financial stability,” said Erik Thedéen, head of Nordic Fixed Income for Nasdaq OMX.He said the group was aiming to create a clearing house offering all fixed income instruments for the Nordic region. SEB and the Debt Office were natural partners for the initial launch as two of the biggest participants in the krona-denominated interest rate swap market, worth an average SKr30bn ($3.9bn) in daily turnover.Talks were under way with other participants in krona-denominated swaps about switching from bilateral settlement to clearing, Mr Thedéen said.Legislators in the US and Europe are pushing for interest rate swaps – the main derivative instrument traded over the counter – to be subject to mandatory clearing.Nasdaq OMX is the dominant exchange operator in the Nordic region, controlling the bourses in Stockholm, Copenhagen, Helsinki and Reykjavik since its acquisition of OMX in 2007.s
542;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-06-16T03:02:57Z;CBOE raises $339m in market debut;;Shares in the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the US’s biggest options trading venue, soared on its market debut on Tuesday after being priced at the top end of the range.The CBOE raised $339m selling 11.7m shares at $29 each – compared to its previous guidance of a range of $27-$29 – valuing the exchange at $2.97bn. By the close the stock was up 12 per cent at $32.49.The initial public offering has been widely watched as a gauge of the appetite for flotations and a guide to current exchange valuations.Chris Brendler, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said other US exchange groups with equity options divisions – such as NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq – could benefit from the CBOE’s implied valuation, which represents a multiple of about 28 times its 2009 earnings per share.Jon Najarian, a CBOE member who runs Option-Monster, the trading consultancy, said: “The pricing coming in at the high end of the range was a good sign.” Mr Najarian said that in the longer term “the real catalyst for upside is financial reform, which could easily boost revenue if they get the multi-trillion dollar over-the-counter products on to exchanges”.He added: “Given the CBOE’s intellectual property as well as technological edge I think they could win a majority of that business, which would make them a takeover target.”The CME Group, NYSE Euronext and Intercontinental Exchange have been mentioned as possible acquirers.Bringing the CBOE to market is a personal triumph for Bill Brodsky, chief executive.The IPO was held up for several years due to a legal wrangle with members of the former Chicago Board of Trade, the futures exchange from which the CBOE was originally spun off in 1973 and which was bought by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 2008.Some CBOT members retained trading rights in the CBOE that they claimed entitled them to a share of the CBOE upon demutualisation. The issue was finally settled in a $4.2m deal last year.
543;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-06-07T08:18:31Z;Norway’s Oslo Børs launches clearing;;Oslo Børs on Monday became the latest exchange to adopt central counterparty clearing with the launch of clearing of five shares on the Norwegian bourse.The move comes six months after Nasdaq OMX, operator of exchanges in Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Iceland and Norway, launched clearing. The Nordic region had up to that point relied on settlement and a basic clearing process where traders took on their own counterparty risk.A clearing house stands between a buyer and seller in a trade, stepping in to complete the transaction in case either party defaults.The Norwegian move also comes as Oslo is competing against at least four rivals also offering Norwegian shares, including Chi-X Europe, BATS Europe, Turquoise and Nasdaq OMX, which launched Norwegian shares in March.Together such rivals have captured 9 per cent of Norwegian stocks, according to Thomson Reuters’ Equity Market Share Reporter.Bente Landsnes, Oslo Børs chief executive, told FT Trading Room: “When you are living in a competitive world you have to fight. As long as we have the major part of the liquidity and also offer competitive services along the whole value chain - including CCP [central counterparty clearing] and settlement – I’m sure we can compete with them.”Oslo Børs said the launch of clearing for the five shares - Sevan Marine, Norwegian Property, Songa Offshore, Fred. Olsen Energy and TGS-NOPEC Geophysical Company – was a “soft launch” ahead of clearing for all equities, equity certificates and exchange-traded funds on Oslo Børs and Oslo Axess, scheduled for June 18.Ms Landsnes said the move was designed to “reduce risk for members and to make the whole clearing procedure more efficient and at lower cost”.“Having a CCP structure in place also helps to strengthen our group’s competitiveness. We have now established a CCP structure in Norway that it is fully competitive with similar marketplaces internationally,” she said.Oslo has had clearing for derivatives for some years. In 2007 the Bors merged with the clearing house that handled that, as well as with the local central securities depository.Last month the FT reported that the Santiago stock exchange had become the latest bourse to adopt clearing, with a plan to launch such a service in August.
544;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-06-01T22:13:09Z;Options trading reaches record volumes;;Options trading volumes in the US soared to a record last month as market volatility and the “flash crash” added to secular growth in the industry.Nearly 406m listed options contracts were traded in May, according to figures released on Tuesday by the Options Clearing Corporation, up 29 per cent from May 2009.The OCC, which clears for all eight US options trading venues, also noted that three of the industry’s five highest-volume days occurred last month.May 6 – the day of the “flash crash”, when US markets plunged and rebounded sharply within 20 minutes – was the options industry’s highest-volume day on record, with about 31m contracts changing hands.While regulators are still trying to work out what happened, the resulting fear – coupled with the general sense of greater uncertainty in the markets – has apparently driven traders to greater use of options.The Chicago Board Options Exchange, the US’s biggest options exchange, said it experienced its busiest month since October 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed.The heavy trading is timely for CBOE, the US’s last big member-owned exchange, which is readying itself for an initial public offering in two weeks. It has benefited as volatility has driven traders to its proprietary stock index options, such as the Volatility Index, or Vix, often referred to as “Wall Street’s fear gauge”.Equity options volumes continued to grow through the financial crisis. They are currently running about 11 per cent ahead of last year, setting 2010 on a path to be a record year.An increasing proportion of options trading volume is thought to come from high-frequency trading firms, a trend that concerns some in the industry.“We really have to ask ourselves how much of this volume is real, legitimate volume,” said Mark Longo of the Options Insider, an industry website. “How much of it is customers coming in to make genuine economic trades, versus high-frequency guys . . . trying to arbitrage between different fee structures at the exchanges?”The options industry is a crowded market in which eight trading venues vie for market share, leading some exchanges to argue that rivals are inflating their numbers by accepting unprofitable trades.
545;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-05-31T20:32:30Z;LCH.Clearnet to offer US solution for swaps clients;;LCH.Clearnet plans to offer prospective US-based clients of its over-the-counter derivatives clearing service the ability to access the service in America using a separate US legal structure aimed at offering them US protection in the event of bankruptcy.The US move appears designed to address concerns among some in the derivatives industry in the US that there may be disadvantages for US-based businesses to clear OTC interest rate swaps though a clearing house in the UK.That would put LCH.Clearnet at a disadvantage to US rivals when all are battling for a slice of the multi-billion dollar OTC interest rate swaps business that is anticipated to come from end-users of such derivatives, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the big US mortgage lenders.This new business is expected amid a push by regulators to force as many OTC derivatives as possible into clearing houses to help safeguard the financial system against the potentially catastrophic effects of another Lehman-style default. A clearing house takes on the risk that a party to a trade defaults, spreading the risk among its members.LCH.Clearnet’s rivals are International Derivatives Clearing Corporation (IDCG), controlled by Nasdaq OMX, and CME Group. They all want a part of this new so-called “client clearing” business. Fannie and Freddie are each so big in interest rate swaps that IDCG has said they will be “ anybody’s biggest customer”.LCH.Clearnet has approached the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) about allowing US-based users of interest rate swaps the possibility of accessing LCH.Clearnet’s London-based SwapClear rates clearing facility through a “futures commission merchant” (FCM), or futures broker, in the US.Currently, any US-based user of such OTC derivatives would have to access SwapClear through a so-called clearing member, governed by UK law. That clearing member can be in any of seven jurisdictions approved by the Financial Services Authority.The regulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac recently expressed concern over how defaults would be handled under UK law.That cast some doubt over LCH.Clearnet’s ability to attract much of the so-called “client” interest rate swap clearing business – as opposed to dealer-to-dealer interest rate swaps clearing, of which LCH.Clearnet already handles over 60 per cent through its London-based SwapClear unit.However Iona Levine, LCH.Clearnet chief counsel, said the new FCM arrangement would give clients access to SwapClear with the added protection of coming under US bankruptcy law. “We will hold all their collateral offshore in the US,” she told the FT.Roger Liddell, LCH.Clearnet chief executive, said the clearer planned to service US customers “predominantly from our US office”.While LCH.Clearnet has a full US clearing licence, it does not have a clearing house with fully paid-up clearing members. It has many US-based customers who are already members of its London-based operation.“What it [the proposed new arrangement] means, assuming it …gets the approvals, is that they [end-users] would get the same treatment that exists today for US customers of overseas exchanges who are operating under the same regime, which means that their margins are not part of the UK bankruptcy process and are instead handled under the US bankruptcy code.”“We’re keen to make sure that the clients in each region get the best protection that they can get under their local regime.”Asked how confident he was about attracting US-based interest rate swaps business, Mr Liddell said: “We are determined to compete aggressively. We know that we have people who are keen to compete with us and that’s not an unhealthy situation.”Separately, LCH.Clearnet revealed that its fledgling Paris-based credit default swaps business had cleared €12.3bn ($15.1bn) in notional value since launch in March.
546;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-05-11T23:52:23Z;Watchdogs weigh uniform ‘circuit breakers’;;US regulators on Tuesday failed to offer a full explanation for last week’s wild market swings but told lawmakers that they may introduce uniform industry-wide “circuit breakers” and new rules to maintain market liquidity in times of stress.Mary Schapiro, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said that “fat-fingered” traders inputting mistaken orders were not responsible for the volatile equity markets last Thursday.“We may learn that the extraordinary disruption in trading, however it may have been triggered, was the result of a confluence of events which, taken together, exacerbated what already had been a down day,” Ms Schapiro told the House financial services subcommittee hearing, adding that the SEC had issued “a number of subpoenas” in its probe.Both she and Mr Gensler suggested that the growing prevalence of high-frequency trading and a lack of uniform rules for when to halt trading, had contributed to the sudden drop of liquidity on Thursday and the sharp fall in prices.Ms Schapiro suggested that she might favour stock-by-stock circuit breakers that kick in uniformly across different exchanges. At the moment, NYSE Euronext implements circuit breakers to slow trading at times of market stress, which other exchanges, such as Nasdaq OMX, can ignore. “The problem is that the other venues don’t have to obey us,” said Lawrence Leibowitz, chief operating officer of NYSE.In what analysts interpreted as a veiled reference to high-frequency trading firms, Ms Schapiro also said the SEC was “considering the types of obligations that should apply to certain liquidity providers”.“I somewhat question the wisdom of debating what’s next when we don’t know what’s happened,” said Jeb Hensarling, the Republican congressman from Texas.High-frequency trading specialists make markets in stocks, hoping to profit from the spread between where they buy and sell – and the rebate exchanges pay them for providing that service. Little known as recently as three years ago, they now account for as much as 70 per cent of all US share-trading volume. Because they are driven largely by their own trading needs, these companies feel little obligation to make markets when conditions are turbulent, contributing to a loss of liquidity in difficult times.“It is the one asset class that has provided returns that have been consistently attractive and stable,” said Mathew Rothman, head of US equity quantitative strategies for Barclays Capital in New York.More traditional market makers, who have lost business to the newcomers welcomed Ms Schapiro’s comments. “We are not only sympathetic, we have been pressing the SEC for two years for proactive obligations,” said an executive at one company.
547;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-05-10T21:10:17Z;SEC eyes trading circuit breakers;Quick-fire trades blamed for fall;"The Securities and Exchange Commission and leading US equity exchanges on Monday laid the ground for the creation of an industry-wide safety valve designed to temporarily halt trading in stocks, in response to last week’s trading turmoil.The SEC issued a statement after it met with chief executives from six equity exchanges that said: “As a first step, the parties agreed on a structural framework, to be refined over the next day, for strengthening circuit breakers and handling erroneous trades.”The House Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets will on Tuesday hold a hearing about the turmoil last week.The chiefs of the four main exchanges, NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX Group, Bats Global Markets and Direct Edge – the public venues for US share trading – together with International Securities Exchange, Chicago Board Options Exchange, the CME Group, and the IntercontinentalExchange later met with Tim Geithner, US Treasury Secretary, and Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.The meetings were held as Senator Charles Schumer called for coordinated circuit breakers across the country’s equities, options and futures exchanges.Last week, the four main exchanges agreed to cancel a number of “erroneous trades” that saw some leading stocks trade at a cent or less in price as support prices vanished from electronic markets during a 20-minute period on Thursday afternoon.A specific trigger for the sell-off is still unknown – the S&P 500 was pushed down a further 4.6 per cent in a matter of minutes after it had fallen by about 4 per cent.Blame for the sudden eruption in selling and the subsequent rebound has been cast on rapid-fire computer programs, while rival exchanges and traders criticised the floor of the New York Stock Exchange for slowing down trading in its listed stocks.During times of stress the NYSE trading floor implements circuit breakers, which other trading venues can ignore to continue trading. Market participants say the implementation of an industry-wide circuit breaker designed to temporarily halt trading in a stock should its price deviate sharply from its last trading level, may be difficult across the fragmented US market.There are also questions about how private trading networks at banks and dark pools will operate under such curbs.Those participants say the SEC might also elect to allow an exchange where the company is specifically listed – for example, the NYSE or Nasdaq – to implement circuit breakers that the rest of the market will have to abide by.The SEC has been conducting a broad review of the equity market structure since January and said that last week’s turmoil “is inconsistent with the effective functioning of our capital markets and we will make whatever structural or other changes are needed.”Under the SEC’s directives for boosting competition and lowering commissions in recent years, equity trading in the US has fragmented across different venues and become highly automated raising concerns about the kind of plunge witnessed last week.An official at one exchange says the challenge will be for the industry to reach consensus on such matters as competition between them, other private networks and dark pools is intense.Among those testifying at Tuesday’s House hearing are: Mary Schapiro, chairman of the SEC accompanied by Robert Cook, director, division of trading and markets; Gary Gensler, chairman of CFTC; Lawrence Leibowitz, chief operating officer of NYSE Euronext; Eric Noll, executive vice president at Nasdaq; and Terrence Duffy, executive chairman, CME Group.Congressman Paul Kanjorski, chairman of the committe said on Monday that the hearing will “thoroughly examine this situation in a public forum to maintain the integrity of the markets and promote investor confidence”."
548;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-05-07T19:23:43Z;Knock-on effect of NYSE slowdown;;The New York Stock Exchange came under fire from its rivals on Friday for slowing trading during the tumultuous trading session on Thursday afternoon, during which $1,000bn was briefly wiped off share values.Rival exchange chiefs said the move had exacerbated the plunge in prices. Once NYSE slowed trading on its floor in companies that had experienced big price moves, the reduction of liquidity exacerbated volatility in those shares at other trading venues.“Because the NYSE goes into a slow, or ‘manual’ mode, other market participants necessarily disregard the NYSE quotes, functionally rendering the NYSE irrelevant while it is in this mode,” said Joe Ratterman, chief executive officer at BATS Trading.In an interview with CNBC, Robert Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq, also criticised the move by NYSE to slow trading.But Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext, defended its policy. “My guess is regulators will take a look at this and say, if it’s just 30 or 60 seconds, no one’s walking away,” he told CNBC. “We’re simply slowing down the race car when we think it’s dangerous.”The dispute between the exchanges underscores the difficulties regulators face in overseeing the computer programs that direct most US stock trading.Soon after stocks fell on Thursday, there were further calls in Washington for greater oversight of so-called algorithmic traders– known as “algos”.
549;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-04-30T20:59:32Z;US bank shares lower on regulatory fears;;"Concerns over Greece’s fiscal situation and the threat of contagion to other eurozone countries hit risk appetite, sending US stock prices sharply lower on the week.“The continuing inability [of European leaders] to stem concerns over Greece is what we are focusing on,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. “We are now reconfiguring our international exposure and looking into how it’s going to affect companies with European operations.”He said he saw growing inflationary pressures on companies’ input costs as a factor that could adversely affect the recovery.After the closing bell yesterday, the S&P 500 was down 1.7 per cent at 1,186.69, and 2.5 per cent lower since the start of the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 1.4 per cent to 11,008.61, leaving it 1.8 per cent lower on the week. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2 per cent at 2,461.19, ending the week down 2.7 per cent.Financials were the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 during the week, falling 3.8 per cent, as fears mounted that the reform bill being thrashed out by US lawmakers could dent the industry’s profitability.Goldman Sachs was in focus after some of its executives and employees testified before Congress on Tuesday. Goldman dropped 9.4 per cent to $145.20 yesterday as media reports indicated that federal prosecutors were investigating the company, raising the possibility of criminal charges.The stock was downgraded to “neutral” from “buy” by Guy Moszkowski at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The target price was cut to $160 from $220.Mr Moszkowski wrote in a client note: “We continue to believe that GS has long-term earnings power beyond what is discounted in the share price.“However, it is very difficult to see the shares making further progress until the matter has been resolved.”Standard & Poor’s analysts dropped Goldman to “sell” from “hold” and dropped their price targets to $140 from $180.Energy producer Chevron declined 1 per cent yesterday to $81.44 in spite of
the release of first-quarter results that were significantly better than expected as rising oil prices offset lower earnings from its refineries.Net profit rose to $4.6bn, or $2.27 per share, from $1.8bn, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenues rose 34 per cent to $46.7bn. ExxonMobil was 2.1 per cent lower over the week at $67.77 as the energy producer posted weaker than expected results for the first quarter on Thursday, hit by losses at its US oil refineries.Shares in Palm surged 15.5 per cent over the week to $5.81 as the smartphone maker announced on Wednesday it had sold itself to Hewlett-Packard for $5.70 per share, or $1.2bn, representing a 23 per cent premium over Palm’s closing price on Wednesday.Over the week, Hewlett-Packard was down 3.6 per cent to $51.97.Nasdaq OMX Group yesterday lost 3.9 per cent to $21 as the transatlantic exchange trading group posted first-quarter results that missed analyst estimates.Operating profit fell 10 per cent to $92m, or 43 cents per share, in the first quarter compared with a year earlier – lower than the average analyst estimate of 46 cents per share.Futures exchange IntercontinentalExchange lost 1.8 per cent to $116.63 yesterday on news that it is to buy Climate Exchange, a London-listed carbon exchange, for about $604m.The price is a 57 per cent premium over the target’s closing price on Thursday.McAfee, the maker of computer security software, yesterday declined 12.1 per cent to $34.75 after reporting weaker than expected first-quarter results, as earnings were hurt by a glitch in some of its software products."
550;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-04-30T14:02:12Z;Nasdaq quarterly profits fall 10%;;Nasdaq OMX, the global exchange operator, reported on Friday that first-quarter earnings of its core business declined, reflecting a drop in US stock market volatility.Nasdaq said its net income, excluding one-time charges, was $92m, down 10 per cent from $102m the same quarter a year ago. Earnings per share on that basis were 42 cents, versus 46 cents in 2009. That missed analysts’ projections that earnings would hold steady at 46 cents per share.Revenues, calculated net of rebates to customers and broker fees, also declined 2 per cent, to $360m, and missed Wall Street’s forecast of $373m. Exchange rate adjustments accounted for a drop of $2m, but the leading factor was US cash-equity trading revenues, which dropped 30 per cent year-on-year.Total matched-share volume was 126.2bn in the quarter, versus 166.7bn in the same quarter in 2009. That follows closely the decline in market volatility, as indicated by the CBOE’s Vix volatility gauge, which touched multi-year lows earlier this year.Nasdaq’s market share also declined, from 24 per cent in the last quarter of 2009 to 20 per cent this quarter, reflecting the rise of competing low-cost equity exchanges such as BATS Trading and Direct Edge.The exchange also announced this week that it would be closing Neuro, its European share trading platform, after it failed to gain substantial market share.But Nasdaq’s share of US options trading grew to 23.8 per cent, versus 22.5 per cent in the fourth quarter. Nasdaq acquired the Philadelphia and Boston options exchanges in 2007 and 2008, respectively.In moves seen as preparing for regulatory changes that will increase the number of derivatives contracts that are required to be cleared, Nasdaq has been moving aggressively to grow that element of its business.In March, Nasdaq purchased the NECC, or North American Energy Credit and Clearing Corp, a clearinghouse of over-the-counter energy contracts, and a stake in Agora-X, an OTC commodity platform, in February.It also purchased Nord Pool, the world’s largest power derivatives exchange.Derivatives trading and clearing revenue increased 11 per cent from the prior year, to $61m.“We remained focused on executing our plan to leverage our world-class technology platform while diversifying product offering,” said Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive. “With positive developments in our interest-rate swaps clearing business, and expansion of our efforts with energy commodities, the breadth of our business has grown substantially.”
551;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-04-30T09:30:53Z;Equiduct to take on Nasdaq OMX Europe orders;;Equiduct, the European share trading platform controlled by Citadel Securities, on Friday said it had entered into exclusive talks with Nasdaq OMX Europe about helping up to 40 banks and brokers that are connected to the Nasdaq facility to redirect their order flow to Equiduct.The move comes two days after Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator, said it would close Nasdaq OMX Europe, or “Neuro”, its fledgling pan-European trading platform, amid stiff competition.If successful it could more than treble the number of clients connected to Equiduct. The platform, technically a market segment of Börse Berlin, is being relaunched as a platform that “aggregates” orders from retail investors, placed through medium-sized banks and brokers across Europe.Neuro and Equiduct would work towards an agreement where clients have the option to migrate their flow using their existing connections to Neuro.Peter Randall, Equiduct chief executive, said: “Probably the most important asset of an airline are its take-off and landing slots. The most critical asset of a trading platform is its connectivity to its participants.“Connectivity, testing, market data are important and expensive elements of connecting to a platform, so we felt it would be an opportunity for customers to have the option to re-cycle their connections and make use of them,” he told FT Trading Room.Charlotte Crosswell, Neuro president, said, “We are pleased to be working with Equiduct to allow [our] clients to continue to effectively utilise their connectivity to the platform.”
552;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-04-28T22:48:19Z;Nasdaq OMX to close European MTF;;Nasdaq OMX, the transatlantic exchange operator, on Wednesday abandoned an 18-month attempt to break into pan-European share trading by saying it would close down Nasdaq OMX Europe next month.The move is a blow to the US-based group’s ambitions to build a European business beyond the Nordic markets where it dominates through its ownership of OMX, based in Sweden.It is also a sign that low volumes in the wake of the crisis and tough competition between new share trading platforms is squeezing some operators out of the business.Nasdaq OMX Europe is one of six so-called multilateral trading facilities (MTFs) that sprang up in the wake of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid), a Brussels rule that broke the monopolies of established national exchanges in Europe, allowing competitors to emerge.However, many were founded on the assumptions about trading volumes that were overly optimistic and most still struggle to reach break-even. Two months ago Turquoise, a platform also launched in 2008 and backed by nine banks, was acquired by the London Stock Exchange.Nasdaq OMX Europe, also known as “Neuro”, never garnered more than 2 per cent of trading in pan-European blue-chips, according to Thomson Reuters, averaging about 1 per cent. That contrasts with the roughly 25 per cent market share in FTSE 100 stocks, and over 16 per cent in continental European shares, so far won by rival Chi-X Europe, which was the first MTF to launch.Charlotte Crosswell, Nasdaq OMQ Europe chief executive, said: “Sitting at 1 per cent obviously is not where we wanted to be and at some point you have to make a pretty tough business decision that you can’t continue to invest in a business if it’s not where you want it to be.”“When you look at when the business plans written for all the MTFs, volumes were very high and people did anticipate that was going to continue,” she told the Financial Times.Ms Crosswell said: “We’ve tried many initiatives to make this work and unfortunately this hasn’t worked, and ultimately we have to be responsible to our shareholders.”But she said Nasdaq OMX still had plans for Europe, without elaborating. “We still believe there are pan-European opportunities for us in different guises,” she said. Nasdaq OMX said Ms Crosswell would “continue working with business development initiatives for Nasdaq OMX in London and across Europe”.Nasdaq OMX Europe was wholly owned by its parent, which some industry observers had said would limit its ability to attract initial volume. Most other MTFs have as shareholders some of the biggest market participants and providers of liquidity, which benefited them in the early stages of their business as such shareholders had an incentive to commit orders to the platforms.Neuro had in recent months been trying to bring in other shareholders but Ms Crosswell acknowledged the effort had failed, partly because it came too late.“We had some very positive talks, but we just felt that it wasn’t necessarily going to guarantee success. Growing it from a low base was still going to be very tough. If it had been something that we’d done at an early time that may have been different.”Nasdaq OMX would continue to have a presence in London, where it runs a sales team for its OMX markets, a UK power exchange and an international listings business. It “remains committed to London as a financial centre”, the company said.Nasdaq’s first attempt at building a business in Europe came in 1996 when Nasdaq took a stake in Easdaq, a Brussels-based pan-European bourse.
553;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-04-28T11:46:47Z;Quick View: Nasdaq’s third time unlucky;;"Nasdaq OMX just can’t seem to crack “greater Europe”.The US exchange operator has just thrown in the towel with “Neuro”, as the clumsily-named Nasdaq OMX Europe is better known.To no-one’s surprise, it had failed to gain traction after 18 months of offering pan-European share trading, managing 2 per cent as its best performance in November last year.So what went wrong?Neuro was set up at a time of generous volume assumptions by everyone in the industry that were knocked for six by the financial crisis. That made it hard for any multi-lateral trading faciltiy (MTF) with feeble market share to have a hope of even breaking even. Especially if they were launching an MTF after its rivals go to the party - as Neuro did; Chi-X Europe has done well by being first to the tape.But crucially, the folks at Nasdaq’s Manhattan headquarters failed to grasp the importance of bringing in some of the big institutional liquidity providers – the banks and market-making firms like Getco and Optiver – as shareholders in the venture.Nasdaq OMX had in recent months been trying to get some of these types into Neuro in a bid to “re-mutualise” – the same rationale that drove Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, to absorb Neuro’s more successful rival Turquoise.But as Charlotte Crosswell, Neuro’s energetic chief executive, points out, it came too late. She was straightforward enough to admit to me this morning that “if there is one thing we did differently from the others that’s the one thing that stands out”.Where does Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq OMX chief executive, go from here? This is the group’s third attempt to crack Europe in a big way, starting with the ill-fated investment in Easdaq in 1996 and continuing with the failed bid for the LSE.To be sure, it is hardly accurate or fair to imply Nasdaq has failed in Europe; it has OMX, the Nordic network of exchanges, a Scandinavian derivatives business, a UK power business and a technology sales business embedded in OMX.Also, aside from a splashy launch party at the London headquarters of Bloomberg, Neuro probably saved on start-up costs by using staff and technology already available from within the Nasdaq OMX group. Ms Crosswell says the investment in the MTF was “not material” to group earnings.Yet the Nordic region accounts for at most 8 per cent of all European trading volume. And Nasdaq’s rival NYSE Euronext has a pan-European foot print in the four Euronext markets, and its own MTF: NYSE Arca Europe.If Nasdaq OMX is serious about building a global execution business, it will have to come up with something else in Europe. One option would be to go for broke and buy Chi-X Europe. When I put this to Charlotte Crosswell, who has headed Neuro since the beginning, she responded: “We never comment on M&A but we have always said that we look at each opportunity on a case by case basis”.But with Chi-X enjoying 25 per cent share in the FTSE 100 and 16.6 per cent of continental European share trading, it would come with a hefty price tag. And there would likely be a bidding war as soon as Mr Greifeld expressed an interest.The answer may even lie in the Gulf, where the sands are shifting in exchange ownership. The Abu Dhabi bourse is reportedly close to merging with – read: acquiring - Borse Dubai, which is the anchor shareholder in both the LSE and Nasdaq OMX.Meanwhile some of the Italian banks that are collectively the second largest shareholders in the LSE are restive and are also reported in the Italian press as being interested in amassing a greater stake, possibly involving Dubai.Could Mr Greifeld perhaps take another run at the LSE, with a big Gulf shareholder?All speculative so far, but it might – just might – be that the key to Nasdaq finally cracking Europe in a big way could lie in the Gulf."

556;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-04-15T18:45:59Z;LCH.Clearnet warns on loose standards;;LCH.Clearnet has accused some of its global rivals of using loose standards to assess the amount of insurance traders must take out against a catastrophic default, in an apparent attempt by Europe’s largest independent clearing house to win business.The development is a sign some clearing houses are trying to highlight the dangers of “competing on margin” – that is, lowering the minimum funds that must be posted by market participants to a clearing house to guard against failures.Regulators fear that clearing houses might start to use margin as a competitive weapon to attract business as they battle for a slice of the vast over-the-counter derivatives markets.They say this could lead to a “race to the bottom” on the financial strength of a clearing house, increasing the risk that a clearer could collapse, potentially triggering a financial crisis.Regulators have insisted clearers adopt the highest possible risk management and margin standards in the wake of the crisis to ensure the safety of clearing houses and the wider financial system. A clearing house acts as a buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer in transactions, using margin to ensure transactions are completed in case of default.Roger Liddell, LCH.Clearnet chief executive, said: “There seems to be a divergence from a risk management standpoint as to how CCPs [central counterparties or clearing houses] are operating.”He said IntercontinentalExchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange – two US exchanges with OTC derivatives clearing operations – “margin differently” from each other. Mr Liddell singled out International Derivatives Clearing Group, a clearing house set up last year to clear OTC interest rate swaps, and controlled by Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator.“The most extreme case is between us and IDCG. Their approach to risk is much more lenient than ours,” Mr Liddell said.Michael Dundon, IDCG chief risk officer, said: “We do not have more lenient standards in that we recalculate our margins on a daily basis. We are very responsive to volatility on a daily basis.”CME said: “The group regards risk margining as essential to proper counterparty risk controls and does not calculate margins according to commercial considerations.”ICE said: “We’ve warned that competing on margin could create a race to the bottom.”
557;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-04-06T14:55:15Z;WSE receives bids to modernise trading;;The Warsaw Stock Exchange said on Tuesday that it had received three responses to its tender for a contract to modernise the exchange’s trading platform and form a strategic alliance with a leading foreign stock exchange.Responses came from Nasdaq OMX, the NYSE Euronext, and the London Stock Exchange, according to Ludwik Sobolewski, the exchange president. Deutsche Börse did not respond. The contract is to be decided by July.Part of the tender is to modernise the WSE’s trading platform, which is currently a modified version of that used by the Paris bourse. But the Warsaw exchange also wants to form a broad partnership with the winner of the tender.The need for a foreign partner became more pressing after last year’s failure to sell part of the exchange, currently 98 per cent owned by the state, to a strategic investor. Deutsche Börse was the only one to submit an offer, but talks broke down over the price to be paid for the WSE and how much independence Warsaw would be able to retain under a change of ownership.The sale of the WSE was not popular with the local financial community, which feared Warsaw’s marginalisation. The plan now is to float the exchange on the WSE by the end of this year.
558;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-03-31T21:28:08Z;Nasdaq, LSE wait for shifting sands to settle;;Ever since the London Stock Exchange rebuffed a hostile takeover by US rival Nasdaq OMX in 2006, the future of the two western bourses has lain in the shifting sands of the Gulf.This week the emirates of Dubai and Abu Dhabi said they were in talks about a possible merger of their two exchanges. Borse Dubai is the largest shareholder in the LSE, with 20.6 per cent, and has 28.6 per cent of Nasdaq OMX.The question is, if the financially stronger Abu Dhabi ends up as the key shareholder in both exchanges, perhaps through an acquisition of the Dubai exchange, how would this realign the strategic balance between the LSE, Nasdaq and – further south in the Gulf – NYSE Euronext, which last year struck a deal with Qatar to transform Doha Securities Market into an exchange with regional ambitions.All three western exchanges have been placing bets in the Gulf, picking partners that they believe will give them a foothold in a region whose capital markets will only grow. Technology is seen as key to driving that, which is why NYSE Euronext is selling its trading system to the Doha Securities Exchange following its acquisition of a 20 per cent stake.But for Gulf exchanges – and particularly the Abu Dhabi Exchange (ADX) – the opportunity could be to act as kingmaker in the next round of global exchange consolidation.Lynton Jones, chairman of Bourse Consult, a London-based consultancy, and former chairman of the Dubai International Financial Exchange (DIFX), says: “They [the LSE and Nasdaq] do not know ultimately who is going to be owning a large chunk of their shares or how that Dubai ownership is going to be managed because of all of these shifting sands.”For the LSE, Dubai was a solid “anchor” shareholder until the emirate’s recent debt crisis. The hope will be that oil-rich Abu Dhabi may replace Dubai as the largest shareholder.The LSE remains vulnerable to takeover, its shares still depressed relative to the sector as it battles a loss of market share in UK equities at the hands of rivals such as Chi-X Europe.Nasdaq’s abandonment of its bid for the LSE was part of a complex set of manoeuvres that also involved the US operator bidding against Borse Dubai for the OMX Nordic exchange. In the end, Nasdaq sold shares in the LSE to Borse Dubai – hence the Gulf exchange’s current shareholding – and snapped up OMX.For Abu Dhabi, a deal with Dubai may help it in its ambition to build up the UAE’s position as a market for foreigners seeking exposure to the oil-rich Gulf region. Yet much will depend on how a Dubai-Abu Dhabi deal is structured.People familiar with the situation say the merger would be easy to engineer given that Dubai Financial Market – the local stock exchange (which recently bought Nasdaq Dubai, the international bourse) – and ADX operate under the same regulatory body, the Emirates Securities and Commodities Authority.One obstacle is that the DFM is 20 per cent owned by the public, after a 2006 initial public offering. ADX is owned by Abu Dhabi, while 80 per cent of DFM is owned by government-controlled Borse Dubai.The notion of creating a UAE exchange goes back as far as the creation of the two bourses in 2000, with analysts arguing that a unified body would better compete on a global scale.But with federal unity the theme of the moment in the UAE, the signals are more positive. Dubai’s debt problems have led to $20bn in financial support from the federal government and its biggest backer, Abu Dhabi, leading observers to expect stronger federal institutions. “The sentiment is that this will happen, but exactly how we will have to wait and see,” said one Dubai-based person familiar with the situation.
559;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Dubai talks to Abu Dhabi over bourse merger;;Dubai and Abu Dhabi on Tuesday said they were in talks on a possible merger of the emirates’ exchanges.The move signals a potential shake-up in a region that holds the key to the future ownership of the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange operator.It offers the possibility of lower costs and higher trading volumes in the Gulf, where there is increasing interest in modernising market structures to attract trading interest.A merger between publicly listed Dubai Financial Market and the Abu Dhabi Exchange would create a larger and more liquid platform, which would better reflect the size of the United Arab Emirates’ economy, the Gulf’s second largest after Saudi Arabia, according to Issa al-Kazim, DFM chief executive.DFM is 80 per cent owned by Borse Dubai, an entity that is controlled by the Dubai government, and Dubai Holding, a conglomerate owned by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, Dubai’s ruler.The ADX is owned by the Abu Dhabi government.Borse Dubai is the largest single shareholder in the LSE, and has 28.6 per cent of Nasdaq OMX.Although the structure of any deal has yet to be finalised, industry experts said financially stronger Abu Dhabi would be in pole position to influence the re-alignment of the global exchange landscape if it were to become a large shareholder in the LSE and Nasdaq OMX through the transaction.ADX, one of the smallest exchanges in the region, would also be likely to need an international exchange partner to help acquire new technology and build Abu Dhabi into a larger financial centre, they said.Majd Shafiq, managing partner at United Advisors, a capital markets consultancy focused on the Middle East, said: “Abu Dhabi will be in the driving seat as far as the consolidation of exchanges worldwide.“Whatever happens, the issue of LSE and Nasdaq ownership is going to be on the table.”Discussions over a possible merger have taken place for at least five years, but they may have a greater chance of success in the current environment.Over the past year, Abu Dhabi and the UAE central bank have stepped in to extend financial support to indebted Dubai.“The story has been there for a while, but it would certainly see marginal costs going down,” Mr Kazim told reporters.He added that the trend of exchange mergers had proved popular in European and US markets.Talks at a pan-Emirates level came as the merger between DFM and Nasdaq Dubai, an international exchange that has failed to attract listings, was set to be completed in one to two weeks’ time, Mr Kazim said.
560;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-03-30T13:13:49Z;Warsaw seeks partner to revamp bourse;;The Warsaw Stock Exchange has put out a tender for a contract to modernise the exchange’s trading platform and form a strategic alliance with one of the world’s leading bourses, said Ludwik Sobolewski, its president.The tender was sent to the Deutsche Börse, Nasdaq OMX, NYSE Euronext, and the London Stock Exchange, with responses due by April 6, Mr Sobolewski told the FT.“I am counting on getting as many offers as possible for our very demanding proposal,” he said. The size of the tender would not be known until bids came in.Part of the tender involves updating the WSE’s platform, which was originally based on that used by the Paris bourse, but has since been extensively modified. Any of the systems used by the four exchanges would be acceptable for Warsaw, said Mr Sobolewski.“It will be a big challenge to change the platform,” he said. “It is a change that will affect the infrastructure of the market.”Warsaw also wants to form an alliance with the winning exchange, which would involve, among other things, co-operation in market data, as well as expanding dual listings.The tender comes after last year’s failure to find a strategic investor for the WSE, which is 98 per cent owned by the state. The Polish treasury ministry contacted the four exchanges that have been approached in the current tender offer, but only Deutsche Börse responded with an offer. Talks eventually broke down over price and over what stake Warsaw would retain.The sale of the WSE to a foreign exchange was not popular with the local financial community, which feared Warsaw’s marginalisation. The plan is to float the exchange on the WSE by the end of this year.The Warsaw exchange, formed in 1991, has become a symbol of the success of market-oriented reforms that transformed Poland after the end of communism, and its future has therefore become a delicate political issue.Both the government and the exchange are aware that Warsaw will have a difficult time retaining its regional importance in an era of market consolidation.Warsaw’s state ownership precluded it from taking part in an earlier round of stock market privatisations that saw exchanges from the Baltics to the Balkans sold to strategic investors. The Vienna Exchange was the main beneficiary of those sales, but in recent months it has lost ground to the WSE, which is now the region’s largest.
561;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-03-14T22:50:36Z;Interest rate swaps new focus for OTC clearing;;"Looking out across his audience of Wall Street bankers, exchange and clearing house executives at a conference last week, Gary Gensler, the top US futures regulator, asked whether anyone disagreed with the need to reform the vast over-the-counter derivatives markets, which have been blamed by many for exacerbating the financial crisis.No hands went up, prompting Mr Gensler to quip: “I want to thank you for your unanimous support that something probably needs to happen.”A key aim is to shift more OTC derivatives on to exchanges and for them to be processed through clearing houses to safeguard the financial system against the potentially catastrophic effects of another Lehman-style default. A clearing house takes on the risk that a party to a trade defaults, spreading the risk among its members.While Republicans continue to frustrate attempts by Senate Democrats to finalise a financial reform bill, the industry is not waiting for Washington to act and is jockeying for the commercial spoils, knowing that more OTC clearing of some kind is not only inevitable but offers a lucrative new business.So far, that has involved launching clearing of OTC credit default swaps. IntercontinentalExchange, the US operator of OTC trading platforms and clearing houses, has taken the lead in clearing CDS negotiated between dealers – mainly Wall Street banks.But at last week’s Futures Industry Conference in Florida, it became clear that a far bigger opportunity probably lies not only in interest rate swaps – a market 10 times bigger than CDS – but with the huge entities that use them to manage interest rate risk.Top of that list are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the huge mortgage financiers. Together they manage a $2,500bn-$3,000bn mortgage portfolio. At the conference their regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, announced that the two lenders would press ahead with using clearing houses for their swaps portfolios this year – whether or not legislation was passed.Susan Milligan, special counsel at the Options Clearing Corporation, says: “If they decide to move all their interest rate swaps into clearing, that will be a tipping point that could convince a whole lot of corporates, pension funds and other end-users that clearing is OK.”Three groups are vying for the business: CME Group, the Chicago-based futures exchange; International Derivatives Clearing Group, a recently formed clearing house controlled by Nasdaq OMX; and LCH.Clearnet, the European clearing house that already clears over 60 per cent of all dealer-to-dealer OTC interest rate swaps.Garry O’Connor, IDCG chief executive, says Fannie and Freddie are so big in swaps they “will be anybody’s biggest customer”.IDCG received a boost last week when Newedge, the world’s largest futures broker, said it had joined IDCG as a clearing member – an essential step for any clearer as members are the intermediaries that connect OTC derivatives users with a clearing house.Martha Tirinnanzi, chairwoman of FHFA’s clearing house working group, told the FT that clearing was “a watershed for interest rate hedging” because it would remove the need for Fannie and Freddie constantly to have to monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties of its OTC swaps contracts.Casting some doubt over LCH.Clearnet’s prospects, she said concern over how a default is handled under UK bankruptcy laws meant FHFA needed to study “what kinds of obstacles we would encounter in the event of a default [in the UK]”.Another complication for LCH.Clearnet is that it does not yet have a US-based OTC clearing house, which experts say would be needed if it had any prospect of clearing more dollar-denominated interest rate swaps. They say US regulators are also likely to insist that dollar-denominated swaps must be cleared in the US to ensure the activity falls under US bankruptcy rules.Ms Tirinnanzi hinted at a preference for more than one US clearing option, saying: “I think we’d like to see CME become operational sooner rather than later.”"
562;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-03-09T01:13:22Z;Nasdaq OMX buys Chicago-based clearer;;The Nasdaq OMX Group, a transatlantic exchange group, announced on Monday it had bought the North American Energy Credit and Clearing Corporation (NECC), a Chicago-based clearing house for the over-the-counter (OTC) power and gas markets for an undisclosed price.The move is part of Nasdaq OMX’s longer-term strategy to expand its OTC commodities business and its clearing efforts.Clearing has emerged as a key component of OTC derivatives reform, with regulators on both sides of the Atlantic insisting that as many OTC products as possible be processed through clearing houses.A clearing house stands between two parties to a trade, guaranteeing that the trade goes ahead even if one party defaults.“This acquisition presents us with an opportunity to deliver what the US power and gas market currently lacks: a clearing house with the flexibility to clear both financial and physical instruments,” said Bob Greifeld, chief executive officer of the Nasdaq OMX Group.Nasdaq OMX said it expects the deal to allow it to start offering clearing for OTC power financial and physical contracts but did not specify when.“Operating as a market-neutral ’riskless principal’, [NECC] enters matching positions with different counterparties and manages the credit risk on both sides using standard clearing house-type margining,” the company said.This is not the Nasdaq OMX ‘s first foray into clearing. It owns a majority interest in IDCG, which provides clearing for interest rate swaps. It also recently merged two Nordic clearing houses to clear Nordic equities, fixed income and power derivatives.To bolster its presence in the OTC markets, the group also bought a majority interest in Agora-X, a fast-growing electronic OTC commodity platform that also trades oil derivatives, last month.The group bought Nord Pool, the world’s largest power derivatives exchange, three years ago and recently expanded it by launching N2EX, a market for physical UK power contacts.Geir Reigstad, head of Nasdaq OMX’s commodities division, will lead the commodities clearing effort.
563;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-03-02T08:39:50Z;SGX chief sets out multi-platform vision;Böcker defends dark pool venture;"Ten weeks into his term as chief executive of the Singapore Exchange, Magnus Böcker has set out a strategy for transforming SGX into a hub for trading and clearing a huge range of products on a variety of platforms.“My approach is to say that if the institutions in the market want to trade in different ways and the brokers want to support them in that, why wouldn’t we help them facilitate it?” says Mr Böcker, a former president of Nasdaq OMX.“It’s not up to me to decide what investors should do; I don’t decide what they should invest in and I can never decide what platforms they should trade on,” he said in an interview with the Financial Times.The aim is to create an Asian gateway for global investors seeking to trade equities, commodities and derivatives on the exchange, over the counter, in dark pools – private networks on which institutions trade large blocks of stock – or between themselves, with the trades cleared by the exchange.SGX, Asia’s second-largest listed exchange by market capitalisation, has more than 300 overseas listings out of a total of 762 and has recently built a lucrative business in clearing over the counter commodities contracts for more than 400 counterparties.To complete the transformation, Mr Böcker is now planning a range of new initiatives, starting with the expansion of exchange traded commodity products from rubber and fuel oil to include gold and coffee, with others to follow later.He is also seeking to expand both the exchange traded commodities and the OTC clearing business through links with clearers and exchanges in Europe, North America and north Asia, as well as adding currency forwards and other financial derivatives to the OTC clearing business.The exchange cleared more than 98,000 OTC contracts last year compared with just over 1,000 in 2006.On the equities side, Mr Böcker said he was ”talking actively” about further co-operation with India’s National Stock Exchange and the Bombay Stock Exchange, where SGX has a board seat after the acquisition of a 5 per cent stake for $42.7m in March 2007.Mr Böcker disclosed that he was seeking to extend a deal with the rival NSE allowing futures trading of its Nifty index in Singapore.The exchange also announced last month the first two dual listings with the Oslo Børs under an agreement focused on promoting co-operation on maritime stocks.Mr Böcker says SGX was reviewing its listing rules – such as the requirement for companies to have a Singapore-based director – to maintain its attractiveness to overseas companies.He says the prospect of attracting more stocks from mainland China – known as S-Chips – has improved with the global recovery from the financial crisis, with seven listing in the last six months of 2009 and more in the pipeline.He also dismisses suggestions that some of the 159 S-Chips are considering moving to Hong Kong, insisting it is not true that many has concerns about valuations and liquidity in Singapore.“No one has ever been able to prove this to me,” he says.Mr Böcker says he is not concerned about a serious challenge from the Singapore Mercantile Exchange, owned by India’s Financial Technologies Group, which is preparing to open shortly with the eventual aim of trading more than 30 commodity products.He is also unapologetic about SGX’s decision – taken by his predecessor, Hsieh Fu Hua – to establish Chi-East, a dark pool joint venture with Chi-X Global, which he says is “on target” for a launch in the summer.Dark pools have been heavily criticised by exchange officials around Asia, including by Ronald Arculli, chairman of Hong Kong Exchanges and Atsushi Saito, president of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, who said recently that they should be ”shut off”.Mr Böcker, who will be the first head of an Asian exchange to run a dark pool, appears unmoved by claims from other exchanges that dark pools lack transparency and compete unfairly.“In some areas we will co-operate with other exchanges, clearing houses and brokers, and in other areas we will compete.“That is what you see in most other industries …we need to learn to live with that,” he says."
564;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-02-21T18:59:05Z;Small orders breed dark pools and higher costs;;Anyone trading on the world’s stock exchanges five years ago would have done so by submitting orders on average twice as large as those today.That may seem like just another statistic. But it points to a fundamental shift in the way market structures – like exchanges – have evolved in that time.According to research by Mondo Visione, a consultancy, the average size by value of orders traded on 14 of the world’s top exchanges has halved in those five years. A similar trend has affected futures and options exchanges.The average size of an order submitted to the New York Stock Exchange in 2005 was $19,400. This week, orders sent to the exchange will average $6,400.That is because automated, or electronic, trading has sliced orders into ever-smaller sizes, particularly as “high-frequency” trading strategies have come to dominate activity.There have been at least two consequences. The first is the growth in “dark pools”, platforms that allow traders to get large, or block, trades done more easily.Placing them on a public exchange is risky with average trade sizes so small because doing so would immediately signal to the wider market that a large order was coming in – possibly prompting the market to move against the person who originally placed that large order.Herbie Skeete, Mondo Visione managing director, says: “With ‘algo’ trading, it’s necessary to disguise your intentions to not give clues to the rest of the market by splitting your orders into smaller and smaller baskets.”Second, the explosion in the number of small trades has added to post-trade costs such as clearing and settlement, since clearing houses and settlement systems generally charge per trade.The findings also highlight why the US Securities and Exchange Commission is in the midst of a “comprehensive review” of US equity markets structure.It is assessing whether the proliferation of types of trading venue, including dark pools, as a result of rapid advances in automated trading have created an uneven playing field for some investors.“Given the dispersal of liquidity across a large number of trading centres of different types, an important question is whether trading centres are sufficiently linked together in a unified national market system,” the SEC said in a report, on which public comment is due by April.The SEC is also examining whether “professional investors” like high-frequency traders with short trading horizons of milliseconds may have different interests from long-term investors more interested in taking a view on a company’s shares.Effectively, the SEC is asking: “Who are the markets for?”The agency does acknowledge that high-frequency traders – which often prefer to be called “liquidity providers” – “can promote efficient pricing”.“Professional traders competing to provide liquidity may narrow spreads and give investors the benefit of better prices when they simply want to trade immediately at the best available price,” the SEC says.Yet the extent to which drivers of smaller trade size dominate the exchanges is highlighted by the generous fee rebates offered to high-frequency traders by the exchanges as they battle for this important source of liquidity.Complicating matters, exchanges have recently started to operate their own dark pools.Nasdaq OMX will soon launch Nasdaq OMX PHLX, its third platform, designed to attract large orders back into the exchange from external dark pools.Mr Skeete says all this will require regulators to have “a better overview of markets”.
565;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-02-21T18:19:26Z;Size of share orders cut in half on global markets;;The average size of share orders on the world’s exchanges has halved in the past five years, highlighting the inroads automated and “high-frequency” trading has made on global markets.The finding, in research carried out by Mondo Visione, a consultancy, and commissioned by the Financial Times, comes amid concerns over the ability of exchanges and brokers to supervise a surge in orders and data flowing through trading and risk management systems.The research also shows how the trend is driving the growth of “dark pools”, with traders interested in executing large orders shunning exchanges and seeking to carry out those types of trades on specialist platforms.Order sizes are being sliced into smaller sizes amid a growth in algorithmic trading, a technique used by high-frequency traders at banks, hedge funds and specialist high-frequency firms. Via software programs, algorithms decide when, how and where to trade certain financial instruments without human intervention.High-frequency trading uses algorithms to trade at ultra-fast speeds – often 1,000 times faster than the blink of a human eye – seeking to profit from fleeting opportunities presented by minute price changes.Exchanges have also been reducing “tick sizes” – the increments by which a price can move – partly in response.Mondo Visione asked 14 exchanges to chart how this had affected average order size by value. It found that this had fallen by 52 per cent since 2005.The fall was most pronounced at the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and the London Stock Exchange.On the NYSE, order sizes fell 67 per cent to $6,400, from $19,400 in the period, while on Nasdaq they dropped by 68 per cent from $44,600 to $14,400.In 2005, an average order on the LSE was worth £20,472, but has fallen 63 per cent to £7,394.On Deutsche Börse, the German exchange, the decline was 57 per cent. In Asia, average order size on the Hong Kong exchange fell by 28 per cent from HK$121,300 to HK$87,300.Herbie Skeete, Mondo Visione’s managing director, said the trend was “a mixed blessing” for exchanges.“Falling trade sizes means more trades, which offsets the impact of lower trade fees, but it also means increased network traffic to contend with.” That would require more “market surveillance, in ‘real time’,” he said, adding that there had been tighter spreads on exchanges “leading to better markets”.
566;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-02-18T10:13:05Z;ASX interim numbers beat forecasts;;Interim results from ASX, the Australian stock and futures exchange operator, beat forecasts on Thursday, helped by what it called improved financial market confidence, lower volatility and a modest upturn in risk appetite.The news came as ASX said it would this year replace its trading system with the Genium Inet trading platform, provided by Nasdaq OMX, to target the “ultra high frequency community”.The new system features average “latency” – a measure of trading speed – of 250 microseconds, or more than 1,000 times as fast as the blink of an eye. It will be used for the ASX’s equities and derivatives markets.ASX and Nasdaq OMX are working on the delivery from October of ASX Trade, the Australian group’s next-generation trading system, which will be powered by Genium Inet. This will allow ASX Trade to increase trading capacity to “exceed 5m trades and 500m order book changes per day”, the exchanges said.Jeff Olsson, ASX group executive for technology, said the platform would “provide a significant improvement in technology performance, which when coupled with ASX’s co-location facilities, will offer market participants a trading experience as fast and efficient as anywhere in the world”.Net profit at the ASX fell to A$168m from A$172m in the six months ended December but less than 1 per cent to A$171m after stripping out exceptional items. The result beat analysts’ forecasts of about A$163m.The small decline reflected lower interest income from the ASX’s cash-backed capital and participant margin balances, which offset gains from a bumper period for secondary listings in Australia.Robert Elstone, chief executive, said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, which rose 9 per cent to A$235m, had returned to the levels before the global financial crisis.ASX is in the process of moving some of its oversight functions, including supervision of real-time trading, across to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Canberra is also expected this year to grant market licences and it is considering applications from Chi-X, the equities trading platform, and Liquidnet, a US-based operator of “dark pools”.Mr Elstone would not comment on the coming competitive landscape.ASX said listing revenue rose 17 per cent to A$65.3m, with 50 listings during the half. Equity capital raising jumped 38 per cent to A$59bn, the bulk from secondary offers.Cash market revenue – including trading, clearing and settlement of equities, warrants and interest rate securities – rose 6 per cent to A$94.3m, while derivatives revenue fell 3 per cent to A$71.9m.ASX said it was confident about its growth prospects going into the second half based on activity levels in the initial six weeks of trading.As well as a “healthy” pipeline for initial public offerings, it said the cash markets average daily traded value of A$4.8bn was 20 per cent higher than the same time last year.ASX shares rose A$1.07 or 3 per cent to A$36.92.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.5 per cent to 10,097.18 but the Nasdaq was 0.3 per cent higher at 2,183.53.The Vix index, tracking market volatility via option prices, ticked lower for the fourth successive session, falling 3.7 per cent.“The cross-current winds are coming from abroad,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners. “There’s a lot of fear out there that the excess money in the markets will be coming out.”Over the week, the S&P 500 recorded a 0.9 per cent gain, breaking its four-week losing streak. The Dow was also up 0.9 per cent and the Nasdaq up 2 per cent.Cal Dive International, a marine contractor to the offshore oil and natural gas industry, weighed on the market after warning its quarterly profit would be lower than previously forecast. The company blamed reduced demand and poor weather in the US Gulf of Mexico, which had hampered activity. The shares fell in early trading but ended unchanged at $7.05.Elsewhere in the sector, Ultra Petroleum initially rose after it beat quarterly estimates and gave an encouraging forecast for this year. But a drop in the oil price sent the shares down 1.6 per cent to $47.75.Shares in 3M fell 1.4 per cent to $79.18 after Bank of America Merrill Lynch reduced its rating on the diversified manufacturer to “underperform” from “neutral”, citing slower growth in the second half.During the week, analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein had upgraded the group to “outperform” from “market-perform” and noted the prospect of better margins and the potential for growth in multi-industrial groups.PepsiAmericas, the second-largest Pepsi bottler, fell 0.3 per cent to $29.48 after posting a lower-than-expected profit for the fourth quarter.The group said it had been hit by unfavourable currency moves and the costs of restructuring its Caribbean business.On Thursday, PepsiCo said it had doubled its quarterly profit thanks to rising international sales.The previous day, Coca-Cola had said that strong demand from China, Brazil and India had helped the soft drinks maker to offset declines in North America.Over the week, PepsiCo gained 2.4 per cent to $60.92 and Coca-Cola was up 1.7 per cent at $53.98.In the technology sector, shares in SkillSoft climbed 13 per cent to $11.03 after a consortium of private equity firms agreed to buy the software maker for about $1.1bn.Motorola added 7.5 per cent to $7.15 after the company announced plans to split into two companies: one to sell mobile phones and television set-top boxes and the other to focus on wireless networking.The companies behind the market’s indices were also in focus this week as they reported their quarterly results.Nasdaq and NYSE Euronext both said they were losing market share and had suffered from falling trading volumes.Shares in NYSE rose more than 5 per cent after its results as cost-cutting helped the exchange operator to beat estimates.But Nasdaq’s results prompted a 4 per cent drop in its share price since the group only beat estimates by a narrow margin and it forecast higher operating costs for this year.
570;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-02-08T22:41:34Z;Nasdaq chief critical of prop trading plans;;Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, said on Monday that it would be “impossible” to distinguish between a bank proprietary trading desk trading on its own or on behalf of clients, casting further doubt on the viability of US proposals to ban such trading.Asked by an analyst on an earnings call whether Nasdaq OMX could say how much proprietary trading was done through the exchange, Mr Greifeld said: “It’s kind of impossible for us to answer, delineated between ‘prop’ and ‘non-prop’. This shows the difficulty legislators will have proscribing prop trading.“Once you get into what is risk [positions] versus principal [positions] it gets impossible, so I think they’d have to find a different path to go.”His comments echo similar doubts from Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext, since Barack Obama, US president, proposed the “ Volcker rules ”. Mr Niederauer said: “Separating proprietary activity from principal activities, from customer facilitation activities [is] virtually impossible.”Mr Greifeld’s comments came as Nasdaq OMX unveiled an 11 per cent fall in net income, excluding one-time expenses, to $99m, or 46 cents a share in the fourth quarter, down from $110m, or 52 cents a share.Revenues fell 8 per cent in the quarter to $369m. Both figures beat analysts’ estimates, but shares were down 3.2 per cent at $18.19 in late New York trade.Including the items, Nasdaq OMX reported a 23 per cent rise in net income of $43m, or 20 cents per diluted share, compared with $35m, or 17 cents, in the previous year’s fourth quarter.Derivatives net revenue exceeded equities trading revenues for the second quarter in succession, highlighting how the group continues to diversify away from share trading. There, revenues plunged 43 per cent in the quarter to $54m.US and European cash equities trading account for 15 per cent of group revenues. By comparison, the London Stock Exchange derives 18 per cent of revenues from trading in British stocks. Nasdaq is also attempting to expand into over-the-counter derivatives clearing.On power markets, where the group recently launched a UK exchange, Mr Greifeld said the aim was to launch a power derivatives market in addition to that “sometime in the spring”

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1 per cent to 9,908.39 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent lower at 2,126.05.Financial and materials stocks led the declines as fears over possible contagion from Greek fiscal woes distracted investors from positive quarterly results in the retail sector.“The market in the US is desperately trying to focus on earnings and fundamentals,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist for Prudential Financial. “But it’s being thwarted continuously by what’s going on in Europe and how the EU is trying to handle the debt crisis.”Shares in CVS Caremark climbed 5.3 per cent to $32.72 after the retail pharmacy chain beat quarterly estimates. While total revenue fell below analysts’ expectations, sales from stores open for more than a year were still higher than those at rival Walgreen.Hasbro added to the market’s gains, reporting a higher than expected quarterly profit.The toymaker said it had seen particularly strong demand for products linked to the Transformers movie. Its shares jumped 12.7 per cent to $34.71.Home Depot added 2.2 per cent to $28.59 after Morgan Stanley raised the home improvement chain to “overweight” from “equal-weight”.Analyst Gregory Melich noted improving trends in the housing market and said there was more room for margin growth than the market was currently pricing in.Meanwhile, Lowe’s, the country’s second-largest home improvement retailer, announced the opening of its first store in Mexico as part of its international expansion strategy.Shares in the group, which underperformed Home Depot by more than 10 percentage points last year, rose 0.8 per cent to $21.76.Amazon.com initially rose after analysts at Collins Stewart upgraded the internet retailer to “buy” from “hold”, noting the growth potential of the company’s electronic book business. The shares were later down 0.5 per cent at $116.83.Walt Disney also briefly benefited from an upgrade but later slipped 0.2 per cent to $29.48. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase raised the world’s largest media group to “neutral” from “underweight”.While improving economic conditions would boost revenues, Walt Disney is likely to lag behind the rest of the sector. due to challenging trends at the film studio and parks, they said.Weyerhaeuser, one of the world’s largest pulp and paper companies, was raised to “neutral” from “underperform” at Credit Suisse.The brokerage also raised its price target on the stock to $42 from $40 on the prospect of higher demand for wood in the economic recovery. Shares in the group also gave up early gains, losing 0.5 per cent to $39.25.Elsewhere, CIT Group named John Thain, the ousted head of Merrill Lynch, as its new chief executive after searching for a replacement for almost four months.Shares in the lender, which emerged from bankruptcy in December, fell 0.5 per cent to $30.61.Etrade Financial, the online share trading broker, announced that it would reduce fees for stock and option trades.Low-volume traders will have to pay $9.99 instead of $12.99 while high-volume traders will continue to pay $7.99. Shares in the group rose 1.4 per cent to $1.48.In the technology sector, Motorola climbed 2.7 per cent to $6.57. Barron’s, the US weekly financial newspaper, said shares in the communications company could rise as much as 40 per cent during the coming year if the company spins off its profitable mobile phone division.Nasdaq itself weighed heavily on the S&P 500 index, falling 4 per cent to $18.05. The owner of the second-largest US equity exchange forecast higher operating expenses for this year than analysts had been expecting. The group also said profit had declined in the fourth quarter as it continued to lose market share.and suffer from a general slowdown in trading.Revenue from cash equity trading had plunged 43 per cent during the period, the group said.
572;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-02-08T14:36:14Z;Nasdaq changes direction on ‘Neuro’;;Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, on Monday conceded that the group’s decision to launch its European “multilateral trading facility” as a wholly owned venture rather than in partnership with key market participants was to blame for the platform’s failure to gain traction.“Clearly we led with low pricing and with a smart order router, and with the benefit of hindsight we probably should have led with a consortium-led effort.“It seems to be an opportune time for us to do something a little bit differently,” Mr Greifeld told analysts on a conference call.The group launched Nasdaq OMX Europe, a pan-European platform, in 2008 in competition with Chi-X Europe, Turquoise, BATS Europe and incumbent European exchanges.But it has failed to garner more than about 2 per cent of trading in FTSE 100 stocks, while its share of continental European shares is minimal.The platform, also referred to as “Neuro”, was launched as a wholly owned Nasdaq OMX business, in contrast with the approach of Chi-X and others, which sought shareholders from within the trading community, such as banks and high-frequency trading firms.Such players were important in the early stages of the other MTFs in providing “liquidity commitments”, essentially pledging to make markets in shares to help kick-start trading on the new platforms. Chi-X has about 25 per cent of the FTSE 100.Mr Greifeld said the group had changed its mind, and was now working on a consortium approach.Nasdaq OMX executives in London have been in talks with potential investors on Neuro, with a deal possible within weeks, people familiar with the matter say.Mr Greifeld said: “You need to have fundamental dealer support for your MTF and for us to get the higher levels of success we’re going to have to be that much closer to our customers. We’re working hard at making that happen.”
573;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-02-08T09:07:46Z;US exchanges;Bourses not about equities any more;How many US stock exchanges are there? Those guessing two, or even three or four, are way off. The answer is 10. By the end of this year it should be at least 13. The NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX compete with upstart alternative platforms, brokerage networks and dark pools for market share – about a third of equities trading occurs off-exchange. But there is now a second layer of fragmentation. Each group wants multiple exchange licences, enabling them to offer different pricing models.It is all about tailoring charges and rebates to attract different order flows – from retail money to the high-frequency traders providing much of the market’s liquidity. Alternative trading outfits, such as Direct Edge, won share with innovative pricing and are seeking the legitimacy of exchange status. Peer BATS, already an exchange, is launching another platform this year. Nasdaq, meanwhile, is experimenting with the exchanges it bought in Philadelphia and Boston, not just on pricing but on ways to incentivise larger trades.This type of trial and error, aiming to capture perhaps a few percentage points share, shows the ferocity of the US cash equities business. That has reduced execution costs for all traders, the largest of whom exercise considerable sway over new pricing structures. Not all ventures will succeed and four current exchanges have less than 1 per cent of trading. Even success stories can be fleeting – volumes quickly vanish once a better deal emerges.So exchange groups must look elsewhere for their rewards. Innovators such as BATS have headed to Europe and will this month enter the options market – where the incumbent, CBOE, is also planning a new exchange, C2. For the old guard, equities are merely a high-profile hook on which to hang higher-margin data, technology and derivatives businesses. Moreover, with BATS going after listings, the distinction between new and old is ever more blurred. Stock exchanges aren’t about stocks any more.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
574;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-02-07T23:02:17Z;Osaka exchange: Ambitions to recapture its glory days;;A short drive away from the Osaka Securities Exchange along the banks of the Dojima River is the site of the world’s first derivatives exchange, where Japanese merchants started trading rice futures back in 1730.The Dojima Rice Exchange is now marked by a tiny plot of land with a stone engraving and a sculpture of two children with a sheaf of rice, a monument most walk past without so much as a glance.In today’s global market, Osaka has also paled in significance since its heyday. However, Michio Yoneda, the OSE’s president, is preparing for battle to regain its position in the top-10 derivatives markets.The OSE has struggled to regain its presence in derivatives trading after regulations introduced in the early 1990s meant it lost its position as the world’s third-largest futures exchange by turnover, as trading of Nikkei futures shifted to Singapore and the asset bubble burst.It is still Japan’s largest derivatives market but languishes at 15th in the world, trailing emerging markets such as China’s Dalian and Zhengzhou Commodities Exchanges.Whether it can climb back up the rankings depends partly on the introduction of its new trading platform early next year.Developed by Nasdaq OMX, the new platform will reduce the time it takes for a trade to be completed from 60 milliseconds now to less than 10 milliseconds enabling it to compete with the Singapore exchange and other global markets.The OSE already offers a co-location service, where its members can place their servers close to the OSE’s matching engine.However, another key development for traders is that the OSE will move its matching engine from Osaka to the Tokyo metropolitan area, where the vast majority of its clients are based. Transmission between the two cities adds a further 20 milliseconds.“That [the 20 milliseconds] is a lot of time,” says Mr Yoneda. “In the past it wasn’t, but now it makes a big difference.” With the new platform, the OSE will be able to introduce more products, more quickly.A current lack of remote members is one of the obstacles to the OSE derivatives market’s growth. High tax rates plus regulations stipulating that remote members must have a board of directors has put off overseas proprietary trading houses.Instead such investors have to trade through member brokers, which increases their costs.The OSE will decide by the summer whether or not to alter its fee structure to cut costs for remote members, says Kotaro Yamazawa, a director at the exchange.The OSE is not only about derivatives trading. It also owns Japan’s largest market for small and medium-sized companies, thanks to its purchase last year of the Jasdaq start-up market. Later this year it will merge Jasdaq with its own Hercules market.Japanese start-up markets have suffered from a considerable lack of investor confidence since internet start-up Livedoor was delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s “Mothers” market in 2006 following the arrest of its founder amid charges of accounting fraud and market manipulation.Since then, the Japanese version of Sarbanes-Oxley regulations, known as J-Sox, have been brought in, which some regard as tough for small companies to meet.A combination of these two problems and lacklustre domestic economic growth over the past few years has led to a sharp decline in the number of new company listings. The market is dominated by retail investors and has a lack of liquidity that leaves many stocks subject to volatile movements.A lack of venture capital in Japan also means that many companies are small when they list, which can limit the number of investors and makes subsequent fund-raising more difficult.All this gives Mr Yoneda another significant challenge in his attempt to increase the competitive edge of the OSE. Those plans include expanding the number of analyst reports on the companies listed on his newly merged Jasdaq market from about 20 per cent of the merged market’s listed companies.“We have a three-year space [to make improvements to the market],” Mr Yoneda says. “The start-up markets need to be brought out of their fractured state and improve quality.”Mr Yoneda also plans to introduce a new Jasdaq index and, subsequently, futures and options derivatives to expand hedging and trading opportunities.The OSE may also provide investor relations services to companies listed on its market to help guide them after listing. These services would include helping them with translating financial statements into English to appeal to foreign investors.More sweeping changes are also in prospect. “The landscape of exchanges in Japan is going to change,” says Mr Yamazawa. “There will be more alliances and mergers.”
575;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-02-07T18:07:01Z;Nasdaq renews European efforts;;When chief executives clinch big deals, they often describe them as a “win-win”. But that was not good enough for Bob Greifeld, chief executive of what was in 2007 still Nasdaq.At the time, the US exchange had agreed to pay $3.7bn to buy OMX, the Swedish-based operator of bourses in the Nordic region – a “win-win-win”, he said.Three years later, the jury is still out on years of costly efforts by Nasdaq OMX, the second-largest US exchange operator, to crack Europe.They stretch back to 1996 when Nasdaq took a stake in Easdaq, a Brussels-based pan-European bourse.The acquisition of OMX was supposed to have contributed to group earnings by last year. That has not happened.Part of OMX’s initial appeal was that it was a big seller of trading technology around the world. But its own markets have been forced to cut fees by up to 40 per cent over the past two years amid competition from Chi-X Europe, a two-year-old pan-European trading venue backed by banks and market-making groups.It also faces a challenge from a smaller platform called Burgundy, launched last year by the Nordic region’s biggest banks.Europe is an important part of the group, contributing about 30 per cent of revenues.Yet Mr Greifeld will make the case to investors that efforts will soon pay off as the group unveils full-year earnings in New York on Monday.In the first of two moves, Nasdaq OMX Nordic – a network of seven exchanges comprising Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the Baltics and Iceland – will today switch over to Inet, a trading system common across the parent group’s markets.The system can get a trade done in 250 microseconds – key to attracting so-called “high-frequency” traders. To get a sense of how fast this is, Han-Ole Jochumsen, president of Nasdaq OMX Nordic, puts this in the context of a Swedish “Gripen” fighter jet flying at top speed: the aircraft would travel 16cm in that time.He says the cost to overseas users of Nasdaq OMX Nordic’s exchanges has already fallen by 80 per cent since the introduction of a post-trade process common to most exchanges known as clearing, in October. Overseas traders account for 37 per cent of trading on Nordic markets.He says the group had capped fees for large volume traders on January 1.This, combined with a reduction in so-called “tick sizes” – the increments by which a share price can move – and the launch of a new trading system, should raise volumes by 25 per cent this year.“Even if competition is tough this year, we are optimistic,” Mr Jochumsen says. “Now we are in a better competitive situation.” The introduction of Inet means that the Nordic exchanges can share technology costs with the parent group’s US markets.Staff levels have been cut by 25 per cent in Sweden, Finland and Denmark, which Mr Jochumsen says should deliver “double-digit- million euro” savings by next year.The second front in Mr Greifeld’s renewed push focuses on Nasdaq OMX Europe, a small trading platform similar to Chi-X designed to take advantage of European Commission rules sparking competition between trading venues.However the platform, also known as “Neuro”, has struggled since launch last year, capturing less than 2 per cent of FTSE 100 share trading.This week, Nasdaq OMX executives will continue talks with banks and others about selling stakes in the venture. One idea would be to share revenues in return for commitments to provide liquidity – a structure that helped Chi-X get off the ground fast.Mr Jochumsen says Neuro, which already uses Inet, also should benefit from the introduction of the trading system in Nordic markets. “A lot of traders here would like to trade pan-European markets too.”
576;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-02-04T20:43:53Z;Nasdaq OMX Nordic predicts 25% volume growth;;Nasdaq OMX on Thursday said the cost to traders of using its Nordic markets would fall by 20 per cent this year if volumes grew by an expected 25 per cent following the the launch on Monday of a faster trading system and new caps on fees.The predictions come as US-based Nasdaq OMX has reached a critical moment in efforts to build a business in Europe.Its Nordic market operation has been forced to cut fees by up to 40 per cent over the past two years amid competition from Chi-X Europe, the pan-European alternative trading venue, as well as a smaller Scandinavian platform called Burgundy.Nasdaq OMX’s own pan-European alternative trading platform, Nasdaq OMX Europe, has struggled since launch last year to gain traction and has captured less than 2 per cent of FTSE 100 share trading.Nasdaq OMX also operates seven stock markets across the Nordic region in Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the Baltics and Iceland. Together, they account for about 7 per cent of all European equities trading volume.The US-based exchange operator in 2007 completed the acquisition of the former OMX group of exchanges, to form what is now Nasdaq OMX Nordic, Stockholm-based operator of the seven markets.Last month Chi-X had captured about 8.2 per cent of trading in Swedish, Finnish and Danish stocks, according to Thomson Reuters. Burgundy, which is backed by Scandinavia’s biggest banks and brokers, has 1.7 per cent of those markets.Hans-Ole Jochumsen , president of Nasdaq OMX Nordic, said costs for overseas users of the seven markets had already fallen by 80 per cent since the introduction of clearing services in October. They account for 37 per cent of trading on Nasdaq OMX Nordic markets.Previously, such traders would have to use custodians in their home markets – such as London – as well as “sub-custodians” in the Nordic region, which was “costly”, Mr Jochumsen said.He said the group had capped fees for large volume traders on January 1. This, combined with a reduction in so-called “tick sizes” – the increments by which a share price can move – and the launch of a new trading system, should raise volumes by 25 per cent this year.The fee cap should make trading free for the largest traders, Mr Jochumsen said. “Even if competition is tough this year we are optimistic. Now we are in a better competitive situation.”On Monday Nasdaq OMX will also migrate all seven markets to the Inet electronic trading system that the parent group already uses for most of its markets. The move should allow traders using Nasdaq OMX Nordic markets to cut dramatically the time it takes for trades to be done.Nasdaq OMX claims the Inet system can handle trades in 250 microseconds in some cases. Current latency at Nasdaq OMX Nordic is 2.5 milliseconds.Mr Jochumsen said that with Inet also used by Nasdaq OMX Europe, also referred to as “Neuro”, more traders would benefit on both platforms, including “high-frequency” traders interested in speed.Mr Jochumsen said: “The fact that we will be bringing better technology means a large number of new participants will now be on Inet and I think that will give some upside for Neuro.“It’s very easy for us to talk with some of the high –frequency [firms] as they are already on Inet in the US, they know the system and they can be up and running technically extremely fast,” Mr Jochumsen said.He said that Nasdaq OMX Nordic has also cut its staff costs since 2008 by 25 per cent in Sweden, Denmark and Finland, delivering savings approaching the “double digit millions of euros” by the middle of next year.
577;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-02-01T01:33:37Z;Row leaves Zagreb exchange in limbo;;A stalemate between shareholders has left the Zagreb Stock Exchange (ZSE) – the largest in the fractured Balkan region – without a chief executive and unable to move ahead on integration plans with Europe’s larger markets.Roberto Motusic, chief executive since 2006, resigned a month ago amid criticism from exchange shareholders that he had wasted money and squandered attractive takeover chances from Vienna and Warsaw.Wiener Börse, the Vienna stock exchange, has formed a network of markets around central and eastern Europe. However, the Warsaw Stock Exchange has emerged as a potential rival, outperforming the rest of the region in the last two years.The Athens exchange and the Swedish-based Nasdaq OMX also expressed unofficial interest in a Zagreb takeover, yet went no further because Mr Motusic never supplied them with requested documents, his critics say.Part of his problem was a new capital markets law, which came into force last year as part of Croatia’s rapid reforms to comply with European Union legislation. The former Yugoslav country of 4.5m people aims to join as the bloc’s 28th member in the next two years.“The new law has turned the rules upside down,” Mr Motusic said. “The activity of investors is frozen.”Regulatory paralysis compounded the impact of the global financial crisis, so that by last March, Zagreb’s market capitalisation had slipped by more than 50 per cent in only a few months, he said. But would-be buyers also took into account Croatia’s shaky overall economic performance, especially in the first half of last year, Nasdaq OMX officials said.ZSE share value had sunk by December to 8bn kuna (€1.1bn), compared to more than 17bn kuna in late 2008. Turnover for the year fell nearly 65 per cent to 10.9bn kuna, according to the ZSE website.Since the violent break-up of the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, Balkan markets have become too small – even after shedding their nationalist political baggage – for the taste of many foreign investors.Marijan Palic, a board member from a local brokerage firm, Auctor, has pushed for a sale of Zagreb’s money-losing exchange as the best way to bring Croatian stocks onto European investor radar screens. He blamed the former management for being “absolutely not ready for the new law.”Yet a new managing board, elected under the updated rules, says it has not found a qualified replacement for Mr Motusic, a former Erste bank equity executive. Two other bankers have declined to take board seats, saying brokers now hold too much sway at the exchange.The turmoil over the trading floor coincides with upheavals in the country’s main ruling party, the centre-right Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). An accelerating anti-corruption campaign has put fear in officials about bending rules.Wiener Börse holds majority stakes in three other exchanges: Budapest, Ljubljana and Prague. This year, it has formed a new holding structure called the CEE Stock Exchange Group that claims to account for two-thirds of equity trading volume in the region.However, a tentative look at the Warsaw exchange was not received warmly in Poland, which recently decided to cancel a privatisation in order to pursue an initial public offering instead.After a period of consolidation, Vienna might concentrate on expansion in Romania, Bulgaria and around the Balkans, market watchers say.
578;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-01-26T01:12:20Z;Osaka Securities Exchange seeks tie-ups;;The Osaka Securities Exchange, Japan’s largest derivatives bourse, is looking to form international alliances to become more globally competitive and would consider a capital tie-up as one of its options.The OSE last year signed a memorandum of understanding with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the largest US futures exchange, which has yet to bear fruit. Next year, the Japanese exchange will introduce a new derivatives platform developed by Nasdaq OMX.Such moves should help the exchange boost its current ranking as 15th largest futures exchange globally by volume and help Michio Yoneda, president of the OSE, to hit his target of doubling annual turnover from the current 163m contracts.The OSE has struggled to regain its presence in derivatives trading after regulations introduced in the early 1990s resulted in the bourse losing its position as the world’s third-largest futures exchange by turnover as trading of Nikkei futures shifted to Singapore. Kotaro Yamazawa, an OSE director, said there was the potential for alliances, including in product development, with both US-based markets as the OSE could offer distribution to Japanese retail investors.Japanese households have some of the highest savings in the world and have yet to get as involved in derivatives trading as neighbouring South Korea.The OSE hopes that extending trading hours into the evening might also encourage more retail trading. “Our market cap is very, very small and size means something in the exchange industry,” Mr Yamazawa said.Next year the OSE will introduce its new platform, which will complete trades in less than 10 milliseconds.The OSE also plans to move its matching engine from Osaka to Tokyo, where most of its clients are based, erasing the 20 milliseconds it takes for transmission between the two cities. That should offer further arbitrage opportunities between the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s cash equities market and the OSE’s Nikkei 225 futures and options products.“Compared with the size of the Japanese economy, [derivatives trading is] really small. We have to meet the needs of this latent demand. So dealing with the system, [more] products, the length of the trading sessions we can rise into the top nine exchanges,” Mr Yoneda said.The OSE also wants to attract more overseas trading activity. It has already introduced “remote membership”, which allows overseas investors to trade on the bourse without having a business in Japan.
579;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-01-25T11:04:52Z;Quick View: You’re kidding, more US exchanges?;;"You’ve got to be kidding: four new exchanges are set for launch in the US this year?Such was the news out of the Security Traders Association of Chicago meeting last Friday. Surely the whole problem with markets these days is that there are too many exchanges and trading platforms chasing persistently low volumes?Apparently not. Direct Edge, the alternative platform that has captured about 10 per cent of US equities trading, said it expected regulatory approval to become an exchange operator next month. It plans to launch two stock exchanges in late April or in May, according to Bryan Harkins, head of sales and strategy.Its main rival, BATS Global Markets – which has grabbed about the same US equities market share – expects to launch an options exchange next month. (In fairness, the US options business has been doing well of late so you can see why it wants in on the action.)Most interesting of all, Nasdaq OMX said it expected to file for regulatory approval for its third – you heard right: third – US stock trading platform within a month.There are different reasons for launching these new platforms. The BATS and Direct Edge moves can be partly explained by their desire to become fully-fledged exchanges, which means competing on a level playing field with NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX when it comes to how orders are handled.It is also a step towards the convergence of automated trading systems and exchanges, a subject I dealt with in an earlier posting.But Nasdaq OMX’s third exchange licence is more intriguing. It is about two things: dark pools and block trading; and experimenting with “tiered” fee structures to try and attract as many types of trader as possible.At the moment Nasdaq OMX operates the Nasdaq main market, which has been around for years, and a second exchange known as Nasdaq OMX BX, which was launched in January last year – essentially the Boston Stock Exchange, re-incarnated since the New York operator’s purchase of its smaller rival.The Nasdaq main market has operated a fee structure that rewards traders for posting orders and charges those who come in and match those orders– a so-called “maker-taker” model, tilted in favour of rewards for posters of orders.Nasdaq OMX BX took a different tack, starting out rewarding traders who posted orders - a so-called “inverted pricing” model - but then changed tack in nine months later, switching to a different model where traders coming in and matching orders get charged 1 cent per 100 shares, while liquidity makers are charged 3 cents per 100 shares.Experimenting with fees and incentives like this is something that all platforms are struggling with as they try and figure out how to balance paying rewards to attract order flow with the need to charge fees to generate revenue.Nasdaq OMX has been experimenting with fees that target traders that are interested in getting orders done as fast as possible, beating others to the head of the queue – the so-called “price-time” scenario.But along comes Nasdaq’s third platform, which will be based on the old Philadelphia Stock Exchange, acquired by Nasdaq OMX in 2008.Here, the idea is to provide a venue for people who want to get larger orders done – such as block trades. At the moment “dark pools” are supposed to be providing this sort of service, but “algo” and high-frequency trading has sliced orders in dark pools into small sizes, making it hard to get blocks done as blocks (for those who want that).Nasdaq’s idea with the Philly licence is to create a “price size” model, with its own fees structure, to attract liquidity away from dark pools.Thus, Nasdaq OMX will end up with three types of market, each designed to appeal to three distinct types of trader or liquidity provider. The rationale is that this is a more effective way of attracting different kinds of market participant than trying to offer multiple fee structures mixed up within a single platform.The London Stock Exchange learned that lesson last year. It has decided that this mixed-in-one-platform approach doesn’t work. Last year Xavier Rolet, shortly after becoming chief executive, returned the exchange to a simple volume discount system, sweeping aside a complicated fee structure that had combined rewards for high-frequency players and volume discounts for more traditional users – like the banks.Hard to tell whether the three-tiered Nasdaq OMX approach will work. For Nasdaq OMX’s sake, it had better: they paid handsomely to acquire both Boston and Philly, so shareholders will want to see them sweating those assets soon."
580;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-01-24T22:30:48Z;BATS Europe to offer ‘smart order routing’ for shares;;BATS Europe, one of five share dealing venues battling Europe’s established bourses, is set to offer traders a new service that seeks out where their orders are most likely to find a match on both the region’s multiple “dark pools” or standard trading platforms.The move makes US-based BATS the second of the region’s small trading venues to offer such a “smart order routing” service after Nasdaq OMX Europe, a rival platform owned by Nasdaq OMX, the transatlantic exchange.Smart order routing is a service commonly offered by brokers and banks as a way of encouraging investors to place more orders with them.Smart order routing has grown in popularity in Europe as the number of trading venues has proliferated in the wake of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, which broke exchanges’ monopolies in 2007.It uses technology that scans multiple pools of liquidity, identifying where the best price for a particular share is likely to be found. It also helps ascertain where large orders can easily be done, and can split orders into smaller sizes and seek the best venues for them to be matched, often within a matter of seconds.The BATS move shows that the lines are blurring between the role of brokers in seeking out the best deals for investors, and exchanges and trading platforms, traditionally only recipients of orders from brokers. It also shows that the platforms to which orders are routed by such technology are themselves offering the same service as a way to attract more orders.That is because complete orders – made up of thousands of shares – are often not filled completely at any given venue. Any exchange or trading platform that is able to find matches for any unfilled orders by “order routing” them away to other venues – even rival ones – are seen as offering a valuable service.Like Nasdaq OMX Europe, BATS Europe will charge a fee for its smart order routing service, which will be launched on February 15.The new service is “designed to give BATS Europe’s market participants even more choice for deploying their trading strategies whilst minimising market access complexities”, said Mark Hemsley, BATS Europe chief executive. BATS Europe was launched less than 15 months ago and has captured almost 8 per cent of trading in FTSE 100 stocks.
581;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Exchanges face threat from loss of liquidity;;"While banks would be clear losers, the effects would also be immediately felt down the entire food chain of the trading world.Liquidity on stock and derivatives exchanges would shrink in the short term, meaning there would be a smaller pool of trading activity in which participants get deals done. The same would apply to the off-exchanges markets.That could hit the valuations of publicly listed exchanges that derive much of their volume from proprietary trading activity – such as the CME Group, the US options exchanges, NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX. The same would apply to smaller platforms such as BATS Exchange and ELX Futures.Larry Tabb, founder of the Tabb Group, a New York-based consultancy, said: “It’s certainly going to harm liquidity. You have a series of players in the market who are no longer going to provide liquidity.”However, some believe that would not last long, as traders regrouped outside banks and set up their own “prop shops”. Christian Katz, chief executive of SIX Swiss Exchange, and a former Goldman Sachs banker, says: “The net effect, longer term, could be neutral; it doesn’t have to be a collapse.”However, any immediate exit could benefit hedge funds and independently operated proprietary trading firms – including “high-frequency” trading firms.Joe Gawronski, president of Rosenblatt Securities, said: “If this [ban] were to happen there would be less capital chasing the same finite number of trading opportunities, which would benefit any independently operated prop fund.”For high-frequency firms, there could even be added market-making opportunities, though banks would still be allowed to do proprietary trading if it was related to their customer business. Banks’ trading operations will often take on significant positions in certain financial instruments to provide clients with trading in those instruments if liquidity in them elsewhere – on exchanges, or in the over-the-counter markets – is lacking. That is seen as a form of market-making and appears to have survived the clampdown on proprietary trading.High-frequency and other proprietary traders are unlikely to feel comfortable with the intense pressure now being applied on banks over their trading activities. One trading platform executive said: “My fear is that this would be the first step. First the banks, then HFT [high frequency trading] firms.”"

However, we are still a long way off the high seen in 2007 as trading volumes are still not where they were.”The best overall performer was BM&F Bovespa, the multi-asset exchange formed by the merger of Brazil’s derivatives and stock exchanges in May 2008, with 172 per cent increase in share price over the year.The Brazilian exchange last year completed an overhaul of its trading systems to attract overseas institutional traders, closing its “open outcry” pits and boosting the capacity of its electronic trading system. It opened a London office last month.The worst performer was Nasdaq OMX, owner of the transatlantic exchange, with a 20 per cent fall in its share price.Mr Skeete said: “Established exchanges will continue to battle with the new players and will need to adapt to continue to prosper. In Asia, we are going to see the competitive environment increase as new entrants make a push into centre stage and the latest trading technologies spread beyond the major Asia exchanges.”The index was established in 2000 as a joint venture between the FTSE Group and Mondo Visione, a UK-based exchanges research company.
583;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
584;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2010-01-06T18:59:31Z;Edmonds steps down as IDCG chief;;The International Derivatives Clearing Group (IDCG), a clearing subsidiary of Nasdaq OMX, on Wednesday announced the surprise departure of Chris Edmonds as chief executive, replacing him with Garry O’Connor.Mr Edmonds had stepped down to “pursue other opportunities”.IDCG is attempting to carve out a presence in the clearing of interest rate swaps, the largest part of the OTC derivatives market along with foreign exchange swaps. However, IDCG has cleared very few interest rate swaps so far.Mr O’Connor previously served as chief product officer for IDCG. He told FT Trading Room: “In the past twelve months, IDCG has gone from a concept to operational reality, but the task is to turn that into a commercial reality.”Interest rate swaps are by far the largest over-the-counter derivative market, with a notional amount outstanding of $341,000bn according to the Bank of International Settlements. Regulators in the US and Europe are pushing for central clearing of OTC derivatives.LCH.Clearnet started clearing interest rate swaps 10 years ago through its SwapClear business. It began operating a live clearing service for buy-side investors last month, while the CME is also attempting to start clearing interest rate swaps.The IDCG independently operates a clearing service for interest rate swap futures contracts and began accepting US dollar denominated interest rate swap futures contracts for clearing and settlement at the end of December in 2008 after it was granted a licence by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Since then, IDCG has issued statements about what it has “shadow cleared” - or cleared on a simulated basis - for around 22 market participants such as hedge funds, banks and fund managers. In terms of live clearing, only a small amount has been transacted and to date IDCG has signed up only one Futures Clearing Merchant (FCM): MF Global.“We need a critical mass of members for clearing and having one FCM is not enough in order to achieve commercial success,” said Mr O’Connor. “We need several more FCM’s.”“The benefit of shadow clearing is that it provides people with an opportunity to familiarise themselves with our system and it also enables us to test out operational efficiency,” he added.Additional reporting by Jeremy Grant in London
585;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Dubai Financial Market buys Nasdaq Dubai;;Dubai Financial Market said on Tuesday it would buy Nasdaq Dubai, its less successful international-focused rival, as the Gulf emirate seeks to take on regional bourses amid its continuing debt crisis.Essa Kazim, DFM chief executive, said the $121m deal had been made on a commercial basis to generate cost and revenues synergies. It has been approved by DFM’s majority shareholder, government-owned Borse Dubai, and Nasdaq OMX, which owns one-third of Nasdaq Dubai. Borse Dubai owns the remaining two-thirds.The move towards a merged platform, which should be completed by the end of next year, will combine the liquidity enjoyed by the retail-dominated bourse with the institutional-focused Nasdaq Dubai, which launched as the Dubai International Financial Exchange in 2005 but has failed to attract a critical mass of traders and listings.“Linking the platform to the retail base of the DFM will be huge for Nasdaq Dubai – if we can bring the velocity we enjoy to companies listed on Nasdaq Dubai, there will be a big revenue synergy,” Mr Kazim told the Financial Times.Mr Kazim said consolidation of the platform would make progress by the end of the first quarter and included plans to create joint clearing and depository houses. Nasdaq will allow the exchanges to use its technology, which should produce 50 per cent cost savings, he said.The merger is a further move in a regional exchanges race that has seen NYSE Euronext join forces with the government in Doha to launch Qatar Exchange, and similar moves in Abu Dhabi and Bahrain. The region’s biggest exchange, in Saudi Arabia, limits overseas involvement.The consolidation also reflects Dubai’s plans to streamline its business lines, triggering mergers across its real estate and investment arms amid the recession in the emirate, which faces debts of as much as $100bn. Abu Dhabi last week agreed to a $10bn bail-out to help the restructuring of government conglomerate Dubai World.DFM’s half-million retail investors will eventually be able to use their own accounts to trade, creating greater liquidity for Nasdaq Dubai. The exchange has seen some big company listings, including that of DP World, the ports operator, but volumes have been disappointing.As one of its reforms to boost liquidity, Nasdaq Dubai has opened up to retail investors via local brokerages, but practical barriers remain and there are hopes that a more unified platform will boost volumes.“The combination of the two Dubai exchanges has long been seen as a preferred way forward,” said Adena Friedman, chief financial officer of Nasdaq OMX. “It will create greater efficiencies from a systems perspective, enabling retail investors to better access Nasdaq Dubai and providing issuers with a choice of commercial and regulatory structures.”DFM and Nasdaq Dubai had already begun consolidating back office functions, but the local exchange – which is 20 per cent publicly owned – feared that consolidation without a change in ownership structure would merely leak value to its younger sister entity.By owning Nasdaq Dubai, that obstacle has been removed, said Mr Kazim. New companies seeking a Dubai listing would be able to choose between the two exchanges but benefit from DFM’s liquidity.Under the terms of the transaction, planned for completion in six weeks, DFM will pay $102m in cash and $40m in shares to Borse Dubai and Nasdaq OMX. The US-based exchanges operator will also take a 1 per cent stake in DFM, valued on Tuesday at about $41m.DFM hired as its advisor Goldman Sachs, which came up with the valuation of Nasdaq Dubai.Mr Kazim said the deal would help generate future expansion for DFM. He added that $121m was a fair price and noted that it was less than the $150m valuation put on the company when Nasdaq OMX completed its investment in the exchange in February 2008, as part of a complex takeover of Scandinavian operator OMX Group.Nasdaq OMX said its initial $50m cash investment, plus technology and trademark rights, was in 2008 valued at $128m and had a current carry value of $120m.Nasdaq Dubai is the only operating derivatives exchange in the region and has a large market for Islamic bonds, or sukuk.Both exchanges will retain distinct identities and operate under existing management, with essential staff to be retained, Mr Kazmin said. He would not rule out redundancies as the companies pursue consolidation, but said most cost savings would be derived from a unified technology base.DFM would continue to be regulated by the UAE’s securities and commodities authority with Nasdaq Dubai regulated by the Dubai International Financial Centre’s regulatory body, the Dubai Financial Services Authority.

With the London Stock Exchange set to absorb Turquoise, the share trading platform, the UK bourse can worry a little less about competitors snapping at its heels.The nine banks that created Turquoise in 2006 as a way of forcing the LSE to lower its fees are now part of a joint venture with the exchange that will compete with the remaining six “multilateral trading facilities” left in Europe.They are Chi-X Europe, BATS Europe, Nasdaq OMX Europe, NYSE Arca Europe, Hungary-based Quote MTF and Equiduct, controlled by Citadel Securities of Chicago. Collectively they still account for more than 30 per cent of trading in the FTSE 100. But with share trading volumes still well below pre-crisis levels, and only Chi-X scraping a profit in October there are doubts over how long the markets can support the remaining six platforms.That is especially true now that the market has a clearer idea of what an MTF is worth. The numbers involved in the Turquoise deal show that the answer is “not much”.Last year, Turquoise posted a pre-tax loss of £15.7m. Small wonder that the LSE ended up paying nothing for the platform. It will invest £25m ($40m) in developing a joint venture in which it has a 60 per cent stake. Turquoise’s shareholders, in turn, no longer have to keep funding the Turquoise platform.In addition, there could still be too many platforms chasing scarce volumes. Volumes are unlikely to rise to anything like pre-crisis levels, according to some analysts.Christian Blaabjerg, head of equities at Saxo Bank, believes that the prospect of higher bank capital requirements next year will restrict trading activity by banks.“Politicians will not allow another banking crisis to evolve and one of the tools they have to stem this will be higher capital requirements and, all other things being equal, that points to lower volumes,” he says.Making matters worse, the proliferation of share trading venues in the wake of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive – enacted by Brussels in 2007 – has cut trading fees across Europe as venues have fought for customers. That has turned share trading into a low-margin business.Yet at the same time the emergence of so-called “high-frequency” trading firms should ensure that there will be no return to the pre-Mifid days where all trading took place on national exchanges such as the LSE.Such firms thrive on trying to eke out profits by trading on the differences between platforms such as fees and the speed of trading systems. The more trading venues there are, the more such so-called “arbitrage” opportunities there are. That is why they have backed some of the MTFs. Getco and Optiver, respectively based in Chicago and Amsterdam, are shareholders in Chi-X Europe, while Getco holds shares in BATS Europe.However James Chrispin, a director in the financial services consulting practice at PwC, says: “At the end of the day it’s a margin business and if part of that margin has to be absorbed in supporting MTFs then the business model doesn’t work.

588;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-12-18T16:37:19Z;Quick View: BATS and the big exchange dilemma;;"Is it possible that the next corporate giant – like a Microsoft – could start life as a publicly listed company on a platform launched by a bunch of tech dudes from Kansas City?The idea is not far-fetched. This week BATS Exchange, a share trading platform launched only three years ago out of the Midwest, said it planned to offer a company listings business from early next year.That would pit BATS against the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq – combined home to more global company initial public offerings than anywhere else.BATS is better known as an upstart platform that has captured 10 per cent of cash equities trading in the US. But IPOs offerings?BATS has done well so far to capture market share in US cash equities. But charging fees for executing trades has become a commoditised, low-margin business amid intense competition. The arrival of high-frequency traders, which harvest “rebates” provided by platforms to encourage them to trade, has become an added drain on operational costs at both exchanges and smaller rivals.Trading volumes are still well below pre-crisis levels. And in Europe, BATS’s operation surely can not afford for much longer to offer generous incentives to lure traders to its nascent “multilateral trading facility”, which is competing against the London Stock Exchange and rivals’ MTFs.All this means that any business set up as an execution venue for cash equities – like BATS – must diversify into other businesses and asset classes – and fast. Hence BATS’s announcement a few months ago that it is moving into US options trading. Its plan to go into the listings business should be seen in the same light.In effect, BATS is building a business that looks more like a traditional exchange, with a primary listings business supporting the secondary trading that sits below it.Unfortunately for businesses like BATS, the big exchanges are way ahead of them in diversifying their revenues. Some facts: US cash equities trading accounts for only 9 per cent of NYSE Euronext’s group revenues; derivatives – mainly its NYSE Liffe unit – accounts for 30 per cent; and listings is only 16 per cent.The picture is the same in London. The LSE derives only 18 per cent of its revenues from UK cash equities trading. Clearing, settlement and custody makes up 19 per cent. Xavier Rolet, chief executive, wants that trend to continue and has plans to build a derivatives business – hence its decision to launch options on the FTSE index next year.The challenging economics of the cash equities trading business are forcing MTFs in Europe to think about diversifying too, just as BATS is in the US. Chi-X is studying other asset classes and seems likely to announce new projects early next year now that its has a new chief executive.Does that mean BATS has a problem? No. The one big advantage that businesses like BATS have is that they are ultra low-cost. BATS employs only 98 staff. It runs all of its technology out of Kansas City, where office space is $17-$18 per square foot – a fraction of the cost of renting New York City office space.The challenge for BATS and the like will be to diversify faster than their core business is commoditised. But equally the challenge for exchanges like NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX will be to take the axe to their cost bases faster than their smaller rivals can show how an exchange should really be run."

It also currently executes 8 per cent of shares traded on the FTSE 100.The growth of BATS has eroded some of the market share previously held by the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.Now, BATS plans to challenge the listings market, which is still the domain of NYSE and Nasdaq.Analysts estimate proceeds from initial public offerings account for between 15 per cent and 25 per cent of overall revenues at NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX.“Based on feedback from our members, investors and the investment community, we believe there is an incredible opportunity to compete in the listings business and satisfy unmet needs of current and future public companies and exchange-traded funds in the US,” said Joe Ratterman, chief executive of BATS Exchange.The move by BATS comes at a time when analysts expect the number of IPOs could rise sharply next year.So far this year there has been $25.7bn in US IPOs, after $30.7bn in 2008. These represent the lowest levels since 2003 and are down from more than $50bn in 2007 and 2006, according to Dealogic.As BATS has rapidly gained market share, it has increasingly sought to compete with the big two established exchanges.“BATS are definitely a force to be reckoned with and this is all part of the battle among exchanges,” said Paul Zubulake, senior analyst at Aite Group.The company is privately held and is majority owned by brokers and big banks including Getco, Wedbush, Lime, Citi, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan.In August 2008, BATS was approved to launch its own stock exchange, and it filed rules with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch US equity options trading and a second US equities exchange, which are expected to start operating early next year.Mr Ratterman said: “We felt it was important for BATS Exchange to help our customers find solutions to their capital needs.”
590;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-12-01T19:52:25Z;Knight launches into carbon trading;;Knight Capital Group, one of the largest US brokers, announced on Monday it is to start a carbon trading business and has appointed Daniel Braun to lead the efforts.The move is a sign of increasing importance of carbon as a tradable commodity. The carbon trading market was worth about $126bn (€86 bn) last year, around double its 2007 figure, according to the World Bank’s “State and Trends of the Carbon Market 2009” report.Based in New Jersey, Knight is involved in providing market-access and trade-execution services across a number of asset classes including equities, fixed income, foreign exchange, futures, options – and now carbon.The company claims to handle more US equities trades daily than either the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq.Thomas Joyce, chairman and chief executive officer of Knight, said that while carbon had emerged as a tradable commodity, “the global carbon markets …are still maturing. For carbon trading to achieve critical mass will require innovative trading technologies and multiple, liquid marketplaces.”The company sees carbon trading as a logical extension to its global portfolio.Mr Braun said: ”In the US, the carbon trading market is not as developed as it is in Europe right now. A lot of the large institutional players are waiting for legislation to come through Congress.”“The expectation is that the next election cycle will be longer than usual. If cap and trade cannot be debated by the spring, the legislation will most likely be pushed until after the next election.”Mr Braun has taken up the newly created position of managing director, head of carbon trading. He will report directly to Mr Joyce and be responsible for developing Knight’s global carbon market capabilities. By the end of next year, he expects to have a team of three to five working for him.Prior to joining Knight, Mr Braun was an adviser on carbon credit development and trading issues. Before that he was a portfolio manager and director of global environmental finance at Stark Investments, an asset management firm.Alexandra Galin, manager of policy and working groups at the Carbon Markets and Investors Association (CMIA), an international trade association representing service providers to the global carbon markets, said: “The entry of Knight Capital Group into the carbon space is welcome news to the industry. Particularly as we move toward a global carbon market, institutions that are participating from outside the EU ETS [emissions trading schemes] will be important in assisting the transition.”Mr Braun said: ”You are going to see carbon become an extraordinary asset class in the next ten to twelve years.”
591;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-11-30T19:02:08Z;Poland scraps sale of Warsaw exchange;;Poland’s treasury ministry has halted talks with Deutsche Börse over the sale of the Warsaw stock exchange after the German group declined a request to amend its bid.Failure of the talks with Deutsche Börse is a blow to Poland’s efforts to cement Warsaw’s position as central Europe’s largest exchange through a partnership with a leading international exchange group. It leaves Poland considering whether to resurrect plans to privatise the bourse through a domestic initial public offering.Deutsche Börse, operator of the Frankfurt stock exchange and Europe’s biggest exchange group in terms of market capitalisation, had submitted the only binding offer for a majority stake in the WSE after three other international exchanges – the London Stock Exchange, Nasdaq OMX and NYSE Euronext – declined an invitation to bid. But the German group did not respond to a request last week by the Polish government for extra guarantees, including that the WSE retain a high level of autonomy and that the exchange’s best listings not migrate to Frankfurt.The two sides were also thought to be well apart in terms of the price they attached to the WSE.On Monday Deutsche Börse said it declined to amend its bid, the terms of which were not revealed, after saying it “submitted a bid based on a fair market value and a clear assignment of competency”.Maciej Wewior, a Polish treasury spokesman, said in a statement: “That means an end to the process according to the currently adopted strategy,” adding that a key criterion for the government is ensuring the WSE becomes central Europe’s leading exchange.The Polish treasury, which owns 98 per cent of the WSE, is now thinking about returning to an earlier proposal, and selling the exchange by listing it on the exchange itself. That is an approach favoured by local brokers and investors, who had worried about the danger of seeing Warsaw’s business migrate elsewhere.Maria Dobrowolska, the head of Poland’s Chamber of Brokerage Houses, said: “The acquisition of a controlling share by a branch investor creates a large risk of the marginalisation of our exchange …A key matter for the future development of Poland’s capital markets is the privatisation of the WSE with the significant participation of local financial institutions.”
592;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-11-18T23:12:48Z;Poland sets conditions on bourse privatisation;;The Polish government is seeking extra guarantees from Deutsche Börse after it submitted the only binding bid in the privatisation of a majority stake in the Warsaw Stock Exchange.Poland is setting conditions on the deal to ensure that Warsaw’s new partner does not draw away trading in the exchange’s best listings but instead continues developing it as the largest bourse in the new European Union member states of central and eastern Europe.“I’ve introduced a set of conditions for the privatisation of the exchange. If the investor is unable to fulfil them, I will not move to privatise just for the sake of privatisation,” Aleksander Grad, treasury minister, said in an interview with the Polska The Times newspaper.The treasury ministry has sent a list of questions back to the German exchange, its spokesman confirmed on Wednesday.These are believed to focus on the ministry’s concerns that Warsaw retains its autonomy and remains the centre for decision-making about Polish stocks.The ministry is also thought to be seeking guarantees that Deutsche Börse keep its investment for 10 years and that the promised initial public offering of the exchange takes place in Warsaw.The value of the deal is not such a critical concern for the government but one source said there was also a gap between the two sides on price.“One side wants a top price and the other side has another sum in mind,” said the source, familiar with the contacts between the Polish government and the German exchange group.The WSE is estimated by analysts to be worth more than 1bn zlotys ($366m). The exchange earned 81m zlotys last year, and Ludwik Sobolewski, its president, expects it to better that result this year.The WSE plays an enormous symbolic role in Polish capitalism.It was one of the first market institutions set up after the fall of Communism in 1989, and started trading in 1991 in the building that used to house the Communist Party’s central committee.However, Warsaw’s state ownership proved to be an insurmountable hurdle when the WSE tried to buy other central European exchanges, leaving the way open for the Vienna Stock Exchange, Warsaw’s largest regional rival.Instead, Mr Sobolewski has been trying to woo central European companies to list on the WSE, with some success.Therefore the government decided that for Warsaw to continue growing – it recently passed Vienna as central Europe’s largest exchange – it will need a partner.“Our goal is for the Warsaw exchange to become a central exchange for our region. For that to happen, it has to have the appropriate investor who will have the same goal as us and will want to build Warsaw’s position,” says Mr Grad.Four international exchanges were invited to take part in the bidding for the WSE – Deutsche Börse, Nasdaq OMX, the NYSE Euronext, and the London Stock Exchange.London dropped out before the end of the process, and only the Frankfurt exchange submitted a binding offer.For Deutsche Börse, buying Warsaw would create an opportunity for obvious synergies in terms of using common trading infrastructure and technology.However, there are a host of issues complicating the potential sale. One problem is that the exchanges use different trading platforms. Deutsche Börse uses Xetra, which is also used by Vienna, while Warsaw uses Warset, a platform similar to that used in Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam.
593;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-11-18T16:41:23Z;Regulatory weakness blocks Qatar’s regional ambitions;;The battle between Gulf exchanges heated up this year when the Qatari stock market launched its long-awaited partnership with NYSE Euronext, the international operator.In June, the Doha Securities Market was rebranded as the Qatar Exchange, a joint venture between an investment arm of the country’s sovereign wealth fund and Euronext, which took a 20 per cent stake for $200m.However, while Qatar’s economy is one of the most robust in the world, the exchange’s ambitions to become the region’s dominant trading hub face fierce competition.Dubai has kept its status as the pre-eminent centre, despite the crisis, and already has its own joint venture with Nasdaq. Oil-rich Abu Dhabi has a comparably ambitious exchange, and Financial Technologies, an Indian operator involved in one of Dubai’s commodities exchanges, is launching a market in Bahrain. Saudi Arabia, the Arab world’s largest stock market and economy, is slowly opening up and modernising.Meanwhile, Arab stock markets have lost some of their lustre. MSCI Barra’s Arabian Markets Index remains relatively flat compared with 12 months ago, lagging far behind emerging markets which have powered to a 70 per cent gain over the same period.The Qatar Exchange’s market capitalisation of about $88bn makes it small by international standards, but the third largest in the region, after Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.Still, the United Arab Emirates has three exchanges – two onshore and one offshore, Nasdaq Dubai – that together dwarf the Qatari stock market.Nonetheless, André Went, its new chief executive, is confident the exchange will manage to elbow its way to the top of the bourse pile. “We definitely have ambitions to become an international and regional platform able to attract the other companies from the Gulf, and potentially from Europe and the US as well,” he says.“NYSE Euronext is here for the longer term, and a lot of focus will be on using the expertise and their knowledge to develop the market into an internationally competitive one.”The plan is to first roll out its Universal Trading Platform technology by next September, before introducing more brokers and new products such as conventional and Islamic bonds, and exchange-traded funds, Mr Went says.Once liquidity on the cash equities side is improved, the exchange plans to introduce clearing, which will enable the use of derivative products such as options and futures, probably in 2011, he says.However, senior bankers and asset managers are less convinced. While NYSE Euronext’s technology is lauded, the paucity and weakness of the regulatory architecture will continue to prevent serious improvements of the exchange, they say. “The challenge is very much on the regulatory side, not the technology platform side,” says a senior, Qatar-based banker.“Frankly, without that being addressed it’s hard to get excited about a high technology exchange.”Similar to most countries in the region, Qatar’s regulatory framework has not kept up with its pace of development. Bankers list a litany of problems: insider trading and market manipulation are widespread, the mergers and acquisitions rulebook is weak, shorting is not permitted, transparency is poor, minority shareholders are not protected, foreign ownership is capped and there are still no laws allowing derivatives.Mr Went says the Qatar Exchange is aware that regulations will need to be overhauled, and emphasises that there is a “long-term strategy” to develop the stock market.“Regulatory reform is an important element of the targets for the next 12 months, so a number of things need to be developed and reviewed,” he says.“But the regulator …is active in addressing these issues, and …I’m quite confident that the regulation will not limit our ambitions.”The government has said it wants to unify the regulatory bodies of the country’s three main financial watchdogs – the central bank, the Qatar Financial Markets Authority and the Qatar Financial Centre Regulatory Authority – and improve its legal framework.However, reforms seem to have been paralysed since the financial crisis broke, and the merger of the three watchdogs has been quietly postponed.Yousef Kamal, the finance minister, admits there have been delays but says he is confident that the unification can be tied up in the coming months, pointing to real questions of strategy in light of the regulators’ role in the global economic meltdown.“Because of what happened, everyone was busy with the crisis, but the aim is there, the law is there, and I hope that within a few months we will have a single regulator,” he says.Meanwhile, the Qatar Exchange’s main rival, Nasdaq Dubai, though plagued by limp trading and few listings, already has a modern, western-based regulatory framework in place, has introduced the region’s first derivatives and is developing a reputation as an able watchdog.The Qatar Exchange feels that it still has the edge, however.“I think the advantage of being rooted in a domestic economy – especially an economy as strong as Qatar – is a much bigger advantage than a temporary regulatory advantage,” says Mr Went.
594;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-11-05T23:22:50Z;Nasdaq OMX highlights tariff dilemma;;The transatlantic exchange, Nasdaq OMX on Thursday highlighted how exchanges and trading platforms are struggling to balance the use of cash incentives to attract traders with a need to charge them to generate revenue as it reported an 18 per cent fall in third-quarter net income.The New York-based group said that excluding merger expenses, losses on the sale of investments and other expenses, net income fell to $89m, or 42 cents per diluted share, from $108m, or 51 cents per share, in the same quarter a year earlier.Like many exchanges and trading platforms Nasdaq has been experimenting with tariffs to maximise revenues from its core “transaction” business – that is, the fees levied on traders for carrying out trades.Until July, the group was paying rebates, or cash incentives, to posters of orders on one of its three equities markets, Nasdaq OMX BX, or the former Boston Stock Exchange, which Nasdaq bought last year.Such schemes are typically used to attract high-frequency traders that use trading strategies involving “harvesting” rebates offered by trading venues. But such “maker-taker” schemes eat into revenues derived from trading if volumes do not rise to compensate and market share fails to rise.Credit Suisse estimated that third-quarter US cash equity volumes fell 2 per cent year-on-year, and were down 13 per cent on the second quarter.Nasdaq’s share of trading in recent months has slipped amid fierce competition from BATS Exchange, Direct Edge and NYSE Euronext.On Nasdaq’s main market, the group in July lowered the amount it charges traders coming in to match posted orders. But last week it raised that fee back up again. The London Stock Exchange has also been experimenting with rebates and tariffs, and in September abandoned a rebate model aimed at high-frequency traders in favour of a blanket “volume discount” scheme.Net exchange revenues, made up of revenues less rebates and other items like clearing and exchange fees, fell by 52 per cent in the third quarter, and by 28 per cent compared with the second quarter.Bob Greifeld, chief executive, said the exchange had been losing market share throughout this year “and we were giving away money [in rebates] that was not having any impact on customer behaviour”.Nasdaq’s market share is 22 per cent, with Nasdaq OMX BX at around 3 per cent of all US equities.
595;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-11-04T16:29:54Z;Capital markets: Strong growth after slight dip;;From the perspective of Brazil’s capital markets, it is almost as if the global financial crisis never happened. The country’s main equity index has gained more than 140 per cent in dollar terms this year. Both stocks and the currency are back to their levels before the collapse of Lehman Brothers.“Brazil has been a great story,” says Alvise Marino of IDEAglobal, a New York research firm. “It may have slower growth than China, but it’s a lot easier to invest in.”Such has been the pace of recovery since the downturn at the end of last year that some have started talking about a bubble. Most analysts think it is too soon to say, but the government is taking no chances.Last month, it imposed a 2 per cent tax on foreign investments in equities and fixed income instruments. Guido Mantega, finance minister, said the tax was designed to slow the exaggerated appreciation of the real, which had gained 36 per cent against the US dollar this year before the tax was introduced.The move is unlikely to have much impact on the long-term movement of stock prices or the exchange rate. But it could reduce volatility, limiting the impact of an increase in Brazilian interest rates, for example, widely expected during the first half of next year.Modern financial engineering should have little trouble sidestepping the tax. Derivatives that deliver earnings on Brazilian assets without bringing money to Brazil can be bought for about 0.5 per cent more than buying the underlying assets – much better than 2 per cent.But one area where the tax is likely to bite is among investors in equities traded both at home and overseas. Many of Brazil’s biggest companies have shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange as American Depository Receipts, which have suddenly become more attractive.“We are under friendly fire,” says Edemir Pinto, chief executive of the BM&FBovespa, the multi-asset exchange formed by the merger of the São Paulo futures and stock exchanges.The BM&FBovespa has been working hard over the past two years to attract business from other exchanges. In terms of market capitalisation, it is already the fourth largest exchange in the world, bigger than NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX combined. It has invested heavily to facilitate direct market access – or DMA, by which big traders execute trades directly on the exchange rather than through brokers – and co-location, in which big customers may install servers inside the exchange’s premises.Brazil is also seeing a surge of algorithmic trading facilitated by “complex event processing” or CEP platforms. Software companies such as Progress Apama and StreamBase, both of the US, have sold systems to at least 15 customers in São Paulo.These platforms, which quickly became standard instruments in the US and European markets over the past couple of years, help find arbitrage opportunities between assets traded in Brazil and overseas and increase the speed and therefore competitiveness with which operators can identify and execute trades.Such advances have helped create deep and liquid markets in São Paulo, encouraging some companies to issue shares even during the crisis. In June, VisaNet, the Brazilian arm of Visa, the credit card network, raised $4.3bn, in what was Brazil’s biggest initial public offering. It was topped last month when Santander, the Spanish bank, sold 14 per cent of its Brazilian operation for $8.1bn.Abundant liquidity in São Paulo was a boon to investors during the early stages of the global crisis, enabling them to withdraw funds needed to cover losses elsewhere. It has been an important factor in attracting their return.The government’s 2 per cent tax threatens to reduce liquidity, undoing much of the BM&FBovespa’s good work, Mr Pinto says. “We didn’t need to have suffered this,” he says. “Our market was one of the first in the world to recover this year and we had the promise of more IPOs this year and spectacular growth in the first half of next year. We didn’t expect such a drastic measure.”Nevertheless, the exchange continues to work on attracting foreign business. It will soon open an office in London, adding to its presence in Shanghai and New York.Before last year’s merger, the BM&F reached an order routing agreement with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange so traders on either exchange can access products on the other. Last month the BM&FBovespa said it was discussing a similar deal on the equities side with Nasdaq OMX.
596;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-10-29T20:48:28Z;Nasdaq abandons move into clearing;;Nasdaq OMX, the transatlantic exchange group, has abandoned plans to try to break into the US equities clearing business, dealing a blow to its ambitions to expand beyond securities trading into the more lucrative post-trade business.In October last year, the group said that as a result of its acquisition of the Boston Stock Exchange, it had also acquired the Boston bourse’s clearing house, which it would rename Nasdaq Clearing Corporation and pit against the monopoly provider of US equities clearing, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC).The DTCC is a utility owned by market participants and has long been the sole provider of clearing and settlement services in US equities markets, in contrast to Europe where competition in such post-trade services is growing.However, Nasdaq said it was “suspending” its effort to launch US equities clearing and would “continue to explore the US equity clearing space for opportunities to bring benefits to the industry”.Asked why the exchange had abandoned its plans, Bethany Sherman, Nasdaq OMX spokeswoman, told the FT that the DTCC had lowered its costs in the meantime and that the “threat of competition had the desired effect”.However, Stuart Goldstein, DTCC spokesman, said the group had started cutting fees in 2006. “These efforts started before Nasdaq announced their plans to launch a clearing apparatus. We have not lowered our fees because they entered into clearing.”The DTCC had argued all along against Nasdaq offering clearing in US equities because it had no track record in risk management, an issue central to running a clearing house. Nasdaq’s clearing drive suffered a blow this year when the senior executive leading its push into clearing, Chris Concannon, left the group to join a trading firm.Nasdaq has launched other clearing initiatives, including clearing of over-the-counter interest rate swaps by International Derivatives Clearing Corporation, a recently established clearer in which Nasdaq has an 80 per cent stake. But it has yet to attract any volume in clearing interest rate swaps.Nasdaq successfully launched clearing of equities in the Nordic region this month.
597;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-10-20T15:57:48Z;Brazil: São Paulo adopts a more international approach;;"Brazil’s apparent ease in brushing off the global economic crisis has put its equities and other assets among the world’s best performers this year.The main stock index has gained 180 per cent since last November and the currency is comfortably above pre-crisis levels.Foreign investors play a leading role and the BM&FBovespa, the multi-asset exchange formed by the merger of the São Paulo futures and stock exchanges in May last year, has been working quickly to make it easier to trade Brazilian assets.By some measures, the BM&FBovespa remains an upstart. Just 400 or so companies are listed on its equities segment, for example, compared with about 3,600 on the New York Stock Exchange. But by other measures it is a giant. Its market capitalisation, at about $15.5bn, is bigger than NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX combined.“Brazil has an interesting macro story; it is a commodities-based exchange, which makes it a great hedge against global inflation,” says Bernardo Mariano of Equity Research Desk, a New York research firm that specialises in exchanges.“Add to that that they are just implementing direct market access and co-location, and this will help it expand very significantly,” says Mr Mariano.Direct market access – by which investors can make offers directly into the exchange’s trading system – has been operating on the equities side since 1999.Co-location is a process by which exchanges offer traders the chance to locate their computer servers physically in the exchange’s data centre, shaving milliseconds off the time it takes for a trade to be done.But change at the BM&FBovespa is increasingly being driven by demand for trading of equities, futures and options on one exchange – a factor that has also driven similar mergers such as the combination of the Australian Stock Exchange and Sydney Futures Exchange in 2006.While the equities segment took its time to adapt to electronic trading, recent changes have come much more quickly.In interest-rate futures contracts, one of the BM&FBovespa’s highest-volume products, it took only two months for the shift to electronic trading to take place.This compares with about nine months when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) underwent the same process with its flagship interest-rate contract in 2004.Before the equities and futures markets merged, the then-BM&F entered a strategic partnerhip with the CME in February last year, when the CME swapped 2 per cent of its own shares for 10 per cent of the BM&F. Under the deal, customers of each exchange can trade directly on the other. Trading on the BM&F via the CME’s Globex system has been rising steadily.This year the exchange launched co-location, further boosting its technology offering. And the group recently said it was in discussion with Nasdaq OMX about a “strategic, commercial and technological partnership” to develop an order-routing system similar to the one with the CME, and other developments, such as distribution of price data on the two exchanges.The announcement followed the opening this year of a BM&FBovespa office in London, adding to its overseas presence in New York and Shanghai.The exchange’s drive to establish an international presence has attracted inward investment from big brokerages.Icap and BGC Partners, two of the world’s biggest inter-dealer brokers – brokerages that specialise in trades between big market dealers rather than individual investors, typically operating with large volumes at low margins – recently bought leading Brazilian brokerages.Another opportunity for investors wanting to tap the Brazilian market’s potential for growth will come with an initial public offering expected before the end of the year by Cetip, a securities depository that offers registration, custody, settlement and other services for Brazil’s over the counter (OTC) market in fixed income instruments and derivatives.Cetip aims to raise about R$4bn ($2.3bn) by selling half of its shares. As recently as May, Advent International, a private equity fund, bought 30 per cent of Cetip for $171m.The BM&FBovespa’s own clearing house, the CLBC, acts as a central counterparty for all trades on the market’s equities segment.The CLBC was developed because, before the rapid expansion of Brazil’s capital markets over the past decade, investors would have lacked confidence to trade on the Bovespa without it.Its presence has been one driver of growth, helping trading volume on the equities segment rise to R$1,375bn last year, from R$60bn in 1994.Analysts say the BM&FBovespa still has plenty of room for growth. Corporate credit, for example, is equal to just 22 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with 160 per cent in the US.If Brazil really has put the global crisis behind it – and most analysts now expect small growth this year and anything from 4 to 7 per cent next year – the BM&FBovespa should be well placed to reap the benefits."
598;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-10-20T15:57:48Z;The tectonic plates are shifting;;All eyes in the US financial system are on Washington, as market participants wait to see how Congress and watchdogs will resculpt regulation.But for the equity options industry, the wranglings on Capitol Hill are only one of the tectonic plates shifting the market landscape.The options business is in a state of flux, says Brian Gelfand, vice-president of institutional relations and market operations at the Montreal Exchange, which owns a controlling stake in the Boston Options Exchange (Box). As well as regulation, it faces changing technology and an evolving market model.The US options market has held up relatively well in the financial crisis. Volumes so far this year are flat compared with last year, says the Options Clearing Corporation, which clears for all seven US options exchanges.But volumes could overtake last year, as trad­ing was muted in the post-Lehman world of the last two months of 2008. The trend compares favourably with the futures industry, where volumes are down about a quarter on last year.“Those figures are pretty darn good,” says Jon Najarian of OptionMonster, the Chicago-based trading consultancy. “A lot of us remember 1987, when investors got pegged so hard they shunned almost any investment vehicle – in particular, options and futures – for years. This time, they almost immediately came back in.”The impressive volume trends come at a time of great change. First, the number of exchanges looks likely to continue to grow. As recently as early 2000, there were four US options exchanges. By next year, there may be 10.Currently, nearly 60 per cent of volumes are traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and the International Securities Exchange, owned by Deutsche Börse. Both NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX operate two options exchanges. NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex have about 17 per cent market share combined, while the Nasdaq Options Market (NOM) and OMX PHLX control about 19 per cent. Box has the remaining 4 per cent.The market is set to become more fragmented next year, with the CBOE planning to launch C2, a fully electronic exchange, and Bats Global Markets, the US-based share trading operator, preparing to start Bats Options. Former PHLX executives are also thought to have received financial backing from Dubai to form another exchange.In part, this growth reflects increasing participation of high-frequency traders in the options market. High-speed, quantitative-trading proprietary trading houses account for some 6 per cent of trading volumes, a figure set to more than triple over the next two years, according to a report by Tabb, a research and advisory firm.However, complex options strategies tend not to migrate well to electronic trading – hence the NYSE, Nasdaq and now the CBOE’s decision to provide two platforms each to meet the needs of different customers.Alex Jacobson, the ISE’s education officer, predicts that large institutional investors such as pension funds and mutual funds will play an increasing role in the options business, given the poor returns of their conservative equity-based strategies in the past two years.Mr Jacobson recalls that when the CBOE, the US’s first options exchange, was formed in 1973, all trading was by retail investors. Now, retail customers account for 40 per cent of the market and institutions for half, with broker-dealers trading on their own accounts making up the remaining 10 per cent.“The options industry is still based around retail traders, but the market is evolving to meet the needs of institutional investors,” Mr Jacobson says.The increasingly important role of electronic traders has prompted several exchanges to adopt fee structures specifically geared to them. In recent years NYSE Arca, NOM and Box have introduced “maker-taker” pricing, a model adopted from the equities market that gives trading firms rebates for “making” liquidity by posting limit orders and charges customers for “taking” liquidity with market and marketable limit orders.After several years of using maker-taker pricing, Box has now abandoned the model after it failed to gain it significant market share. That would appear to cement the “payment for order flow” system of the bigger exchanges, in which customers trade free, but market-makers pay a fee that is redistributed back through them to pay broker-dealers for providing customer order flow.However, NOM, NYSE Arca still use the fee structure and Bats – which used aggressive maker-taker pricing to gain market share for its equity trading platform – plans to do so on its options market.One of the two fee models will ultimately triumph, says Robert Newhouse, chief executive of Ballista Securities, a broker-dealer whose Alternative Trading System brings options traders together to trade large lots.“The market will make a clear decision about which it likes better and the better model will quickly collect up to 90 per cent of the market,” he predicts. “It won’t be a long transition.”Another important development has been the “penny pilot” – a Securities and Exchange Commission initiative to quote options prices in one-cent increments as opposed to the traditional 5 cent or 10 cent jumps. The SEC launched the programme in 2007, with the aim of tightening spreads and offering better prices to retail traders.The larger options exchanges are uneasy about pennies, arguing that although it has produced tighter spreads, it has fragmented liquidity and made it hard to execute large orders.Nevertheless, the SEC has signalled a massive expansion in the penny pilot. Last month, the agency approved a NYSE proposal to add 300 new issues to the existing 63 options classes quoted in single pennies, a move that would extend the programme to 85 per cent of overall US options volume.Quoting prices in pennies has vastly increased the amount of data that electronic trading firms need to process, prompting a technology “arms race” in the options market. As well as competing on price, exchanges and market participants are having to ramp up their technology spending to keep an edge, whether on hardware services such as “co-location” or software such as data-processing systems.Exchanges may also increasingly look to make technology acquisitions to gain market share. NYSE Euronext, for example, bought Wombat, a provider of data management software, for $200m last year.Technology is also top of mind in Washington, where the SEC is considering banning “flash orders” – when exchanges allow traders’ computers to glimpse share order flows a fraction of a second before the broader market.While many in the industry are braced for a ban, the CBOE and ISE – both of which allow flash orders – are hoping the options industry will be exempted.Gary Katz, ISE chief executive, argues that flash orders can give customers better prices and save them from paying fees at rival venues. He suggests that to level the playing field (and thus soothe the SEC’s concerns), flash information could be given to all market participants.The flash order issue is one of a number of regulatory proposals that could impact the industry – such as changes in short-selling rules or payment for order flow. But many in the industry remain sanguine.“If we take away flash, it’ll be challenged by something else,” Ed Tilly the CBOE’s executive vice-chairman, told a recent industry panel in New York. “We’re very inventive in creating new order types and market structures in the options business.”
599;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Sweeping changes are on the way;;Most years, when the world’s ex­changes meet to talk shop, few outsiders pay attention.This time was different. The World Federation of Exchanges gathering in Vancouver this month came almost a year after the collapse of Lehman Brothers plunged the world into financial crisis.As a result, regulators and policymakers are en­gaged in a thorough re-examination of the structure of the financial system.At the centre of that system lie market structures such as exchanges, trading platforms and the post-trade services that support them. The way they performed throughout the crisis holds lessons for policymakers as they contemplate sweeping reforms to the way markets function.William Brodsky, WFE chairman – and chief executive of the Chicago Board Options Exchange – said: “All the systems worked well – and the markets that weren’t regulated had many issues. It is our obligation as custodians of a public trust to make sure that the regulators understand what worked and what didn’t.”Exchanges have been accused, by some, of seizing on the new regulatory mood in Washington and Brussels to promote their businesses.There is probably an element of truth to this. But at the same time there is no denying the financial crisis has not only highlighted that exchanges functioned well relative to the off-exchange markets Mr Brodsky was referring to.The issue has also led to a far-reaching – and controversial – debate about how assets of many kinds should be traded.In many ways, it all boils down to transparency – or lack of it. Mary Schapiro, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, says: “During the crisis, investor confidence in the transparency of the markets, sufficiency and even the reliability of the information they were getting was shaken to the core.”Washington and Brussels have seized on the dysfunction of many parts of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets and how this exacerbated the crisis.In June, the Obama administration unveiled proposals for the reform of such markets.The US Treasury wants to regulate both derivatives dealers and derivatives markets themselves. Banks that deal in derivatives would be required to meet capital standards and margin requirements to help lower risk. To promote transparency, a comprehensive reporting and recordkeeping regime should be established for swaps.The US administration also wants to make it mandatory for all “standardised” derivative products to be cleared by a central clearing house to lower risk. Market transparency and efficiency is to be improved by “moving standardised OTC derivatives on to regulated exchanges or regulated trade execution facilities”.The European Commission has come out with similar proposals.Much of this has been cheered on by the exchanges, which have long had an uneasy competitive relationship with the much larger OTC markets. In theory they stand to benefit from any shift on-exchange.But the issue of forcing more transparency into the OTC derivatives markets has sparked scrutiny of trading practices far beyond the confines of the OTC world. The SEC has embarked what on Ms Schapiro calls an “in-depth review of multiple market structure issues given the rapid advancements in technology”.It is considering a ban on a type of order known as “flash orders”, is examining “dark pools” and high frequency trading, as well as “direct market access” and “co-location”.High-frequency trading is a form of rapid-fire trading that seeks to eke out profits from the tiniest pricing differences between assets traded on exchanges and other platforms. Critics argue that participants armed with sophisticated technology have an unfair advantage over ordinary investors.Proponents of high-frequency trading – which is done not only by such firms as Getco of Chicago and Optiver of the Netherlands, but also by banks – argue that without the liquidity they provide, investors would be worse off.They also say that technology has always given one investor an advantage over another and this is no different from how markets have always worked.Then there are “dark pools”, facilities that – in theory – allow large blocks of trades to be done, at a time when orders are getting smaller on exchanges, making it harder for many asset managers to perform large trades.These platforms add another layer of complexity to the bewildering number of trading venues. In the US, Bats Exchange and Direct Edge have challenged NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX in equities trading, while in the European Union, the “Mifid” reforms have spawned a slew of “multilateral trading facilities” such as Chi-X Europe, Turquoise and a European arm of Bats.In Europe the resulting fragmentation of liquidity has made it hard for investors to know if they are getting best prices for deals.More controversially, the growth of dark pools run by banks has sparked a war of words between exchanges in Europe and the banks. The Federation of European Securities Exchanges argues that too much share dealing has shifted on to such venues, which operate “with full opacity”.They retort that their dark pools are not only regulated but provide a service to institutional investors and provide liquidity.If the reshaping of market structure is inevitable, as concerns over transparency persist, it is also true that the financial industry and others – while accepting that more regulation is inevitable – have concerns that it could go too far.Companies worry that the push for more clearing will make it dearer to use OTC derivatives, constraining their ability to hedge fuel and commodities.Patrice Blanc, chief executive of Newedge, the world’s largest futures broker, says that: “If it does not make economic sense to clear OTC transactions nobody’s going to do it.”Ultimately, any new regulatory framework will have to balance calls for greater transparency with a need to preserve what all protagonists can agree are the best parts of the markets.Anthony Belchambers, chief executive of the Futures and Options Association, says: “This whole tension is between safety and innovation.”
600;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-10-20T15:57:48Z;US: High frequency trading dominates the debate;;"Equity trading volumes in the US are now dominated by traders using powerful computer algorithms in a practice known as high frequency trading.Concerns in some quarters that HFT could have a disproportionate influence on markets have made it part of a broad inquiry into the structure of the US equity market by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The practice is also growing rapidly in Canada and Europe.High frequency traders seek to extract tiny amounts of money by placing massive orders in the form of small parcels of trades on electronic exchanges at the NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX, BATS Exchange and Direct Edge, the main trading platforms for US listed stocks.The rise of high frequency trading reflects the big changes that have swept through the US equity market during the past decade. Before the changes, market-makers shouted orders across the trading floor and quoted prices with a difference of at least 1/8th of a dollar between buying and selling shares.“In today’s highly electronic trading environment, high frequency trading firms play the role of liquidity providers, very much like the traditional market-makers and specialists of the past, just without the perception of conflict of interest and information advantage,” says Sang Lee, managing partner at Aite Group.The move to quoting stock prices in cents, not fractions in 2001, broke the back of the old market-making system. Providers of liquidity were unwilling to quote prices for large orders, as the quoted difference or spread between buying and selling shares shrank. The size of the average trade is 250 shares, down from more than 1,000 units a decade ago.In turn, the rise of alternative trading platforms fragmented liquidity and prompted a turf battle with exchanges that paid market-makers a rebate to provide prices.By 2007, high frequency trading was surging, after a ruling by the SEC allowed firms to trade NYSE-listed shares across all other market venues.Against this backdrop, computer systems that can break down a large order into tiny slices and execute them across different trading venues at close to the speed of light has become the new way of doing business in the US equity market.The main objective of high frequency traders involves minimising risk and posting small deal sizes that enable them to move in and out of trades extremely quickly, arbitraging between spreads available on different exchanges and platforms, and even between the speed of trading available on them.As a result, they often turn over their portfolio of shares many times during the day, capturing revenues of between one-10th and two-10ths of a penny for each share traded.“High frequency traders need to trade massive volumes to make their strategies sufficiently profitable,” says a report written by Justin Schack and Joe Gawronski of Rosenblatt Securities.Among the most common strategies are: being automated market-makers; deploying a predictive approach, whereby certain changes in stocks trigger an order; and pursuing arbitrage, seeking to buy and sell shares at a profit across different platforms.The speed factor in trading is known as latency and requires constant upgrading of computer systems to stay ahead of the pack. Exchanges also provide space at their data centres for computer servers owned by high frequency traders. This “co-location” means a high frequency trading system can access prices a fraction faster than if it were located down the street, let alone in another city.“In today’s trading environment, a significant percentage of human traders has been replaced by emotionless computers,” says Mr Lee. “For active traders, anything more than a millisecond has become unacceptable.”By moving share trading out of the hands of floor traders, who had an inside look at order flows, advocates of electronic systems say it has become fairer. They also argue that high frequency trading keeps buy and sell prices close together, which benefits all investors.It is estimated that high frequency trading accounts for as much as 70 per cent of daily US share trading, up from about 30 per cent a few years ago.Among the largest of the traders are hedge funds Citadel Investment Group, DE Shaw & Co. and Renaissance Technologies. Meanwhile, automated brokerages including Getco, Hudson River Trading, Wolverine Trading and RGM Advisors are active.At a recent panel discussion in New York, held by Aite Group, Richard Gorelick, chief operating officer at RGM Advisors, said it was incumbent on the industry to participate in the debate over high frequency trading and get out and explain what it does.“HFT firms are making real profits on real trading,” says the Rosenblatt report. “They are not pouring dollars into assets whose value is being wildly overinflated because of largely psychological or otherwise artificial reasons.”"
601;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-10-15T21:37:45Z;LSE pulls out of bidding for Warsaw Stock Exchange;;The London Stock Exchange has pulled out of the bidding for the Warsaw Stock Exchange, leaving three remaining bidders as the Polish treasury prepares the sale of a majority stake in central Europe’s largest bourse.The withdrawal of the UK exchange leaves Deutsche Börse, NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX.One person familiar with the matter said the LSE had decided that an acquisition of the WSE would not fit with a new strategy being implemented by Xavier Rolet, the LSE’s new chief executive.Mr Rolet, who replaced Clara Furse in May, has been concentrating on cost cutting, replacing the LSE’s trading technology and the expansion of its derivatives and clearing businesses as it faces competition in FTSE share trading from rivals like Chi-X Europe.Poland is selling a majority stake in the WSE and has told bidders that they must buy at least 51 per cent.The remaining bidders have until October 28 to present their final offers to the Polish treasury, which is handling the sale.
602;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Nasdaq OMX to launch new listings platform;;Nasdaq OMX, the transatlantic exchange, late on Wednesday became the latest exchange to relax listings standards for some companies by saying it would establish a “new listing market” for companies that currently do not qualify for an exchange listing.The new platform, to be known simply as BX, would be “a modern venue for companies that aspire to list on, or return to, the Nasdaq stock market”, Nasdaq said.Nasdaq OMX said: “While BX will have basic quantitative listing standards, the exchange will require companies to comply with many of the qualitative requirements for listing on Nasdaq and other securities exchanges. In addition, transactions on this platform will be subject to a high level of real-time and post-trade market surveillance.”The move is the latest in a series by exchanges that are tweaking listings standards to try and attract as wide a range of companies as possible amid fierce competition for primary and secondary issuance. In some cases, exchanges are attempting to keep existing listings.In the US Nasdaq rival NYSE Euronext in June decided to maintain a threshold of $15m as the lowest level that a company’s market value can fall before automatically losing its listing. The previous threshold had been $25m and had been due to revert to that level after an initially temporary move down to $15m.Moves to offer tiered listings according to company size and the use of different corporate governance standards were pioneered some years ago by OTC Pink Sheets, long known for operating the “Pink Sheets” penny stock quoting venue.The operator has since launched a “premium” tier above basic penny stock standards known as OTCQX, “which includes both the elite OTCQX market tiers for strong OTC-traded companies that can satisfy financial and disclosure listing standards”, the operator says.In the UK, the Financial Services Authority last month approved a new more rigorous primary listing category for the London Stock Exchange, which will now be known as a ”premium listing” to make clear that it holds companies to higher corporate governance standards, no matter where they are based.Bob McCooey, senior vice president of Nasdaq OMX, said: “With BX we are filling a necessary need for a well-regulated listing venue for companies that otherwise would transfer to, or remain on an unregulated or lightly regulated platform.”“This platform will provide significant benefits and protections to companies and their shareholders alike.”Companies that qualify for BX will “need to meet significant qualitative listing requirements”, Nasdaq said, including having at least three independent directors, a fully independent audit committee and an independent process for oversight of executive compensation decisions.“It is expected that candidates for BX are presently trading on one of the over-the-counter venues, either the OTCBB or the ‘Pink Sheets’, or are listed on Nasdaq or another exchange and subject to being delisted,” Nasdaq said.The exchange operator said it would use its listing licence from the acquisition of The Boston Stock Exchange in September last year to launch the BX market.
603;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-10-14T09:41:36Z;Signs of recovery as Mondo Visione exchange index rises;;The share values of the world’s main listed exchanges grew by 6.4 per cent in September compared with the previous month, signalling “further signs that the sector is returning to buoyancy”, according to the FTSE Mondo Visione Exchanges Index.Sixteen of the 18 exchanges listed on the index saw growth in the past month, with BM&F Bovespa leading the charge. Its share price rose by 17.6 per cent last month, and by 65.7 per cent over the past year.Herbie Skeete, managing director of Mondo Visione, said: “It looks as though the exchange sector is beginning to return to health. Listed exchanges have been forced to engage in some significant cost cutting in order to improve performance and remain competitive.“Year to date, we are, however, seeing the recovery continue and the exchanges sector persist in outpacing the rest of the market.”The index’s worst performer was Nasdaq OMX, whose shares fell 4.1 per cent in September.Compared with September 2008, the share price of CME Group fell 17 per cent last month, that of Deutsche Börse fell by 9 per cent and the London Stock Exchange by 11 per cent.
604;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-10-09T13:23:04Z;Nasdaq OMX, Burgundy launch Nordic clearing;;"Nasdaq OMX, the transatlantic exchange and clearing group, and alternative trading platform Burgundy both on Friday launched mandatory clearing for Nordic stocks in a move described as the biggest structural change for the region’s equity markets since the start of electronic trading.Hans-Ole Jochumsen, president of Nasdaq’s Nordic operations, said the launch of central counterparty clearing (CCP) could reduce costs for cross-border traders by 70-80 per cent, encouraging increased volumes and liquidity in a region that is home to companies such as Nokia and Ericsson.Burgundy said it was providing clearing through European Multilateral Trading Facility, a small clearer 22-per cent owned by Nasdaq OMX and which already clears for Chi-X Europe and BATS Europe, two pan-European equities platforms. The rest is held by Fortis.Nordic stock exchanges were, until Friday, an outlier among leading global markets in lacking clearing.Clearing provides safeguards in the overall trading process because a clearing house acts as a buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer, even in the case of default by either party.Clearing had been operating on a voluntary basis over the summer but now becomes mandatory for the region. The new system will replace a bilateral clearing model that had worked efficiently for Nordic brokerages but involved higher costs for cross-border investors.“I’ve been in discussions over the introduction of CCP in this region for 15 years so this is a special day,” said Mr Jochumsen, whose company controls all the main Nordic stock exchanges except Oslo.“This is the biggest structural change for the Nordic equity markets since trading became electronic in the early 1990s, and I expect the introduction of CCP to have a similar increasing effect on volumes,” said Mr Jochumsen.Initially, clearing will be mandatory for only nine securities – three each in Stockholm, Copenhagen and Helsinki. If everything goes smoothly, the system will be extended to all main index stocks in the three markets later this month.“Today’s launch is a major step closer to achieving greater market liquidity and a competitive CCP model for the Nordic region,” said Jan Booij, EMCF chief executive.The system will be trialled initially on the following stocks: Danisco, H. Lundbeck, and Novozymes of Denmark; Stora Enso, Amer Sports, and Pohjola Pankki of Finland; and Alfa Laval, Securitas, and SSAB of Sweden."
605;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-10-01T04:52:36Z;H&F raises fresh $8.8bn fund;;San Francisco buy-out group Hellman & Friedman has raised a new $8.8bn fund a year after pulling back on plans for a much larger amount, in the latest sign of a partial revival among private equity firms that escaped the worst excesses of the industry’s bubble.While short of the $13bn in provisional commitments H&F first attracted before the credit crisis, the fund, due to be announced on Thursday, is among the biggest so far this year, slightly below the $9bn raised by energy investor First Reserve.Some of the industry’s biggest names, including Blackstone and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, have had to delay, scale back or scrap their fundraising plans.With a long-term focus on a few industries, including media, software, fund management and insurance, H&F’s most prominent recent investments have included digital media company DoubleClick and the Nasdaq stock market, along with European investments such as German broadcaster ProSiebenSat and fund manager Gartmore.The firm claims annual gross returns of about 40 per cent for most of its 25-year history, though these are before fees, which include a 1.5 per cent management fee and a 20 per cent share of any profits.Its most recent vehicle, an $8.4bn fund dating from 2006, is likely to return less, though it is still on course to double its investments, according to one person familiar with its strategy.The investments in its last fund were written down by 12 per cent at the end of March, according to one investor. This is better than many of its big buy-out rivals.In a sign of the upheaval among public pension funds, endowments and other traditional investors in private equity, H&F said a quarter of its earlier investors had not backed its latest fund.Foreign investors, including sovereign wealth funds, had taken up the slack and now accounted for about 40 per cent, up from 25 per cent, said Brian Powers, who was named chairman in a broader management transition.H&F said co-founder Warren Hellman, 75, would give up his role as chairman but continue as a member of its investment committee.He handed over the chief executive role to Mr Powers earlier this decade.H&F said Philip Hammarskjold would take over as chief executive and head of its investment committee.In a reflection of the growing significance of its European arm, Patrick Healy, head of its London office, would become deputy chief executive.
606;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-09-25T21:48:25Z;Transcript: View from the Top with Bob Greifeld of Nasdaq;;"Aline van Duyn, US markets editor, interviewed Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, in New York. They discussed executive compensation reform, the SEC and flash orders and acquistions and co-location. This is a transcript of that interview.Part 1: Bob Greifeld on executive compensation and IPOsFT: Welcome Mr Greifeld, and thank you for joining us.BG: It’s my pleasure.FT: There are a lot of issues on the agenda for corporate America, not least the potential reforms in healthcare, potential changes in executive compensation, potential changes to many regulations; what, of all these issues that are on the administration’s agenda, do you think will have the biggest effect on companies?BG: I believe the issues on the agenda will not have a fundamental impact on corporations’ health. Take, for example, executive compensation: a lot of the principles that are being spoken about, and principles which we support, are what’s been practiced by compensation committees for the last five or six years. So, I think that direction is a proper direction, but I think when you look at it most of that action has already happened so far today.FT: Do you mean in the sort of non-financial corporate world rather than a financial one?BG: I think that is a good question. Certainly the financial world will have a separate set of regulatory burdens put upon them, they will probably have some type of systemic regulator looking after those particular compensation practices. So, I was speaking directly to overall corporate America. I had the opportunity to speak to many heads of compensation committees, many heads of boards on our listed companies, and every one of them is using what I would call practices that were different from five or ten years ago. So, I think that will not have that large an impact. On the healthcare front I believe corporations are shouldering a large percentage of the healthcare burden towards their employees today; I actually see some upside with some of the regulatory changes and what might happen in this healthcare reform. Certainly large listed public companies, I think, have been at the forefront in providing comprehensive medical care to their employees, and I think that will hold them in good stead as we go through this period of reflection and reform.FT: So, do you think there will be an introduction of universal healthcare?BG: Well, that is an impossible question, I think you know it, because the healthcare debate is raging as we speak, there are numerous plans that have come out. I would have predicted that the Baucus plan would have been more widely accepted than it was. So, we are at a stage, as we conduct this interview, where it is impossible to predict exactly what is going to come out of the congressional process.FT: And what about government’s role more broadly? Do you think the role of the government, in the financial market it is particularly obvious, but in general government has a bigger presence than it did a year ago, how does that affect companies?BG: I certainly think the government role in the financial world will be more intensive and more comprehensive than it has been in the past. And I like to separate the financial industry from the broader industrial companies. I believe in the broader industrial companies the net impact of their operations will not be great, whatever government election happens. So, I clearly see that the government will take some additional steps with respect to guidelines or rules with respect to compensation, but I think at the end of the day most corporations have been driving towards those principles as a part of their strategic direction.FT: And what is your view about the state of the equity markets, particularly in the light of the many IPOs that we are seeing at the moment which of course have a direct affect on your business? What are you expecting for the equity markets and, in a way, for the direction of the index?BG: I like how you say many IPOs; I don’t know if I would quite that far, but we are seeing a flowering in the IPO market, we are seeing the opening of a window, we have a number of quality companies that want to come public, have been able to public, and it is our expectation that that will continue through the balance of 2009. So, that is probably the most optimistic thing I’ve said about the equity IPO market in the last 18 months, and I’m happy to say it. We are expecting two large IPOs to come public, more than two but two large ones in particular, on Nasdaq just this week. We saw in August, in the dark days of August, we had the largest number of companies file an application to list on Nasdaq in about 18 months. So, these are all positive signs.FT: You are talking about American companies, of course; because I guess more broadly much of the IPO and the listings activity seems to be coming from China, for example.BG: I’m speaking about both American and international. One of the large companies coming public this week is a Chinese company, Shanda, and we are proud to welcome it to our market. We have now over 105 companies from greater China listed on our market, so clearly it is an important part of our current market operation and will be a part of our growth operation; but we also see equally great innovation coming out of the United States. We have the battery company A123 coming public on our market today, and they are clearly pointing the path, I think, to our electric future, so we are proud to welcome them and I think they will be well received on the market.Part 2: Bob Greifeld on equity market regulationFT: In terms of the trading of shares that already exist, one of the big themes that has come up, or a theme that has come up, particularly from some politicians and some regulators, is this question whether some of the shifts in the equity markets in the last few years, which have seen the presence of much more trading generated by computer programmes, a lot of it being done at very high speeds. Is the ordinary retail investor at a disadvantage now that so much trading is done A, electronically and B, maybe off exchanges in dark pools?BG: Well, the first thing I would say is the retail investor in the market, as a whole, is more fair today than it always has been. It is important to recognise that when the markets were floor-based there were people who came to work on those floors every day who essentially had privileges, and they had privileges of having information to manage over the rest of the investors. And that was really the original flash order; the flash order originated on the trading floor. So, today you see very little of the trading is done on the floor, and the vast majority of the trading is accessible, the information, to all investors at the same time. Now, there are still pockets of darkness in our market. Sometimes there are very legitimate reasons for an order to stay dark. I’ll give you one. If somebody has a million-share order to buy or sell, it is very hard to put that order into the market at one time; it will definitely force the market to move away from that investor’s interests. So, that is one of the reasons you have some darkness in the market. But I believe the SEC will take an exhaustive look at what is the proper structure of the market, given today’s technology and today’s use of technology. As always there are areas where it can be performed, but the important point is that today retail investors, institutional investors are better served than they ever have been in the history of the US equity markets.FT: Have you been working with the SEC on some of these issues? Have they been asking you and your experts questions?BG: Yes. The SEC is clearly in information-gathering mode. I think they are talking to the broader community which is, I think, part of their mandate. But let’s also understand that a year ago the credit markets completely froze; they froze the world, they froze the world’s financial system. Now, the equity marketplace here in the US and other parts of the world work incredibly well because we are electronic, because we have electronic market participants, some that are very high frequency, who are providing liquidity to the market in both good times and bad. So, as we step back a year from now we say okay, we can see clearly that the basic plumbing, the basic infrastructure of our markets have been really remarkable. The issues we had a year ago was the tremendous volume of trading activity that came into our market. I was at the control room one of those mornings at 9:30…FT: This was back in September?BG: Yes. And our systems were redlining at 250,000 transactions per second that investors were able to do. In the credit markets you couldn’t do any; we were at 250,000 per second. So, an amazing performance by our market participants and by the markets.FT: So, you think any concerns that the high-frequency traders in some ways might suddenly pull out of the market and create a disappearance of liquidity? And people compare it potentially to situations like in 1987 when programme trading, of course, caused problems. Is that a legitimate concern, or do you feel that the experience of the last year has answered that it shouldn’t be a concern?BG: Well, one, I’m a cautious person so I would say I cannot predict the future. But we have hard facts. We lived through a perfect storm, through the credit crisis of 2008, and the electronic players in our markets were there, they made our markets as fair and as efficient as possible, so the track record is very strong.FT: Do you think that in some way the high-frequency traders or the electronic traders are getting a bad press for no real legitimate reason?BG: I think it’s a topic at the moment, and as we get through more thoughtful analysis, their value add to the markets today will be witnessed by all. It is important to understand that with respect to high-frequency trading, any trading, there is a regulatory regime that they have to fit into, so you have the ability for any class of market participants to break a regulatory rule; high frequency, low frequency, manual, you have those people. But I would say this: when you are in an electronic world the audit trail is complete, it’s thorough, and it is very easy for the regulators to see what is happening in the market. So, I myself feel a lot more comfortable having electronic players interacting with our electronic market. I know that the audit ability of that is significantly higher than other types of trading.FT: So, the fact that the SEC is looking to prevent flash orders, for example, doesn’t necessarily mean that they are going to take a similarly negative or a similar stance on dark pools, or on some of these broader other discussions about the market structure?BG: They are separate issues. The flash orders were replicating floor-based activity, so certainly that was giving privileged information to a few, just like a floor does. I believe the commission is proper, and the ruling last week is the right ruling to strike flash orders from the market place. But that is a discrete issue from others that you mentioned. High-frequency electronic trading is a broad term that talks to many of our customers who then interact with our electronic market; so not related.Part 3: Bob Greifeld on acquisitions and co-locationFT: Let’s talk a little bit about Nasdaq. Obviously in the last few years it has become a very international company, you are expanding in Europe as well as in the US, a lot of acquisitions along the way. This year, however, the Nasdaq share price has fallen, some of your rival shares have gone up, the broader market has gone up; what is your sense of what is behind that?BG: One is, I think, most of the exchange stocks have come down and our multiples have compressed. So, I think in the wake of the number of public offerings the exchanges were the darlings of the investment world for a period of time, and just as I think we were too much in favour at one point, now we probably have to live through a cycle where we have to work ourselves back to what I would say would be a fair level of credibility based on our earnings power and our growth prospects. So, we who run the business day to day can’t focus too much on that; we have to focus on the operational details and manage this business, knowing the stock price in the fullness of time will follow our actual performance. So, we think with respect to our actual performance we have more opportunities in front of us today for growth than we’ve had during my period of time at Nasdaq OMX. So, clearly over-the-counter derivatives represent an opportunity for us.FT: On the trading side?BG: First and foremost the clearing side. We feel very strongly about that. We certainly see great opportunities in Europe with the coming of MiFID. We are implementing a new paradigm in the Nordics. Between the central clearing and the new platform you are going to see a fundamental remaking of the Nordic cash marketplace; so just several of the great new initiatives that we have.FT: Do you think that more generally in this space there will be more acquisition and consolidations?BG: I think at the end of it there will be one exchange; we will all merge together.FT: One big global exchange ruling the world.BG: And one global language too.FT: And one global newspaper.BG: One global newspaper called the Financial Times, right? So, that will obviously not happen, but I say that somewhat facetiously. But the important thing to realise is an exchange has as its beating heart a transaction-processing business, and once you build the platform, the marginal cost of the next trade is very low. So, you have the ability to provide a good return to your shareholders, while providing a superior price performance to your customers. So, that is a unifying theme of our acquisitions, and I think that fundamental logic will apply in the future, and will be the prism through which we judge different opportunities.FT: Recently there was some talk about Turquoise; is that still something that you are looking at? Is that still a live situation?BG: What we have said is, with respect to Europe we are participating in the expansion of the number of competitors in the post-MiFID arrangement. We also stated very clearly, can’t be any more direct than this, that we will participate in the consolidation phase of the European equity theatre. We don’t know who that will be and, as I said before, you really have to have the perfect storm of the environments arranged for a transaction to come together. And with our discipline a transaction won has to be strategically significant, it has to accrete to our shareholders within a year. So, that is a pretty direct answer.FT: In terms of what, for some outsiders, looks like a kind of technology arms race, recently there has been some focus on this issue of co-location where people’s server sits right next to your sort of matching engine; how important is that?BG: We are in the co-location business, and I think the co-location business is a relatively important service that we offer to our customers. But I would say what is important for us in the running of that service is that we be completely fair. The SEC will regulate this business; we’ve run the business assuming that they would. So, that means that every one of our customers has equal access to the data centre, every single one of our customers pays the same rate; we have a rate card available to our customers. And we wanted to make sure within the data centre that every customer has equal access, so those closest to the matching engine don’t have any advantage, even a theoretic advantage, to someone who is 100 feet away.FT: So, you might have to slow things down, essentially?BG: We might have to give everybody the same length cable, believe it or not. That is what we’re looking at, to give everybody the same virtual 100-foot cable so everything is completely equal; we show zero favouritism to all our customers.FT: So, you can’t bid up the thing that is merely a fraction closer?BG: Exactly. When you look at it we are doing some of the math on it, you will get down below microseconds, you will approaching picoseconds of difference, so I don’t think that really matters to anybody; but we just want to take away that theoretical advantage by giving everybody the same access. So, that is our obligation. You do it that way, you do it the proper way and it is a valuable service to the market.FT: Now we’re going to play long short. The dollar?BG: Long.FT: New York real estate?BG: Short.FT: The iPhone?BG: Long.FT: Universal healthcare in the US?BG: Short.FT: Oil price?BG: Flat.FT: Dow above 10,000 soon?BG: How soon and for how long? I would say long.FT: Chicago’s Olympic bid?BG: Short.FT: New York as a financial centre compared to London?BG: Long.FT: And Chinese IPOs?BG: Long.FT: Thank you."
607;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-09-17T20:29:36Z;BATS to launch second US equities exchange;;BATS Exchange plans to launch a second US equities exchange early next year in a move to allow greater experimentation with pricing models and market structures.The exchange, which has captured around 10 per cent of US equities trading business and has emerged as an upstart rival to NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX, said it plans to file an application for a new exchange with US regulators in the coming weeks.The second exchange launch is planned in addition to BATS’ move into the US options market next year.The new exchange, called BYX, will use the same technology, location and connectivity as BATS’ existing US exchange.BATS, known for its aggressive pricing strategies, is owned by a consortium including Getco, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup.BATS has also pushed aggressively into the European equities market. BATS’ main smaller rival is Direct Edge, an electronic stock trading platform, which applied for exchange status in May.
608;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-09-14T21:54:51Z;LSE poised to acquire Sri Lankan technology company;;The London Stock Exchange is expected to announce, possibly as early as Wednesday, the acquisition of Millennium IT, a Sri Lankan trading technology company, as the group embarks on a massive upgrade of its trading platform.The move marks the biggest step yet taken by Xavier Rolet, chief executive, to dismantle the legacy of his predecessor Clara Furse. The exchange’s existing TradElect trading system was upgraded two years ago at a cost of £40m ($66m).But its capacity – that is, its ability to handle messages, or orders – significantly lags behind rivals such as Chi-X Europe, at a time when being able to absorb thousands of messages per second is essential to attracting business from algorithmic and so-called high-frequency traders.The purchase of Millennium IT, founded by Sri Lankan entrepreneur Tony Weeresinghe in 1996, is likely to cost under £50m. The LSE has £370m in loan facilities at its disposal.Millennium IT has developed, in laboratory conditions at a facility in the UK, what it claims is the fastest trading system in the world. It handles trades in 130 microseconds, compared with 250 microseconds on Nasdaq OMX, which had claimed to be the fastest based on commercial application.The Sri Lankan company won its first contract integrating systems for the Colombo Stock Exchange.Since then it has expanded rapidly to the UK – where it includes Icap, the inter-dealer broker, as a client – and the US, where it has offices in Boston and New Jersey.The company has developed a system that can handle up to 1m messages per second, compared with 20,000 available on TradElect currently. Chi-X Europe operates a system capable of handling 225,000 messages per second.Mr Rolet told the Financial Times this month that lack of capacity was holding the LSE back. “We have to [upgrade] because the technology specifications are no longer competitive and that’s impacting our ability to support volume growth,” he said.The LSE has been burdened by the cost of maintaining dozens of staff needed to run TradElect that were “in-sourced” from Accenture, the consultancy.That helped drive the LSE’s technology costs unacceptably high, in Mr Rolet’s view, to 47 per cent of the group’s total costs. The LSE is now taking direct control of its technology as it tries to recover lost ground in the technological race between exchanges.Bernstein Research estimated on Monday that the LSE could save “almost £70m” in costs as a result of staff cuts, replacing the TradElect system and migrating its MTS bond trading onto a new platform.The choice of Millennium IT highlights how some of the most innovative trading technology is emerging from the Indian sub-continent. Financial Technologies, an Indian company, provides trading systems to exchanges in the Gulf and Asia.The Sri Lankan company operates a technology “campus” on the outskirts of Colombo, complete with a cricket field and gymnasium for employees, as well as accommodation for staff working late.
609;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
610;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Bourses in data arms race;;In trading, as in computing, it pays to have the fattest “pipes” through which to send and receive data – the greater the capacity, the more data travels down the pipe and the more trades can be carried out.That explains why the London Stock Exchange is poised to announce the acquisition of a Sri Lankan technology company called Millennium IT as part of an overhaul of its trading technology.Like other exchanges, the LSE is fighting for a share of the world’s equities trading flow.Crucial to any exchange’s ability to attract that flow is its ability to absorb electronic “buy” or “sell” messages sent by traders even before they get to the point of being fulfilled. That is known as capacity, or throughput.Yet the rise of algorithmic and “high-frequency” trading has prompted an explosion in numbers of these messages, helping drive US equities volume up 120 per cent in the past three years. That is forcing exchanges into a technology arms race to stay in the game.Dirk Hoffman-Becking, analyst at Bernstein Research, says: “Historically, exchanges have set themselves up with the assumption that a [substantial] proportion of messages sent in would actually turn into trades.“Now with high frequency trading, the parameters have completely changed. You now need to be able to process huge amounts of messages to bring the order flow to you.”For the LSE, to get its hands on Millennium IT will help it to boost its capacity from 20,000 messages per second to 1m per second – a huge leap, although the technology has yet to be used commercially.Currently, the LSE is outgunned by Chi-X Europe, one of a handful of nimble trading platforms that are battling Europe’s incumbent exchanges. It can handle 225,000 messages per second.Similar capacity shifts are afoot in North America. Last week, Chi-X Canada said it had boosted the capacity of its trading platform to 175,000 messages per second – a 500 per cent increase. US-based BATS Exchange can handle 600,000 messages per second.Nasdaq OMX, the transatlantic exchange, implemented a wide-ranging upgrade in its Inet trading system, including boosting capacity to more than 1m messages per second.Rival NYSE Euronext is working on a new version of its Universal Trading Platform that will, from next month, boost capacity on its NYSE Arca equities and options platform to 300,000 messages per second from 200,000.Anthony Attia, head of the UTP programme, says: “When you have algo and high-frequency traders sending you a lot of orders, what they care about is full predictability of the exchange’s capacity to absorb these orders.”Beneficial as such developments may seem for markets, their speed raises a question: can regulators keep up?Chris Pickles, head of marketing in a division of UK telecommunications group BT that provides trading technology, says regulators tend to focus on “historical recovery” of data rather than tracking it in real time.“In fact, regulators’ ability to control this data is extremely limited. But I think that is surely what we must be aiming for – and as soon as possible.”
611;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-09-09T22:02:27Z;Nasdaq OMX steps up Oslo Børs battle;;Nasdaq OMX, the New York-based stock exchange operator, is planning to open a new competitive front against Oslo Børs, the only Nordic exchange it does not control, by launching trading in Norwegian derivatives next week.The move marks an intensification of hostilities between the exchanges, since Oslo Børs ended an alliance between the pair last year and struck an alternative deal with the London Stock Exchange.Nasdaq OMX launched a counter-attack in March by offering trading in the 25 biggest Norwegian stocks in Stockholm and it will step up competition on Monday by providing access to Norwegian derivatives.The new service signals a push by Nasdaq OMX to plug the gap left by Oslo Børs in its pan-Nordic exchange network as it seeks to build a single trading platform for the region.Nasdaq owns the main exchanges in Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland, after its acquisition of OMX last year. It owned a 6 per cent stake in Oslo Børs but sold it in June after the Norwegian exchange forged a strategic alliance with the LSE.As part of the deal, Nasdaq OMX lost its contract to supply trading technology to Oslo Børs and members of the two exchanges will lose access to each other’s derivatives products in December. From Monday, Nasdaq OMX members will be able to trade 15 Norwegian single-stock derivatives, as well as contracts based on a new index containing the 20 most traded shares on Oslo Børs.Hans-Ole Jochumsen, president of Nordic operations for Nasdaq OMX, said the new service would allow members to continue trading in Norwegian derivatives via one pan-Nordic trading platform.Mr Jochumsen said Nasdaq OMX had no option but to compete directly in the Norwegian market after its partnership with Oslo Børs broke down.“It was not our decision to break the strategic alliance with Oslo,” he told the Financial Times. “It was Oslo that made that decision to go with the London Stock Exchange so were are reacting.”Tor Arne Olsen, spokesman for Oslo Børs, said it was ready for the challenge. “We have been challenged in the equity market for a while and we are dealing with it. Now we are being attacked in the derivative market so we will have to do the right things to remain competitive.Mr Olsen said Oslo Børs did not dispute the right of Nasdaq OMX to offer Norwegian derivatives but expressed disappointment that it had chosen to do so before their partnership officially ends in December.“We were not surprised that they wanted to do this. What was a bit of a surprise was that they chose to do it now when there is still an agreement in place,” he said.
612;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-09-03T13:18:51Z;DTCC appoints former Lehman IT expert as CTO;;The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation has appointed Bridget O’Connor, a former head of technology at Lehman Brothers, as chief technology officer.One of the most important jobs in any group focused on post-trading infrastructure and services, the role means Ms O’Connor will be responsible for overseeing the networking services, processing and messaging systems, distributed systems and business continuity.DTCC said this is the infrastructure that protects the “certainty and reliability” of DTCC post-trade processing capacity, which exceeds 850m transactions in a single day. Put another way, that is nearly three times the highest peak volumes experienced by the more than 50 trading venues in the US, such as the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq OMX and electronic communications networks and alternative trading systems like BATS Exchange and Direct Edge.Ms O’Connor will report to William Aimetti, DTCC’s chief operating officer and President.Mr Aimetti said: “As our customers increasingly are headquartered in Europe as well as the US, we face new challenges both in extending the reliability and low-cost infrastructure to new customer segments and in supporting new asset classes of financial products worldwide. Bridget brings the global experience and record of success that we believe will continue to differentiate DTCC in the future.”Before joining Lehman, Ms O’Connor worked at AT&T Bell Laboratories.
613;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-08-31T19:59:18Z;BATS price war targets LSE;;Offering discounts to persuade people to buy your product is a time-tested sales tactic. But how about actually paying people to do business with you?That is what BATS Global Markets, a US share trading operator, will do on Tuesday as it takes its battle for market share in European equities trading directly to one of the region’s incumbents: the London Stock Exchange.During September BATS Europe, an arm of Kansas City-based BATS, will pay traders posting orders on its platform 0.4 basis points of the value of an order while charging 0.2bp to those coming to the platform and matching those orders.Previously, BATS Europe paid posters of orders 0.2bp, while charging traders 0.3bp to match those orders.With its new so-called inverted pricing, BATS is in effect paying to attract customers.The move is a sign that competition in European share trading is moving into a phase of hand-to-hand combat. A new fee structure also comes into force on Tuesday at the LSE as the exchange, under Xavier Rolet, its new chief executive, takes the fight to the handful of multilateral trading facilities (MTFs) that have sprung up in the past year.Last week, the largest, Chi-X Europe, upped the ante by offering customers free trading in October, under certain conditions.BATS Europe is not profitable 11 months after launch. But it is prepared to gamble on paying for market share because the tactic worked in the US.Two years ago, BATS used inverted pricing against the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq OMX.Since then, the NYSE’s share of trading1 in NYSE-listed equities has fallen well below 50 per cent.Moreover, the LSE’s new fees no longer reward posters of orders such as the high frequency trading firms that account for an increasing share of equities trading on both sides of the Atlantic.Instead, the exchange is offering generous volume discounts to all types of traders equally and has slashed a minimum charge it has long levied.This “should help to encourage a return to the long-term trend of volume growth on our markets”, Mr Rolet has said. BATS Europe believes that the LSE is turning away from high-frequency traders and that this hands BATS an opportunity to attract more of them.Such traders – including Chicago-based Getco, a shareholder in BATS Global Markets – are already big users of BATS.Paul O’Donnell, chief operating officer of BATS Europe, says: “We have some customers who are pretty unhappy with the LSE pricing change. We think there is an opportunity to move some order flow.” The LSE counters that it is not turning its back on such traders since the ones that match rather than post orders will benefit from the volume discounts – and so in turn will attract posters of orders naturally, especially given that the LSE remains the most liquid market for UK stocks.Still, the LSE will be hoping its plan will work quickly. Its share of trading in FTSE stocks fell below 60 per cent briefly last month, although it has remained above that since.There are also signs that the LSE is no longer the home market for many of the most heavily traded shares in the FTSE index.Fidessa, a provider of trading technology, operates a fragmentation index that shows how many trading venues need to be visited, on average, for an order – often consisting of thousands of shares – to be filled at the best possible price.The index shows that, for the first time since the European Commission kick-started competitive share trading two years ago, traders are routinely having to complete orders in most FTSE 100 stocks on multilateral trading facilities, as well as on the LSE, to get the order completely filled.Steve Grob, Fidessa director of strategy, says: “This trajectory seems to be inevitable and shows no sign of abating.”Yet for BATS Europe, there is no guarantee of repeating the US success with inverted pricing.A similar move targeted at Euronext stocks this year gave the platform only a short-lived bounce in market share. Its market share in FTSE stocks is still only about 5 per cent.Mr O’Donnell says: “I’d like to see us at 10 per cent market share and the LSE below 50 per cent. These are both aggressive goals but not impossible.”
614;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-08-31T15:11:01Z;Direct Edge continues with flash orders;;Direct Edge, the US equity-trading platform, is set to continue with the controversial practice of flash orders, even though two of its main rivals will formally cease providing the service from Tuesday.”We pioneered this product and it gives our clients an opportunity to see liquidity that is off the grid or in dark pools,” said Bill O’Brien, chief executive officer at Direct Edge. “We started this three years ago and no one complained. This is a product we believe in and one that our clients are choosing to use.”Flash orders occur when an exchange allows traders’ computers an extended glimpse of share order flows a fraction of a second before the broader market.Nasdaq OMX and BATS Exchange said earlier this month they would cease the practice after initiating the service in June. The move follows a rise in Direct Edge’s market share from about 2 per cent to 12 per cent in the past few years.Of the major trading venues, NYSE Euronext has been a vocal opponent of flash orders. Concern has been raised by investors and members of Congress that flash orders provide some traders with an unfair advantage over other market participants.The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at flash orders and other aspects of market structure and whether rules and regulations have matched advances in the use of technology amid dramatic changes in the trading of equities.The rise of electronic trading and demise of old-style market makers has resulted in equity trading becoming fragmented across exchanges and various electronic venues. Trading is now dominated by rapid-fire computer systems that critics contend creates a more technically driven market, rather than one based on fundamental forces.There are also concerns about “internalised” orders that are passed through trading desks at major banks before they are released into the broader market.Mary Schapiro, chairman of the SEC, is awaiting a recommendation from within the agency as to how inequities created by flash trading can be eliminated.”We think the SEC is taking the right approach in looking at flash orders and other market issues in their totality and we will be an active participant in their review and respect the outcome of their findings,” said Mr O’Brien.Mr O’Brien said Direct Edge enjoyed its best day for market share on August 25, taking 14.3 per cent of overall trading. The month of August so far is approaching an average daily share of 13 per cent, up one full percentage point over July.
615;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-08-27T00:52:04Z;Nasdaq and Brazilian exchange to discuss partnership;;"BM&F Bovespa, Brazil’s futures and equities exchange, and the Nasdaq OMX Group of the US are discussing a “strategic, commercial and technological partnership”, the Brazilian exchange said in a statement on Wednesday evening.If completed, the partnership would mark a further expansion of BM&F Bovespa’s international activities, which have expanded quickly since it was formed by the merger of Brazil’s derivatives and stock exchanges in May 2008.It recently opened an office in London, adding to its overseas presence in Shanghai and New York. Shortly before the merger, the BM&F segment swapped 10 per cent of its shares for 2 per cent of shares in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Customers of the two exchanges can trade directly on both, and access to the CME’s Globex system has been a powerful driver of new business for the exchange this year.Brazil has been quick to emerge from a short recession caused by the global economic crisis and its equities and the currency have recovered their levels before the collapse of Lehman Brothers last September. Analysts say portfolio investors have been attracted to Brazil because of its large and healthy domestic market and because, as a big producer of food and industrial commodities, it offers a natural hedge against rising global inflation.This has attracted growing interest from some of the world’s biggest market players. ICAP and BGC Partners, two of the world’s biggest inter-dealer brokers, have recently brought leading Brazilian brokerages. They will take advantage of increasing electronification – open outcry trading ended this year – and “co-location”, in which big customers can install computer servers inside the exchange’s premises to enact high-speed automated trades that seek out arbitrage opportunities between different asset classes.BM&F Bovespa is already the world’s fourth largest exchange by market value, bigger than better-known exchanges such as NYSE Euronext, the London Stock Exchange and Nasdaq OMX. Its market value combined with that of Nasdaq OMX would put it in second place behind the CME.The statement issued on Wednesday contained no suggestion that the two exchanges would merge. It said they would examine the development of an order routing system similar to that between BM&F Bovespa and the CME; commercial agreements to offer Brazilian companies services developed by Nasdaq OMX such as investor relations and communications; distribution of price data on the two exchanges; and technological cooperation."
616;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-08-25T19:09:10Z;Deutsche Börse taps IBM to boost platform;;IBM is to supply part of the technology for Deutsche Börse as it implements a complex upgrade of all its trading platforms.The deal comes amid greater focus on the speed of transactions – so-called latency– that can be carried out on exchanges’ platforms, with traditional exchanges under threat from a range of alternative trading platforms. These have touted high performance, as one of their strengths – particularly for frequent traders using computer-driven algorithms to trade in milliseconds.Deutsche Börse and IBM said the software group would supply a messaging system – used to display trading orders – for all its new technology infrastructure, now under development.The system will first be implemented at the International Securities Exchange, bought by Deutsche Börse in 2007, when the New York-based exchange migrates to a new infrastructure late next year.ISE’s existing deal to use Nasdaq/OMX technology under license expires in 2010 and Deutsche Börse plans to use the need to find a replacement system as an opportunity also to upgrade its relatively old technology for its Xetra equities and Eurex derivatives exchanges.The group will then have a common backbone for its several alternative platforms, making upgrades or expansion into new markets or asset classes easier and cutting maintenance costs and development times.Deutsche Börse has set great store by its ability to develop its own IT systems, with Reto Francioni, chief executive, telling the Financial Times recently that IT knowledge and skills were a “core competence” for the Franfurt-based group.“We have enormously skilled people in IT. We have a real asset here in terms of intellectual property and knowledge of how to run and maintain markets …We maintain and run systems, that is our strength,” he said.The IBM system, called WebSphere MQ Low Latency Messaging, is also used by Santiago stock exchange in Chile.June Felix, general manager for IBM Banking and Financial Markets, said exchanges, investment banks, hedge funds, and other capital markets firms “all [want] to manage increasing business demands in terms of speed, throughput and efficiency”.
617;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-08-23T21:42:13Z;Sweden to outline new takeover rules;;A two-year battle to secure equal treatment for all shareholders in bid battles in Sweden is drawing to a close with the Swedish stock exchange expected to outline new takeover rules this week.As part of a tougher takeover regime, the exchange, operated by Nasdaq OMX, is expected to adopt new rules preventing bidders paying more for shares that have preferential voting rights in target companies.This follows a long campaign calling for equal treatment for all shares in takeover situations that give investors the same rights to assets and dividends with all shareholders sharing the same risk, even if one class of share has multiple voting rights.Peter Rudman, corporate governance director at Nordea Investment Funds, part of Sweden’s biggest bank, said the current discriminatory system risks “undermining confidence in the stock market with implications to the cost of capital”. He said amending the rules was vital “to restore confidence in the market”.About half of Sweden’s 270 listed companies, including H&M, Skanska and Saab, have two or more classes of shares with different voting rights but the same financial rights.In 2007 and again in 2009, a group of 24 Swedish and international investment groups, including Nordea, DWS, Germany’s biggest fund manager, Hermes, Standard Life Investments, and Calpers in the US, wrote to the Näringslivets Börskommitté, the Swedish Industry and Commerce Stock Exchange Committee, calling for equal treatment of all shareholders in takeovers. The letters highlighted the widespread criticism of shares carrying different voting entitlements, which could be used as a defence against takeovers and said that “influence ought to be proportionate with the risk capital invested in the company”.This week the signatories welcomed the expected rule change and suggested the success of the Swedish campaign might encourage further international efforts to champion shareholder democracy across Europe where multiple voting rights are still common.Anita Skipper, Aviva Investors’ head of governance, said: “At a time when shareholder behaviour is under scrutiny, this is a great example of collaboration by global shareholders acting together on an important governance principle.”In France, nearly six in 10 companies had multiple voting rights in 2007, largely due to a law that rewards long-term shareholders. Investors that have held shares for several years receive double rights.President Nicolas Sarkozy has backed multiple voting rights, seeing them as part of his campaign for responsible capitalism.In the UK, Lord Myners, City minister, recently proposed introducing shares with multiple voting rights to reward long-term investors, a move that appeared to run counter to Britain’s traditional advocacy of “one share, one vote”.However, the pressure for shareholder democracy is intensifying elsewhere.Sarasin, the wealth manager, has launched a lawsuit in Switzerland’s highest court to overturn an offer by Mitsubishi Chemical of up to a quarter more shares to some shareholders in plastics maker Quadrant.

618;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-08-18T18:56:46Z;Turquoise hires UBS to seek a buyer;;The banks that own Turquoise, the pan-European share trading facility, have hired UBS to find potential buyers for the business.The move follows a recent approach to Turquoise by Nasdaq-OMX, the US exchange group, which set up a rival trading platform last year. “The banks have asked UBS to drum up a better price,” said a person familiar with the process.Another person close to the events said a “pretty detailed approach” was received early in the summer.Turquoise is one of several alternative “multi-lateral trading platforms”, or MTFs, that sprang up in the wake of recent European deregulation to challenge the traditional dominance of established exchanges such as the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse.The MTF market is dominated by Chi-X, majority owned by Nomura, which claims a 15 per cent share of European equities trading, making it Europe’s third-biggest trading platform after the LSE and Deutsche Börse.Turquoise, with about 5.5 per cent, is the second-biggest MTF, ahead of BATS Europe, the European arm of US-based BATS Global Markets, with an estimated 3 per cent share. Nasdaq has been less successful, taking an estimated 1 per cent.Bankers suggested Turquoise could be sold for £25m to £50m, though the business’s strategic importance is larger than that price suggests.It is owned by its founding banks: BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Société Générale and UBS.Bankers said that the LSE or Deutsche Börse, as well as Nasdaq, might be interested in bidding for Turquoise but said an ideal owner might be an operator outside the cash equities business, such as Icap, the inter-dealer broker.“We’d like to reach out into other areas, such as equity derivatives and foreign exchange,” said a Turquoise board member.Icap is known to have looked at Turquoise earlier in the year but concluded that the business model was unattractive.UBS was hired in July to look at ways in which the business could be sold. One person involved in the sale said: “The founding shareholders are ready to cede control, but that might not mean an outright divestment.” Depending on the identity of the bidders, at least some of the current owners could retain a minority stake, he said.Turquoise was set up last September. But one banker involved with the project said it had now served its purpose. “We came into the market to keep the incumbents on their toes. We wanted to be a catalyst for change in terms of costs. And I think we’ve done that. Our goals are largely fulfilled.” Exchanges have cut their charges following the launch of the MTFs.In the spring, Turquoise’s market share plummeted after the expiry of an agreement with its owner-banks to channel business through the platform. In recent weeks, however, Turquoise has regained business on the back of lower charges and a reduction in the minimum size of transaction bundles.The business’s next move will be to launch an “aggregation service”, in an attempt to tackle the fragmentation of trading liquidity across Europe by pinpointing where an order is most likely to be executed among multiple markets.
619;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-08-13T21:38:55Z;TD Waterhouse buys OMX Securities;;Stockbroker TD Waterhouse plans to continue its run of recent acquisitions, its chief executive said as it announced the acquisition of OMX Securities, a Birmingham-based company that provides clearing and settlement services to stockbrokers and fund managers.“We continue to be in the marketplace for good value acquisitions – expanding into corporate services brings you the scale that is so important and lacking in UK brokerage,” said Angus Rigby, chief executive of TD Waterhouse, which is part of Canada’s TD Bank.The acquisition of OMX, which was 51 per cent owned by Nasdaq OMX, for an undisclosed cash sum marks a significant expansion into back-room services for TD Waterhouse, which mainly operates in the online market.OMX had £4bn of assets under administration for 22 clients, which include Brooks Macdonald, the private client fund manager, and Killik & Co, the broker. TD Waterhouse, with about 200,000 customers, had £3.55bn under administration in October 2008, prior to its latest acquisitions.Additional trade from OMX, which had a turnover of £30m in the year to April 2009, will boost annual turnover at TD Waterhouse Investor Services (Europe) to more than £120m, Mr Rigby said.Mr Rigby said the company had achieved a critical level of volume, which would allow it to undercut the prices of its UK competitors.“The cost of equity trading in the UK is ridiculously expensive compared to North America,” he said.TD Waterhouse has enjoyed record levels of trading in recent months and has been rapidly expanding. In February it raised its stake in Luxembourg-based online brokerage Internaxx to 75 per cent, and in June it bought the online share-dealing business of Hoodless Brennan.TD Waterhouse is expanding its online sharedealing business into Ireland in the next few months and plans to launch in the Netherlands early next year.Mr Rigby said that reduced revenues in advisory and fund management businesses had made outsourcing to companies such as OMX a more attractive option. “We bring to the party a really viable alternative to outsource [through the OMX Securities acquisition],” he saidAngus Macdonald, chief executive of OMX Securities, said: “To have the backing of TD Waterhouse is fantastic news for our clients and for everyone who works with us. We now have the balance sheet and support we need to underpin our growth.”Nasdaq OMX said that the sale of OMX Securities was not related to the unit’s profitability. “It is not part of our core strategy any longer, and an opportunity showed itself to divest,” said Anna Rasin, a company spokesperson.
620;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-08-12T15:08:04Z;Singapore signs dark pool deal with Chi-X;;SGX, the Singapore exchange, on Wednesday signed a joint venture agreement with Chi-X Global, the alternative equities trading platform, to launch Asia’s first exchange-backed ”dark pool” for the trading of large blocks of shares in a move that gives Chi-X its first foothold in the region.The development is part of plans to build pan-Asian share trading at a time when the growth of China’s capital markets is forcing smaller exchanges in the region to come up with innovative ways to ensure their long-term survival.The equally held joint venture is expected to start in the first half of 2010 and will allow institutional investors to trade large blocks of shares listed in Singapore, Australia, Hong Kong and Japan. The respective investments were not disclosed.Chi-X Global and Chi-X Europe are both subsidiaries of Instinet, which is owned by Nomura, the Japanese financial services group.Dark pools allow the trading of blocks of shares with prices made public only after trades are completed. They are growing in popularity as asset managers and other traders find that as algorithmic trading is shrinking the size of orders on exchanges, larger orders are harder to execute on an exchange’s public order book.Gan Seow Ann, SGX’s head of markets, said the joint venture ”will complement exchange trading by reducing the market impact of large trades” and ”attracting new participants and improving the trading environment in the region”.Dark pools have proliferated in the US and Europe and while several broker-led dark pools operate in Asia – mainly in Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore – they account for only 1-3 per cent of trading in the region, according to Chi-X. Liquidnet, a US-based dark pool operator, also has one in the region.Chi-X Global believes that its entry will give it a first-mover advantage. Its sister company, Chi-X Europe, has captured more market share than rival platforms in Europe partly by being first to take advantage of European Commission rules allowing competition between trading venues in 2007.John Lowrey, chief executive of Chi-X Global and a former trading expert at Lehman Brothers, said it had decided to adopt a “hub” approach, using Singapore as a base, since establishing dark pools in individual markets would be less effective.Chi-X hoped to expand the joint venture with SGX to cover other Asian markets, including China and India, and that other exchanges could join as partners.Mr Lowrey also said both partners plan to offer pan-Asian clearing to support the new venture – a first for the region. Requests had gone out to leading clearing houses to provide such a service.People familiar with the plans said LCH.Clearnet, the London-based clearer, and EMCF were among likely candidates. EMCF is a small European clearer which already clears for Chi-X Europe and is owned by Fortis, the Dutch bank, and Nasdaq OMX, the transatlantic exchange.However, the fragmented Asian exchange market, with differing rules on foreign ownership and market access, means that Chi-X and other alternative trading platforms could face slower growth than in Europe, where regulation is more uniform under EU rules.Chi-X Global has expressed interest in entering Japan. But domestic institutional investors, such as pension funds, are reluctant to use alternative trading venues. Since the trades are off-exchange and are not cleared, it could expose investors to counterparty risk.Chi-X Global has faced delays in entering other Asian markets, including Australia and Japan. It initially planned to enter Australia first, but the move was delayed as regulators debated how supervisory arrangements to monitor investor protection could be best achieved in a multi-operator environment.Additional reporting by Jeremy Grant in London
621;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-08-06T23:15:24Z;Nasdaq OMX and BATS to end ‘flash orders’;;"Two of the three US equity exchanges that allow traders to use flash orders said on Thursday they would voluntarily end the practice at the start of ­September.The announcements by Nasdaq OMX and BATS Trading came only days after Mary
Schapiro, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, signalled that the SEC would clamp down on flash trading amid concerns it puts some investors at a disadvantage.Direct Edge, the exchange that pioneered flash trading three years ago and gained market share in equity trading as a result, declined to comment on whether it would change its policy on the practice.The only leading exchange that does not offer flash orders is NYSE Euronext.Flash orders involve allowing traders with lightning-fast computers to gain a glimpse of share order flows a fraction of a second before the broader ­market.Some exchanges “flash” an order to certain exchange members, potentially giving them an unfair advantage over other market participants. While flash comprises a small share of overall trading, the practice has come under intense scrutiny.The SEC is drawing up proposals that would eliminate the ability to flash orders. The proposals would need to be approved by the full five-member commission and be open to public comment.An SEC spokesman said that while current rules still allow flash trading, Ms Schapiro “nonetheless welcomes decisions by any exchange to end the practice voluntarily”.Nasdaq OMX said: “We recognise the SEC’s rule-making process will take time, yet as an exchange we have the ability to move on our own. We respectfully call on other markets offering similar functionality to make the same decision.”BATS Trading, which last month called for an end to flash trading, said it was “pleased that Nasdaq is heeding our call to eliminate flash orders”.Nasdaq OMX and BATS started allowing flash orders in June to compete with Direct Edge. Nasdaq OMX, which on Thursday reported a 31 per cent fall in second-quarter net profit to $69m, said its share of US equity trading during the quarter had fallen to 20 per cent from 30 per cent from a year ago."
622;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-08-06T20:28:23Z;Nasdaq to cease offering flash orders;;Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX says the exchange has informed the Securities and Exchange Commission of its intention to voluntarily cease offering the “flash orders” from September 1 2009.The exchange, which only introduced the service in June in order to compete with rivals, is also calling on other markets offering similar orders types to take the same action.The move by Mr Greifeld, comes after Joe Ratterman, chief executive officer at BATS Trading, a rival exchange, last month called for the industry to take a coordinated approach to withdrawing flashed orders. BATS said on Thursday that they would also withdraw the use of flash orders from its trading platform at the start of September.Flash orders involve allowing some traders’ computers to gain a glimpse of share order flows a fraction of a second before the broader market. Some then ”flash” an order to certain exchange members, giving them an unfair advantage over other market participants.The practice, which only accounts for 2 per cent of daily trading has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks. This week, the SEC indicated it is moving to possibly ban the practice.Amid the focus on flash orders which reflects the intense competition between exchanges, Nasdaq OMX said on Thursday that its share of US equity trading dropped sharply as it reported a 31 per cent drop in earnings for the second quarter.The transatlantic exchange said net profit was $69m, or $0.33 per diluted share, for the quarter, compared to $100m, or $0.47 per diluted share, in the same quarter last year.Adjusting for merger expenses associated with its acquisition of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange in November 2007, and other items, the company posted earnings of 47 cents per share which matched estimates.Nasdaq OMX said it was focused on controlling costs and reducing its debt, and on Thursday the shares rose 1.6 per cent to close at $22. So far this year, shares in the exchange have dropped 11 per cent.Investors were troubled by the news that its share of US equity trading fell to 20 per cent during the quarter, down from 30 per cent a year ago. The exchange’s market share has contracted for the past five quarters, and reflects a bruising price war with rivals, such as Direct Edge and BATS Trading.Cash equity trading net exchange revenues slid to $68m during the quarter, down 28 per cent or $26m from the same period a year ago and off 15 per cent, or $12m from the first quarter of 2009.“Like other global exchanges, Nasdaq is facing a scenario where volumes are slowing and competition is increasing, putting pressure on fees,” said David Easthope, senior analyst with Celent, a Boston-based financial research and consulting firm.One bright spot was the rise in combined market share of option trading, which averaged 21 per cent during the second quarter. That was up from 17 per cent a year ago, while total volume grew 40 per cent versus the same period in 2008.Mr Easthope said the exchange’s diversification into new business areas may well pay off.“While swaps clearing (International Derivatives Clearing Group) provides potential for growth, the most promising business at the moment may be the Market Technology business, where client activity is brisk and Nasdaq OMX has a strong franchise,” he said.

624;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-08-06T17:34:13Z;Exchanges should unite to end flash orders;;As noted in a letter last week to Mary Schapiro, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Nasdaq OMX has been examining questions related to the increasing prevalence of “flash” order types in the cash equities market, as well as a related trend in US markets towards “darkness” – activity or orders not transparent to the full market.In looking at the use of flash order types, it is important to understand where they came from, why they exist and why electronic markets including Nasdaq OMX have adopted them. Flash orders originated from and remain an accepted practice of exchanges with a trading floor, with the effectiveness of the “flash” limited by the distance a human voice could travel. These voice flash orders are the raison d’être for people who work on the floor of an exchange. As technology was added to floor trading operations, automation of these flash capabilities occurred through systems such as Block Talk on the NYSE. In addition, fully electronic versions of this floor flash capability were introduced by the CBSX and Direct Edge.After full consultation with the SEC, Nasdaq OMX was one of the last groups to offer flash orders. Most importantly, we used our technology to create a flash order type that all investors could see and use.We appreciate that Ms Schapiro and the SEC commissioners will assume the leadership role in a comprehensive review of issues related to flash orders. But their ability to act quickly is limited. For example, the statutorily mandated rulemaking process will take time. Yet, as an exchange, we can move on our own.Therefore, we have communicated to the SEC that we will voluntarily cease offering the flash dark order type on September 1 2009. We also respectfully call on other markets offering similar order types to take the same action.In a related development, dark pools have also received attention. Part of that can be attributed to the industry’s curious choice of the name “dark pool”. This name is a misnomer and has inevitably gained a negative connotation. Transparent markets have had difficulty in servicing the requirements of large “block orders”. SEC Rule 600 defines a block order as a share size of at least 10,000 or a dollar value of at least $200,000. Broker dealers have traditionally performed this function through the use of capital, trading acumen and a transparent market. The broker dealer-operated block execution services are needed and must continue. Broker dealers have improved their services through innovative uses of technology. It is this use of technology that has been given the unfortunate “dark pool” appellation. Rather, they should be labelled block execution services.Recent commentary on flash orders and dark pools has wrongly conflated these market structure concerns with questions on the validity of market participants who engage in high-volume algorithmic trading. The magic of markets discovering the proper price at a moment in time occurs when market participants are numerous and diverse, with divergent investment aims and views on value. This philosophical view of proper markets is codified in our rules that mandate fair and equal access to all market participants. Any step away from this principle will create distortions, with unintended consequences. Electronic markets and electronic trading are the foundation of modern markets. The activities of electronic marketmakers, who built their technology to compete in this modern world, provide critical liquidity during good and bad markets. These activities benefit all investors.Speed in the execution of transactions is another way in which markets and market participants compete. In turn, open, transparent markets facilitate competition. As long as information is available on an equal basis to all, the increased speed at which transactions are executed provides tremendous benefits to investors by enhancing liquidity and cutting transaction costs.As we reflect on the state of the US equity markets, we can take pride in their performance through the tumult of the last year. While investors did not appreciate the direction of the market, at all times the markets were accessible, liquid and transparent. This reliable performance is due to the constant evolution and improvement of our markets. We look forward to the continuation of the journey.The writer is chief executive of the Nasdaq OMX Group
625;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-08-05T18:41:21Z;The dash to flash;;"No matter how rapidly the human eye can blink, a computer trading system on Wall Street has already left it for dust – carrying out a transaction 1,000 times faster, at just 400 microseconds. It is a frenetic, technology-driven world of which few ordinary investors are even aware.But this “high-frequency trading” is estimated to account for well over half of daily volume in US stocks, up from estimates of 30 per cent in 2005. It is based on extracting tiny slices of profit from trading small numbers of shares in companies, often between different trading platforms, with success relying on minimal variations in speed – or “latency”, in the trading vernacular.It amounts to a transformation in equity trading that has lowered dealing costs virtually all round and, many argue, has created a more efficient market for both retail and institutional investors.But amid all this hectic activity, a certain type of stock order has raised anxiety among market participants, competing exchanges, members of Congress and now the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mary Schapiro, no-nonsense new chairwoman of an SEC that had been accused of being largely supine till the credit crunch began to batter markets two years ago, this week served notice that the days of so-called flash orders are likely to be numbered.Flash orders occur when, as some exchanges allow, traders’ computers get a glimpse of share order flows a fraction of a second before the broader market. The concern is that some of them then “flash” an order to the exchange’s members, giving them an unfair advantage over other market participants. By posting a trade, the firm even gains a rebate from an exchange hungry for its business.These orders comprise only around 3 per cent of overall flows, according to Sang Lee, managing partner at Aite Group, a consultancy. He says a lot of high-frequency traders do not use them. But flash orders were thrust into the limelight after some investors and lawmakers, including New York Senator Charles Schumer, urged the SEC to ban the practice late last month. Ms Schapiro said on Tuesday that she had instructed her staff to find “an approach that can be quickly implemented to eliminate the inequity that results from flash orders”.The SEC has been looking into flash orders as part of a review of what are called “ dark pools” – electronic trading venues that do not display public quotes for stocks. “Flash orders are a very small part of trading flow, but it has caught the attention of regulators that a certain class of investor may be getting a preferential look at order flow,” says Larry Tabb, founder and chief executive of Tabb Group, a research and strategic advisory firm. “Flash orders can be looked at as providing a two-tier market,” he adds. “All agree that everyone should have a fair shake at seeing all orders.”The use of flash orders is not confined to high-frequency traders. Retail brokers, institutional investors, proprietary trading firms and automated market-makers also deploy them. Nor are flash orders the only manifestation of the revolution in electronic trading that has taken place in less than five years – such as the ability for a trading firm to shave microseconds off the time it takes for a trade to be done by physically locating its trading systems in an exchange’s data centre – known as “co-location”.The dilemma for regulators is what to do about this technological revolution – especially as many orders are cancelled almost as soon as they are posted. By flashing orders so quickly, some traders could be trying to ascertain where other investors want to buy and sell stocks. Cancelling the order before it is executed means the flasher could potentially squeeze a better price from the investor.Regulators in the US are already smarting from having failed to spot glaring holes in the way the opaque over-the-counter derivatives market functioned. Few ordinary investors had such complex investments in their portfolios, yet ownership of shares in the US is widespread. So the SEC, whose prime congressional mandate is investor protection, is highly sensitive to the flash trades issue.But as many market participants point out, there has never been equal access to information in the markets. In the old days of trading floors, dealers were able to achieve better prices than rivals often by overhearing information uttered by a rival standing a few feet away. In cynical recognition of this disparity, traders at banks and brokerages routinely describe orders originating from “mom and pop” retail investors as “uninformed order flow”. It also has long been common practice for banks to conduct huge amounts of share dealing, between each other and on behalf of clients, in the over-the-counter or off-exchange markets.The SEC has acknowledged the dilemma. In a recent speech, James Brigagliano, a senior staffer in its trading and markets division, said securities markets had thrived as “competitive forces have led entrepreneurial industry participants to innovate with new technologies and new trading tools”. He described the challenge for the industry and regulators as having to “monitor these changes and update a market’s structure when needed”.How the SEC undertakes this challenge of technology is the compelling question. Richard Balarkas, chief executive of Instinet Europe, a broker owned by Nomura of Japan, says there is a risk that regulators could go too far. That could hobble many of the technology-enabled trading processes that have resulted in tighter bid-ask spreads and greater liquidity in markets.“The dilemma for the regulators in the US seems to be this assumption that their job is to ensure there is absolute equality of information amongst all market participants and it all boils down to this efficient market hypothesis,” he says. “In reality there are a couple of thousand tiers of information in the market and there always have been. If the regulators want to insist on this single-tier philosophy, where do they stop?”In the US, Stuart Schweitzer, global market strategist at JPMorgan’s private bank, says: “The issue in the market has long been, do you always get the best execution? I understand some may point a finger but I think it’s being exaggerated.”BATS Trading and Direct Edge, two dealing platforms that have been competing with NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX, argue that their existence has helped expand liquidity in the markets. William O’Brien, Direct Edge chief executive, says: “Our customers like flash orders and the way it provides them with access to liquidity in the market they would not normally reach.”Flash orders were pioneered by Direct Edge some three years ago. At that time there was little fuss, but Direct Edge’s share of average daily equity volume in the US has since climbed to 12 per cent from 1 per cent. Competitors such as BATS and Nasdaq OMX have felt compelled to offer flash orders in order to compete for market share. Mr O’Brien argues that the debate over the use of flash orders “reflects competition among exchanges, rather than being a true burning regulatory issue”.NYSE Euronext, operator of what was long known as Wall Street’s “big board”, does not allow flash orders and has been a vocal critic of the practice. The SEC’s move on Tuesday sparked a rally in the exchange’s own share price.Aite’s Mr Lee says: “Flash orders are a legitimate issue as it creates a private network for trading. We will have to wait and see if it’s a complete ban or whether certain aspects of flash orders are stopped.”Exchanges and main participants appear at least to some extent open to a curb. Joe Ratterman, chief executive of BATS, has called for a collective ban on flash orders, although he plays down concerns that have been raised about their use.Themis, an institutional brokerage, says other trading practices need reform as well. “It’s a good first step that the SEC has taken, but this just scratches the surface,” says Joe Saluzzi, its co-head of equity trading. Inducements from exchanges to traders such as paying a rebate to posters of orders should be abolished, he adds.The rebate model, which the London Stock Exchange has decided to abandon from next month, underlines how competitive the equity trading business has become in the US over the past decade. Computer systems or algorithms that can break down a large order into tiny slices and execute them all across different trading venues at somewhere near the speed of light has become the new way of doing business. The size of the average trade has fallen to 250 shares, down from more than 1,000 units a decade ago, according to Aite.It is business that the exchanges and platforms such as BATS are keen to attract – hence the rebates. Here, the dilemma for regulators is not high-frequency traders per se. Indeed, firms such as Getco, a market-maker that uses some high-frequency trading strategies and is a shareholder in BATS, are often just as much “takers” of orders from platforms as they are posters of orders, meaning they do not solely harvest rebates and often add liquidity to a market.But some high-frequency traders are also starting to use “dark pools” and the SEC is concerned about the practice of sending electronic messages on to the trading platform to “test” the likelihood of an incoming order finding a match in it – so-called “indications of interest”. Yet dark pools are supposed to be used to trade large blocks of shares, with prices posted publicly only after trades are done. Indications of interest merely increase their opacity.Another area of concern for the market is “sponsored access”, whereby a trading firm that has a relationship with a broker can use it to access trading flow directly at an exchange or trading platform.Technologies such as these seem unstoppable. But what seems certain is that the practices they are leading to face intense scrutiny.“I would not be surprised to see the SEC take a look at a number of strategies and trading practices,” says Mr Tabb. How far regulators follow up that scrutiny with action will decide the shape of markets for years to come.American traders cross the Atlantic for arbitrage opportunitiesSix months ago, Olof Neiglick and a team of trading experts in the Nordic region were busy setting up Burgundy, the latest alternative share-trading platform to emerge in Europe, writes Jeremy Grant.He recalls telephoning the high-frequency trading companies that have recently migrated to Europe from the US, as well as some of the region’s own companies. None returned his calls.But since Burgundy started trading in 600 Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian and Danish stocks in June, his phone has started ringing. “It’s amazing. They are asking me about latency …how much capacity you have, that sort of thing. I must be doing something right,” the Burgundy chief executive says.As debate continues in the US over the influence of high-frequency traders, Europe is just starting to experience the phenomenon. The focus is Amsterdam, where there has been options trading since at least the late 1970s. Companies that sprang from that culture include Optiver, All Options and Van der Moolen.US high-frequency traders have been setting up in Europe, mostly in London and Dublin. Getco, based in Chicago, has a branch overlooking the Thames;Susquehanna and Madison Tyler of the US are based in Dublin. They are drawn there because forces unleashed by the European Commission’s 2007 markets in financial instruments directive are bringing about changes that mirror what happened in the US more than five years ago: competition and adoption of new technologies. High-frequency companies are attracted by arbitrage opportunities offered in the battle between exchanges and “multilateral trading facilities” such as Chi-X and BATS Europe. Technology such as “smart order routing”, helping direct orders to places they are most likely to be matched, and technology allowing faster connections to exchanges have helped. This week, Deutsche Börsebegan installing infrastructure giving UK-based traders access to its markets in less than five milliseconds.Some of the companies have taken stakes in MTFs, giving them a say in fee policies. Some also account for a significant share of trading on a single MTF, giving them huge influence. Phil Allison of UBS says the high-frequency traders are useful in providing liquidity to the markets but adds it is important “to be at least aware of how they shape the overall market structure”.He adds: “My real concern is that these high-frequency traders have an enormous ability to influence our market micro-structure. If you remove one of the highest-volume traders off Chi-X, for example, you will materially change their overall market share, which means their power as a client of the MTFs is incredibly high.”"

That kept the broad benchmark above the 1,000 threshold, which it finally rose above on Monday for the first time since last November.The S&P closed up 0.3 per cent at 1,005.65, near its intra-day high of 1,007.12.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent to close at 9,320.19, while the Nasdaq Composite index rose 0.1 per cent to 2,011.31.“A pullback would be healthy, there have been lots of positives to take from the earnings we have seen,” said Neil Massa, senior trader at MFC Global Investment Management.Meanwhile, growing momentum by the Securities and Exchange Commission to ban the use of flash trading orders on exchanges sparked volatility in the shares of NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX.Shares in NYSE Euronext surged nearly 4 per cent in early afternoon trade, before easing to stand 2.4 per cent higher at $27.40. Nasdaq OMX, which, unlike NYSE Euronext, allows flash orders, fell 0.3 per cent to $21.39 having plumbed an earlier low of $20.78.Financial stocks fell in early trade, knocked in part by data showing that personal income fell more sharply than analysts expected in June.But figures showing that pending home sales jumped much more than predicted during the month saw them rise into positive territory by midday.John Canally, economist for LPL Financial, said the fifth straight month of rises for pending home sales was very encouraging.“After housing starts and moderating prices, the pending home sales figures are the latest sign that the housing market has stabilised.”Citigroup rose 2.2 per cent to $3.25 while Wells Fargo was up 2.9 per cent at $26.55 and Bank of Americapicked up 2.1 per cent to $15.64.Homebuilders saw mixed fortunes as the data lifted some of the sector’s biggest companies following early losses on the back of some disappointing quarterly results.Pulte Homes fell to a heavier loss than expected, with falling land values and weak sales continuing to take their toll. Its shares dropped 0.7 per cent to $11.68.The negative outlook briefly weighed on Centex, which Pulte has agreed to buy, and after early losses, its shares rose 0.1 per cent to $11.33 as the company made a quarterly profit.Rival DR Horton also suffered as a result of record foreclosures and rising unemployment. Its results were worse than expected.But its shares picked up following early falls and it gained 4.9 per cent to close at $12.32.“People are selling the homebuilders after their recent run-up but I would pay more attention to these economic data,” said Mr Canally.The utilities sector was the heaviest faller on the S&P, led lower by Allegheny Energy, which lost 4.9 per cent to $24.50 after the company reported slightly lower profit than expected.The results exacerbated pre-market falls that came on the back of an announcement on Monday evening that the company had filed a universal shelf register with the SEC, which would enable it to sell fresh stock.Meanwhile, Duke Energy announced second-quarter profit 21 per cent below their level at the same time last year – its shares edged up 0.1 per cent to $15.58.There was weakness in the agricultural sector as Archer Daniels Midland fell 5.2 per cent to $28.81 after it reported falling revenues and profit, with demand for its oilseed and other commodities remaining low. Monsanto lost 2.6 per cent to $84.02.Shares in PepsiCo rose 5.1 per cent to $59.06 after the company agreed the purchase of its two large bottling companies.Pepsi increased its offer to $36.50 a share for Pepsi Bottling and $28.50 a share for Pepsi-Americas. Pepsi Bottling rose 8.5 per cent to $36.49 and PepsiAmericas gained 9 per cent to close at $28.50.
627;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-08-03T08:48:14Z;Europe calm on flash orders;;Debate may be raging in the US about the effect of “high-frequency” traders in markets but in Europe, the issue is slightly different.High-frequency groups have been flocking to the region from the US to take advantage of Mifid, the Brussels directive that has injected competition between trading venues.Home-grown European companies, most of them in the Netherlands, have also sprung into action.The main bone of contention in the US – the use of so-called flash orders – is largely academic in Europe, as such kinds of orders are almost entirely absent from the European trading landscape. Flash orders are those that an exchange or trading platform will allow to sit on its order book for up to half a second, without publishing bids and offers from other venues.The trader committing an order in this way stands a chance of earning a rebate if the order is matched.Charles Schumer, a New York senator, says this creates “a two-tiered system, where a privileged group of insiders receives preferential treatment”.The nearest equivalent in Europe is a system called Blink, operated by Nasdaq OMX Europe, one of a handful of smaller equities trading platforms battling against Europe’s incumbent exchanges, and each other.Nasdaq OMX says the difference is that, with Blink, orders sit on its book for 25 milliseconds and “are seen by everyone”.If there is any controversy in Europe – so far at least – it revolves around the role of high-frequency traders, “smart order routing” and “dark pools”.The proliferation of trading venues has made it hard for traditional users of exchanges, such as asset managers, to know if they are getting the best possible price for their orders.They rely on their brokers to provide “smart order routers” that will seek out the most appropriate match for them.Using mathematical algorithms, such routers will seek out, electronically, the best match for a particular order whether it is on the standard “lit” order book of an exchange or on a dark pool.High-frequency traders now make up a significant – if hard to quantify – part of the market, meaning they are often likely to be the counterparty to trades originated by asset managers.That includes in dark pools, where they are increasingly trading in small orders, even though such venues were initially designed only for large orders.Betsy Anderson, head of centralised dealing at Ignis Asset Management, says high-frequency traders are beneficial because they provide liquidity.But she says it is increasingly important to buy-side players to know what type of liquidity provider their orders are interacting with.High frequency traders, dealing in small trades, may allow an asset manager to get a portion of its large trade done. But that may merely alert the rest of the market to the existence of the whole order, prompting rival traders to move against it in a process known as “gaming”.“We want to be able to establish what types of liquidity are suitable,” Ms Anderson says. “We need the ability through the smart order router and its anti-gaming technology to see what sort of liquidity might not be best if we interacted with it, and to have the ability to take that out of the equation.”
628;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-08-02T21:57:06Z;Nasdaq OMX closes India liaison office;;Nasdaq OMX, the transatlantic exchange, has closed its liaison office in India, people familiar with the matter have told the Financial Times.The move comes after failing to list any Indian company on its New York-based exchange since it set up a presence in Bangalore, the country’s information technology hub, in 2001.One of India’s most senior IT executives, who asked not to be named, said: “Nasdaq has done a lot in terms of educating companies in India but it has been very difficult for them to list companies on their US exchange and therefore it made no sense to keep an office open here”.Indian IT companies, which contribute to about 25 per cent of the country’s total exports, generating $46.3bn (€32.7bn £27.7bn) in revenues last year, have boomed in the last 10 years providing vital software and back-office services to US and European multinationals.Nasdaq has been competing aggressively for global listings. However, Kiran Karnik, former president of Nasscom, the Indian software trade body, said the global financial crisis and high regulatory costs in the US had been strong deterrents for Indian groups looking at the US.He said: “The regulatory environment in the US was perceived [by Indians] as being very high in terms of compliance costs,”.“I know some companies – that I wouldn’t want to name – who were looking at US alternatives but then decided to list on the London Stock Exchange.”Ghanshyam Dass, who was appointed Nasdaq OMX’s director for South Asia in 2001, based at the Bangalore liaison office, said he resigned in March this year. He was not replaced locally.Richard Dour, Nasdaq’s general manager for south Asia, is based outside India. The US exchange group has denied closing its liaison office in Bangalore.Bethany Sherman, a Nasdaq OMX spokeswoman in New York, said last week: “Nasdaq OMX has not closed its representative office in India. In fact, Nasdaq OMX’s presence in India is increasing, with multiple representatives serving the region.”She added later: “We do not have, nor have we ever had, a physical office in Bangalore – it has always been individual representatives.”However, in 2001, Nasdaq said in a statement that it had opened a liaison office in Bangalore to service Indian companies.“The decision to open an office in India was two-fold. First, to provide enhanced service to our existing companies, Infosys, Rediff and Satyam Infoway, and second, to assist other companies contemplating listing on Nasdaq,” said Alfred R. Berkeley, then vice-chairman of Nasdaq, in a statement found on the company’s website.S.M. Krishna, Indian foreign minister and former chief minister of Karnataka, the south Indian state where Bangalore is situated, inaugurated Nasdaq’s liaison office in 2001.In the eight years Nasdaq was present on the ground, no Indian company was listed on its stock exchange, according to Dealogic and the Nasdaq’s website.Exchange experts said that there were very few incentives and many regulatory bottle necks for Indian companies to list in the US.“Indian companies have found cheaper options in raising debt [through] instruments like foreign currency convertible bonds,” said an executive from a local Mumbai-based exchange.
629;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-07-27T23:12:47Z;SEC to review ‘flash’ orders;;The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday said it was examining “flash” orders – trades made at lightning speeds on electronic systems – after calls by a US senator to ban the practice.Officials are currently conducting a review that includes looking into flash orders by exchanges and automatic trading systems that disseminate information to select market participants, ‘’potentially disadvantaging investors,’’ said a SEC spokesman.The SEC staff is “specifically examining flash orders to ensure best execution and fair access to information for all investors,” he said.The practice of flashing orders across electronic platforms helps providers of market liquidity, many of whom are high-frequency traders with powerful computer systems, to attract “buy” and “sell” orders from investors.But critics, notably Charles Schumer, a senior Democrat on the Senate banking panel, contend that flash orders are not being shown to all investors at the same time, creating a two-tier market. This, they say, favours traders with faster and more powerful trading systems.The New York senator has called for a clampdown on how equity prices are displayed to investors on electronic systems. He sent a letter late last week to the SEC requesting that it curb the use of flash orders by Nasdaq OMX and the trading platforms Direct Edge and BATS. If the regulator fails to act, Mr Schumer said he planned to introduce legislation in the Senate seeking to prohibit the use of flash orders.Flash orders have come under increasing scrutiny recently as US securities regulators look for ways to regulate “dark pools”. These anonymous electronic trading venues, which do not display public quotes for stocks, have flourished in recent years. Last month, Mary Shapiro, the chairman of the SEC, raised concerns about the growth of dark pools.On Monday, Nasdaq OMX, which allows flash orders, wrote to Ms Schapiro, urging her to review the broader practices which now dominate equity markets. Exchanges like Nasdaq have lost market share to electronic rivals, including some which operate dark pools.Flash orders are but one symptom of the current evolving market structure,” wrote Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq, in a letter. ”We have a unique opportunity at this time to take a hard look at dark order types and the underlying market structure issues that do not support public price formation. These include flash orders, internalised orders, enhanced liquidity providers, Block Talk orders and dark pools.”But calls to ban flash orders have met resistance from Direct Edge, a leading market provider. William O’Brien, chief executive of Direct Edge, said: “If these types of programs are banned, it will drive liquidity away from exchanges and perpetuate a two-tier market.” The Direct Edge system was available to any brokerage that wished to participate, he said.BATS also said any trading firm could submit flash orders with its system and it was “ready to participate in an industry review of potential issues associated with them, including the possibility that they create a two-tier market”.NYSE Euronext does not allow flash orders and wants the practice stopped. “We are waiting to see how the regulatory landscape develops,” said Joe Mecane, NYSE Euronext’s chief administrative officer for US equities markets. “We have been vocal about our opposition to flashing orders.”In Europe, high-frequency trading firms have yet to attract the same level of regulatory attention as in the US. But they have been attracted to the region as a handful of new trading platforms, offering ultra-fast electronic trading, has sprung up in the wake of the Mifid reforms passed by the European Commission two years ago.The platforms, including Chi-X Europe, Turquoise and a European arm of BATS, also offer rebates to the firms to encourage them to post orders, making them the platforms’ largest customers. However doubts about the value of high-frequency firms have emrged at the London Stock Exchange, which this month abandoned similar rebates amid concern that it was alienating its biggest customers, the large banks that channel orders from so-called buy-side asset managers and pension funds.
630;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-07-21T19:49:54Z;SGX looks to broaden horizons;;The Singapore Exchange, which advertises itself as “Asia’s Gateway”, might have broader international ambitions, judging from its appointment of Magnus Böcker, Nasdaq OMX president, as its new chief executive.Mr Böcker was selected to replace Hsieh Fu Hua, who announced late last year he was stepping down as head of south-east Asia’s biggest bourse.But it is Mr Böcker’s background in technology and international market expansion that is drawing the most attention as a clue to the SGX’s future strategy as it competes against such regional rivals as the Hong Kong and Shanghai exchanges for new listings.“There is no doubt that Asia – and, in particular, Singapore and SGX – will play a crucial role and have significant influence in shaping tomorrow’s global financial landscape,” said Mr Böcker.The 47-year-old Swede was instrumental in the regional growth of the OMX, the Stockholm-based Nordic exchange group, and became head of the Nasdaq in March 2008 after he played a key role in the OMX’s merger with the New York-based exchange.Analysts believe Mr Böcker’s background in Europe and the US could help the SGX as it seeks to expand its network of alliances and attract listings from companies in Asia and elsewhere. The SGX last week signed an agreement with the Oslo exchange to promote dual listings in shipping and energy.Proposals by the SGX to promote the sharing of trading technology, as it tried to do with the Kuala Lumpur exchange, would strengthen partnerships with regional exchanges. Mr Böcker’s background would help in this regard.He headed the OMX’s technology division from 1996 to 2003 before becoming OMX chief executive.The OMX sells technology to more than 70 exchanges, including the SGX, as it moved towards full electronic trading.Mr Böcker “has distinguished himself in most areas of the exchange business and has a good understanding of the interplay of forces in the global exchange community”, said JY Pillay, SGX chairman, in announcing the appointment.But Mr Böcker also will have to focus attention on several recent controversies involving the SGX.Mr Hsieh, a former Morgan Grenfell banker, is credited with increasing the number of SGX-listed companies from 521 to 762 during his tenure by attracting mainly small and medium-sized Chinese companies.But the strategy recently suffered a setback as trading was suspended for a number of the Chinese listings due to accounting problems and allegations of poor corporate governance.This has prompted demands for more stringent listing requirements and triggered a debate about a potential conflict of interest in SGX’s regulatory supervision and its dominant market position in Singapore.
631;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-07-20T14:10:03Z;Fifth executive to leave Nasdaq OMX;;The departure of senior executives from Nasdaq OMX continued on Monday as Magnus Böcker, an important figure in the integration of Nasdaq and OMX, resigned to become chief executive of SGX, the exchange in Singapore.Nasdaq OMX has lost five senior staff in five months, including Chris Concannon, who headed the group’s clearing initiatives and oversaw Nasdaq OMX Europe, its London-based pan-European share trading platform. Darren Mulholland, a senior vice-president in technology, left at about the same time.The departure in December of David Warren, chief financial officer, was announced in February. Adam Nunes, in charge of Nasdaq’s US options market, left in April.Nasdaq OMX said Mr Böcker, in charge of listings, would step down on September 2 and would start at SGX in December. Mr Böcker started at OMX, the Nordic arm of Nasdaq OMX, 22 years ago, serving as chief financial officer and chief operating officer.Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq OMX chief executive, said: “Magnus built a ground-breaking, successful exchange and technology company in OMX, and he has played an integral role in the successful merger of Nasdaq OMX.“We are delighted that we can continue our partnership with Magnus in his role as a market technology customer.”In an interview with the Financial T imes this month, Mr Greifeld pointed out that the management team had remained constant for the past six years until the recent departures.“We try to recruit people not in the guise that you’re going to be a lifer [here]. We have a strong belief that deadlines increase productivity. I never want people to see their careers as an ‘endless ocean’,” Mr Greifeld said.Mr Böcker replaces Hsieh Fu Hua, a former Morgan Grenfell banker who has run SGX for more than six years. Mr Hsieh’s predecessor was Thomas Kloet, a US citizen who has become chief executive of TMX, the exchange group based in Toronto.Mr Böcker’s responsibilities will be assumed by Bruce Aust, executive vice-president, global corporate client group, and Anna Ewing, chief information officer.
632;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-07-13T10:09:19Z;LSE in talks with EMCF over stake;;"The London Stock Exchange is in talks with European Multilateral Clearing Facility (EMCF), a clearing house jointly owned by Nasdaq OMX and Fortis of the Netherlands, about the possibility of taking a stake in the venture, two people familiar with the matter said.If the LSE were to take a stake in EMCF, it would give Xavier Rolet, the exchange’s new chief executive, a stake in a pan-European clearing house that clears equities for more platforms than any rival.The move comes as EMCF is set this week to become an alternative clearer to Baikal, the LSE’s “dark pool” being readied for launch. Baikal was to have used the LSE’s Italian clearing house, Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia (CC&G) but is not yet ready to take on the job alone.Mr Rolet has made expanding the LSE’s post-trade business a priority. The LSE already has a relatively large clearing business in CC&G, which came with the LSE’s acquisition in 2007 of Borsa Italiana.The talks with EMCF, first reported by Financial News, also reflect the impact of a series of agreements that have been signed in recent weeks between clearing houses in Europe to “inter-operate” with each other. The European Commission has been pressing for such agreements to allow market participants more choice between different clearers. Inter-operability means that trading firms no longer have to post margin collateral with each clearing house they use.EMCF was established in early 2007 to provide competitive central counterparty (CCP) clearing services for a new breed of “multilateral trading facilities” (MTFs), including Chi-X Europe, which has captured 18 per cent of trading in the FTSE 100. EMCF is 22 per cent owned by Nasdaq OMX, with the rest held by Fortis, controlled by the Dutch government.EMCF clears for Chi-X Europe; BATS Europe; Nasdaq OMX Europe, an MTF owned by US-based Nasdaq OMX; and Nasdaq OMX Nordic, the Nordic market owned by the same US parent.The LSE declined to comment on any talks with EMCF.Erik Westerling, a spokesman for EMCF, declined to comment on any talks. But he said: “I can confirm that, as it looks right now, we will be the CCP when Baikal is launched and it’s definitely the intention to become interoperable as quickly as possible after Baikal’s launch. CC&G will not be ready as of day one.”Having a fully-functioning, pan-European clearer is likely to be crucial to the success or failure of Baikal, on which the LSE is pinning much of its hopes to expand beyond UK borders.One senior market expert said: “For Baikal to get any traction it’s got to have a sophisticated clearing and settlement system. Whether CC&G can offer that across the piece is unclear, but we know that EMCF can offer that.”Other market experts said that as interoperability spread across Europe, clearing fees would likely continue to fall, making it less attractive for the LSE to own a stake in a business like EMCF, which depends on cash equities clearing.However industry sources have said that the Dutch government has for some time been looking to offload the Fortis stake in EMCF."
633;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-07-08T11:03:56Z;Nordic clearing house drives Nasdaq OMX changes;;Nasdaq OMX plans to expand its Nordic clearing business into the rest of Europe as the transatlantic exchange group seeks to take advantage of the increasing appetite for clearing amid the re-regulation of the financial sector.Bob Greifeld, chief executive, said the group aimed to expand into pan-European derivatives clearing using its existing Nordic clearing house, part of Nasdaq OMX Derivatives Markets, which offers trading in Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, Danish, Icelandic, Russian and Baltic derivatives.“We really want our derivatives clearing capability to be European. It’s important for our Nordic clearing house to become a European clearing house,” Mr Greifeld said in an interview at Nasdaq OMX’s London office.He said the aim was to have “5 per cent of European [derivatives] clearing” by early next year.OMX is already withdrawing from EDX, a joint venture derivatives exchange operated with the London Stock Exchange, and which trades Scandinavian derivatives.“We certainly have plans to introduce additional products,” Mr Greifeld added.Nasdaq OMX has launched a series of clearing ventures in the past 18 months, including IDCG in December last year. “That’s [clearing] really our major focus,” Mr Greifeld said.The group is also working on a new US equities clearing house, to compete with The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the sole US clearing house for equities.LCH.Clearnet, Europe’s largest independent clearer, is already the dominant clearer of interest rate swaps.Its SwapClear unit clears more than half of all interest rate swaps in 14 different currencies, of which 36 per cent is denominated in euros, 33 per cent in dollars and the rest in yen and other currencies.Nasdaq rival the IntercontinentalExchange is already working with a group of key banks that use OTC credit default swaps on a clearing mechanism for such contracts.Industry experts say that for an exchange-driven OTC clearing mechanism to be successful, exchanges should bring in the biggest users of OTC products as co-investors.Nasdaq paid $85m last year for its stake in IDCG. It has so far cleared few contracts.Last week, Nasdaq agreed to sell a minority stake in the venture to Bank of New York Mellon.Mr Greifeld said IDCG was open to other investors.Asked why it was taking time to grow volumes on IDCG, Mr Greifeld said: “We are in the process of aligning with our customers. We are taking an OTC product and putting it in a futures wrapper. The clearing and settlement systems are not accustomed to this.“We will be in a position to be properly connected with our customers by the end of the third or fourth quarter.”
634;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-07-05T11:33:41Z;Innovation key to staying ahead in ESG game;;Are environmental, social and governance issues becoming old hat as part of the investment management mainstream? As the Norwegian government pension fund adds an extra layer of ESG information to its arsenal, some ESG managers find they are having to innovate to stay ahead.“We are an early warning view,” says Charlotte Mansson of Ecofact, which will supply the Norwegian fund with data from its RepRisk system. By looking at a host of global media sources, RepRisk identifies companies facing controversy in areas such as environmental impact or labour relations.“We find it’s very important to look at the live picture – quite often you will find a discrepancy between a nice CSR [corporate social responsibility] report and what’s going on on the ground,” says Ms Mansson, who claims Ecofact’s information is “unique”. “Our clients want to know if there are any environmental, social or reputational risks attached to the companies they invest in,” she adds.She points out that ESG or sustainability has become a must-have element of investment management. “You need to offer something at least, even if you don’t embrace it wholeheartedly.” However, most Ecofact clients are well established as proponents of sustainable investment and are using RepRisk to help differentiate themselves.Investors incorporating ESG factors have evolved over the years, according to Peter Ohnemus, chief executive of Asset4, which gathers data globally on companies’ ESG practices from company reports.“The first generation were the hippies, then the second generation was SRI. The third generation is value-based investing.”This is the stage he sees the industry having reached, after a “long road” as he and his competitors have struggled first to gain recognition for the concept, then to achieve consensus that it is a viable element of investment processes, and finally to work out standard indicators of ESG practice.“Our whole model is to give a standard framework so you can compare apples with apples,” says Mr Ohnemus.While the trend has been clear for some years, last year’s financial crisis gave it impetus, he says. “After the crisis, people are saying they need standardisation.”Corporate and social responsibility reporting is now the norm for public companies, making life easier for the likes of Asset4 and investment managers who wish to integrate ESG considerations into their investment strategies.“The most important thing is the agreement of key performance indicators,” says Mr Ohnemus. Investment managers have settled on between 30 and 70 KPIs, he adds. “Big corporates have taken this on board and are building this into their cockpits.”As the range of KPIs is accepted, investment banks are developing different frameworks to use the information, such as Goldman Sachs’s Sustain , while stock exchanges are developing benchmarks for companies to use in benchmarking themselves. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq offer such services.These developments are largely being driven by asset owners, says Mr Ohnemus, citing the large numbers (more than 400) of owners signing up to the UN’s Principles for Responsible Investing. Having signed up to this accord, they then require their investment managers to help them live up to its promises.Having struggled to come to grips with it, fund managers are becoming more at ease with the concept, says Mr Ohnemus. “The next generation of asset managers has been taught about these factors in their academic preparation,” he says.So internalised is the process, in fact, that it no longer necessarily provides a competitive advantage and asset owners and managers have to innovate to add value.This is confirmed by Sustainable Asset Management, which uses sustainability analysis as a key differentiator. Results of a study by parent company Robeco, released last week, show a performance advantage is gained by investing in companies that score well in SAM’s sustainability rankings. But the outperformance effect is decreasing.“We see some criteria that have performed well in the past [in helping select outperforming stocks] but have stabilised” as they became mainstream, says Stephanie Feigt, SAM’s chief investment officer. “We have to continue to innovate. It’s all about exploiting market inefficiencies.”For those investors who live in an entirely relative universe, this is bad news – as more managers track extra-financial issues, it becomes harder to achieve outperformance – but there is a more positive way to view this. As more asset owners and managers take account of sustainability general standards rise.
635;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-06-25T20:46:07Z;Clearing not the cure-all for financial system woes;;"Regulators and politicians are falling in love with clearing.Long overlooked as the unglamorous “plumbing” of the financial system, it is increasingly being seen as a solution – even the main solution – to ensuring that crises such as the Lehman Brothers collapse never happen again.This week, Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures regulator, pressed home the US administration’s desire to see swathes of hitherto uncleared, lightly regulated over-the-counter derivatives shifted into clearing houses.But, as with any love affair, warning voices are emerging. They say that clearing cannot be seen as a panacea by lawmakers as they move to clean up after the financial crisis.Roger Liddell, chief executive of LCH.Clearnet, Europe’s largest clearing house, says: “Clearing houses manage risk, they don’t work miracles. In this headlong rush to clearing, we must take care that clearing does not become an end in itself.” The enthusiasm for clearing – especially its use in OTC markets – is understandable.Most of the contracts entered into in the OTC derivatives markets are bilateral contracts between individual buyers and sellers, each exposed to the “counterparty risk” of default by the other side.The failure of a trading subsidiary of AIG, the US insurer, involved in certain opaque, uncleared OTC derivatives, left the financial system at risk of a catastrophe before AIG was rescued.Clearing systems also performed well throughout the crisis. Two of the world’s largest post-trade groups – The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation in the US and LCH.Clearnet – both managed down billions of dollars worth of outstanding Lehman exposures without needing to dip into their default funds.Exchanges that own clearing houses are seen as the main beneficiaries of the regulatory push on clearing. But even they are concerned that some of the more bespoke OTC contracts could end up in clearing houses that are ill-equipped to handle the risks associated with them.Those products could be more difficult to unwind because they are illiquid compared with more “standardised” products.The Committee of European Securities Regulators appeared to recognise this in a report this week.It said that in view of the “greater complexity of OTC derivatives and the relative illiquidity of certain contracts” it was “essential for [clearers] to be as transparent as possible for both regulators and users and to ensure effective risk management”.Competition between clearers is also a concern. The worry is that clearers might start to use certain functions such as margining as a way to lure customers.Ensuring that robust margining thresholds are maintained is a key part of a clearing house’s role. Many consider this aspect of risk management as a quasi-utility function, which could be used as a competitive tool to distinguish one clearer from another.In the US, the DTCC uses this argument to criticise plans by Nasdaq OMX, the transatlantic exchange, to start a new US equities clearing service to rival the DTCC – the sole clearer of US equities.Nasdaq OMX counters that risk comes from “over-concentration and over-reliance on one market participant, not from competition”.In Europe, clearing houses have proliferated to cater for a raft of new equities trading platforms that have emerged in the wake of the European Union’s markets in financial instruments directive, which sparked competition in share dealing.Diana Chan, chief executive of Euro CCP, the European arm of DTCC and clearer for Turquoise, says: “If users flock to [clearers] that require the lowest level of margin, then even those [clearers] that do not compete on risk will, over time, converge at the lowest level of margin requirement that is permitted by regulators.”The same concern applies to clearing of OTC credit default swaps, a particularly opaque part of the derivatives markets where exchanges and clearing groups are busy setting up clearing mechanisms.Another uncertainty is over who gets access to clearing. Operators that already offer trading of certain OTC products want to ensure that exchanges with their own clearers do not gain an advantage.Devin Wenig, chief executive of the markets division of Thomson Reuters, part-owner of Tradeweb, an OTC derivatives trading platform, says: “If the regulators are going to mandate clearing, then they should be treated like utilities and we should all have fair and equal access to them.”Clearing must also catch up with new risk management trends in the post-Lehman world. A big problem in the hours after the bank defaulted was that many of its counterparties did not know what their Lehman exposures were.That could have been solved with systems giving firms their exposures in real time.But Tony Freeman, director of European industry relations at Omgeo, a post-trade technology company, says: “The operational infrastructure is not in place for real-time margin processing. There is a big gap between what is possible in trading terms and what is possible in post-trading terms.”Ms Chan warns that if clearing houses take on more risks as more types of products are cleared, there are implications for the perceived soundness of a clearing house itself.The idea that a clearing house could not go under is “an assumption that was possible before the financial crisis”, she says, “but I don’t believe it’s an assumption that should go unchallenged now.”For a business that relies on the accurate valuation of financial instruments, timed to the latest second and tied to precise documentation, the origins of clearing are unclear, writes Jeremy Grant.Some academic research suggests that a primitive form of clearing existed in the temples of Babylon or, more reliably, in the rice markets of Osaka in Japan in the 18th century.Peter Norman, a British writer and journalist who is working on a history of clearing, says clearing in its current form, including the crucial guarantee against default, arrived on the scene relatively late, almost certainly in the coffee markets of the French port city of Le Havre in 1882.When a contract between a buyer and seller is submitted to a clearing house for clearing, the contract is “novated” to the clearer.That means that the clearing house is substituted as the counterparty to the contract, and stands between the buyer and the seller, guaranteeing that the transaction is done even if a trader defaults.In the same way that an insurer relies on a pool of premium payments to pay out on claims, a clearing house relies on a “default fund” consisting of funds deposited by a trading firm when it becomes a member of the clearing house; and margin collateral to support trading activity, posted daily by market participants.Shortly after the Le Havre model was created, clearing arrived in England at the London Produce Clearing House – a forerunner of the London Clearing House – which cleared trading in coffee and sugar.In the US, a form of clearing started at the Chicago Board of Trade, the grain exchange, in the 1880s.But modern clearing did not appear until the invention of financial futures at its cross-town rival the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in the 1970s.Today, many clearing houses are owned by exchanges, such as Eurex Clearing, which is part of Deutsche Börse. New clearing houses are still being created, the most recent being a US equities clearer planned by Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange."
636;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-06-24T03:24:25Z;Optiver backs new European share trading venture;;"The already crowded market for share-trading facilities in Europe received another entrant yesterday with the launch of Tom Trading, a venture based in Netherlands that is the first targeted at retail investors.It is a joint venture between Optiver, a privately held Dutch electronic trading firm, and BinckBank, a locally listed online bank. The companies said that Tom Trading would be extended to derivatives this year and clearing would be provided by Nasdaq OMX.The involvement of Optiver is a sign of the increasing role of a breed of electronic trading firm, also known as electronic liquidity providers, in US and European equity markets.Optiver is already a co-owner in Chi-X Europe, the first trading platform
to emerge to challenge Europe’s established exchanges as part of the Mifid reforms passed by the European Commission in late 2007.The proliferation of trading venues, or multilateral trading facilities (MTFs), in Europe has led to fragmentation of liquidity. Investor groups have said this makes it hard to achieve “best execution” – or the best price – for their clients.Tom, which stands for The Order Machine, will operate a search function that will seek out the best prices available on markets across Europe – a function common to many of the “smart order routing” systems already used by banks and some exchanges.Henk Wim van Arem, Tom chief executive, said: “At any given moment, Tom seeks out and compares the price and volume information on the most important stock exchanges and alternative trading platforms, thereby finding the most competitive price at which trading can be done for each order.”He said that Tom aimed to expand across Europe “within two years at most, but preferably sooner” to become an MTF. “Tom is already holding talks with market players about this.”"
637;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-06-19T17:51:07Z;Regulators set to shine light into ‘dark pools’;;All the share trades that are carried out every day on the New York and London share markets and around the world – prices, bid-offer spreads and trade sizes – are visible to every member of the investing public. Right?Wrong. That is the strange truth behind the emergence of “dark pools” of liquidity – a relatively new venue for the buying and selling of shares. Pre-trade prices – the price at which shares are offered for sale – are not visible to anyone, even the participants in them, and the price at which shares change hands is only revealed after the trade is done. No wonder dark pools have started to attract regulatory scrutiny. Sandy Frucher, a senior executive with Nasdaq OMX, said at a London conference a few weeks ago the big question was whether they would “pass the regulatory smell test”.This week he got his answer – or at least part of it. Mary Schapiro, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, said their “lack of transparency has the potential to undermine public confidence in the equity markets”. This is the first time that any regulator has sounded such alarm over dark pools.“The lack of reliable information can prompt speculation and suspicion about the basis for market fluctuations,” she said.Dark pools first emerged in the US over five years ago and are rapidly spreading in Europe.Their defenders say they allow institutional investors – mostly big banks and asset managers – to trade big blocks of shares more easily than on ordinary trading venues like the London Stock Exchange.In the old days, before electronic trading, getting large blocks done was a case of phoning a broker on a trading floor. The broker would work the crowd until a match was found.But now that electronic trading has replaced the trading pits, large orders are difficult to execute. That is because on exchanges, orders are being sliced into ever-smaller sizes by the increasing sophistication of computer-driven electronic trading. The average size of a trade on the New York Stock Exchange is 300 shares, while a typical large order in a dark pool can be as big as 55,000 shares.Any large order coming into the order book of an exchange would be immediately visible to rival traders, jeopardising the trade, dark pool operators say. That also explains why prices are only visible to traders entering a dark pool.Alfred Eskandar, director of corporate strategy at Liquidnet, which operates dark pools on both sides of the Atlantic, says: “The initial motive for ‘going dark’ was to protect a dark order from predatory participants in the markets and to stop the price moving against you.”Regulators are already scrambling to plug the gaps in how the opaque over-the-counter derivatives have been regulated. It now looks as if they are turning their attention to the more staid equities markets, where few would have imagined transparency was an issue.One of the SEC’s concerns is that dark pools could divert a sufficiently large amount of orders away from normal exchanges that it would be hard for ordinary investors to discern whether the prices they were seeing on the “lit” markets were accurate. That may not seem likely given that fewer than 9 per cent of all US equities trades are done on dark pools. But regulators have found their next target.
638;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-06-14T22:37:24Z;Brazil and HK bourses soar in global rankings;;Two of the biggest bourses in Asia and Latin America have for the first time overtaken rivals in New York and London by market capitalisation in a sign of how the economic crisis and tough competition in mature markets is reshaping the global exchange landscape.Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEx) and Brazil’s BM&F Bovespa have vaulted ahead of NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX and the London Stock Exchange in the value of shares in the exchange companies themselves.HKEx is now the world’s second-largest exchange by market value, behind CME Group, the largest US futures exchange. BM&F Bovespa is in fourth place, after Deutsche Börse, the German exchange. The LSE has slipped to 10th place.The recent stock market rally has boosted volumes at most exchanges. The monthly FTSE Mondo Visione Exchanges Index, released Monday, shows the the market value of listed exchanges rose by 27 per cent last month. That built on the previous two months’ rallies.Herbie Skeete, managing director of Mondo Visione, said: “Shares of listed exchanges are up across the board from their lows of 2008. Derivatives markets are leading the pack, in part on hopes that US and European regulators plan to regulate over-the-counter derivatives, which could help exchanges.”But the benefits of renewed market confidence have been felt less at the more established exchanges of New York and London. They face stiff competition from alternative trading platforms such as BATS and Direct Edge in the US and Chi-X and Turquoise in Europe.The Brazilian and Hong Kong exchanges also benefit from ownership of their own houses for clearing trades, which generates added revenues. NYSE Euronext does not own a clearer. Nasdaq OMX will soon launch US equities clearing. The LSE owns an Italian clearing house but its contribution to group revenues is modest.BM&F Bovespa has been closing down its trading pits and expanding into electronic trading to make it easier for overseas traders to access the exchange. Next month, the Brazilian bourse opens a London office.Trading volume on HKEx has surged in recent months on the back of strong inflows from investors shifting to equities as they seek higher returns. HKEx shares have risen nearly 70 per cent since the start of the year.
639;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;NYSE Euronext and Liquidnet to launch ‘dark pool’ tracking tracker;;NYSE Euronext, the transatlantic exchange group, and Liquidnet, one of the largest US-based “dark pool” equity trading platforms, have agreed to set up a service that will allow companies to get a better indication of how investors intend to trade their stocks.Under the terms of the agreement, NYSE Euronext-listed companies will be able to see the ratio of intended buy orders against intended sell orders in their company’s stock in the Liquidnet dark pool.That ratio would help companies to react more effectively to developments that may be moving their share price – such as market rumours – by analysing buy and sell trends on the stock in the dark pool.The two companies said the new service, Liquidnet InfraRed, would “aggregate institutional demand, news sentiment and block trading data”.They said: “For the first time [investor relations officers and chief financial officers] will be enabled to take an active approach in their outreach to their targeted institutional investors.”Dark pools allow anonymous matching of large share trades with prices posted only after completion of the trade.They are increasingly popular among institutional and high-frequency traders, who find it hard to get large orders transacted on regulated exchanges. Trades on such so-called public order books are becoming smaller, which increases the risk of markets moving against the originator of a large order.Some exchanges, including NYSE Euronext and its main rival Nasdaq OMX, have developed their own dark pools. NYSE has an agreement on block trading access with Bids Trading.Seth Merrin, Liquidnet chief executive, said: “The corporate access business, in its current state, is highly inefficient and a perfect example of how legacy practices often fail to serve the needs of issuers and investors alike.“We believe that this new model will mitigate the inherent conflicts that often arise in servicing both the portfolio managers at our member firms and NYSE Euronext’s corporate issuers.”Some observers have expressed concerns about the amount of trading in equities that takes place away from the public markets, and the impact on price discovery and transparency.But supporters of dark pools say they aggregate liquidity, allow institutional traders to complete large orders, and reduce the trading costs of portfolios.
640;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-06-08T18:15:12Z;BM&F Bovespa challenges global exchanges;;Open outcry trading on the BM&F, the Brazilian derivatives exchange, will end on June 30. The move completes a migration to electronic trading that began in 1990 on the Bovespa, the São Paulo stock exchange with which the BM&F merged a year ago.If BM&FBovespa has been slow to complete a change made years ago by many of the world’s better-known exchanges, it is moving quickly to challenge them for world leadership.It is already bigger by market value than NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX and the London Stock Exchange. Technology being introduced this year should keep it growing quickly.The exchange also has its own clearing house, an added benefit at a time when clearing has become central to the clean-up of the financial system.Bernardo Mariano of Equity Research Desk, a New York research company specialising in exchanges, says: “Brazil has a very interesting macro story, and this is a commodities-based exchange, which makes it a great hedge against global inflation,”“Add to that that they are just implementing direct market access and co-location, and this will help it expand very significantly.”In fact, direct market access – or DMA, by which traders can directly access an exchange’s trading system – has been operating on the equities side since 1999.But change at BM&FBovespa is increasingly being driven by traders’ demands for “multi-asset” trading of equities, futures and options on one exchange. This factor has driven similar mergers, such as the combination of the Australian Stock Exchange and Sydney Futures Exchange in 2006.While the equities side took its time to adapt to electronic trading, recent changes have happened much more quickly. In interest-rate futures contracts, one of the BM&F’s highest-volume products, it took only two months for the shift to electronic trading to occur. This compares with about nine months when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) underwent the same process with its flagship interest rate contract in 2004.BM&FBovespa is also upgrading on the equities side. Until last month, its electronic system limited the number of “messages” received from equities traders – offers to buy or sell that may or may not become trades – to about 770,000 a day. This fell far short of demand, especially from overseas traders, who typically send nine messages for every completed trade.BM&FBovespa has been charging extra fees to traders with high ratios of messages to trades, adding a considerable cost to their activity.The system is being upgraded to take 1.5m messages a day: enough, says Paulo Oliveira, director for new business, to ensure traders will be able to operate freely.But the pressure is on BM&FBovespa to keep advancing. Frank Piasecki, president of ACTIV Financial, a global market data provider, says: “It needs to continue targeting sophisticated traders who capitalise on algorithmic and automated trading strategies and produce high trade volumes”.BM&FBovespa is moving to address this and will open an office next month in London, home to a huge concentration of algorithmic traders. The group already has offices in Shanghai and New York.The biggest step it has taken overseas was a deal with the CME in February last year, when the CME swapped 2 per cent of its own shares for 10 per cent of the BM&F. Customers of the two exchanges can trade directly on both.More technology will be introduced next week, when the exchange joins the global trend to “co-location,” in which big customers can install computer servers inside the exchange’s data centres to enact high-speed automated trades that seek out opportunities between different asset classes.
641;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-06-04T08:55:56Z;Brazilian exchange to open London office;;BM&F Bovespa, the Brazilian exchange, plans to open a London office next month as part of a push to encourage greater foreign participation in its rapidly-growing electronically-driven equities and derivatives markets.The exchange, like Brazil itself, has weathered the financial crisis better than most of its global rivals, with rising volumes that have helped make the Latin American bourse the world’s fourth largest by market capitalisation.That puts it ahead of NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX and the London Stock Exchange.Paulo de Sousa Oliveira, chief business development officer, said the opening of the London office would build on the opening of another in Shanghai in 2004, and an existing office in New York.It was aimed at increasing the share of foreign participation in the exchange’s derivatives markets from a current level of around 20 per cent. Foreign participation in its equities markets stands at around 35 per cent.BM&F Bovespa is the product of the merger in 2007 of the Bovespa equities exchange and the BM&F derivatives exchange. Since then, the group has been rapidly shifting from “open outcry” trading to electronic. Its shares have risen by 90 per cent since the start of the year, compared with a 56 rise in the FTSE Mondo Visione Exchanges Index.The expansion into electronic trading, combined with the installation of “direct market access” (DMA) systems for foreign traders, has allowed BM&F Bovespa to tap a growing number of traders globally that want exposure to Brazilian derivatives such as stock index futures and a commodity futures such as soyabeans.Previously, foreign traders would have to call a broker in Brazil on the telephone. The broker would then place the order on the exchange.DMA allows traders outside the host country of an exchange - particularly those using trading algorithms increasingly common in electronic trading - to access BM&F Bovespa products electronically without using an intermediary.Mr Oliveira said about 60 per cent of derivatives volume on the exchange was the result of DMA trading, compared with almost zero last year. DMA accounted for 54 per cent of equities volume, and was “ really growing” he said.The only remaining open outcry pit, where “Ibovespa” stock index futures are traded by around 200 traders, will be closed next month. “It’s the end of an era,” Mr Oliveira told the Financial Times at the Mondo Visione Exchange Forum.To further improve access by foreign traders, BM&F Bovespa will on June 15 launch a “co-location” service. Co-location is increasingly common among exchanges and allows traders to physically locate the computer servers in exchange data centres, right next to – or metres from – the exchange’s matching engine itself. This helps cut the time it takes for trades to be executed.BM&F Bovespa also has a cross-shareholding arrangement with CME Group, the Chicago-based derivatives exchange. This includes an “order routing agreement” enabling customers in more than 80 countries using CME’s Globex electronic trading platform to trade BM&F Bovespa products directly, via the Brazilian exchange’s electronic trading platform.
642;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-05-20T20:03:04Z;Furse the link to Rolet and LSE’s new evolutionary era;;"What if the missing link is not a 47m-year-old female named Ida but a 51-year-old female named Clara?Dame Clara Furse’s departure as chief executive of the London Stock Exchange is an invitation to City palaeontologists to place her in the timeline of the LSE’s development from user-owned club run by dinosaurs to fast-moving international marketplace with opposable thumbs.First, they have to set aside the inevitable goodwill impairment on the Borsa Italiana deals (which leaves her last full-year results recording an unflattering loss of £251m before tax). Then they can cite a tripling of revenues, a quintupling of operating profit and a sevenfold increase in dividends as evidence of progress in the Furse era.That still leaves the frustration of a share price that trades at a discount to big exchange competitors such as Deutsche Börse and NYSE Euronext. It’s unfair to blame the chief executive for resisting a takeover by Deutsche Börse, Nasdaq or Macquarie. The first offer came at a price that certainly undervalued the exchange; the last two were bids based on what now looks like perilously high leverage. But Dame Clara was guilty of moving late into derivatives and reacting to customer pressure for fee cuts and block-trading of equities only when pushed by regulatory change and increased competition.That said, the current valuation gap fails to recognise some of those developments. Borsa Italiana, for instance, has broadened the LSE’s range – these results were bolstered by Italian post-trade services – customer base and capabilities.Xavier Rolet, Dame Clara’s successor, could be taking over at the perfect time. He’ll benefit if recovery takes hold and the downturn in new listings, the daily value of LSE trades, and the number of users of its data reverses. But to do so, he will, like Ida’s descendants, need to leave the old era behind and evolve to meet new challenges.No need to shoutSo that’s how the banks are going to rebuild their profits. Yell Group, the heavily indebted publisher of the Yellow Pages directories, disclosed on Wednesday that its cost of debt was just above 8 per cent. That’s a lot. Fortunately (for the banks and for Yell), the company throws off more than enough cash to service the debt and meet repayments. It also managed to reduce leverage slightly. Less fortunate is the impact on revenues and profits as the recession whacks Yell’s customer base of small and medium-sized businesses.The company said Wednesday that the quarter ending in June would see revenues fall 11 per cent while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation would be down 20 per cent. That guidance has got to be a disappointment, even if the earnings number reflects the negative impact of investments that Yell has brought forward. It certainly focuses attention on the main question: could Yell end up in breach of its covenants and, if so, what will happen next? The company, with admirable devotion to transparency, set out what would have to happen for its covenant headroom to be whittled away: a year-on-year fall in ebitda of 13 per cent over the next four quarters. That may still seem extreme, given adjusted ebitda fell only 1.8 per cent for the 2009 fiscal year, but worse things have happened.In spite of the shock factor of a potential breach, the reality is less dramatic. The banks have every interest in continuing to collect their interest payments, which are not at risk. There are also a few levers Yell can pull – it could cut back on investment, flog a business or refinance early – before shareholders need worry about being buried by a debt for equity swap.Strategic thinkingIt’s good news that venture capital, biotech and information technology groups have joined forces to badger Lord Mandelson about the £750m vaguely promised in the Budget for a “strategic investment fund”. On the day, private equity and Nesta, the government-backed VC fund, issued apparently conflicting reactions to the new initiative. Now they’re using the same hymn sheet. But getting the department of business to sing in tune could be tricky.The strategic investment fund’s main objective – to invest in advanced projects such as low-carbon technologies and life sciences – is a fair one. It also tallies with what private sector VC funds already want to do. Lord Mandelson’s first instinct, therefore, should be to delegate deployment of the funds to them. Ensuring the money goes only to UK businesses may be harder but there are ways to achieve this, such as attaching “sidecar” funds to existing pots of private sector cash. Then comes the hard part: convincing the government not to try to pick winners by attaching any additional strings.andrew.hill@ft.comYell: charis.gresser@ft.com"
643;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-05-07T17:56:15Z;Nasdaq profits plunge 22%;;Nasdaq OMX Group on Thursday reported a 22 per cent decline in first-quarter profit as rivals continued to cut into its market share in US equity trading.The exchange group reported earnings of $94m, or 44 cents per share, compared with $121m, or 69 cents per share, in the same quarter last year.Its shares were down 7.5 per cent at $19.99 by midday in New York.Nasdaq is locked in a fierce battle for market share in the US cash equities trading business with long-time rival NYSE Euronext and two smaller competitors, BATS Exchange, a Kansas City-based upstart that gained exchange status last year, and Direct Edge, a Jersey City-based rival.Analysts have expressed concern recently about the company’s loss of three of its most senior executives in the past few weeks: David Warren, chief financial officer, Chris Concannon, executive vice-president of transaction services and technology senior vice-president Darren MulhollandNet exchange revenues were $369m, a decrease of $50 m, or 12 per cent, from last year.This decline was due primarily to a fall in the number of shares matched by Nasdaq.The company’s operating expenses jumped 40 per cent in the quarter.It said it expected operating expenses of $830m to $850m for the full year, compared with $10m from a projection it gave three months ago.Record volume on its US options platforms – where its market share rose to 21 per cent last month – could go some way to offsetting the relative weakness in cash equities in the US and in Europe.Derivative trading net exchange revenues were $55m for the quarter, a decrease of $2m from the same period last year.The drop was primarily due to lower Nordic derivative trading volumes, which were down 34 per cent from the first quarter of 2008.David Easthope, senior analyst with Celent, a Boston-based financial research and consulting firm, said: “At its core, an exchange is a technology company, and Nasdaq has been delivering platform synergies for many years. However, the continued weakness of cash trading volumes, especially in Europe, is likely to pressure Nasdaq to stay very focused on cost savings, while hoping for a possible rebound at some point in the cash business.”
644;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-05-04T20:02:18Z;Time runs short for LCH.Clearnet;;By walking away from its bid for LCH.Clearnet last week, The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation moved the drama of the London-based clearer a step closer to resolution.It boosted the chances of a takeover by a consortium of 11 banks and Icap, the inter-dealer broker.But the decision also exposed how time is running out for LCH.Clearnet – which is the clearer for the London Stock Exchange, London Metal Exchange and of some important over-the-counter derivatives – to deal with challenges that could threaten its position as the region’s only remaining user-owned clearer.The outcome will decide the extent to which end users – banks, brokers, asset managers, pension funds and ordinary investors – can trade Europe’s markets more cheaply than at present.A clearing house is part of the post-trade infrastructure that underpins most securities trading. A clearer stands between two parties to a trade in case of default.Worryingly for LCH.Clearnet, exchanges with their own clearers are expanding cross-border, driven by increasing competition in cross-border share trading.Eurex Clearing, owned by Deutsche Börse, last month published plans to offer pan-European clearing.In addition, a rash of small trading platforms that have emerged in the last two years – such as Chi-X, Turquoise and BATS Europe – have produced new clearers to support them, such as EMCF and Euro CCP, the DTCC’s European equities clearing unit.That has led to a price war, exposing LCH.Clearnet as the expensive incumbent on clearing fees.At the same time, debate rages over whether London and continental Europe are best-served by competition between for-profit clearers offering cross-border clearing services, or by preservation of a single, pan-European, user-owned utility in the form of LCH.Clearnet — or some combination.Miguel Pintado, analyst at Standard & Poor’s, says LCH.Clearnet faces “a dynamic operating environment, which offers threats and opportunities to the group’s competitive position”.Last week LCH.Clearnet acted to cut clearing fees for important European equities by 30 per cent from July. Further cuts are in prospect.For traders in London, to bring clearing fees down is more important than achieving cheaper trading fees. Competition between the London Stock Exchange, Chi-X and the other platforms has already brought trading fees down dramatically in the last 12 months.As LCH.Clearnet awaits the Icap consortium’s bid, it is wooing clients and is also working on a plan to convert itself to a more streamlined shareholding structure along the lines of the DTCC, which clears and settles trades in the US. But LCH.Clearnet must also address problems that have dogged it since 2003, when the group was formed by the merger of the London Clearing House and Clearnet SA, a Paris-based clearer.LCH.Clearnet’s critics point out LCH and Clearnet still charge different fees, long after the clearer had been expected to behave commercially as one entity. LCH.Clearnet also has yet to harmonise its London and Paris technology platforms, a move that was supposed to have meant substantial clearing fee reductions when the merger was touted five years ago.Alberto Pravettoni, LCH.Clearnet head of strategy, argues it has been hard to tackle the technology issue with market participants in London and Paris using different securities settlement protocols: “There is a set of players that have to go through pretty big technology changes in the UK and France – and that’s the bit that hasn’t been agreed.”Euroclear, LCH.Clearnet’s largest shareholder with 15.8 per cent, has sympathy with that. But Pierre Francotte, Euroclear chief executive, says: “I think what has renewed urgency is for LCH.Clearnet to have a credible plan for integration now they are going to be discussing the two remaining options on the table.”Meanwhile, competition is intensifying. Last month EMCF, jointly owned by Nasdaq OMX and Fortis, cut clearing fees for UK equities by 40 per cent. Mr Francotte says: “LCH.Clearnet must look for ways to secure its client base and its business flows.”
645;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-04-30T19:31:23Z;Nasdaq OMX Europe slashes costs;;Nasdaq OMX Europe, the pan-European share trading platform,is to attempt to bolster its market share by slashing the fee it charges traders for seeking to match orders.The platform has struggled to win business since it was launched at the end of September.Some alternative trading platforms and exchanges in Europe have been trying to to find the right balance between paying rebates to market makers to encourage them to post orders on their platforms – and charging other traders for coming in and matching those orders. The model, known as “maker-taker”, is where market makers post – or “make” – prices, while those coming in and matching them are the “takers”. An exchange or smaller platform makes money by charging the taker more than it pays the maker.However striking a balance between whether to pay makers – and hope that the takers will come – or seeking to attract liquidity takers has proved hard for some – notably Nasdaq OMX Europe – as competition has in European share trading increases.The platform, owned by US-based Nasdaq OMX, is trailing the three leading so-called “multilateral trading facilities” (MTFs): Chi-X, Turquoise and BATS Europe. At its launch, Nasdaq OMX Europe started charging takers of liquidity 0.25 basis points on the value of a trade, while paying makers 0.25bp in a bid to gain market share.Charlotte Crosswell, chief executive, said there had been a focus by MTFs on providing incentives for posters of liquidity but she believed it was more effective to “tailor your offering for takers”.From today, the MTF will charge takers of liquidity in French, Belgian and Dutch blue chips 0.15bp, making it the cheapest platform in Europe for such pricing. For “makers”, it will pay 0.15bp, slightly less than a previous 0.2bp.Ms Crosswell said the move was designed to build market share on these three markets. Yesterday, in apparent anticipation of the changes, traders increased their use of Nasdaq OMX Europe for CAC-40 stocks, giving it a share of more than 1 per cent, against 0.1 per cent three weeks ago.
646;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-04-23T21:09:25Z;US shares struggle on economic news;;US stocks struggled for direction before ending higher on Thursday as investors reacted to quarterly earnings reports from companies including Apple and United Parcel Service and digested more disappointing economic news.UPS reported quarterly profits that missed analysts’ estimates and forecast no quick turnaround as the global economic downturn continued to take its toll on the world’s largest package delivery group.Its quarterly net income fell by 56 per cent, from $906m a year earlier to $401m. Its shares fell 2.6 per cent to $53.33. Shares in its main competitor, FedEx, which like UPS has been on a cost-cutting drive, rose 3.4 per cent to $55.04.In contrast, Apple said after the market closed on Wednesday that its profit had risen 15 per cent to $1.21bn, or $1.33 a share, compared with forecasts of $1.08. Its shares closed 3.2 per cent higher at $125.40 in spite of a relatively downbeat forecast for the current quarter, with revenues estimated at $7.7bn-$7.9bn and earnings at $0.95-$1 a share.The previous session had ended lower with leading indices giving up an earlier rally, leaving some analysts to express doubt about the sustainability of the rebound. A late sell-off in the financial sector had erased gains made during a choppy trading day on Wall Street.By the close in New York, the S&P 500 was 1 per cent higher at 851.92 points while the Nasdaq Composite index was 0.4 per cent higher at 1,652.21 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.9 per cent higher at 7.957.06 points.The CBOE’s Vix index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, was down 2.5 per cent at 37.15 and remains significantly below highs of approaching 90 reached last year, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.Disappointing economic news also weighed on stocks with a weekly report on jobless claims saying the number of people filing new claims for unemployment insurance in the week ending April 18 rose by 27,000 to a higher than expected 640,000, while continuing claims crept up again to a new record high.The pace of sales of existing homes in the US fell 3 per cent in March to a sharply lower-than-expected 4.57m unit annual rate, according to the National Association of Realtors.Shares ended higher led by late gains for banks and companies involved in the credit card business. These moved higher after senior executives from the industry met with President Barack Obama. Representatives from banks including Wells Fargo, Visa, JPMorgan, MasterCard and Visa, were among those at the meetings. Wells Fargo shares rose 10.5 per cent to $20.09 while Capital One shares rose 17.7 per cent to $16.93.The earnings season is in full swing with many reports issued before the bell on Thursday and several more due after the close.

Microsoft, American Express and Amgen were due to report after the closing bell last night. Microsoft shares moved 1.2 per cent lower to $18.54.The exchange sector was in focus as profits at the CME Group operator of the world’s largest futures exchange, plunged by 30 per cent in the first three months of the year from the same period in 2008.But in spite of this, CME shares rose 9.4 per cent, to $239 leading other exchanges groups higher.Shares in NYSE Euronext were up 13.7 per cent at $23.37 while Nasdaq OMXshares rose 3.3 per cent.
647;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-04-20T13:40:00Z;LSE loses top markets executive;;"The London Stock Exchange lost one of its key executives as Martin Graham, head of markets, resigned amid a reorganisation of the top structure of the group.The surprise move is an early sign of changes that are taking place as Xavier Rolet, its new chief executive, seeks to put his stamp on the more than 200 year-old bourse in the weeks before he succeeds Dame Clara Furse.Mr Graham, who joined the LSE six years ago, was responsible for overseeing the LSE’s main Sets market and was a key figure behind the LSE’s response to the competitive threats posed by a rash of new, smaller competitors such as Chi-X, Turquoise and Bats Europe.The LSE last year instigated deep fee cuts, launched rebates for high-frequency traders and started work on the launch of its first “dark pool” block trading facility, known as Baikal.Mr Graham will be replaced by Raffaele Jerusalmi, the LSE group head of derivatives, a former Borsa Italiana executive who was in charge of derivatives and fixed income at the LSE.The exchange said Mr Jerusalmi’s “enlarged role” was “part of a streamlining of the senior management structure, which will now be organised around three core business units”.These are capital markets, post trade, and technology and information services.By making a derivatives specialist head of markets, the LSE appears to be signalling a renewed emphasis on derivatives at a time when the exchange lags behind its global rivals in derivatives.NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX have recently been expanding into derivatives, which are a higher margin business than cash equities. LSE rival Deutsche Börse has been cushioned from
the worst effects of recent dismal equity markets by having a robust derivatives business in Eurex.Mr Graham also headed Aim, the LSE’s junior board, and helped expand the exchange’s appeal as a
global listings venue.The LSE yesterday said: “Martin Graham has decided to leave . . . after six years leading the company’s equity markets division. We thank Martin for his important contribution to our business and wish him every success for the future.”While the LSE frequently has been criticised for poor customer relations, the emergence of competition has prompted a change of approach that is likely to accelerate under Mr Rolet.Tony Whalley, investment director at Scottish Widows and a director of Chi-X, said there was still an “old school-new school” divide within the LSE. He said of Mr Graham’s departure: “I think it’s a shame, Martin was certainly more customer-focused than a lot of
previous incumbents.”Mr Rolet spent years dealing with exchanges, including the LSE, when he was a senior manager at Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs. Analysts saw the appointment of someone from the LSE’s biggest customers as a sign of the exchange’s determination to further improve relations with its customers. The shares fell 29p at 660p."
648;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-04-19T17:49:47Z;Exchanges come round to multilateral approach;;When exchange executives and trading companies arrive in Paris for the annual Trade Tech industry conference on Tuesday, they will be gathering at a pivotal moment for European share trading.Last week, Deutsche Börse unveiled plans to launch a pan-European trading platform designed to take on the London Stock Exchange by next year.And the LSE will this week reveal the next stage of its pan-European strategy by announcing the technology providers for Baikal – a new block trading facility for large orders across the region.Although the two are taking different approaches they have both learnt the same important lesson in the past two years: the rash of smaller rivals have proved there is appetite for trading on a pan-European scale.That the big exchanges took so long to learn this might seem surprising. After all, it was in 2007 that the European Commission affirmed pan-European share trading when it enacted the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or Mifid.That broke the monopolies of the exchanges, allowed the launch of alternative share trading platforms and triggered competition across the region.The new players – known as multilateral trading facilities (MTFs) – quickly grasped that Mifid was likely to create an integrated market and launched their offerings on a pan-European basis from day one.The biggest exchanges concentrated on their home markets, hoping to fend off the MTFs by cutting fees and upgrading trading systems. Today, MTFs account for about 20 per cent of trading in the largest shares across Europe’s main markets, with Chi-X holding the lion’s share.Frank Gerstenschläger, a Deutsche Börse executive board member, says: “What we really learnt from the MTFs was that there is demand for pan-European markets. I’m convinced that in the next two to five years we will come to a single, pan-European market.”A further uncomfortable truth for Deutsche Börse and the LSE is that their moves are a vindication for NYSE Euronext, their main rival in Europe. It has operated something approaching a pan-European market through its Paris-based unit Euronext, which combines the Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Portuguese markets. Last month NYSE Euronext filled in gaps by launching NYSE Arca Europe, its own MTF, covering stocks from a further 11 countries.LSE and Deutsche Börse are diving into a bewildering array of players operating in European share-trading, including exchanges, four standalone MTFs, two exchange-owned MTFs and so-called dark pool block trading systems – both independent and exchange-owned. But a question remains over how many will survive.If the US is anything to go by, weaker players will fail or be absorbed via consolidation – something that could be hastened if the bear market rally peters out – and cost pressures return.That will leave the big European exchanges competing with a small number – perhaps as few as three – relatively large MTFs.In the US, Kansas-based BATS, a US-style MTF, claims to be the third largest stock exchange after NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX. It is the only US platform trying its luck across the Atlantic. BATS Europe has 3.36 per cent of the FTSE 100 and 2.67 per cent of the Dax, according to the Fidessa Fragmentation Index. That may not seem much. But Mark Hemsley, its chief executive in Europe, says it is better than expected five months after launch. “We always went into this with a two-year programme that looked at break-even after that time. We are funded accordingly and I am very confident in our longevity.”The race will not be decided merely by who is the cheapest and fastest: providing cost-effective, pan-European clearing and settlement is also vital. These post-trade services account for the bulk of the overall cost of executing a trade.As the G20 summit showed, governments want clearing to be more widely adopted as a way of ensuring there are safeguards against future financial crises. A clearing house stands between two parties to a trade, stepping in when there is a default.Deutsche Börse’s plan for European clearing rests on making use of its Eurex Clearing unit not only to handle European stocks but to aid their settlement in each national market.The LSE plans to use the clearing assets of its Borsa Italiana unit, but will offer users a choice in where their trades are cleared in each national market – a strategy more in keeping with Brussels’ desire to see more clearing choice across Europe. The rival MTFs use much smaller clearers, with shorter track records.With the next stage in European competition set, the late entrance of the big exchanges is still raising eyebrows. “Why all these national exchanges have sat on their hands for so long just eludes me,” says Mr Hemsley.
649;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-04-15T14:32:45Z;Nasdaq OMX loses key executive;;"Nasdaq OMX on Wednesday lost a key executive behind the transatlantic exchange group’s push into the clearing business with the resignation of Chris Concannon, executive vice president in charge of transaction services.The surprise departure of Mr Concannon, considered by many as the most likely successor to chief executive Bob Greifeld, comes as Nasdaq is at the forefront of moves by exchanges to expand into clearing as risk management services have shot to prominence in the amid the financial crisis.Policymakers and regulators want the use of clearing to be extended to a broad swathe of over-the-counter derivatives. Leaders at the recent G20 meeting re-iterated their desire for more clearing and other risk management systems to reduce counterparty risk in the financial system.Counterparty risk refers to the risk that a party to a trade may default. Clearing is the mechanism by which the completion of a trade is guaranteed in the event of a default by a clearing house using the funds it holds on margin from traders.Nasdaq OMX said Mr Concannon would leave on April 30 and would join Virtu Financial, a newly formed proprietary trading firm, as a partner.Mr Greifeld said: “Chris has played a major part in our growth and success over the last six years and he has been a trusted and valued partner.“His entrepreneurial, competitive style has served us well and we wish him much success as he pursues a new and different path,” he said.Mr Concannon, a former lawyer at the Securities and Exchange Commission, joined Nasdaq from Instinet Clearing Services in 2003. At Nasdaq, he oversaw various acquisitions, including the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and the Boston Stock Exchange.He was one of the lead executives involved in an array of clearing initiatives in recent months, which now have Nasdaq managing eight clearing mechanisms.They include International Derivatives Clearing Group, which clears OTC interest rate swaps; a central counterparty clearing system for the Nordic markets served by the OMX arm of the Nasdaq group; and Nord Pool Clearing, which clears power derivatives.Nasdaq is also working on the launch of an equities clearing platform that would compete with the sole equities clearer in the US so far, The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation.Mr Concannon was also in charge of the launch of Nasdaq OMX Europe, the London-based, pan-European equities platform that is one of six so-called “multilateral trading facilities” that are battling for market share in European equities trading.Mr Concannon said: “My time at Nasdaq OMX has been both personally and professionally fulfilling. I have watched Nasdaq OMX grow from a single cash equity exchange into the world’s leading global marketplace.”"

Both developments highlight how weak equity markets and intense competition between small trading venues and exchanges is forcing costs down, in post-trade services as well as in trading.Post-trade services – principally clearing and settlement – are the largest components of the overall cost of trading and often determine where traders send their orders.EMCF, a clearing house owned by Nasdaq OMX, the transatlantic exchange, and Fortis, acts as clearer for Chi-X, BATS Europe and Nasdaq OMX Europe, three of the five so-called “multilateral trading facilities” (MTFs) launched recently to compete against the region’s incumbent exchanges.Euro CCP clears for a further two – Turquoise and NYSE Arca Europe – as well as for Smartpool, a “dark pool” block trading facility launched last month by NYSE Euronext.Cuts in trading fees have spread rapidly across Europe in recent weeks as exchanges and their smaller rivals – known as “multilateral trading facilities” (MTFs) – have tried to maintain their market share. The MTFs have also tried to stop liquidity slipping to rival MTFs.Last week, Turquoise, one of the first MTFs to launch, introduced rebates after its market share almost halved after market-making commitments from its founding nine banks expired.EMCF said that from April 14, its UK equities clearing fee would drop to €0.03 per trade from €0.05 currently. The fee for other European equities cleared by EMCF would remain at €0.05.Jan Booij, chief executive, said: “Increasing competition, most notably in the UK segment, has triggered a competitive response from EMCF. We send a strong message to the trading and clearing community: ‘we will continue our price reductions based upon volume growth and competitor pricing’,” he said.LCH.Clearnet, which dominates UK equities clearing, charges on a sliding scale depending on volume traded. It said that “at least 70 per cent” of trades cleared this year on its EquityClear system were charged at 4.7p (€0.05) per trade or less. Some larger volume traders can pay as low as 3p.

Some larger volume traders can pay as low as 3p.However LCH.Clearnet’s fees do not include a “service fee” levied by Crest, the UK settlement services provider owned by Euroclear. The fee is charged to market participants trading UK equities on the LSE, adding to the overall trading costs for market participants using the LSE.SIS X-Clear, a Swiss clearer, started competing with LCH.Clearnet in UK equities clearing in mid-December but implemented a fee cut a month later.Euro CCP, owned by The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the US post-trade provider, last week cut its pan-European clearing fee to €0.05, from €0.06.
652;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-03-30T23:06:08Z;Fee cuts for Europe’s equity traders;;Europe’s equity trading markets yesterday saw a fresh wave of fee cuts and other incentives by exchange groups and operators of clearing services, as the battle for market share intensifies amid weak volumes.Nasdaq OMX Europe, one of the region’s five smaller trading platforms, said it would offer participants options to buy shares in its US-based parent, Nasdaq OMX, if they passed sufficient number of trades through the platform.Euro CCP, the European clearing subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, the US post-trader services provider, said it would cut its clearing fees. Euro CCP acts as the clearer for Turquoise, one of five smaller platforms – also known as “multilateral trading facilities”.The moves came as Eli Lederman, Turquoise chief executive, launched a blistering critique of market participants, saying they would “rue the day” they did not shift more trading to the MTFs and that Europe’s incumbent exchanges might start to raise prices.“A year ago banks and brokers would have thought it a kind of utopia to have competition for exchange and clearing services, and today they have it.“If they do all just make the move, trading will be better for them and for their clients. If they don’t, it’s tantamount to them asking to reprieve the hegemony of exchanges,” he told the Financial Times.His comments reflect frustration among some market participants that the competition heralded by the enactment of Brussels’ Mifid directive liberalising share trading has not led to a greater shift away from established exchanges.The MTFs are engaged in a price war with each other as well as with incumbent exchanges, which has intensified amid weak equity markets. Exchanges have themselves launched MTFs, confusing the picture.Turquoise this month saw its volume halve as market-making commitments from its nine founding banks ran out. Tomorrow the MTF will introduce its third fee incentive programme since launch, offering rebates for traders that post orders on Turquoise.Nasdaq OMX Europe’s share of trading in European markets has remained well below 1 per cent since launch, partly because it does not have large market making firms – also known as “high frequency traders” – as shareholders.Charlotte Crosswell, Nasdaq OMX Europe chief executive, said: “We are expecting some more of the high frequency traders in between now and the end of the May”.
653;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-03-30T19:54:03Z;Exchanges to suffer from fall in trading;;"The global financial crisis will exert negative pressure on the profitability of equities and derivatives exchanges this year, as lower issuance and volumes hit a sector that has, so far, weathered the global financial crisis relatively well, according to a report from Moody’s.Exchange revenues and profits have held up well in spite of – and to a degree, thanks to – the turmoil affecting the financial sector. Volumes have often approached record levels during the crisis as traders moved to exit positions; piled into perceived safe havens or hedged their exposure to stocks or sectors.But the combined effects of falling asset prices, lower issuance volumes, and deleveraging by market participants, will curtail trading volumes, resulting in lower transaction revenues and company-wide earnings, according to the Moody’s study.However, the report points out that because of the differences in their respective business models, some exchanges are likely to fare better than others.Taking into account the competitiveness of the exchanges’ trading platforms; revenue diversification and sources of recurring revenue; pricing power; expense flexibility and balance sheet quality, the Moody’s report suggests that Nasdaq OMX may be best positioned to cope among the four exchanges it rates.The Nasdaq carries a positive outlook, while its larger rival in the equities market, NYSE Euronext, has its rating on review for possible downgrade. The other two exchanges – the CME Group and the London Stock Exchange – have stable outlooks.The ratings are based on “important differences in the pricing power, expense ­flexibility, and revenue diversification among the four exchanges that will determine their operating performance”.Longer-term, most analysts agree that trading volumes are likely to resume an upward path, although growth rates might struggle to reach pre-recession levels when monthly volume records became almost the norm."
654;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-03-26T01:54:01Z;PM seeks to quell US fears on bank regulation;;Gordon Brown on Wednesday sought to confront American scepticism over his proposals for tighter regulation of the banks, telling a Wall Street audience the financial sector had to rediscover moral principles.“We have to clean up the banking system,” said the prime minister. “We must give people confidence that the principles that guide their daily lives are those that also guide the markets. I know people are angry at what they see in banking bonuses.”Mr Brown delivered his uncompromising message to bankers in the grand ballroom of New York’s five-star Plaza Hotel. Attendees included the presidents of Citibank, Nasdaq and Goldman Sachs. The prime minister warned them they could not operate in a moral vacuum ruled by “avarice”.“The principles and values we apply in our everyday lives, you have got to ask did we apply them to the running of our financial institutions?” said Mr Brown. “There is a sense that the global economy was outside these standards that we applied in our everyday lives.”The perception that banks were operating in a value-free hinterland, failing to adhere to basic principles of honesty and hard work, had damaged the entire system, the prime minister suggested. “Markets depend on morals in the end. A world without standards is going to be a world without stability,” he said.Mr Brown used the New York leg of a five-day diplomatic tour ahead of next week’s G20 summit of world leaders to try to confront American pressure for protectionist measures and scepticism about supranational financial regulation.The prime minister signalled hopes that the London summit would impose a “name and shame” system to police governments that put up barriers to trade. “We will agree at the G20 to monitor any protectionism …and report it,” he stated.In a bid to quell fears that America would cede control of Wall Street under a new international regime, Mr Brown dismissed as “ridiculous” the idea the G20 would seek to impose a single global financial regulator. He also stressed the “remarkable consensus” developing about the regulation of hedge funds and other shadow banks. But he cautioned against trying to reform America’s regulatory system in isolation, stressing the extent to which the US subprime crisis had infected European banks.In a separate development the prime minister revealed that Britain was in talks with Germany to agree a system for managing the withdrawal of banks, including the state-owned Royal Bank of Scotland, to their home markets.The prime minister called for a series of such bilateral agreements to try to prevent the exodus of banks from overseas markets exacerbating the global financial crisis.Aides said the RBS talks were still at an early stage.
655;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-03-24T20:09:00Z;US moots a revised uptick rule;;The largest US stock exchanges are to urge US regulators to adopt a modified version of the so-called uptick rule, originally conceived during the 1930s, which they claim would curb abusive short-selling in today’s fast-moving markets.The Securities and Exchange Commission is to consider reinstating the uptick rule after coming under political pressure to take action against short-sellers who many people hold responsible for driving down stock prices during the past 18 months.In a joint letter to Mary Schapiro, chairman of the SEC, the exchanges, including NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX, BATS Exchange and the National Stock Exchange on Tuesday proposed a modernised version of the uptick rule.The original rule – abolished on July 6, 2007, just as the credit crunch was slipping into high gear – prevented stocks from being shorted unless the last tick in their price was up.The rule was implemented after the 1929 market crash to prevent short sellers from driving the price of a stock down in a bear run.By the modified uptick rule the exchanges are proposing that short-selling could be initiated only by posting a quote for a short sale order priced at more than the prevailing national bid.As such, the execution of a short sale would occur only at a higher price than the prevailing market at the time of initiation, and only on a passive basis. That restriction, the letter said, “would assist the prevention of manipulative short selling, which is so harmful to the markets”.The exchanges said the modified uptick rule was superior to the original in several ways, including being easier to programme into trading systems.They also suggested the SEC adopt a “circuit breaker” that would trigger the application of the modified rule only after the price of a stock experienced a precipitous decline – perhaps by 10 per cent.The exchanges said the modified rule would be a simple, effective and more prohibitive short sale restriction that takes into account how equity trading has changed in recent years.Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, said that with the last sale price of a stock often changing hundreds of times in a second, the original rule failed to deliver any “prohibitive value”.The SEC is scheduled to meet on April 8 to consider proposals for restricting abusive short-selling.
656;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-03-17T18:39:39Z;Nasdaq to launch dark liquidity pool;;Nasdaq OMX Europe will next month launch a new “dark” liquidity pool, entering the market as it comes under increasing scrutiny from regulators.The new offering, Neuro Dark, like other dark pools will be based on the best bid and offer prices available on public markets and will aim to offer another low-cost market for non-displayed liquidity.Dark pools allow anonymous matching of large share trades with prices posted only after trades have been completed.They are increasingly popular among institutional and high frequency traders who find it hard to get large orders done on regular exchanges.The launch by Nasdaq, planned for April 27, comes as existing dark pool operators attract greater regulatory interest and criticism from some members of the exchange business, which is challenged by the popularity of dark pools, particularly for large block orders.Last week Bill Brodsky, chairman of the World Federation of Exchanges, said dark pools “introduced distortions” into equity markets by relying on the pricing mechanisms developed by exchanges without shouldering any of the costs.But that has been countered by several executives in the dark pools business, who say exchanges themselves are in the process of launching dark pool offerings.With its latest launch, Nasdaq OMX has joined a group in Europe that already includes NYSE Euronext’s Smartpool and the London Stock Exchange’s Baikal. Turquoise, the equity trading platform, said late last year it would launch a share trading service linking dark pools operated by banks.Liquidnet, Nyfix and ITG are the leading independent operators of dark pools in Europe, with operations based in London. The UK’s Financial Services Authority is conducting a routine review of the licences awarded to dark pools operating on a pan-European basis out of London. It has raised questions over whether so-called “pre-trade transparency waivers” given to some pools are still appropriate.That could disrupt plans by other dark pools to launch in Europe, at a time when the fragmentation of the region’s equity markets offers opportunities for the new trading platforms.Dark pools are popular in the US and have been growing in number in Europe since the passage of the markets in financial instruments directive (Mifid), liberalising share trading across Europe.
657;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-03-12T23:43:06Z;Nasdaq plans to buy European platform;;Nasdaq OMX plans to acquire an alternative trading platform in Europe, the US-based group said on Thursday, with consolidation likely to prompt a shake-out of existing players.The announcement, made by Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq OMX’s chief executive, comes as the group is struggling to build trading volume on its existing alternative trading platform in Europe, known as Nasdaq OMX Europe.The facility is one of five so-called “multilateral trading facilities” to have been launched since competition was unleashed in European share trading with the enactment of Mifid in 2007.Nasdaq OMX Europe was launched in September, offering trading in more than 600 European stocks and competing against Chi-X, Turquoise and BATS Europe, three other MTFs.This week, Nasdaq’s rival NYSE Euronext launched its own European MTF, named NYSE Arca Europe.Chi-X, the leading MTF, has captured roughly an 11 per cent share in FTSE 250 stocks, according to Fidessa, a trading technology company. Nasdaq OMX Europe has 0.27 per cent.Mr Greifeld acknowledged that the platform’s performance had not matched expectations.“We’re not where we want to be. We are actively engaged with our customers now on different approaches [to improving the performance of the platform],” Mr Greifeld said at the Futures Industry Association conference in Florida.Asked whether he was interested in buying another of the MTFs, he said consolidation was likely in the next few years: “We will participate in the consolidation. I don’t yet know who.”He said he had anticipated that such consolidation was likely to start in 2012, but that he now believed it would happen sooner. He declined to comment on speculation that Nasdaq OMX had at one point been in talks to buy Chi-X.Analysts have said deterioration in equity markets – and sharp declines in the value of trades done – means some of the MTFs are unlikely to survive.Intense competition between similar share trading platforms in the US some years ago resulted in the failure of some, while others were snapped up by incumbent exchanges – including Nasdaq itself.Those that have done relatively well so far – including Chi-X – have benefited from having as shareholders the high-frequency trading firms that are increasingly being drawn to Europe’s equity markets.However, Nasdaq OMX Europe’s sole shareholder is its parent, Nasdaq OMX. Mr Greifeld said this had its advantages: “At the end of the day we have staying power.”Separately, Mr Greifeld said that clearing over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate swaps held out the prospect for greater business than clearing of credit default swaps, currently the focus of Nasdaq’s rival exchanges and of efforts by policymakers to “re-regulate” the financial sector.
658;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-03-10T23:48:20Z;Securities upstarts are making trading a four-way fight;;The battle for market share in US equities trading is becoming a four-way fight with two relative newcomers increasingly being mentioned in the same breath as the established centres, NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX.BATS Exchange, a Kansas City-based upstart that gained exchange status just last year and Direct Edge, a Jersey City-based rival, have at times been dismissed by seasoned industry professionals as flashes in the pan.Many have taken the view they will go the way of the countless others that have claimed they can break the US equities trading duopoly.But their recent progress suggests the NYSE and Nasdaq can no longer take their US domestic dominance in equity trading for granted. Their rapid gain in market share is likely to be among the main points of discussion at the Futures Industry Association’s annual conference that begins in Boca Raton, Florida, on Wednesday.In the rivalry between Direct Edge and BATS both have this month claimed to be the third largest venue in US equities.Direct Edge, which is still an electronic communications network rather than an exchange, last week said that it handled a record 1.54bn shares per day in ­February, representing a 191 per cent year-on-year increase.Direct Edge also said it set market share records for the third consecutive month in February, with a matched share of 8.3 per cent.It added that for the third straight month, Direct Edge’s handled volume and market share ranked third among all US equity markets for the month, behind only the NYSE and Nasdaq.Last year, International Securities Exchange, one of the largest US options markets, became the largest shareholder in Direct Edge, in a move highlighting the blurring of the line between established exchanges and alternative equities platforms and confirming the ambitions of Direct Edge.Meanwhile, the BATS Exchange earned 11.39 per cent of US matched market share in February, setting a new record high, an ­achievement that it insisted reaffirmed its position as the third largest cash equity market behind NYSE and Nasdaq.BATS also recorded a new one-day record matched market share of 12.14 per cent on February 25.Whichever of them is actually the closest challenger to the big two – and for the time being the more established BATS seems to have the upper hand, according to independent analysts – is almost a moot point.The fact is that the two could soon, between them, effectively control about a quarter of the cash equities business in the US, something that NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX must surely be mindful of.

Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
660;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-03-08T23:30:50Z;NYSE Euronext launches trading platform;;European investors will on Monday be presented with two additional share-trading facilities with the launch of NYSE Euronext’s alternative trading platform and the unveiling of plans for a “dark pool” block trading system by US operator Pipeline.Both initiatives come as deteriorating equity markets call into question the viability of many trading facilities, which thrived following the enactment of the markets in financial instruments directive 16 months ago.Mifid kicked off an era of competition in European share trading, breaking the monopolies of established exchanges and prompting the launch of start-ups such as Chi-X, Turquoise and BATS Europe, as well as dark pool block trading facilities, which allow the anonymous trading of large orders.Exchanges have been fighting back with their own start-ups. NYSE Euronext will Monday start operating NYSE Arca Europe, becoming the fifth “multilateral trading facility” in the region behind rivals such as Nasdaq OMX.NYSE Arca Europe will launch with trading on 377 blue chips in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. The UK and Ireland will be phased in over the next three weeks, NYSE Euronext said.Separately, Pipeline, a privately held operator of a type of dark pool in the US, will announce plans to launch in Europe in the second quarter. It joins existing dark pools operated by Liquidnet and Nyfix of the US, and US-listed ITG, which runs a dark pool called Posit.Alfred Berkeley, founder of Pipeline, said: “We are looking to expand our business across Europe and provide traders with a block execution system.”The moves come amid concern that weak equity markets could weed out the least strong MTFs.
661;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-02-26T15:04:56Z;Nasdaq OMX profits sink on writedowns;;Nasdaq OMX, the exchange group, on Thursday morning reported a 53 per cent fall in fourth quarter profits as losses from foreign currency hedges related to acquisitions, among other write-downs, offset gains from greater trading volumes and revenues in the US.The exchange group also said that David Warren, chief financial officer, will step down from his role in July.Net income decreased to $36.8m, or 17 cents a share, from $79m, or 52 cents, in the same period last year. These results included $82.3m in write-downs on hedging and investments. Excluding currency loss and other expenses, profit was 53 cents a share, slightly ahead of analyst expectations.Net US cash equity trading revenues increased when compared to the same period last year due to higher trading volumes for US listed equities. But declines in Europe offset increases in the US revenues.The drop in revenues when compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 were driven by a 45.3 per cent reduction in value traded on the exchanges that comprise Nasdaq OMX Nordic and Baltic, offset slightly by a 16.7 per cent increase in trade volume.Also contributing to the decline in European cash equity trading revenues in the fourth quarter were changes in the exchange rate of the Swedish Krona as compared to the US dollar.Mr Warren, who has been at the Nasdaq for almost 8 years, will remain as CFO until July and will then oversee a transition period with Adena Friedman, currently executive vice-president, corporate strategy and global data products, who will assume the role of CFO. Mr Warren will remain with the group until the end of the year.He joined Nasdaq from Long Island Power Authority in 2001 as chief administrative officer, and assumed the expanded role of CFO of Nasdaq in July of that year.During his tenure Nasdaq has made several acquisitions, including the combination with OMX and acquisitions of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and the Boston Stock Exchange last year, the acquisition of INET in 2005 and the acquisition of Brut ECN in 2004. It was also rebuffed in its efforts to buy the London Stock Exchange.
662;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-02-25T00:26:08Z;NYSE in talks to relax its $1 minimum rule;;NYSE Euronext is in talks with US regulators about relaxing its requirement that companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange maintain a share price of more than $1 to protect itself from a possible wave of delistings.The exchange group is in talks with the Securities and Exchange Commission about a temporary relaxation of the rule. An announcement is expected in the coming weeks.It comes after the NYSE this year relaxed its minimum market cap threshold from $25m to $15m – after the combined market cap of its parent group’s listed companies fell almost $14,000bn last year, equivalent to the gross domestic product of the US.The NYSE now temporarily requires that companies maintain a market cap of $15m, down from $25m, over a 30-day period to avoid delisting. The revised rules do not apply to new listings for which the minimum market cap requirement is $150m.About a dozen companies were saved from delisting by the change in the market-cap rule, but the suspension of the $1 minimum for company share prices could affect hundreds of groups that are currently trading below $5.The move to lower the minimum price for a stock to remain listed comes after stocks this week reached lows not seen since 1997 with bearish sentiment continuing to drive the actions of many traders.As a result of recent declines, some of the most famous names in corporate America are in danger of falling foul of the NYSE’s minimum share price listing requirement. For example, Citigroup ended on Tuesday down 61.3 per cent for the year to date at $2.60, and Ford is down 12.7 per cent this year at $2.NYSE rules currently stipulate that a company’s listing can be removed from the exchange if its share price falls below $1 for 30 consecutive trading days, although a six-month “cure period” is typically given to resolve the issue.Rival exchange Nasdaq OMX suspended its minimum bid price requirement in October after securing SEC approval, and in December was granted an extension to that suspension period. It also suspended its market-cap requirement of between $35m and $50m across its markets.NYSE Euronext this month reported a net loss of $1.34bn for the fourth quarter, missing expectations, as it was hit by costs related to the merger of NYSE and Euronext. Revenues suffered in part because of a new rebate scheme for high-frequency customers.
663;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-02-09T21:47:11Z;Wall Street flat after rescue delay;;US financial stocks enjoyed reasonable gains during the most subdued session of the year so far as traders remained reluctant to place bearish bets on banks before the Obama administration unveiled plans to shore up the stricken sector.Regional banks did particularly well, helped by an upbeat note on Regions Financialfrom Richard Bove, influential Ladenburg Thalmann analyst.He noted that current valuations suggested “investors do not believe that this company will survive”, yet went on to argue that “despite all of its faults and scars, this company has a dominant franchise in a good banking market and it should recover from the current economic downturn”. Regions Financial leapt 10.5 per cent to $4.64 while regional banks rallied 4 per cent overall.Some insurers also enjoyed strong gains and the sector added 1.8 per cent overall.The wider market struggled for momentum after it emerged that Tim Geithner, Treasury secretary, would not disclose the bank rescue proposals until Tuesday.The market drifted between positive and negative territory during the narrowest trading range for the benchmark S&P 500 so far this year.Alan Ruskin, senior analyst at RBS’s global banking and markets division, wrote in a note to clients: “Because the devil will be in the detail of the newest measures, notably the purchase of toxic assets, I would expect that the rally in risk appetite we are seeing ahead of the plan will lack immediate serious follow-through.”The S&P 500 finished 0.2 per cent higher at 869.89 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.1 per cent lower at 8,270.87 and the Nasdaq Composite Index flat at 1,591.56.“Traders left their desks on Friday all bulled up over Monday’s line-up,” said Andrew Wilkinson, analyst at Interactive Brokers. “The postponement of Mr Geithner’s plans until Tuesday doesn’t instill confidence that whatever his team’s plan delivers will be much more than a compromise.”Meanwhile, another round of downbeat earnings illustrated the toll that the recession was taking on US corporations.“The known uncertainties of earnings are now mixing with the unknowns of both the Treasury Department’s plan for the banking sector and the government’s stimulus package,” wrote Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup.In financials, Nasdaq OMXwas hit in the fallout from poorly received fourth-quarter results from NYSE Euronext. Shares in the exchanges lost 6.3 per cent to $23.34 and 5.2 per cent to $21.71, respectively.Among the results elsewhere, Whirlpool added 2 per cent to $37.13 in choppy trade despite the appliance-maker unveiling a worse-than-expected 76 per cent drop in fourth-quarter profitThe energy sector, up 0.2 per cent overall, provided the market with some support early in the session but later tracked the oil price lower.Meanwhile in materials, Dow Chemical shed 2.1 per cent to $10.65 after HSBC said the group was likely to cut its dividend, downgraded its view of the stock to “underweight” and warned a debt-financed deal to buy Rohm & Haas could prompt a credit rating downgrade. For its part, Rohm & Haas – locked in a merger dispute with Dow – edged 0.1 per cent lower to $55.47 on glum fourth-quarter results.Coca-Cola was among the losers in soft drink stocks, down 2.9 per cent to $42.31 after Citigroup cut its price target from $53 to $51.“While headline risks remain for the US soft drink industry,” wrote Celso Sánchez, Citi analyst, several factors could “increasingly garner investor attention and support sector valuations”.Homebuilders came under pressure after Citigroup downgraded its view of Lennar, off 6.3 per cent to $8.71, to “hold”. The sector lost 4.9 per cent overall.Motorola bucked a downward trend in the telecoms sector, helped by news that its co-chief executives had snapped up battered shares in the group last week. Its shares climbed 7 per cent to $4.15.Also on the upside, General Electric was a key winner, bolstered by hopes that GE Capital would benefit from bank bail-out plans.GE shares rallied 13.9 per cent to $12.64, helping the industrial advance 2.6 per cent overall.
664;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-02-09T10:58:51Z;Burgundy presses on with launch;;Burgundy, a new alternative equities trading platform backed by a consortium of Nordic banks and brokers, on Monday took a step towards launch by appointing EMCF, jointly owned by Fortis bank and Nasdaq OMX, as the venture’s clearer.The Nordic platform, set for launch in May, is one of at least two further so-called “multilateral trading facilities “ (MTFs) due to emerge in Europe, even amid depressed equity markets.Competition in European share trading is already intense between incumbent exchanges and four existing MTFs – Chi-X, Turquoise, BATS Europe and Nasdaq OMX Europe, backed by Nasdaq OMX, the US exchange group. The MTFs have been battling each other with recent fee cuts and the offer of generous rebates to liquidity providers.Unlike the existing MTFs, Burgundy will be for the Nordic financial markets, where Nasdaq’s OMX unit is the dominant exchange.Burgundy’s shareholders include Nordea, Danske Bank, Svenska Handelsbanken, Swedbank and NeoNet, Scandinavia’s largest broker. The account for almost half of all Nordic equity trading volume.The appointment of a clearer is one of the most important steps for any equities platform and indicates that Burgundy is serious about pressing ahead in spite of the competition. Chi-X has offered trading in Swedish, Norwegian, Danish and Finnish stocks since last year.Olof Neiglick, Burgundy chief executive, said: “Burgundy will offer a single point of entry to the Nordic equity markets, fully integrated with a leading European clearing and risk management service provider.”A sixth European MTF, Quote MTF, is set for launch in June, based out of Hungary.
665;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-02-08T17:20:16Z;Case for change heard loud and clear;;When Chris Concannon, an executive at Nasdaq OMX, testified at a congressional hearing in early February on credit default swaps and clearing, he knew US lawmakers would wonder why an exchange famous for trading technology stocks had anything to say on the subject.So he pointed out that Nasdaq OMX operated eight clearing houses round the world. That week, the group bought a 22 per cent stake in EMCF, a clearer that acts for Chi-X, one of the new entrants in European share trading.Nasdaq’s push into clearing is a sign of the changes sweeping the world’s exchanges as trading volumes fall, competition intensifies and as regulators promote clearing as a way of reducing the risks to the financial system exposed by the collapse of Lehman Brothers.A clearing house acts as buyer for every seller, and also as seller for every buyer in a transaction, helping virtually to eliminate counterparty risk – the chance of a party to a transaction ending up defaulting.The exchanges realise now that, after successive years of record trading volumes, they can no longer rely on trading revenues to sustain their businesses and are looking elsewhere for growth.Benn Steil, an exchange expert at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York said: “The exchange gold rush is officially over .“The market for marketplaces has been brought to earth by deleveraging and we may never again see the cost of debt capital for financial institutions, which underpinned soaring [volumes], as low as it was from 2002-2007.”Last week CME Group, the futures exchange, reported a 41 per cent fall in trading volume amid an exodus of hedge funds from derivatives markets. Yet the volume of off-exchange energy trades processed through its Clearport clearing system jumped by 50 per cent.Celent, a consultancy, says the exchanges’ role in such post-trade services will only increase “in an environment where new regulations are expected and new risk management programmes and clearing initiatives are put into place”.The big opportunity is in over-the-counter derivatives, which is why the four largest exchanges – NYSE Euronext, CME, Deutsche Börse and IntercontinentalExchange – are finalising plans to clear OTC credit default swaps. Citi estimates that the pool of clearing revenue available here is $300m-$400m.Nasdaq recently bought a majority stake in International Derivatives Clearing Group, a new clearer for OTC interest rate swaps. Mr Concannon remarked to lawmakers candidly: “I will admit that we have self-interest in the reform of these markets.”At the same time, exchanges are trying to attract new users. NYSE Euronext launched SmartPool last week, a dark pool allowing the trading of large blocks of shares anonymously.CME, NYSE Euronext and Eurex, the derivatives arm of Deutsche Börse, have all introduced fee rebates recently to attract high-frequency traders.They are also targeting investors not hurt by the collapse in prime brokerage funding, such as Chicago-based Getco, and Optiver, based in Amsterdam, which use their own risk capital to trade.Exchanges may go even further in their hunt for customers. Last month, the Börse came close to acquiring Neonet, Scandinavia’s largest broker, highlighting how exchanges want access to brokers’ order routing technology to increase order flow.Miranda Mizen, senior consultant at Tabb Group, says: “Whether this particular deal comes to fruition or not, there will be deals this year that break the mould.”As tough as life will be for exchanges, Citi analysts say that some asset classes will do well, including equity derivatives and interest rate swaps. Miserable equity markets could squeeze out some new equities trading platforms that have emergedIn 2008, so-called multilateral trading facilities, such as Turquoise, Chi-X, Nasdaq OMX and BATS Europe, captured a share of the most liquid European stocks. In January, their combined share was 15-17 per cent, according to Citi.MTFs are engaged in a price war that will delay their break-even points. Some may even be snapped up by exchanges.Peter Randall, chief executive of Chi-X, said consolidation was inevitable.He said: “Dealing with this market is going to need strong nerves and deep pockets”.
666;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-02-02T21:40:49Z;Wall Street downbeat on stimulus fears;;Industrial stocks were among the hardest hit on Wall Street on Monday as the market struggled to mount a recovery from its worst January on record.Investors took scant comfort from the latest reading of US manufacturing activity from the Institute for Supply Management, which although better than expected was nevertheless glum.The industrial sector led the declines, down 2.5 per cent overall. Among the hardest hit big names, Boeingand 3M dropped 3.6 per cent to $40.80 and 5.9 per cent to $50.62, respectively.The major indices finished mixed after a choppy session in relatively thin trade. The S&P 500 drifted between positive and negative territory throughout the day, yet the benchmark index finished 0.1 per cent lower at 825.43 despite a wave of buying into the close.The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 0.8 per cent lower at 7,936.75, a fresh low for the year. Yet strength in the relatively cash-rich technology sector helped the Nasdaq Composite stand 1.2 per cent higher at 1,494.43.“That’s more about short-covering than anything else,” said Richard Parower, managing director at J&W Seligman. “The earnings have lived down to expectations.”Semiconductor stocks did particularly well. Intel and Texas Instruments finished up 5.7 per cent at $13.63 and 5 per cent to $15.69 overall.Elsewhere, however, a succession of corporate results once again highlighted the damage that the recession – now more than a year old – had done to company performance.Consumer stocks did badly, hurt by a glum corporate outlooks from Mattel and Macy’s.An unexpected 46 per cent plunge in profit at Mattel, which sank 16.1 per cent to $11.90, hurt Hasbro, a peer, which lost 9.1 per cent to $21.93.Macy’s lost 4 per cent to $8.59 after the retailer cut its dividend from 13.5 cents to 5 cents a share and disclosed plans to cut about 7,000 jobs.Among other consumer stocks to perform poorly, Procter&Gamble shed 2.7 per cent to $53.05 after Barclays cut its price target to $58 and maintained its “equal weight” stance.Avon Products dipped 5.4 per cent to $19.34 after Goldman Sachs removed the stock from its “buy” list ahead of its results.“The cost of doing business is likely to fall owing to pressure on commodities and advertising rates [but] Avon has limited exposure to these favourable trends,” wrote the analysts.The latest economic data came as concerns heightened that political wrangling would delay the economic stimulus package weighed on the wider market.Talks continued in Washington over the passage of the Obama administration’s near-$900bn stimulus plan, which is facing opposition from leading Republican senators who have called for further tax cuts along with other changes to the bill.Meanwhile, the financial sector – which outperformed the market last week as hopes mounted that the Obama administration would avoid outright nationalisation of key financial institutions and set up a so-called bad bank to take on their toxic assets – struggled for momentum.Investors were concerned that the White House had yet to disclose details of the plan and the sector was also hit by a Moody’s downgrade of the credit ratings on Barclays, the British bank.Among the big name banks, Bank of America shed 8.8 per cent to $6 even after S&P Equity Research, which previously forecast a full-year loss, adjusted its estimate to earnings of 47 cents a share.Regional banks also did particularly poorly, down 3.9 per cent overall.Also among the worst performing in the wider sector, NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq OMX tumbled 12.4 per cent to $19.28 and 6.2 per cent to $20.47, respectively, on a bearish view from Goldman Sachs.The financial sector overall spent much of the session in the red but stood 0.2 per cent higher by the close.Elsewhere, the energy sector came under pressure, down 0.9 per cent overall, as US crude prices slid.Healthcare and utilities – defensive areas – outperformed as investors sought safety.The market’s downbeat start to the month followed a 8.6 per cent drop in the S&P 500 in January, which was even worse than the 7.7 per cent fall in the benchmark index during January 1970.
667;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2009-02-01T07:57:49Z;Emerging markets move to establish solutions;;The increased focus on clearing and settlement is not limited to the obvious developed markets of western Europe and the US. Less developed – or less immediately obvious – markets are also moving with the tide.The Bond Exchange of South Africa (BESA) is set, subject to local regulatory approval, to introduce in the second quarter clearing of fixed income derivatives, repo bonds and cash bonds through BondClear, a clearing house owned by the exchange and in which Nasdaq OMX has a 20 per cent stake.South Africa is the sixth most liquid government bond market according to the Bank for International Settlements, while the World Federation of Exchanges ranks Besa the fourth largest exchange-trade bond market.Besa operates a hybrid exchange model where trades are done over the counter – bilaterally negotiated – and then matched on exchange.Garth Gruebel, Besa chief executive, says the lack of a clearing facility has been “an impediment” to getting a fixed income derivatives market going in South Africa because the long-dated nature of such futures contracts means that bilateral credit lines are tied up. “If you can put it through a CCP [central counterparty] and you can manage your exposures on a daily basis that creates the opportunity for greater trading of a derivatives instrument,” he says.BondClear says it will offer “a comprehensive clearing solution including matching, CCP services, risk management and settlement with risk management being underpinned by Nasdaq OMX’s balance sheet which acts as ultimate acceptor of risk”.On the settlement side Central Depository Romania, the eastern European country’s settlement system, last month launched a new service providing direct access to eurobonds traded on international markets for Romanian investors, through a new direct link with Clearstream Banking Luxembourg, a unit of Deutsche Börse’s Clearstream settlement system.
668;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Nasdaq OMX to launch Nordic clearing service;;Nasdaq OMX, the US-based exchange group, is to highlight a growing focus on the unglamorous post-trade business by fixing next month for the launch of the Nordic region’s first equities clearing service.The collapse of Lehman Brothers and the broader financial crisis have led regulators to push for ways to reduce the risk that parties involved in a trade unexpectedly default.Clearing, where a clearing house stands behind both parties, has shot to prominence as parts of the sector believe that it is likely to be central to how financial services operate in future.Exchanges, especially those that do not yet have their own clearing houses, have been exploring ways to expand into clearing, partly as a way of offsetting declining trading fee revenues.Nasdaq OMX said in October that it planned to launch clearing for the Nordic markets, where it is active through its OMX constituent exchanges in Denmark, Finland and Sweden.Since then, it has finalised a plan for a central counterparty clearer with the securities dealers associations in Denmark, Finland and Sweden.Nasdaq OMX will use European Multilateral Clearing Facility, a small clearer Fortis set up less than two years ago to clear for the emerging new equities trading platforms such as Chi-X and Nasdaq OMX Europe, Nasdaq’s own alternative European equities platform. Nasdaq bought a 22 per cent stake in EMCF in October.Turquoise, the alternative share trading platform, is to cut trading fees and raise rebates for a second time in less than two months, amid the intensifying price war between exchanges and such new platforms. Exchanges and “multilateral trading facilities” are increasingly competing for market share from electronic market making firms.Turquoise cut the fee it charges traders for “taking” liquidity on its platform and on Mondaywill raise the rebate it offers to those posting liquidity.
669;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-12-16T23:50:21Z;News Corp moves listing to Nasdaq;;News Corporation is transferring its market listing from NYSE Euronext to Nasdaq OMX, in a move expected to save Rupert Murdoch’s media group large sums in listing fees.News Corp highlighted Nasdaq’s trading technology and “cost-effective structure”, and one person close to the company said that Nasdaq had put together “a really compelling package”.Other people close to the negotiations said Nasdaq would spend $5m-$8m a year in advertising with News Corp properties over three years. News Corp would not comment on this.News Corp’s switch is the latest episode in an often acrimonious battle for listings between the two largest US stock exchanges. It means eight companies have moved from the Nasdaq to the NYSE this year and six have gone in the opposite direction.Rich Adamonis, a spokesman for NYSE Euronext, said: “Nasdaq OMX made News Corp an offer it couldn’t refuse – quite a lot of money – to switch its listing to Nasdaq. Other Nasdaq properties should seek similar arrangements.”A Nasdaq spokeswoman said the exchange group already advertises across many of News Corp properties and in that respect it remained “business as usual”.The owner of Fox Business Network and the Wall Street Journal, which transferred its official domicile and primary listing from Australia in 2004, has been on the NYSE for 22 years, but Mr Murdoch has often thumbed his nose at establishment organisations.“News Corp has been defined by innovative ideas,” said Bruce Aust, executive vice-president of Nasdaq’s global corporate client group. About 98 per cent of its shares are already traded electronically, one third of them on Nasdaq.Mr Murdoch said last month he would impose “stringent” cost cuts across News Corp, including reductions in headcount, after being caught in an advertising slump affecting all of its peers in the media industry.The group also lowered its earnings forecast last month, saying it expected double-digit declines in operating income for this fiscal year, rather than the 4-6 per cent growth previously forecast.Shares in News Corp closed up 65 cents or 8.4 per cent at $8.43.
670;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-12-16T20:49:20Z;Equiduct takes MTF gamble;;With equity market volumes tumbling, now might not be the best time to be planning to launch yet another alternative equities trading platform in Europe.The region has already seen the launch of three of them since August: Turquoise, BATS Europe and Nasdaq OMX Europe. Chi-X, majority owned by broker Instinet Europe, was the first to arrive on the scene last year.Equiduct, a fifth so-called “multilateral trading facility”, aims to join the pack in February.It is 53 per cent owned by Börse Berlin, with 23 per cent held by Jos Peeters, a Belgian venture capitalist and a former founder of the Easdaq exchange, with the rest held by Knight Capital and other investment banks, including Goldman Sachs through a former investment in Easdaq.It was only a few months ago that the prospect of MTFs competing with the London Stock Exchange, Deutsche Börse and Euronext was met with excitement as they promised lower fees and faster trading systems.Yet being cheap is no longer the proposition it was, since a vicious price war has slashed prices to rock bottom levels.Nor is having the fastest technology necessarily the knock-out weapon it might have initially seemed. Many MTFs now execute trades in microseconds, although BATS insists that speed is still vital because it allows traders to get in and out of their positions faster than on other venues when the market moves.Instead, Equiduct has spent months developing a specialisation that aims to solve for traders the fragmentation of liquidity and market data that has become a worrisome by-product of competition.Europe has no “consolidated tape”, where prices are aggregated, unlike the US. To circumvent this, banks and brokers have developed “smart-order routing” systems that detect where the best price for an order may be across a range of trading venues, and send orders there.That way, they hope to meet their obligations under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, enacted a year ago by Brussels, to demonstrate that they are providing clients with “best execution”.Yet, for medium to small-sized brokers especially, the cost of having such routers can be prohibitive.Equiduct’s technology – which it calls Orange VBBO – aggregates prices from all the existing trading venues in one place, showing how much trading there is and whether there was a better price available elsewhere.Niki Beattie, managing director of The Market Structure Practice, a consultancy, said that as market fragmentation continues, Equiduct’s model “is starting to look more compelling”.“They have the only decent consolidated data for liquid stocks and they also have some very powerful analytics about what is happening on the MTFs and exchanges,” she says.Equiduct is also offering users a choice in where their trades are cleared, rather than tying them to one clearing solution – as its rival MTFs do.Yet providing both services has involved significant up-front investment. Artur Fischer, Equiduct chief executive, admits this is “a gamble”.He also concedes that there is “a real threat” that others could copy what Equiduct is doing, if it works.But he insists that, as the market continues to fragment, Equiduct will allow traders to see “a much deeper order book”.Some people in the markets may be sceptical of Equiduct, given that it was forced to change its pricing model in August. The timing of its launch has also slipped into next year.Mr Fischer acknowledges that market conditions are not ideal. “I am in a marketplace with declining transactions, so I am not in as good a position as my competitors. But the timing is perfect for us because of fragmentation.”
671;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-12-10T10:50:05Z;A clear advantage in turbulent times;;Sometimes, it pays to be boring. While the financial crisis has decimated banks’ trading desks, the unglamorous back office and risk management businesses that have gone largely unnoticed for years are emerging as beneficiaries of the turmoil.In the past six months, London-based clearing house LCH.Clearnet has increased its IT staff by 27 per cent and its risk and operations staff by 12 per cent.The Chicago-based Options Clearing Corporation, the largest clearer of derivatives in the world, plans to hire staff next year.And Nasdaq OMX, the US-based group best known for running the technology-rich Nasdaq market, has in the past two months been pushing into clearing – the business of providing the guarantees that parties to a trade do not default.In October, it bought a stake in EMCF, a European clearer established a year earlier by Fortis that clears for Chi-X, the alternative equities platform. At the same time, Nasdaq launched a clearing service for its Nordic markets.Nasdaq has also invested in International Derivatives Clearing Group, a new derivatives exchange and clearing house for over-the-counter interest rate swaps. It also plans to launch a US equities clearing service.In normal times, these developments would go barely noticed. Yet clearing and settlement, as well as the “front office” risk management services that accompany trading, are receiving unprecedented attention as regulators figure out what the future shape of financial services should be.Jeff Gooch, head of valuations and co-head of trade processing at Markit, a market data provider, says: “It’s the one thing people are not willing to cut. Given what’s happened it’s vastly more important to get your risk management right.”In the latest development, List, an Italian technology provider, on Tuesday launched FMR Position Keeping, a system that provides market makers with a “real-time” view of their positions across interest rate futures, credit default swaps and bonds.The developments are an early sign of the type of businesses likely to thrive in an era when financial services emerge redefined, after the excessive risk-taking that led to the worst financial crisis in a generation.They also imply a shift away from the creation of and trading in complex financial instruments – the front office – and more emphasis on post-trade and risk management – the back office.Philippe Carrel, vice-president of risk at Thomson Reuters, says: “In a market like this are you going to ask your boss to invest in trading faster and in new derivatives? No, you are going to try and ensure your risk is understood and controlled and create some watertight compartments and say ‘at least within these boundaries we know what we are doing’.”In credit derivatives, regulators are pushing for a clearing mechanism for over-the-counter credit default swaps to reduce counterparty risk after the Lehman default.Exchanges and clearers are investing in OTC clearing – hence the rise in staff numbers at LCH.Clearnet, which is involved in a NYSE Euronext-led effort to clear CDS products.Roger Liddell, LCH.Clearnet chief executive, says the clearer’s recent growth has been “driven by the demand for us to clear new markets”.Icap, the inter-dealer broker, also plans to expand into OTC post-trade services. It has identified $12bn in risk capital tied up by dealers in their portfolios that could be saved by offering clearing in OTC derivatives, foreign exchange and other products.Even shipping is getting attention. Imarex, a Norwegian shipping derivatives exchange, has launched a position netting service to help participants in the dry freight forward contracts market reduce their financing needs.Demand for such services is likely to grow, industry experts say, because the boards of banks and asset managers will be asking more questions about how their risks are being managed.Mr Carrel says: “If I am in a bank where the board asks what our commitments and liabilities are and what’s going to happen to us, I need to have the answer.”Marco Strimer, chief executive of SIX X-Clear, a Swiss clearer, says getting that answer right will involve an element of “common sense and gut feel”.“Sometimes people were a bit shy about saying ‘no’ [to getting involved in complex financial instruments]. I think the word ‘no’ will take on a new relevance,” he says.…..Future launchA new US futures exchange backed by some of Wall Street’s biggest names took a step closer to launching on Tuesday by announcing a deal with the world’s largest derivatives clearing house, write Hal Weitzman in Chicago and Anuj Gangahar in New York.Electronic Liquidity Exchange – whose investors include banks such as Bank of America, JPMorgan, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and Credit Suisse and electronic trading houses such as Getco and PEAK6-Breakwater – said it had struck an agreement with the Options Clearing Corporation to provide clearing and delivery services.“The focus on clearing and credit mitigation in the current market environment is so great that to partner with a clearing house with a AAA rating gives credibility to the effort we were undertaking,” said Neal Wolkoff, chief executive of the ELX and former chairman and chief executive of the American Stock Exchange.The exchange hopes to break the dominance of the CME, the world’s largest futures exchange, over the US listed futures industry.Since its takeover of Nymex, the New York energy exchange, earlier this year, the CME controls 98 of US-listed futures.ELX plans to launch with Treasury futures contracts, one of the most successful products at the Chicago Board of Trade, which the CME bought last year. Although the exchange will not confirm its timetable, it is thought to be targeting the early part of next year to roll out its first contracts.
672;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-12-05T19:33:00Z;X-Clear moves to slash fees by 20%;;X-Clear, the Swiss-based clearing house, fired the latest salvo in an escalating price war in the European equities markets by saying it would slash its clearing fees by 20 per cent next month.The cost of share trading has been falling since the Mifid reforms enacted by Brussels a year ago spurred competition between trading venues, pitting established exchanges against start-ups such as Chi-X, BATS and Nasdaq OMX Europe.But post-trade fees, which are charged by clearing houses and settlement system providers and are important elements of the cost of trading, have been slower to fall amid lack of full competition.Brussels brokered a “code of conduct” that was supposed to see the creation of such choice by clearers making themselves “interoperable” with each other.While there are more than 80 requests for “interoperability” outstanding between clearers and exchanges with their own clearing operations, progress has been slow because of national regulatory barriers and a fear among some exchange-owned clearers that they stand to lose revenue.But the London Stock Exchange in September broke the impasse in London by allowing X-Clear to offer clearing services in competition with its longstanding clearer, LCH.Clearnet.Marco Strimer, X-Clear chief executive, said the clearer’s cheapest fee would be 2 euro cents a trade, when it starts offering its London service next Friday.Mr Strimer said X-Clear had simplified its tariff structure, from one based on customers’ risk exposure to one based on the credit rating of a customer.“It’s much more market-friendly, it’s predictable and cheaper for us to process as well,” he said. “[We are] undertaking a change that is completely in line with open competition.”This week UBS, the largest single provider of orders to the LSE – and a co-owner of X-Clear’s parent company – said it would be switching to X-Clear from LCH.Clearnet.The London-based clearer said: “When all aspects of our broad cash equity service offering are considered, we remain the most cost effective [clearer].”Rivalries between competing clearers has been stoked by sudden changes in their ownership structures. Chi-X has used EMCF, a clearer set up less than two years ago by Fortis, as its clearer since launch 19 months ago.But Nasdaq OMX, which operates the Nasdaq OMX Europe equities platform in competition with Chi-X, took a stake in EMCF. That could prompt Chi-X to switching to another clearer, and has not ruled out X-Clear.
673;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-11-28T23:34:37Z;Turquoise seeks fresh funding;;Turquoise, the alternative share trading platform, is in talks with “strategic investors” about fresh funding for the venture two months after it was launched to challenge Europe’s incumbent stock exchanges.The platform is also cutting one of its main prices on Monday for the first time. The move is a sign that competition is intensifying between the handful of alternative trading venues that have emerged since the European Commission’s Mifid reforms were unleashed a year ago.The Mifid directive broke the monopoly of the region’s established exchanges. Turquoise is one of four pan-European “multilateral trading facilities” set up since then, along with Chi-X, BATS Europe and Nasdaq OMX Europe.Eli Lederman, Turquoise chief executive, said: “We are talking to potential strategic investors.” The move was “in the best interest of the continued development” of the platform, he said.Turquoise claims to have captured almost 5 per cent of the trade in the equities it offers across 13 European markets. It was backed by nine investment banks, with which it has a market-making agreement under which they commit to provide a certain amount of liquidity. However, that expires in March.Two of its rivals, Chi-X and BATS, have as shareholders specialist market-making firms – sometimes referred to as professional trading firms – such as Getco, based in Chicago, and Optiver of the Netherlands.Such liquidity providers are becoming increasingly important in equity markets, partly as hedge funds recede amid a shortage of prime brokerage lending. They are also expanding into Europe to take advantage of the proliferation of trading venues in the wake of Mifid.Mr Lederman said such types of firms were “very important” to Turquoise and were members of the platform. But the talks could involve such firms becoming investors as well, although he declined to name any. “We are actively talking to a number of professional trading firms to the point of their being investors in the platform,” he said. The London Stock Exchange is also trying to encourage such firms to trade more.Turquoise is also launching an “equity incentive programme” allowing members to earn equity in the platform based on levels of trading activity. Like its rivals, Turquoise operates a “maker-taker” pricing model that rewards traders for making a commitment to post orders on its platform, and charges traders for coming in and matching, or “taking”, those orders.From Monday, Turquoise will cut the amount it charges to takers of orders, and pay posters of liquidity less. Mr Lederman said: “We’ve increased the likelihood of the ‘maker’ earning their rebate. We believe this will improve the overall liquidity of the market.”
674;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-11-14T02:36:06Z;LSE shares fall over warning of tough market;;Shares in the London Stock Exchange on Thursday fell more than 10 per cent after it warned of “difficult and uncertain” market conditions and halted a share buyback programme.But the group said it was seeing a “step change” upwards in the amount of trading activity from a new breed of high-frequency, electronic trader after the exchange introduced a new tariff structure designed to attract such traders.Dame Clara Furse, chief executive, said the exchange had “delivered a good performance in challenging market conditions”.But she added: “Activity on the exchange will continue to reflect more difficult and uncertain market conditions.”The shares closed 10.4 per cent lower at 519.5p.Dame Clara said the financial and economic crisis had highlighted “the fundamental strength and resilience of the exchange business model”.The group also said it had created £700m ($1bn) in bank facilities by extending the terms of some existing loans and refinancing some bridge debt. It now had that amount available to 2012 or beyond. “We’ve secured more than we need for current business operations for more than the next three years,” said Doug Webb, chief financial officer.The LSE re-affirmed its intention to proceed with the launch of Baikal, a “dark pool” – or anonymous trading venue for large blocks of shares. But the launch would now be at the end of the second quarter of next year, a delay of about a quarter since a timetable announced in June.Baikal was to have been a joint venture with the former Lehman Brothers. John Wilson, chief executive of Baikal, said the LSE was weeks away from picking alternative partners.While Nomura, the new owner of Lehman’s European assets was “keen to participate”, Dame Clara said, the LSE would not be using the trading technology formerly owned by Lehman that was to have been a key part of Baikal.Dame Clara said there were five “structural developments” that were changing the LSE’s equities markets, including the acceleration of a move to high frequency, highly automated electronic trading.She said five institutions that specialise in making markets across multiple trading venues, and which are at the forefront of such trading, had joined the LSE since April “with more to come”.“Most of them have cut their teeth in the US markets and have a seemingly insatiable appetite for ever greater speed and ever higher capacity. In the last six months alone, their contribution to our market has seen a step change,” Dame Clara said.The exchange’s share price has fallen by more than most of its peers this year amid concerns over competition from new trading platforms such as Chi-X, Turquoise, BATS Europe and Nasdaq OMX Europe. Analysts have expressed concern about continued erosion of the LSE’s market share.Dame Clara said that a lot of the business conducted on platforms like Chi-X was new. “We know this because we are seeing this new business ourselves. This means the name of the game is market growth, rather than market share,” she said.
675;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-11-07T03:25:05Z;Nasdaq OMX third quarter profits fall 84%;;Nasdaq OMX Group said on Thursday that its third-quarter profit fell 84 per cent from the same period last year, when it posted a one-off gain from the sale of its stake in the London Stock Exchange.Net income fell from $365m (or $2.41 per share) a year ago to $60.1m (or 28 cents per share). The group recorded a pretax gain of $431.4m for the sale of its stake in the LSE during the third quarter last year, which boosted earnings by $1.95 per share.Disregarding that gain and some other expenses, adjusted net earnings rose 28 per cent to $109.7m on record trading volumes and the purchase by the Nasdaq Stock Market of the Swedish OMX Group to form the combined Nasdaq OMX.Net exchange revenue increased 7 per cent to $410.6m from $384.2m last year. Growth in both market and transaction services helped push revenue higher.Transaction services revenue grew as Nasdaq increased its volume handled on all US exchanges during the third quarter. About 179.2bn trades were executed through Nasdaq OMX, compared with about 121.7bn during the same quarter last year.Volume increased amid the financial crisis, which led to increased volatility in equity market trading at exchanges across the world.Nasdaq OMX “matched” share volume was 29.6 per cent for all US equities trades during the third quarter essentially unchanged from the same period a year ago.Matched volume represents the share volume of securities that are executed on an exchange’s book as a percentage of consolidated market volume.Along with most of its rivals in the exchange space, Nasdaq OMX has been expanding and diversifying its operations by geography and asset class, most recently by acquiring the Boston and Philadelphia stock exchanges as well as continuing the process of merging the operations of Nasdaq and OMX.The group also recently completed its launch of Nasdaq OMX Europe with about 600 listed European equities trading on the exchange. The group also plans to launch a London exchange, following its failed attempts to buy the LSE in recent years.David Easthope, senior analyst at Celent, the financial research and consulting firm, said: “Nasdaq OMX’s third quarter underscores that, like other global exchanges, Nasdaq is facing a scenario where many of its best trading clients are in a weaker position than a year ago.”“Like its biggest competitor NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq is swallowing major acquisitions in 2008, pushing the exchange further into cash equities and options, but also making the continued generation of cost synergies a higher priority than a year ago, amidst continued global economic weakness,” he added.
676;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-11-02T19:40:19Z;LSE pushes ahead with special levy;;"The London Stock Exchange is to carry out its threat to levy a special charge on orders that are routed through its new competitors.From Monday, it will charge a fee of 1 basis point on any trade that arrives from an external trading venue – such as Nasdaq OMX Europe, owned by the US-based arch-rival to the LSE.The same will apply to trades routed from the newly launched BATS Trading, which plans to offer the same type of service early next year.The move was criticised as “anti-competitive” by Nasdaq OMX, when the London bourse first indicated it was planning to introduce a fee last month. It accused the LSE of “artificially controlling competition in order to maintain high prices”.A key feature of Nasdaq OMX Europe, the recently launched pan-European equities trading facility, is that any order that cannot be fulfilled on Nasdaq OMX Europe is routed to other trading platforms – including the LSE – for matching there. The routing is handled by Citi, which is paid a fee by Nasdaq OMX Europe for the service.Nasdaq OMX Europe’s fees to traders for the service are sufficiently low – it charges 0.25 basis points – that traders have been able to trade LSE stocks more cheaply by going through Nasdaq OMX Europe than going directly to the LSE itself. The exchange argues it is unfair for Nasdaq OMX to “avail itself of LSE member firm privileges” by enlisting Citi for the service. It is also
furious that a competing exchange should gain access for its customers to the LSE in this way.US-based BATS becomes the fourth so-called “multilateral trading facility” (MTF) to challenge Europe’s established exchanges – after Chi-X, Turquoise and Nasdaq OMX Europe – under the auspices of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid).In a note to customers on Friday, Martin Graham, the LSE’s head of markets, said a new tariff structure introduced in September “incentivises our members and rewards volume posted on our markets through a
value-based discount scheme. This tariff is intended to benefit our members, who create our market. Business on behalf of other displayed markets will not be eligible for our discount scheme and will be subject to a different fee.”In the US, exchanges are responsible for routing orders to other exchanges if a better price exists at another venue. There is no such requirement in Europe, where trading venues appear to be using its absence to jostle for advantage. Randy Williams, BATS spokesman, said: “We believe routing is critical to a healthy and
efficient market.”"
677;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-10-30T19:28:45Z;Mifid opens door for US platforms in Europe;;When trading starts on Friday in FTSE 100 stocks on a new equities platform called BATS Europe, it will mark the next wave of US interest in a revolution in European share trading.BATS’s parent company started life as a technology company based in Kansas City, in the US Midwest. But in the past three years it has captured more than 10 per cent of the market in US share trading.Thanks to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, the Americans are now establishing a beachhead in Europe. Mifid was initiated by the European Commission with the vision of lowering transaction costs across Europe’s capital markets, in turn lowering the barriers to entry for ordinary investors and spurring the use of the markets to fund private pension schemes.Policymakers could see that Europe was at a disadvantage to the US, which long ago brought transaction costs down. Retail participation in the equities markets is far higher than in Europe.Mifid, which came into effect a year ago Saturday, kicked off that revolution by breaking the monopoly the region’s stock exchanges had long enjoyed on where a share is traded – and thus on how tariffs were charged to traders.The directive required brokers and other intermediaries to ensure that they were achieving “best execution” when they carried out a trade for a client, which opened the way for other trading platforms to challenge the exchanges.Best execution means not only getting the best price for a share for your client, but ensuring that the trade is cleared and settled in the most efficient and cost-effective way.BATS Europe is the fourth alternative trading platform – or multilateral trading facility – to have emerged since Mifid. The others are Chi-X, Turquoise, and Nasdaq OMX Europe. Equiduct is expected soon and there is industry talk of at least 10 additional MTFs waiting in the wings.Their existence is proof that in one important regard – competition in share trading – a key Mifid objective has been met.But some market participants think Mifid has thrown up problems that must still be resolved.Peter Randall, chief executive of Chi-X, majority owned by broker Instinet Europe – itself owned by Nomura of Japan – has taken to spelling Mifid out as meaning “Most Institutions Find It Difficult”, pointing out that “best execution” is hard to define in the absence of clear rules.Richard Balarkas, chief executive of Instinet Europe, believes that there are some brokers and investment banks that are not routing their clients’ orders in the most efficient way to the trading platforms but instead mingling these orders with their own proprietary order flow to “optimise their revenues”.“The [Mifid] regulations themselves do not require anyone to go to those venues [MTFs]. What’s worse is they allow you to hang on to client orders for motives that might not be wholly aligned with ‘best execution’,” he says.However, Phil Allison, head of European client trading and execution at UBS, says: “We’re looking at achieving the best possible result for clients. Best execution sets a bar and hopefully that bar is reasonably high so that anything that one might term egregious is not happening.”Another issue is that with the fragmentation of trading venues, market data has also fragmented, meaning that it is possible to see quotes for a particular stock on multiple venues – but only if you are connected to all the venues. The US gets around this problem by having a “consolidated tape”, where all quotes are aggregated.However, Will Meldrum, managing director of Markit, a financial information services company, says there are other issues – such as “double reporting” – that have been dealt with effectively as Mifid has been bedded down.
678;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;LSE hunts for new chief;;The London Stock Exchange has hired a City headhunter to find a replacement for its chief executive, Dame Clara Furse, signalling the beginning of the end of her long tenure at the exchange.The LSE said yesterday: ”Clara has been with the exchange for eight years and it’s natural that the board is thinking about succession planning.”Dame Clara is not expected to leave before the end of next year, at the earliest. The LSE said that, among other things, she would be completing the integration of Borsa Italiana, which the LSE bought last year.But the development is the first sign that the exchange is preparing to move further beyond the broadly defensive strategy adopted under Dame Clara as it fended off a string of hostile takeover bids, including from Nasdaq of the US and Deutsche Börse, the German exchange group.That strategy had been criticised by some analysts for what they saw as a slow response to emerging threats to the LSE’s business from new trading platforms in the wake of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or Mifid.On Friday another platform, BATS Trading of the US, goes live with trading in FTSE 100 stocks. It will be the fourth so-called ”multilateral trading facility” to challenge the LSE’s franchise since Turquoise, Nasdaq OMX Europe and the emergence 16 months ago of Chi-X, majority owned by Nomura of Japan.Nonetheless in the last nine months Dame Clara has overseen a number of aggressive responses to such threats, including cutting trading fees, offering incentives to high-frequency traders, upgrading the exchange’s TradElect trading engine and unveiling plans in June for a new type of trading facility known as a ”dark pool”, in joint venture with Lehman Brothers.The same month, the LSE awarded Dame Clara a 16 per cent rise in her total pay package after concern that her salary had ”fallen so far below” the median for her industry.The collapse of Lehman has thrown the dark pool venture – known as ”Baikal” – into doubt. Lehman was to have provided the technology for Baikal, based on its own ”LX” trading system.It is unclear who now owns LX since Lehman’s European trading operations were bought by Nomura, and with Barclays now owning Lehman’s US trading operations. The two sides are believed to be close to resolving the issue.The LSE said on Sunday that Baikal was ”definitely still on the agenda”. The exchange is also still in talks with other unnamed investors in Baikal, including but not limited to other investment banks.The LSE’s shares closed on Friday at 477.5p. That is well below the 530p offered for the exchange by Deutsche Börse, the German exchange group, in 2004, and Nasdaq’s final offer in 2006 of £12.43.
679;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-10-23T20:24:01Z;Amazon wins over sceptics about web services;;"Wall Street thought Jeff Bezos had his head in the clouds when he came up with the idea of Amazon’s becoming a utility that offered web services to other companies.In one sense, the financial analysts have been proved right. Amazon’s founder has made his company a trailblazer in the field now known as cloud computing.But when Amazon Web Services (AWS) was launched in March 2006, it seemed to investors like a diversification too far for the online retailer. The hundreds of millions of dollars Amazon was spending to build up its infrastructure and hire engineers were hard to justify.Today, the move seems less contentious. Microsoft and Google are among the big companies following Amazon’s lead and it reported a 41 per cent year-on-year growth in third-quarter revenues this week to $107m from the non-retail services that include AWS.Adam Selipsky, vice-president for product management and developer relations at AWS, says the company had spent over a decade building a massively scalable infrastructure to support its own operation at Amazon.com. It felt it had the scale and expertise to offer this to those who did not want to focus on or did not have the means to build their own.“We’ve built a business around providing the heavy lifting for developers with our cloud computing platform,” he says.Storage was seen as a basic need and S3 – Simple Storage Service – was the initial service launched. More than 400,000 developers are now using S3, which stored 29bn objects – anything from an e-mail to a video file – at the end of
the third quarter, growing from 22bn the previous quarter.Amazon followed up in August 2006 by offering raw computing power for businesses to run processes. Both services are pay-as-you-go – companies are charged only for the capacity they use and no contracts are needed.Other services have followed, including billing and account management.Adoption of Amazon’s services began with smaller Web 2.0-type companies but larger corporations have joined the client list in the past year, including Oracle, Sun, the New York Times and Nasdaq."
680;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-10-23T17:07:26Z;Nasdaq OMX Europe cuts trading fees;;In a sign of an intensifying price war in European equities trading Nasdaq OMX Europe on Thursday cut the fees it charges for using its trading facility only three weeks after launch.The move was designed to “position Nasdaq OMX Europe as the most competitively priced trading platform in Europe”, it said.Nasdaq OMX Europe is one of a handful of so-called “multilateral trading facilities” that have been or are about to be launched, in the wake of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, a Brussels initiative designed to break the monopolies of Europe’s established exchanges and spur competition.The MTFs have all touted fast trading systems and cheap fee structures as a competitive advantage. But as more MTFs are launched, each with similar offerings, it is becoming harder for would-be users to distinguish between them.Asked why Nasdaq OMX Europe was cutting fees so soon after launch, Charlotte Crosswell, its chief executive, told the Financial Times: “We always said we would look at pricing. We’re at the end of the roll-out [launch] and this is about getting market share quickly.“It’s a competitive space and it’s essential that we are positioned high up the chain. There is potentially only space for a few [MTFs] out there and it’s essential that some of the early movers take advantage of that,” she said.Next Friday a fourth MTF, US-based BATS Trading, launches with an initial focus on the FTSE 100.Separately, NYSE Euro­next and BME Spanish exchange yesterday introduced services aimed at making it easier for brokers and fund managers to demonstrate to regulators that they had achieved “best execution” of trades for clients, as required under Mifid.
681;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-10-17T11:38:57Z;Over the counter: Exchanges have their eyes on the next opportunity;;There may be no end in sight to the financial crisis, but one consequence is already clear: over-the-counter markets will never be the same again.The crisis has brought complex structured financial products out of deep obscurity and exposed their weaknesses. In particular, credit derivatives – which allow investors to make bets on the creditworthiness of baskets of corporate debt – stand accused as an accomplice in the meltdown.Bad mortgage debt was at the heart of the credit crunch but, in the eyes of many observers, banks’ inability to quantify their exposure through credit default swaps (CDSs), the main kind of credit derivative, aggravated the crisis, while swings in the CDS market exacerbated the plunge in bank stocks.CDSs allow investors either to bet on the chance of a debt default or to protect themselves from that risk. One party pays an annual fee to another, in exchange for a promise that it will be compensated in a default.The CDS market has experienced explosive growth, expanding by 81 per cent last year to a value of $62,200bn. Although the sector has shrunk since then, it is so large that outstanding contracts are often 10 or more times larger than the underlying “cash” bonds.Credit derivatives contracts are predominantly negotiated “over the counter” – privately between traders in banks, rather than on a central exchange. Because it is private, the decade-old sector has been largely unsupervised.While CDSs have been hugely profitable for financial institutions, the lack of regulation and opacity have proved to be the market’s Achilles heel.“The real criticism of [the market] is twofold,” observe analysts at CreditSights, the research firm. “One, it is unregulated and that hides overall credit risk. Second, the CDS market has provided an incentive for credit risk to be taken without proper due diligence.”Christopher Cox, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, recently told the Senate Banking Committee the CDS market provides “significant opportunities” for manipulation.Meanwhile David Paterson, governor of the state of New York, unveiled plans to redefine some types of the product as insurance and put them under the control of insurance supervisors.The pressure has prompted attempts to clean up the sector: credit derivatives markets saw their first ever decline in the volume of outstanding contracts over the first half of this year, as the financial industry moved to tear up economically offsetting transactions.TriOptima, a specialist in the sector, oversaw more than $17,400bn worth of credit derivative terminations in the first half of 2008 in the inter-dealer market, while, overall, the notional outstanding volume of credit derivatives was $54,600bn at the end of June, down 12 per cent from the end of 2007.While such “compression” certainly helps rationalise the industry, it now seems inevitable that regulators will force a complete overhaul of the CDS market. In response, financial institutions have unleashed a flood of central clearing counterparty (CCP) initiatives.The absence of a central clearer has made CDSs risky because there is no guarantee that parties will pay out. As the Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group, a taskforce of specialist bankers, has noted, a CCP would “create a shock absorber” that would reduce the impact of default by a big participant.In North America, CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, looks likely to be first off the mark.In early October, the Chicago-based company announced it was teaming up with Citadel, the hedge fund, to form an electronic marketplace and CCP for CDSs within 30 days.Days later, InterContinental Exchange (ICE), the electronic futures exchange based in Atlanta, struck a deal with The Clearing Corporation – a clearing house backed by big users of credit derivatives such as Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and JPMorgan – to create a “global clearing solution” for CDSs.In Europe, Liffe, a subsidiary of NYSE Euronext, plans to start a CCP by the end of the year, ahead of Eurex, the European derivatives exchange, which is aiming to launch by the middle of next year.Without banks’ support, CME’s solution may struggle to make inroads, as the CDS market in the US is dominated by a small number of large dealers. On the other hand, the crisis has put a strain on the dealers’ ability to fund a CCP.The US Federal Reserve is keen to speed up the various plans. As the Fed appears agnostic about which project to back, the CDS market seems set, at least at first, to resemble OTC energy markets, in which deals are done via telephone and can be cleared at Clearport, CME’s facility, or at the ICE’s clearing house.Fresh battlegrounds are also being marked out. Nasdaq OMX, for example, is investing $20m in International Derivatives Clearing Group, a venture that aims to be the first exchange to trade and clear OTC interest-rate swaps, a much larger than the CDSs.Exchanges, it seems, already have their eyes on the next OTC opportunity.
682;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-10-17T11:38:57Z;Alternative platforms: US electronic networks step on exchanges’ toes;;The line between exchanges and electronic communications networks is blurring, as the two leading US ECNs grow ever closer to attaining full exchange status, adding to the already fierce competition among trading venues.The two ECNs in question – BATS and Direct Edge – have been taking market share away from the historically dominant New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq in recent times.The new threat comes as the stock exchange business has been undergoing a revolution, with a series of mergers leading to rapid consolidation while new entrants continue to try to take a piece of the action.The opportunity springs from the growing take-up of electronic trading, which has seen volumes explode and the speed of trading now measured in microseconds.BATS Trading, based in Kansas City, has undercut traditional exchanges on fees since its inception three years ago, and has now received SEC approval for exchange status and plans to launch its National Securities Exchange this month.Meanwhile, Direct Edge has formed a partnership with the International Securities Exchange (ISE) that will advance its transition to exchange status.The progress of BATS in particular has led to criticism from some quarters, with some observers claiming it was successful only because the prices it charges are unsustainably low.But it seems clear that the threat it represents is a real one that exchanges can no longer ignore.Many of the users of BATS also have a vested interest in its success. It is backed by an ownership group that includes affiliates of Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Getco, JPMorgan, Lehman Brothers, Lime Brokerage, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, software developer Tradebot, and investment bank Tradebot.The progress of BATS continued last week as it won regulatory approval for a European offering that will compete with the London Stock Exchange, initially trading in UK stocks, with continental European stocks set to follow.The European launch will come after the launch of two rival platforms – Turquoise and a “pan-European market” backed by Nasdaq OMX. All three will provide added competition for incumbent exchanges in Europe, which have already seen the emergence of Chi-X, another investment bank-backed equities platform.These multilateral trading facilities (MTFs) have emerged recently and are designed to take advantage of stock trading rules under the European Union’s Mifid directive.Unlike Turquoise and Chi-X, BATS has a track record in the US, where it is already executing, or matching, 10 per cent of all US equities volume on its platform.As a result of platforms such as BATS, Nasdaq and others, the New York Stock Exchange has seen its share of NYSE-listed stocks fall to about 25 per cent of trades on publicly visible markets, according to Equity Research Desk, a consultancy.The arrival of BATS as an exchange should allow it to compete more effectively with the NYSE and Nasdaq, as it will no longer have to route its quotes through other exchanges to get them to the market.Separately, International Securities Exchange, one of the largest US options markets, recently became the largest shareholder in Direct Edge.This move further blurs the lines between established exchanges and alternative equities platforms.The deal between Direct Edge and the ISE also marks the first involvement by a European exchange in the competitive US equities market. ISE is owned by Frankfurt-based Deutsche Börse.Direct Edge is owned by a consortium including Knight Capital Group, Chicago-based hedge fund Citadel, and Goldman Sachs.Under the deal, ISE Holdings, the parent company of ISE Stock Exchange, will invest $123m in Direct Edge, giving it a 31.5 per cent stake, and Knight, Citadel and Goldman Sachs will reduce their stakes to 19.9 per cent each.At the same time, the ISE’s stock exchange unit will become a subsidiary of Direct Edge.The ISE Stock Exchange was set up about two years ago and operates an equities platform that combines a traditional “displayed” market, alongside a “dark pool”, offering anonymous block trading.ISE will also provide technology to Direct Edge, which will continue operating under its own brand.Direct Edge says that the deal will allow it to “position itself to meet the regulatory requirements necessary to become an exchange”.The ideal model for exchange groups remains unclear, however, as continuing volatility in the markets sends volumes soaring.After one of the most volatile trading weeks in the history of Wall Street, The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) processed a record 209m sides of a trade on Friday October 10 – a 15 per cent increase on the previous record of 182m achieved last month.
683;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-10-17T11:38:57Z;Time of crisis also gives opportunities;;This month, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange launched “Börsenspiel”, a competitive stock trading game aimed at attracting people who have never or only rarely traded stocks.Virtual seed money of €50,000 ($67,000) will be deposited into a fictitious securities account “for speculating and investing”. Participants will receive a special dictionary and be sent “supporting background articles” on investing to help them get up to speed with the art of stock market investing.In December, when the competition ends, prizes will be handed out, including a trading internship on the floor of the exchange.With stock markets experiencing their most stomach-churning weeks in living memory amid the unfolding global financial crisis, the timing of the Frankfurt exchange’s attempt to make trading fun may not have been ideal.According to the FTSE Mondo Visione Exchanges Index, which tracks the performance of 17 of the world’s publicly listed exchanges, $16bn was wiped off the value of market capitalisation at those exchanges in September alone.Not only has the financial crisis brought to a screeching halt years of unbroken growth at many of the world’s stock and derivatives exchanges, it has cast a shadow over businesses that were once the darlings of the financial sector. Demutualisation and public listing of exchanges had helped drive record volumes on most exchanges since at least 2002, when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange became the first US futures exchange to get a stock market listing.Herbie Skeete, managing director of Mondo Visione, which produces research on the 300-plus exchanges operating globally, says consolidation and increased deployment of sophisticated trading technology have helped exchanges perform more efficiently.But he predicts: “Volumes in most asset classes may decline in coming months as markets react to recent changes in financial markets. This, coupled with a slowdown in the number of IPOs [initial public offerings] suggests more downside for listed exchanges, at least in the short term.”At the World Federation of Exchanges’ annual meeting in Milan this month, Nasdaq OMX president Magnus Bocker said the outlook for the next year was “gloomy”, predicting a fall in equity trading volume into next year.Volatility has helped volumes, especially in the futures and options markets, which thrive on sudden changes in market expectations for the performance of underlying instruments or economic data.US options trading has remained relatively robust, for example. Credit Suisse estimates volumes in the first half of this month at the Chicago Board Options Exchange and International Securities Exchange were up 82 per cent and 43 per cent respectively. But the value of assets traded is falling as hedge funds, some of the biggest users of exchanges, cut back on trading as their prime brokers scale back lending to them in a process of “deleveraging”.Moreover, established stock exchanges in Europe have this year been forced to deal with the rise of alternative equities trading platforms in the wake of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, or Mifid.Enacted 11 months ago by the European Commission, the rule has broken the exchanges’ monopolies on the trading of stocks in their host country and opened the door to competition for the first time in decades.Using ultra-high-speed trading systems and offering cheaper tariffs than the incumbents, the new platforms – such as Chi-X, Turquoise and Nasdaq OMX Europe, backed by the US-based exchange Nasdaq OMX, have started to make inroads.Tariff erosion is likely to continue, experts believe, as competition continues and users of exchanges focus on cost reduction and managing risk. Tabb Group, a consultancy, says: “There is no question that exchanges will lose market share to the [new platforms] and will need to fight hard to retain their commanding position, as their cost structures struggle with cumbersome legacy environments, lost revenue and pricing wars”.New issuance on exchanges has also slowed to a trickle, with IPO activity showing no sign of returning soon. While IPOs make up only a small part of an exchange’s revenues, new company listings are the lifeblood of a bourse’s secondary market.Consolidation has also slowed, although some acquisitions have still gone through: CME’s acquisition of the New York Mercantile Exchange, and NYSE Euronext’s purchase of a 25 per cent stake in the Doha Securities Market and of a 5 per cent stake in India’s Multi Commodity Exchange. The MCX is owned by Financial Technologies group, an ambitious Indian trading technology company that offers a glimpse of the way the exchange business could be reshaped in Asia.Yet as bad as the financial crisis is likely to be for exchanges, the mood is not all gloomy.Lee Hodgkinson, chief executive of SWX Europe, the London-based Swiss blue-chip stocks platform, says the new platforms might proceed more slowly amid a “dramatic paring back of customer IT budgets, resource allocation and changed priorities”.There are some signs that exchanges could be the beneficiaries of the fallout in other important ways.Some of the issues at the centre of the crisis, such as lack of transparency in the pricing of certain assets and poor counterparty risk management, highlight the importance – as the exchanges see it – of the kind of market infrastructure that the exchanges have long provided, such as transparent and reliable pricing, clearing and full regulation.Deirdre Somers, chief executive of the Irish Stock Exchange, says: “In recent months, despite extraordinary market conditions, regulated exchanges have, without fail, delivered …price formation, transparency and execution. More importantly, recent events have underscored how critical it is to have market operators who are highly vested in longterm market integrity and stability.“As economies, markets and investors respond to the changes ahead, it is time to re-assert the voice of the regulated exchange as a force for re-establishing much-needed stability and investor confidence.”Concerns over counterparty risk may also provide exchanges with opportunities. Regulators will be pushing for much of the over-the-counter trade in derivatives, foreign exchange and other asset classes to be cleared.
684;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-10-16T22:06:39Z;Nasdaq OMX takes 22% stake in EMCF;;"Nasdaq OMX, the transatlantic exchange, on Thursday snapped up a 22 per cent stake in EMCF, the securities clearing operation set up only a year ago by Fortis, the Belgo-Dutch partially nationalised bank.The move underlines how the global financial crisis has thrust the unglamorous role of securities clearing to the forefront of the exchange industry’s and regulators’ agendas, as their attention focuses on ensuring the stability of financial markets.A clearing house, or CCP, stands between two parties to a trade and guarantees trades in the event of a default. The lack of a CCP in the over-the-counter credit derivatives markets has prompted regulators to push aggressively for the creation of such an entity.The EMCF move came as Nasdaq OMX said it would for the first time introduce CCP clearing in the group’s four Nordic stock markets, based in Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Iceland. Both developments highlight how exchanges appear to realise that with trading volumes set to drop amid a global recession, clearing offers another source of revenue.Nasdaq this week said it planned to set up a CCP in the US, to compete against The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, a vast quasi-utility that handles most US post-trade processes.Nasdaq said that its objective in taking the stake in EMCF – the European Multilateral Trading Facility – was to “reinforce EMCF’s position as a leading cash and equity CCP”. EMCF already acts as clearer for Chi-X, one of a handful of alternative equities trading platforms that are emerging to challenge Europe’s established bourses.It also clears for Nasdaq OMX Europe, a similar platform that Nasdaq OMX itself launched two weeks ago. A third platform, BATS Trading, starts operating on October 31, again using EMCF.Europe’s post-trade landscape is fragmented between multiple providers of clearing and settlement services. Such services are more centralised in the US, dominated by DTCC.Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq OMX chief executive, said: “Investing in EMCF allows us to provide a cohesive clearing solution to our customers and a cost and risk-efficient clearing model.” He said the aim was for EMCF to “become the leading cash equity central
counterparty clearing facility in Europe”."
685;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
686;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-10-13T22:21:57Z;Nasdaq OMX to take on DTCC;;In a sign of increasing market focus on central counterparty risk, Nasdaq OMX said on Monday it planned to launch a clearing service for US cash equities in competition with The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, the vast industry-owned post-trade group.The move is believed to be the first by any US exchange into the clearing of equities, which has for years been dominated by the DTCC, a quasi-utility that also handles all equities settlement, as well as post-trade services in over-the-counter derivatives.It comes amid expectations that the fallout from the global financial crisis will increase regulatory pressure to ensure mechanisms are in place to reduce the risk of default in the trading of most asset classes by strengthening central clearing systems.Such pressure is already intense in credit derivatives, where banks and exchanges are jostling to provide the first central clearing counterparty in OTC credit derivatives.While post-trade costs for cash equities in the US are a fraction of those in Europe, Chris Concannon, Nasdaq OMX’s executive vice-president of transaction services, said there was scope for US clearing costs to come down further.“I believe there are some inefficiencies in US clearing for cash equities and we think there are a number of opportunities to help our clients reduce their clearing costs,” he told the Financial Times.“We’ve heard from our clients that the cost of clearing in the US is still relatively expensive given the notional values traded here.”Nasdaq is entering the clearing business through its purchase in August of the Boston Stock Exchange, which has a clearing house that Nasdaq will rename the Nasdaq Clearing Corporation. The new clearing platform would be running by next year.It will compete with the DTCC’s National Securities Clearing Corporation subsidiary.Mr Concannon said Nasdaq would offer “real time netting” of trades.He said NSCC netted batches of trades at night, informing market participants the next morning what their net settlement and margin obligations would be.Nasdaq’s system would operate in real time, allowing traders to know their margin obligations for the next day at the close of the current trading day.DTCC was not immediately available for comment.
687;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-10-02T16:31:08Z;Nasdaq to trade OTC interest rate swaps;;Nasdaq OMX is to take its first significant step into the futures business with an investment in a new venture that aims to be the first exchange to trade and clear over the counter interest rate swaps.The move is another sign of how exchanges are moving to capitalise on regulatory pressure to bring OTC products into a centrally-cleared environment to help reduce systemic risk.The OTC interest rate swap market is much larger than the credit default swaps market, which is already the focus of efforts by exchanges and banks to migrate the market to a centrally cleared model.Last week Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq OMX chief executive, referring to the current financial crisis, said that if interest swaps or credit default swaps “had been traded on an exchange type of model, we would be under a better set of circumstances”.Nasdaq will extend a $20m capital facility to International Derivatives Clearing Group, a new entity set up by other investors. Alan Sobba, who represents IDCG, declined to name the investors.IDCG this week applied to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US futures regulator, for a clearing house licence. The venture will eventually be capitalised at $50m, according to a filing with the CFTC.IDCG said it would license the Idex swap futures contract to the Philadelphia Board of Trade, a futures exchange belonging to the PHLX Philadelphia bourse that Nasdaq OMX bought last year. PBOT would “list them for competitive trading,” the filing said.“Initially, the [IDCG] clearing house will clear US dollar denominated fixed versus floating interest rate swaps,” it said.Nasdaq OMX will also provide IDCG with Click & Secur, a type of clearing technology already used and licensed out by OMX in Sweden.
688;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-10-01T01:12:00Z;Nasdaq OMX slams LSE over tariffs;;A row erupted on Tuesday night between Nasdaq OMX, the transatlantic exchange, and the London Stock Exchange, with the US-based group accusing its rival of “anticompetitive behaviour”.The LSE plans to place a special tariff on share trading orders that are channelled to it from competing platforms as it mounts the latest counter-attack against a growing band of upstart trading venues.The move is aimed at Nasdaq OMX Europe, one of three pan-European “multilateral trading facilities” to have emerged in recent months to challenge Europe’s exchanges.Like other exchanges, Chi-X and Turquoise, the Nasdaq MTF aims to take advantage of trading and clearing rules known as Mifid, which were passed by Brussels last year. Mifid broke the exchanges’ monopolies and is designed to create competition in share trading.Nasdaq OMX Europe started trading last week in 600 shares across Europe, including the same FTSE 100 blue-chips offered on the LSE. Relations between the LSE and Nasdaq OMX were soured by the failed 2006 hostile takeover bid by the US group for the London bourse.Nasdaq OMX Europe has hired Citi to provide an “order routing” service that takes any orders that cannot be fulfilled on Nasdaq OMX Europe’s order book and seeks out a market where they are more likely to find matches – including the LSE and other alternative platforms.In response, the LSE now plans to introduce a way of distinguishing between orders that come straight through to the exchange and those that arrive through order routing from competing platforms. It will then charge a different tariff for orders that arrive from a competing platform.Charlotte Crosswell, chief executive of Nasdaq OMX Europe, said the LSE’s action would “suppress competition and market innovation” and was “contrary to the core principles of Mifid”.She accused the LSE of “artificially control[ling] competition in order to maintain high prices”.“Given this anti-competitive behaviour we are now forced to escalate our objections,” she said.John Wallace, from the LSE, said: “[We] welcome competition that leads to a more innovative, efficient market for equities. However, Nasdaq OMX appears to think it can avail itself of LSE member firm privileges.“We beg to differ, and think it is right to distinguish between our customers, who create our market, and our competitors, who are just that, competitors.”Mr Wallace added: “There is nothing to stop them from competing as a number of new entrants are doing.”The arrival of Nasdaq OMX Europe and the launch in coming months of two more MTFs – BATS Trading of the US and Equiduct, majority owned by Börse Berlin – will provide further competition for the LSE and others.But questions remain over how long MTFs can survive financially by maintaining rock-bottom tariff structures if volumes tail off.A report from Tabb, a consultancy, says: “Competition will be fierce and eventually lead to overcrowding by MTFs, which will trigger mergers and acquisitions, not to mention a few flops.”
689;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-09-30T07:21:25Z;Services: Playing catch-up in the innovation economy;;When it comes to developing beyond an oil-dependent economy, Russia’s Soviet legacy is both its blessing and its curse.Its vast reserves of natural resources led to the rise of an economy fed by heavy industry – but also a highly educated workforce steeped in science. This, investors hope, will steer the country into the world of high technology.The Russian leadership is keenly aware of having missed the technology boom of the late 1990s, and is pouring funds into fringe ventures such as nanotechnology while paying steady lip-service to the need for innovation.Private investors, meanwhile, are banking on the massive growth in consumer income that accompanied Russia’s oil-fuelled economic boom, and say they see no signs yet that the market turmoil of recent weeks has trickled down to affect the average Russian.“Switching to an innovation economy takes a long time, and requires much more long-term effort than one needs to overcome the traditional fall and rise in oil prices,” says Leonid Melamed, chief executive of Sistema, a holding company that brought in $13.7bn of revenue last year and has interests in telecommunications, technology and banking, among others.The long-term trends are strong, say Mr Melamed and other market leaders, pointing to steady GDP growth, a middle class developing beyond the traditional centres of Moscow and St Petersburg, and a consumer culture that favours spending.They believe they are catching the upswing of what is expected to be a significant curve.“The internet is really only starting right now in Russia,” says Alexander Tamas, a partner at DST, a company that invests in Russia’s top e-mail and social networking sites.“Every day, there are roughly 25,000 new Russian speakers online for the first time.” DST expects the number of Internet users to double to $60m by 2010.In 2007, Russia’s advertising market brought in $9bn, just 2 per cent of which was spent on the internet, far below the 20 per cent average seen in the west, Mr Tamas says.“It’s almost like a time machine,” he says. “Online advertising is exactly what you had in the US in 1997, and very close to what China had in 2002 or 2003.”The fact the Russian market remained so small for so long it kept foreign investors away, leaving the field to homegrown players such as mail.ru and social networking site Odnoklassniki.Russia is one of the few markets to hold off Google’s dominance – Russian search engine Yandex rules instead.“On the internet, when you’re late, it’s difficult to catch up, no matter how much money you have,” says Mr Tamas.Yandex, barring a rethink in the wake of the global financial crisis, plans to list on Nasdaq this year in a float that would value it at $5bn (£2.7bn).Consumption trends show many Russian consumers spending more and more disposable income on advanced technologies, warranting Russia’s focus on high-tech and services over basic consumer goods.“We have clearly reached a scale of full mass consumption,” says Michael Hecker, vice-president for strategy at MTS, Russia’s largest mobile phone company, which is majority owned by Sistema.“In the mid- to long-term we will reach the same level of usage, and more or less of spending, that we see in highly developed markets, such as the US or western Europe.”The bulk of the company’s growth comes from low- to mid-income brackets, as subscribers tend to double their spending, however small, each year, Mr Hecker says.That trend could change if the liquidity crisis that struck Russia’s financial sector in September translates into a drop in real wages, but Mr Hecker and others insist Russia’s fundamentals will prevail.“We have not seen any substantial impact yet, and don’t think even at an advanced stage it would affect the fundamental trend in any substantial way,” he says.“It’s a highly educated, literate, communicative and technologically interested population,” he adds.Yet as the oil price that drives Russia’s growth remains high, despite fluctuations, the state’s attention to high-tech remains confined in large part to grand statements about modernisation.“Russia has the curse of mineral resources,” observes Mr Melamed, sitting in his expansive office overlooking the Kremlin. “A lot of attractive initiatives don’t go as quickly as some people would like because of this curse.”The world’s largest country remains woefully lacking in infrastructure, from transport to communications to reach the millions of Russians who live in its far reaches.Investing in high-tech is also a way to develop Russia’s traditional industries, including its life-blood oil industry, says Mr Melamed.He says: “On the one hand you can’t develop as a country if you’re not developed in high-tech. On the other hand, high-tech develops your country and your people.”
690;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-09-26T13:12:06Z;Volatility drives rise in LSE volumes;;Volatility in equities markets drove an upturn in trading volume at the London Stock Exchange in the five months to August, but revenue per trade – a key barometer of an exchange’s financial health – fell.The figures were released on Friday, as trading began on an alternative share trading platform backed by the LSE’s US-based rival, Nasdaq OMX.The new platform, known as Nasdaq OMX Europe, becomes the second so-called “multilateral trading facility” (MTF) to have started operating this month, after Turquoise, and the third since the launch of Chi-X last year.The MTFs represent the most serious challenge to the LSE’s core business in decades.Dan Garrod, an analyst at Citi, said volatility had caused a “strong pick-up in activity both by value and volume” at the LSE, where volumes had been “resilient” in spite of competition from Chi-X.But he and other analysts pointed out that a growing trend towards smaller trade sizes – due to the growth of so-called “algorithmic” trading – was putting downward pressure on average yield per bargain.Algorithmic trading uses complex computer programmes to react to or anticipate minute shifts in data or news. It is popular among the largest users of the MTFs, such as hedge funds and other institutional traders.The LSE has upgraded its electronic trading system to attract such traders. It used to rely heavily on numbers of trades passing through its trading platform but since the introduction of a new fee structure this month the bourse’s fees are more skewed towards value traded.At the same time, trade sizes are becoming smaller as traders slice large orders into ever-smaller sizes to make sure trades are executed faster.Mamoun Tazi of MF Global pointed out that revenue per bargain continued to decline “at a rapid pace”.In August alone, average daily value traded at the LSE was £6.2bn, down from £9.2bn in August last year but up from £4.7bn in August 2006. Volumes were up 27 per cent from the year-ago period.The LSE said it was deliberately bringing yield per trade down as a way of incentivising more trading.Patrick Humphris, an LSE spokesman, said: “Essentially what we are doing is reducing the price for our customers to trade and by doing that, we are incentivising them to trade more, so that our revenues go up. Our trading revenues are not falling. That’s because we are getting more trades through.”However Mr Tazi said: “Competition is setting in and will continue to take market share. Chi-X is slowly taking more market share. Turquoise is now up and running and Nasdaq is just starting. As LSE continues to lose market share, the pressure on yields/fees could intensify even more.”The LSE said that initial public offerings on its main market and the Aim junior board were down 56 per cent in the five months, compared with the same period a year earlier.IPOs represent only 7 per cent of the LSE’s revenues but they are important to maintaining the exchange’s reputation as a global listings venue, and to keeping its secondary market supplied with issuance.Dame Clara Furse, LSE chief executive, said: “Our issuer services division turned in a good performance despite testing market conditions for equity issuance, with over 100 new issues, including 25 international companies.”The LSE pointed out that while new issues were down year-on-year, the exchange remained “strong in terms of international IPOs, equivalent to the number on Nasdaq OMX and NYSE Euronext combined”.Shares in the LSE were 27p or 3.2 per cent lower at 807p in afternoon London trading.
691;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-09-24T22:19:31Z;Dubai’s watchdog sanctions Shuaa Capital;;Dubai’s financial regulator on Wednesday sanctioned investment bank Shuaa Capital for alleged share manipulation, the regulator’s highest-profile enforcement since the Dubai International Financial Centre opened for business four years ago.The Dubai Financial Services Authority, which oversees regulated companies operating in the DIFC, said it had fined Shuaa Capital’s DIFC arm $950,000 and criticised it for obstructing its six-month investigation.“The DFSA has determined that Shuaa Capital intentionally set about to raise the closing price of DP World shares on 31 March 2008 so that it could mark up the book value of its proprietary portfolio in those shares for accounting purposes,” the DFSA said in a statement.“It did so by standing in the market during the closing minutes of trading with bid prices well above those at which DP World shares had been trading in the ordinary course of business.”Shuaa Capital said in a statement that it regretted the “lapse in its internal control systems,” describing it as an isolated incident that did not reflect the company’s values.The move comes amid a corruption probe against government-linked companies operating in Dubai’s real estate and financial sectors.The action marks the highest-profile regulatory action taken by the authority, which launched under a cloud after the DIFC’s governing body sacked the DFSA’s independent chief executive and chairman, who had raised questions about the DIFC’s standards of corporate governance.The DFSA, which fined Shuaa Capital for both the share manipulation and obstructing the investigation, is forcing the bank to appoint a new chief compliance officer and train staff in the regulations of the centre.“This conduct has prolonged resolution of the investigation and is inconsistent with the standards of behaviour that DFSA expects from regulated firms within the DIFC,” David Knott, chief executive of the DFSA, said.This incident is not the first time Shuaa has been criticised. A Paris-based magazine last year raised questions about Shuaa’s conduct in a share transaction in Kuwait. Shuaa denied the allegations.Shuaa Capital is one of the most established local investment banks in the region, with a long history in corporate advisory, asset management and private equity.The DFSA said DP World was blameless in the matter.Dubai-listed Shuaa was one of four lead managers in DP World’s $5bn initial public offering last year on the Dubai International Financial Exchange, the DIFC’s bourse that is now part-owned by Nasdaq as part of the takeover of the US exchange company and Borse Dubai’s acquisition of OMX Group.Some investors criticised Shuaa’s handling of the share allocation process, calling on the DFSA to investigate the process and for the allocation details to be made public.
692;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-09-22T20:03:37Z;Challenge to LSE pricing feeds;;A group of upstart share trading platforms and Nasdaq OMX, the US-based exchange group, have formed a loose alliance to devise a system that would provide an alternative to the London Stock Exchange’s dominance of market data and price reporting.The initiative reflects unease among market participants that the fragmentation of share trading platforms as a result of the Mifid rules from Brussels is also resulting in fragmentation of share price information.Investors now have at least four places where they can see the bid and offer price for shares in the largest UK companies: the LSE, Chi-X, Plus Markets and Turquoise, which on Monday went live across 13 European equities markets.However, not all investors have the data feeds they need for comparative purposes. In the US there exists a central mechanism for aggregating price reporting – known as consolidated tape.The LSE has long been the only “reference market” for pricing purposes, and operates a lucrative business providing market data.Chi-X, Turquoise and Nasdaq OMX have in recent weeks joined an informal working group formed by Plus Markets, a London-based exchange that competes with Aim and with the LSE on some larger-cap stocks.Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq OMX chief executive, said: “We certainly want to take a leadership role on that. We think it will not be too difficult to come up with a market-based solution.”The Investment Management Association, the trade body for UK fund managers, warned in June investors were unable to judge accurately whether UK equity trades were being executed at the best possible price. It blamed a proliferation of price-reporting mechanisms.The issue was highlighted this month when the LSE’s trading system failed. Trading did not migrate to Chi-X and Turquoise because traders still rely on the LSE to provide the most reliable benchmark for pricing.The LSE argues there is already a form of consolidated tape in the market in the form of data feeds provided by companies such as Bloomberg and Reuters.John Wallace, of the LSE, said: “I don’t think there is the need for anything prescriptive to be done, as was the case in the US.”
693;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-09-22T10:35:58Z;Turquoise claims 2% of European trading;;Turquoise, the share trading platform backed by nine investment banks, on Monday claimed it had captured more than 2 per cent of trading in Europe’s most liquid stocks as it turned fully operational after weeks of testing.In the three weeks since it began trading on a limited basis more than 1,200 stocks across Europe, Turquoise has seen days on which it has notched up €1bn on single days.That compares with €7bn achieved by rival platform Chi-X, which launched 15 months ago.Eli Lederman, Turquoise chief executive, said: “While we’re very pleased with the initial market share gains, we know that volumes develop over time.”Both Turquoise and Chi-X are competing with Europe’s established bourses for market share in European equities trading.Their emergence as rivals to the incumbents – such as the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse – has been made possible by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid), a European Union initiative designed to break the monopolies of established exchanges.Platforms like Turquoise are hoping to use their low cost base, cheap trading fees and rapid trading technology to steal market share from established exchanges. The exchanges are responding with price cuts and technology upgrades. Some have announced plans to set up their own alternative trading platforms.On Friday, US-based Nasdaq OMX launches its own platform, known as Nasdaq OMX Europe.In a nod to the traditions surrounding some of the established exchanges, Turquoise marked its formal launch on Monday with the ringing of the “Turquoise Bell”, which was cast for the platform at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry – Britain’s oldest continuously operated manufacturing company.Turquoise said the bell symbolised “the traditional values of reliability and integrity that have characterised successful exchanges through history”.The launch of Turquoise was marred three weeks ago when it suffered a technology glitch that halted trading during its initial weeks of testing. The LSE suffered an almost total one-day outage shortly afterwards.Separately Euro CCP, Turquoise’s clearer and a subsidiary of the US-based Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, said five new customers had signed up to use its clearing and settlement platform: Landsbanki Securities, MF Global, Numis Securities, Parel and Pershing Securities.The addition of these firms brings the number of clearing participants in Euro CCP to 20.
694;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-09-21T22:31:30Z;Nasdaq takes aim at LSE listings;;Nasdaq OMX, the transatlantic exchange group, plans to set up a listings venue in London in direct competition with the London Stock Exchange for initial public offerings.The move is part of a multi-pronged effort to expand in Europe and comes two years after Nasdaq’s failed attempt to buy the LSE.Nasdaq OMX is already poised on Friday to become the first US-based exchange to launch a pan-European alternative equities trading platform.The platform is a so-called “multilateral trading facility” – set up to take advantage of Mifid share-trading rules – such as Turquoise, which formally launches across 13 European markets today. Both platforms are a threat to established Europeans such as LSE and Deutsche Börse.Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq OMX chief executive, said the MTF would allow discounts to existing users of Nasdaq or OMX.Its pricing would be “dramatically” lower than other planned MTFs, such as BATS Trading that launches in the UK in November, because it would be “leveraging its [global] scale”.He said: “It’s certainly going to compress pricing further [across Europe]”. He predicted volume would move away from the LSE “because of the MTFs”. The LSE says volume did not leak to alternative platforms on its recent one-day system failurebecause it is the only “reference market” for setting prices participants can trust.Mr Greifeld said Nasdaq OMX would apply “within weeks” to the UK Financial Services Authority to set up an exchange in London to attract IPOs.It would also set up a “global listings centre” to handle the paperwork for any company wishing to list in any jurisdiction covered by Nasdaq OMX.
695;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-25T22:25:02+0000;Nasdaq OMX calls for client benefits;;Robert Greifeld, the chief executive of Nasdaq OMX, says the time has come for exchanges to start delivering the real benefits to their clients of the wave of consolidation that has swept the business.For its part Nasdaq OMX, the exchange operator, will on Monday introduce a new pricing scheme based on global transaction volume, together with new listing services designed to allow companies to list more easily on multiple Nasdaq OMX markets across the world.Mr Greifeld said the move marked an important step towards delivering the frequently talked-about benefits of consolidation to exchange users.The Nasdaq has played a big part in that consolidation, merging with OMX, the Nordic exchange operator earlier this year. It had previously tried unsuccessfully to buy the London Stock Exchange and the launch of a listings business in London will see it compete directly with the LSE.Mr Greifeld said: “We’ve witnessed a tremendous amount of exchange consolidation in the last several years, but exchanges still have not articulated or delivered to their customers the real value of those transactions.”The consolidation appears to be slowing now with many of the largest potential mergers now done and the largest exchanges such as NYSE Euronext, CME Group and Nasdaq OMX concentrating on integrating the various parts of their businesses rather than trying to pursue more growth through further acquisitions.One exchange analyst said: “Most of the exchanges have their hands full trying to deliver on the cost savings of their respective mergers and also adjusting in many cases to their new status as public companies.”Nasdaq OMX’s transaction pricing is designed to provide cost incentives for firms conducting trading across the exchange’s US and Nordic markets and Nasdaq OMX Europe, linking the markets in a new way.It is hoped that the tiered transaction pricing, due to come into effect later this month, will provide customers with a lower total cost of trading in Nasdaq OMX liquidity pools in the US, London, and the Nordic exchanges, based on aggregate volume.Mr Greifeld, said: “Global customers want to deal with global enterprises. While this has been the norm in most industries, the exchange space has been the exception to the rule.”Meanwhile, Nasdaq OMX’s expanded listing services aim to let companies access multiple listing markets more efficiently, and with less bureaucracy. The often arduous process of listing can deter many companies from pursuing a public offering.Nasdaq’s move comes as NYSE Euronext, the transatlantic exchange operator and Nasdaq’s main rival, gets set to combat alternative share trading platforms in Europe by launching one of its own, further escalating the battle for market share in the region.Europe’s established exchanges face an assault by share trading platforms, such as Turquoise and Chi-X, which are challenging them with fast trading and low fees.They have emerged because of the competitive forces unleashed by share trading rules passed by the European Commission last year as part of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, which broke the exchanges’ dominance over where shares may be traded.
696;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-09-14T22:33:32Z;Deutsche Börse debates MTF launch;;Deutsche Börse is considering setting up alternative trading facilities to compete for business with rival stock exchanges in the latest sign of the dogfight for European share trading.Deutsche Börse, which has already said it is considering a so-called “dark pool” crossing network, is studying whether and how to set up a more open multi-lateral trading facility (MTF), according to people familiar with its plans.If it goes ahead the system would trade shares listed in several European markets, not just Deutsche Börse’s home market of Germany.The plans are being drawn up as the London Stock Exchange, Nasdaq OMX and NYSE Euronext, operator of the Amsterdam, Paris and several other bourses, react to new pan-European regulations by setting up alternative share trading facilities. MTFs aim to undercut the price of traditional exchanges, while dark pools – which are variants of MTFs – make the trading of large blocks of shares easier by keeping orders secret.Deutsche Börse has not committed to setting up an MTF but is examining the business case and is prepared to open a facility or buy a rival, people close to the matter said.New European financial market rules have encouraged a string of ventures to set up MTFs to challenge traditional exchanges. Chi-X, which is majority owned by broker Instinet Europe, was the first MTF to open in Europe last year, with others such as BATS Trading, Turquoise and Equiduct, majority owned by Börse Berlin, following or preparing systems.NYSE Euronext said it would offer a pan-European trading platform – competing with Deutsche Börse and London – last week, with a phased launch of its MTF due to start in November. Euronext has teamed up with HSBC and BNP Paribas to develop a dark pool, while the LSE has linked with Lehman Brothers to develop a dark pool called Baikal.Deutsche Börse’s system, if it goes ahead, will not be available until next year.Officials at Deutsche Börse have been sceptical about the prospects for alternative trading schemes, producing research suggesting the all-in cost – the spread and the fees together – is higher than on traditional markets.“We are carefully observing how they are doing and what they will really do to the business,” Deutsche Börse said.
697;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-09-09T18:17:13Z;Time to concentrate on integration;;Terry Duffy may be chairman of a global financial exchange that has just completed the $8.4bn acquisition of New York’s Nymex, but he remains a Chicagoan to the core.“What’s the name of that park in Manhattan?” he asks during his interview with the Financial Times, temporarily forgetting the name of one of New York’s most famous landmarks as he gives an example to illustrate the use of weather derivatives. “Oh yeah, Central Park.”Regardless of his apparent lack of familiarity with the geography of New York, as chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Mr Duffy sits at the head of a company that is a serious global competitor to the two super-exchanges that dominate the city: Nasdaq OMX and NYSE-Euronext.In the past two years, Mr Duffy has helped steer the CME through two large acquisitions that have given the company control over 98 per cent of US listed futures and transformed it into the largest futures exchange in the world.A former hog trader, the CME chairman retains the air of a straight-talking dealmaker. That proved instrumental in the company’s 2007 acquisition of the Chicago Board of Trade and the purchase of Nymex.To secure approval for the most recent transaction, the CME had to win over 612 votes of Nymex’s 816 class A members. That entailed a lot of one-on-one lobbying by senior CME management, a process Mr Duffy says “got a little tedious at the end”.The CME was able to win member approval without overpaying by choosing its concessions wisely, such as its commitment to retain Nymex’s trading floor until 2012 and to charge Nymex’s members lower trading fees.“I met with a lot of members,” he says. “I’m fortunate: I’ve been a member of this exchange since 1981, so people know I’m a straightforward person and I don’t say things I don’t believe in. So anything I said to the Nymex guys is something I truly believe …so I hopefully had an impact on them.”Taking over Nymex has given the CME stakes in various other ventures, such as the Dubai Mercantile Exchange and the Montreal exchange.Mr Duffy will not be drawn on whether the CME might sell any of those assets. “It’s premature to say what we’d be doing with them. Right now we’re going through all these businesses to understand them and it’s going to take us a little time to make any decision about whether we want to liquidate or maintain them.”After two huge takeovers in as many years, Mr Duffy suggests the company is unlikely to make any similarly large purchases in the near future.“We have the capacity to do a lot of things, but we are definitely not looking at doing another big acquisition at this moment,” he says. “We have to integrate the Nymex.“We’ve done two deals in 18 months. It’s critically important that we execute on these transactions. A lot of people can do deals. But what’s important is to make the deals work. We all know the statistics around mergers and acquisitions: 80 per cent of the acquiring companies fail to integrate properly,” he says.In recent months, the CME has become a victim of the credit crunch, as deleveraging by big financial institutions has led to lower trading volumes. Concern over the issue has been a main factor in the CME’s depressed share price: it closed last Friday at $328.93, down from a high of $714.48 last December.“The credit crunch was something that truly hurt our volumes,” Mr Duffy says. “We’ve seen some banks go through some major issues. These are big participants in our marketplace and they have pulled back.”He lamented the fact that the credit situation was so bad that financial institutions were finding it almost impossible to get loans. “That’s who qualifies for a loan right now – people who don’t want them or need them. That’s the predicament that we’re in.”Although he is wary of giving any predictions on timing, Mr Duffy is confident the volume will return.“Is it a long-term issue or a cyclical issue that will work itself out? We obviously think it’s the latter,” he says. “These products will come back and trade very actively and aggressively. I don’t think the financial system as we know it is coming to an end.”
698;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-09-01T08:22:18Z;LSE cuts fees to fend off competition;;The London Stock Exchange on Monday introduced deep fee cuts and incentives for traders in the latest sign Europe’s exchanges are ratcheting up efforts to defend themselves against a wave of new entrants in equities trading.The move comes as Nasdaq OMX Europe, one of the new entrants, will on Monday appoint Citigroup to provide electronic routing of orders from its new trading platform to others in Europe.The next two months will see the launch of three alternative venues offering trading in pan-European equities. They are the result of the competitive forces unleashed by the Mifid securities trading rules, enacted in 2007 by the European Commission. The move broke the exchanges’ monopolies on where shares could be traded.Turquoise, one of the two so-called “multilateral trading facilities” to have emerged, enters its third week of testing. On Friday, it expands testing to a full range of shares across 13 European markets. The other MTF is Chi-X, majority owned by broker Instinet Europe. It has captured a roughly 13 per cent market share of all volume traded in FTSE 100 stocks since it was launched 14 months ago.From Monday, traders using the LSE will be eligible for incentives for liquidity provision, including zero fees for “passive executions” – where traders effectively advertise a trade they are prepared to execute and wait for a buyer to appear. These would allow up to £2.5bn in value to be traded.The LSE will also abolish a 7.5p execution charge and a 1p order management charge. The tariff changes are designed to attract a new breed of trader that uses complex computer algorithms to drive large numbers of orders in rapid-fire fashion, often in response to minute data shifts. LSE shares fell 27½p or nearly 3.5 per cent to 765½p.These “algorithmic traders” are increasingly critical to exchanges since they are the biggest users of the MTFs and are growing fast as a proportion of overall trading volume. Such traders account for 50 per cent of order flow into equities trading at Deutsche Börse, which last week also cut its fees.Nasdaq OMX Europe, an MTF-backed transatlantic exchange, will be the first of the new entrants to offer an “order routing” service when it launches in late September. If any part of trades done on Nasdaq OMX Europe cannot be fulfilled on the platform, Citi will route a portion of the order to other venues if matches are available for the trades there instead.
699;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-08-31T18:43:04Z;The fast bowlers arrive;;"Sometime in the next few weeks, a large package will land on the desk of Dame Clara Furse, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange. Inside, she will find a cricket bat inscribed with the letters “BATS” and a greeting from a small technology company of that name based thousands of miles away in Kansas City.If she casts her mind back a couple of years, she will recognise the gesture. When the LSE was fighting off a hostile takeover bid from Nasdaq in 2006, the same company mailed her a baseball bat to show its respect for the way she was defending the LSE – the jewel in the City of London’s crown – against invaders.This time, the message from BATS will be rather different: it is throwing down the gauntlet to the LSE. In November BATS, founded barely five years ago, plans to compete head-on with the 207-year-old British exchange by offering trading in the top 100 UK stocks.Its arrival is the latest sign that a revolution in the way shares are traded is moving to Europe from the US. Exchanges have lost the monopoly that they long held over where a share can be traded, thanks to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, new rules enacted by the European Union (see below) that have liberalised share trading.That has prompted the creation of a slew of upstart share-trading platforms, often backed by the investment banks that are among the exchanges’ bigger providers of orders. Such platforms are part of the next generation of trading outfits – known as electronic communications networks – that sprang up in the US in the wake of regulations passed in 1997. These broke the monopoly of the New York Stock Exchange in trading shares listed on its “big board”.In Europe, the banks had long been irked by the pricing power that the exchanges enjoyed under their monopolies. They jumped at the chance that Mifid provided to set up alternative trading venues offering cheaper fees and faster trading.Chi-X, the first of Europe’s so-called multilateral trading facilities, has stunned observers by the speed with which it has captured market share in FTSE 100 shares, only 14 months since its launch. In July, it averaged a 13 per cent share. Turquoise, backed by nine of the world’s largest investment banks, is the second new entrant and this week continues live test trading before becoming fully operational this month across 13 European markets. Other MTFs are waiting in the wings: Equiduct, majority owned by Börse Berlin; Burgundy, a Nordic venture backed by banks in the region; and Nasdaq OMX Europe, backed by Nasdaq OMX, the transatlantic exchange operator.In response, Europe’s exchanges have been cutting fees. On Monday a new tariff structure comes into force at the LSE. Last week, Deutsche Börse unveiled its third round of fee cuts since 2005. In a significant shift, exchanges are also changing the way they charge fees to take account of the growth of “algorithmic” traders, a new breed of operator that tends to trade many orders at once, in rapid-fire fashion, using complex mathematical formulae to respond to minute shifts in data or economic news.Algorithmic traders are being sought by the MTFs because the platforms’ backers know such dealers will be among the biggest providers of trading liquidity in coming years. That is why the MTFs are concentrating on offering ultra-fast trading, with the time for a trade to be done taking a mere millisecond or two in some cases. The exchanges know they cannot afford to miss out on this source of liquidity and are also building “dark pools”, where large blocks of shares can be traded. The aim is to get closer to the pension and hedge funds that normally go through a bank’s brokerage arm to access a dark pool.In effect, the banks and their brokerage arms are becoming more “exchange-like” by setting up MTFs, while the exchanges are moving closer to the broking turf hitherto dominated by the investment banks. How this plays out will not only determine the future shape of Europe’s securities markets but will also dictate whether the exchanges – the LSE, Deutsche Börse, the Paris-based Euronext and Spain’s Bolsa – can survive in their present form.“The whole playing field is being reset,” says Jason Nabi, head of UK financial intermediaries at BNP Paribas, one of Turquoise’s investors. “There is about to be an almighty battle and it will take two years to resolve.” Adam Sussman, director of research at Tabb Group, a consultancy, says he believes the changes post-Mifid will “far exceed” what happened to the structure of markets in the US when alternative trading platforms emerged there. “What’s happening in Europe is not just competition between exchanges and MTFs but the integration of pan-European share trading,” he adds.The winners and losers are not yet evident. But the exchanges are putting a brave face on the challenge they face. Rainer Riess, managing director for cash market development at Deutsche Börse, says competition is “nothing new” for the German market. The group has long faced competition from six regional domestic stock exchange rivals. “It’s always helped us be an early adopter and keep us on our toes,” he says.Martin Graham, the LSE’s director of markets, says the competitive issue has been “oversimplified by some”. He goes on: “We have been living in a competitive environment for a long time at the LSE. Competition was inevitable and planned for. A lot of it was stimulated, ironically, by our success. We are completely confident in our ability to thrive in a competitive environment.”Indeed, the LSE has been on the offensive. It has been completing a £40m ($73m, €50m) upgrade of its TradElect electronic trading system to bring it much closer to the speeds offered by the nimbler MTFs. Crucially, the LSE’s new tariff schedule includes incentives for algorithmic traders. Mr Graham says this represents a “huge structural shift” in the way shares are traded. “This is going to lead to a very significant increase in our trading. It’s positioning us for the next 10 years.”In June, moreover, the exchange linked up with Lehman Brothers to create a dark pool – Baikal, named after the world’s deepest freshwater lake. That followed similar moves by Euronext and Switzerland’s SWX.The LSE has not only seen the value of shares traded hold up relatively well; it has also benefited as traders have arbitraged between Chi-X and the LSE. The LSE’s own shares were among the top performers in London last Friday after an HSBC analyst played down competitive concerns, saying Chi-X’s presence was “complementary” for the LSE.Mr Riess at Deutsche Börse says he is seeing the same trend. “When there is a strong day in a particular stock – for example on Chi-X – then we seem to have an extraordinary day in that stock as well. Up to now we’ve seen no detrimental effect.”Yet the fee cuts by exchanges are bound to have their limits, because of the exchanges’ larger cost bases. Chi-X operates with only 26 staff. A direct comparison of staffing levels with the LSE has to take account of the businesses the LSE is involved that go beyond the core share-trading operation – such as market data and company listings. But with a staff of 1,200, the LSE needs to become leaner, some analysts say.Richard Balarkas, chief executive of Instinet Europe, Chi-X’s majority shareholder, says of the LSE: “It is vulnerable to price competition because it is not a new start-up and it has legacy infrastructure costs that it’s hard to dispose of. Chi-X and Turquoise can rent cheap offices and get their platforms going with about 30 people.”In addition, many of the new platforms are starting out by offering share trading on a pan-European basis, while none of the exchanges has yet to do so. Niki Beattie, a consultant and until recently head of market structure at Merrill Lynch, says: “One of the incumbent exchanges has to be the first to move to a pan-European trading platform and the big question is: have they got the ability and the low operating costs to compete in that space?”The MTFs face their own hurdles. Conquering Europe is complicated by the region’s patchwork of clearing and settlement systems – which are in effect the infrastructure, or plumbing, that sits underneath trading systems and ensures deals are completed and cash and shares change hands. This infrastructure is organised along national lines and settlement of shares still can take place in each of the 23 central securities depositories. Clearing is done at six clearing houses. In the US, both are centralised in one place – at a vast quasi-utility called The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, meaning its capital markets are more cost-efficient than Europe’s.Brussels hopes that the region’s post-trade infrastructure will be streamlined by a code of conduct it brokered with the industry. Under this code, Europe’s clearers – many owned by exchanges – would connect with one another to offer clearing choice and help lower post-trade costs. But progress has been slow because of national regulatory barriers and a fear among some exchange-owned clearers that they stand to lose clearing revenue.Tabb Group argues that the success of the new MTFs is likely to be constrained by “the increase in operational complexity and costs associated with an unresolved cross-border clearing and settlement process”. Some observers are also concerned about the fragmentation of liquidity that seems inevitable as the number of trading venues proliferates.The difficulty for each MTF will be to show that it brings something different to the market. Turquoise stands out because it will be offering a dark pool component to its order book. Nasdaq OMX Europe will offer a routing service that directs traders’ orders to other platforms if portions of them cannot be matched on its own. Still, the LSE’s Mr Graham suggests the new platforms are “all scared of each other” at this point. “How are they going to show they are bringing something new to the market?”BATS is confident, as its cheeky cricket bat gambit seems to show. It highlights its technology as its advantage. Joe Ratterman, BATS chief executive, says Dame Clara and the LSE are “formidable competitors” for which he has “great respect”. But he is also determined to capture a sizeable chunk of business in FTSE 100 stocks, perhaps 15-20 per cent.That may seem ambitious but, given BATS’ record in the US – where it says more than 10 per cent of all US share trading is executed on its platform – it may not be unreasonable. Inroads by electronic communications networks and other competitors such as Nasdaq have eroded the NYSE’s share of trading in its listed stocks to about 42 per cent.Mr Ratterman says: “I would encourage anyone at the LSE to look at the NYSE’s market share chart. It’s a good historical lesson.”‘RELATIVE VALUE HAS SHIFTED QUICKLY’If there is anyone who has a feel for what it takes to challenge Europe’s mighty exchanges at their own game it is Peter Randall, chief executive of the only alternative share trading platform that is yet fully operational.Sitting in Chi-X’s offices in London’s St Katharine Docks, with moored yachts bobbing alongside the quay behind him, the usually effusive former analyst is modest in his assessment of how Chi-X has done since launch 14 months ago.“I was confident within 90 days from when we started, at the end of the second quarter of 2007, that we’d got something that has tangible legs. Even back then, I thought it was going to work. But I didn’t think it was going to work anything like as quickly,” he says. “I think we’d go from saying that we were cautious. Now we move to being modestly pleased with the success.”Chi-X was set up by Instinet Europe – a broker owned by Japan’s Nomura – together with 14 others, including BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Optiver, a Netherlands-based securities and derivatives firm. The idea was to take advantage of the European Union’s new Markets in Financial Instruments Directive trading rules and offer a way to deal in European shares that would – in the words of a Chi-X statement at launch – “completely bypass Europe’s existing exchanges” and the existing post-trade infrastructure.Its main proposition was and remains faster trading speeds than the incumbents and cheaper fees. Trading a share on Chi-X takes about 1.4 milliseconds, compared with the fastest speed on the London Stock Exchange of six milliseconds (although this will fall to three milliseconds next month).For a growing band of traders, speed is of the essence if it means securing the desired price for a share before anyone else. Chi-X also operates a fee structure that pays rebates to those that commit to posting offers on its platform – currently 0.3 basis points – and charges 0.2 basis points to those who accept those offers and trade. Chi-X pockets the difference. So for every €1m ($1.5m, £800,000) that goes through Chi-X, the platform collects €10.That may seem like slim pickings. But with only 26 staff, its cost base is tiny. The LSE’s fees are still, in aggregate, higher. Also, Chi-X has managed to attract large numbers of a newish breed of high-frequency trader not interested in holding on to shares for long.The value of trading on Chi-X, which offers shares in 11 European markets, was €73.5bn in July, in theory bringing Chi-X revenues of €735,000. Mr Randall points out that Borsa Italiana – for which the LSE paid €1.1bn last year – had €74.6bn in volume the same month. “I’m not saying that Chi-X has a high value,” he says with a mischievous smile, “but you see what I mean? Relative value has shifted very quickly.”But Chi-X no longer has the field to itself. Turquoise, a platform backed by nine investment banks, will on Friday make trading available in stocks on 13 European markets. Nasdaq OMX Europe is set for launch at the end of September, while BATS Trading, a platform with a formidable record in the US, arrives in November.Mr Randall says he believes growth in alternative venues will be limited because the more there are, the more brokers and traders need to consider the expense and complexity of connecting not only to multiple venues but also to the clearing and settlement systems that underpin the trading infrastructure.Equally, he does not see competing with the exchanges – especially the LSE – as a zero-sum game. “The pie is getting bigger but – critically – our share of the pie is getting bigger, too.” He will be hoping that this remains the case when the field becomes more crowded.THE MIFID MOMENTUMThe Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, a 2007 Brussels initiative, fired the starting gun on competition in share trading in Europe. Mifid required brokers to ensure they could demonstrate “best execution” in dealings for their clients – achieving the keenest price and using the most efficient, cost-effective clearing and settlement systems.Its effect was to end the so-called “concentration rules” that were in place across much of Europe. These required shares to be traded on a national exchange, to ensure what were viewed at the time as more orderly and transparent markets.Part of Brussels’ rationale for Mifid is to bring the cost of securities trading and clearing more into line with the US and make it easier for the financial services industry to develop private sector retirement plans."
700;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-08-25T20:56:46Z;Global turmoil dents Swedish sell-off plans;;Turmoil in global financial markets is threatening the Swedish government’s goal of raising SKr200bn ($32bn, €21bn, £17bn) by 2010 from the sale of its stakes in state-owned companies, Mats Odell, minister for financial markets, said on Monday.The centre-right government said when it was elected in 2006 that it would try to sell stakes in six state-owned companies by 2010 to reduce the role of the state in society.The privatisation programme is a cornerstone of the government’s policy, providing a break with Sweden’s recent political past, which has been dominated by the Social Democrats.But with the next general election due in 2010, Mr Odell, who is overseeing the privatisations, said selling companies that were ultimately owned by the Swedish people for less than they were worth amid depressed market conditions would be “political suicide”.He expressed confidence the government would reach its original goal of raising SKr200bn by 2010 from the sales, but admitted it might not be able to sell all of the companies by then as originally planned.He made clear that securing the highest possible price was more important than meeting a time limit, telling the Financial Times: “2010 is not a target . . . It is a budget technical assumption.”The government has so far sold Vin & Sprit, maker of Absolut vodka, for SKr55bn to Pernod Ricard, offloaded 8 per cent of TeliaSonera, the telecommunications company, to institutional investors for SKr18bn, and sold a 6 per cent stake in OMX, the stock market operator, for SKr2.2bn to Nasdaq and Borse Dubai.It retains a 37.3 per cent stake in TeliaSonera, a 19.9 per cent stake in Nordea, the Nordic region’s largest bank, and 100 per cent of SBAB, a mortgage lender.The SKr119bn raised so far has been used to reduce state debt and will help finance tax cuts and other reforms to the welfare system to be announced in September in the autumn budget. But the sales have proven unpopular with large parts of the electorate.Mr Odell said that in this environment, securing the highest possible price for the remaining companies was essential. “We are not going to have a clearance sale here,” he said.His comments follow a defence of the government’s stake in TeliaSonera, which received an unsolicited takeover offer from France Telecom this year.The government rejected the offer as too low and the French company eventually walked away from the transaction. “We don’t need the money,” Mr Odell said on Monday.
701;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-08-15T19:45:30Z;LSE trades blows with rivals;;If the London Stock Exchange needed a wake-up call to signal the scale of the competitive threat facing its dominance of UK equities market, it needed only to look at trading in its own shares on Friday.Some 19 per cent of trading in LSE shares was not carried out on the exchange itself but on Chi-X, one of a flurry of quirkily named rivals.Some investors fear that such a shift in market share may be only the start of things as the LSE faces its most serious challenge in its 207-year history.Its shares were marked down this week 14 per cent to 803p, extending their losses this year to 60 per cent. Even compared with hard-hit rivals in other countries, it has underperformed by 24 per cent this year.The fall has been partly driven by concerns over a downturn in trading volumes as the credit crunch has hit investor confidence. But it also reflects the uncertainty over the effect of the new trading “platforms”.“The great British public still very much regard the LSE in almost the same way in which they regard the Bank of England or the Treasury – as some utilitarian piece of the financial system that’s there for the greater good of all,” says Richard Balarkas, chief executive of broker Instinet Europe. “In fact, it has become one amongst many competitors in the provision of a share trading market.”Turquoise on Friday became the second platform to start offering trading after Chi-X launched 14 months ago. Both are tiny compared with the LSE in budget and staff numbers. But they have heavyweight backers in some big name investment banks and Chi-X has already made its competitive presence felt. At one point this week, Chi-X captured more than 20 per cent of all trading in FTSE 100 stocks.Both Chi-X and Turquoise emerged in the wake of rules enacted by Brussels last year that have broken the monopolies of Europe’s established exchanges.The rules, known as Mifid, require brokers to find “best execution” when a stock is being traded. The move was an invitation to set up new trading venues, spur competition and lower trading fees.Investment banks pounced. Turquoise and Chi-X are not only cheaper than the LSE but have ultra-fast trading systems that are suited to the high-volume trading strategies of many hedge funds and other institutional investors.For Dame Clara Furse, LSE chief executive, this is a distinctly unwelcome development. It comes not long after she basked in the glory of having seen off a wave of hostile takeover attempts, most recently from Nasdaq of the US.Some have questioned whether she has what it takes to switch from the defensive tactics she used to see off her early challengers, to tackling an entirely new, and arguably more serious, threat.But the exchange has been on the offensive.The LSE changed its fee structure this month, cutting prices and tilting its incentives towards the new breed of electronic traders that are flocking to the new platforms.These traders are often little more than complex computer programs run by investment banks, involving little human intervention. Such “algorithmic” trading thrives off tiny shifts in data or economic news, sending orders electronically to be matched in a matter of milliseconds.Martin Graham, director of markets at the LSE, says the exchange recognises that this type of trading is a “huge structural shift” that is going to “a very significant increase in our trading”. He dismisses the notion that the LSE has been slow.“We have been living in a competitive environment for a long time at the LSE. Competition was inevitable and planned for,” he says.The LSE has also unveiled plans for a “dark pool”, a kind of trading venue popular among large institutions. It offers anonymous trading of large blocks of shares, away from the exchange’s publicly visible order book. In a clever marketing twist, the LSE named the venture Baikal, after the world’s deepest freshwater lake.Finally, the LSE has been upgrading its TradElect electronic trading system, equipping it for faster trading times and much greater capacity.Many large users of the LSE are pleased there is choice in the market. Tony Whalley, investment director at Scottish Widows Investment Partnership, says the new entrants are “begetting more liquidity on other systems”.“It’s going to provide a varied approach to the way orders are handled. Before Mifid, everything had to go through the LSE. Now there is a spread of liquidity and that’s been to our advantage,” he says.So far, the LSE’s share price has yet to react favourably to its moves. Mr Whalley says: “The LSE has shown that they are prepared to react to the changes that are happening. Whether it is enough, or whether it’s a case of ‘too little too late’, I’m not sure.”
702;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-08-06T20:38:46Z;Gains in energy and materials lift Wall Street;;US stocks climbed modestly on Wednesday for a second straight session as energy and materials stocks made ground and investors cheered some decent results from technology bellwether Cisco.A small pull back in oil prices and a drop in gasoline inventories helped refiners to advance, taking energy stocks to a 1.9 per cent gain.Sunoco, Tesoro and Valero added 3.3 per cent to $43.28, 12 per cent to $17.39 and 7.3 per cent to $34.47 respectively.Materials stocks were the day’s second biggest gainers, climbing 1.6 per cent on some analyst upgrades and a bump in certain commodity prices.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold was the outstanding performer, adding 11 per cent to $87.67.Citigroup analyst John Hill advised clients to buy the shares, noting that they had dropped more than 35 per cent since mid-June while the company still had exposure to China, high margins and strong free cash flow.Technology was another positive. Cisco climbed 5.7 per cent to $23.93 after posting estimate-beating fourth quarter profits.Microsoft also received a boost after an analyst at UBS said the company could buy up to $20bn of stock back over the next three months. The shares rose 3.1 per cent to $27.02 while the broader sector added 1.3 per cent.The benchmark S&P 500 index shrugged off early losses to close 0.3 per cent higher at 1,289.07 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent at 11,656.07. The Nasdaq Composite ended the day 1.2 per cent ahead at 2,378.37.On Tuesday stocks rose the most in four months after oil prices dropped sharply and the Federal Reserve kept its benchmark interest rate at 2 per cent. An accompanying statement seemed to reduce the likelihood of rate rises, soothing investors concerns.In the telecoms sector, disappointing earnings news dragged the sector down 1.4 per cent on Wednesday.Sprint Nextel posted a $344m second quarter loss due to spending on discounts and advertising to win new customers. Sales fell 11 per cent to $9.06bn and the shares dived 14.2 per cent to $7.34. Qwest Communications International said profit dropped 24 per cent to $188m and cut its annual forecast. The results were in line with estimates but the shares slipped 6 per cent to $3.45.So far this earnings season more than 400 of the S&P 500 companies have reported results and on average, index members have seen an 18 per cent drop in profits.Financials have had another torrid quarter. Melissa Roberts, an analyst at KBW, said: “Results continued to be disappointing across capitalisation levels [revealing] continued asset quality deterioration, revenue growth offset by mounting expense growth, and reduced profitability.”KBW cut its earnings estimates for 2008 and 2009 by 14 per cent and 10 per cent respectively as a result.On Wednesday, there was mixed news from the embattled sector. Freddie Mac shares plunged 19.3 per cent to $6.49 after the mortgage finance company posted its fourth loss in a row and said it would cut its dividend.Fannie Mae, another government-sponsored entity, slumped 14.7 per cent to $11.60 on the news. Fannie reports results on Friday. Elsewhere in the financials sector the news was mixed but the sector was among the biggest losers of the morning session, dropping 0.7 per cent.Marsh & McLennan, said second-quarter profit fell 63 per cent to $65m owing to higher staff costs and certain writedowns at its corporate security division. The insurance broker still beat analysts’ estimates and the shares rose 2.5 per cent to $30.07. Nasdaq OMX Group jumped 16.9 per cent to $30.89 after the exchange operator posted results that beat analysts’ quarterly estimates.In the consumer staples sector, a drop in agricultural commodity prices helped offset a handful of disappointing results.Whole Foods, the grocer, tumbled 12.6 per cent to $20.04 after it posted annual earnings that undershot analyst’s estimates.Dean Foods dropped 5.7 per cent to $22.02 after the maker of dairy products forecast lower third-quarter profits than expected. As a whole, the consumer staples sector rose 1.1 per cent.Profit-taking and some poor results took their toll on the consumer-discretionary sector however. It lost 0.5 per cent led down by a 7.2 per cent fall to $22.45 for restaurant chain operator Wendy’s International.
703;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-08-06T17:38:05Z;Nasdaq earnings up 81% amid volatility;;Nasdaq OMX Group on Wednesday said second-quarter earnings rose 81 per cent as it took advantage of the heightened volatility in capital markets and the diversification benefits of the merger between Nasdaq and OMX, which closed in February.The exchange operator said net profit rose to $101.6m, or 48 cents per share up from from the $56.1m, or 39 cents a share earned in total by the two companies in the same period last year, before they merged.Profit excluding merger costs and benefits from foreign currency contracts rose to $101.8m, or 48 cents a share, from $77.2m, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier.The results beat Wall Street expectations and the company’s shares soared 13.4 per cent to $29.97.Robert Greifeld, chief executive, said the company expected to have integrated the operations of OMX in the first quarter of next year, nine months sooner than it originally estimated.“We are dramatically ahead of the aggressive plans we’ve established,” he said.Nasdaq OMX is also in the process of acquiring the Boston Stock Exchange.Mr Greifeld said the company’s position remained that it will not pursue “any major transactions” until it had first gained the benefits from the OMX and other deals already under way.David Easthope, senior analyst with Celent, a Boston-based financial research and consulting company, said: “Nasdaq OMX’s second quarter, while good, underscores that like other global exchanges, Nasdaq is facing a scenario where growth in core trading volumes is slowing and competition is increasing, while at the same time many of its best clients are in a weaker position than a year ago.“Also, like its biggest competitor NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq is swallowing major acquisitions in 2008, pushing the exchange further into cash equities and options, but also making cost synergies a higher priority compared to a year ago amid global economic weakness.”Nasdaq OMX has been on a push to diversify into new businesses outside of its traditional domestic market.In September, Nasdaq is due to launch its pan-European business, Nasdaq OMX Europe, amid a large scale restructuring of the European cash equities market landscape under the European Union’s Mifid regulations.The acquisitions of OMX and Philadelphia exchanges have also made derivatives a core offering at the Nasdaq, which has historically concentrated on equities.Nasdaq completed its buy-out of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, the third-largest options market in the US two weeks ago.Nasdaq plans to continue to run its existing options market alongside the newly acquired business.
704;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-07-13T22:11:38Z;Nasdaq claims to have trading edge;;Nasdaq OMX will on Monday claim that more stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange were traded on Nasdaq’s own platform than at the NYSE for the first time, fuelling rivalry between the world’s exchanges as their share prices sink.Nasdaq will say that on Friday it had a 25.7 per cent market share in NYSE-listed stocks compared with the NYSE on 25.56 per cent.The development is likely to be seen as a milestone in the erosion of the market share of the NYSE, which still operates a hybrid between electronic and floor trading. Nasdaq is all-electronic.The claim may not go unchallenged. On Friday, NYSE Euronext took the unusual step of issuing a statement rejecting a separate claim from Nasdaq saying it had “attracted more new listings in the second quarter . . . than any other US exchange”.NYSE Euronext said that in June alone it had attracted 42 new stock market listings – as many as Nasdaq in the entire second quarter. Nasdaq later said that it was only comparing Nasdaq with the NYSE, not including the European exchange businesses that are Euronext and OMX.Richard Adamonis, an NYSE representative, said: “[I] would also add that Nasdaq in its boilerplate language claims to have more listings than any other market place group. That’s wrong as well.”He said that, at the end of May, NYSE Euronext had 4,497 listed companies compared with Nasdaq OMX’s 4,422. After its purchase of the American Stock Exchange closes shortly, the NYSE group number would rise to more than 5,600 listed companies.Exchanges have just finished reporting volume figures as well as showing how many stock market listings they have attracted.However, with the share prices of the exchanges themselves having sunk this month into “bear market territory”, according to Mondo Viseone, a UK-based exchanges data provider, pressure is intense to top the listings league tables and demonstrate the most trading volume.
705;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-06-30T19:41:16Z;CME to leave NYSE for Nasdaq;;Shares in the CME Group, the world’s largest futures exchange, will next week cease trading on the New York Stock Exchange and list solely on the Nasdaq, the NYSE’s main rival for listings in the US.Analysts said the move was likely to sour relations between NYSE Euronext, the parent company of the NYSE, and the CME, the two largest US exchange groups. The NYSE is aiming to break into the futures business, which is dominated by the CME, and hopes to gain its licence to trade futures as soon as next month.The NYSE and Nasdaq compete fiercely to attract listings from one another with any win loudly trumpeted by both.The CME has been listed on the NYSE for almost six years and dually listed on the Nasdaq since 2005.It will cease listing on the NYSE on July 11 and commence trading on Nasdaq on July 14 under the symbol CME, the same ticker it has on NYSE.Bob Greifeld, chief executive of the Nasdaq OMX Group, parent company of the Nasdaq, said: “The CME Group has been an innovative exchange leader that understands trading efficiencies.”Magnus Bocker, president of Nasdaq OMX, pointed out that the CME and Nasdaq share a similar market philosophy, adding that the CME Group had been a Nasdaq corporate services customer over the past few years.Along with the sole listing, Nasdaq will extend the CME’s exclusive rights to offer futures and options on futures contracts based on Nasdaq indices, for an additional seven-year period, to 2019. The exchanges said in a statement that this arrangement further strengthens a long-standing partnership that began in 1996.A spokesman for NYSE Euronext said the enhanced commercial relationship between the CME and Nasdaq was “clearly influential” in the listing decision.“We are proud of the market quality and service that we have provided the CME and their shareholders,” he said.The Nasdaq has a Chicago-based office and has 59 listed companies based in Chicago, with a market capitalisation of about $59bn.The agreement with Nasdaq comes as CME is coping with having lost its licence to list futures contracts based on the Russell indices, which formerly accounted for about 10 per cent of its equity index trading volume.For the past three years, Russell licensed its indexes to multiple exchanges. Instead, the company has an exclusive agreement with InterContinental Exchange, the Atlanta-based company that last year battled the CME for control of the Chicago Board of Trade, to list futures on the Russell indexes. The transition is expected to begin over the summer.
706;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-06-25T17:51:13Z;Rush to co-location proves every microsecond counts;;In the race to provide the fastest trade execution times for algorithmic traders, systems are already so sophisticated that it takes less than a handful of milliseconds for a trade to be done.For Michael Spencer, chief executive of Icap, the interdealer broker, the development is astonishing.“To put this into context: when I started my career on the London Stock Exchange 30-odd years ago, average deal times were, from my recollection, about three minutes – and that was only if you had a pretty quick and athletic floor dealer.”Milliseconds are fast – the blink of a human eye takes 300 of them – but increasingly, it is not fast enough.This week, Nasdaq OMX will become the latest exchange in Europe to offer “co-location” – that is, allowing traders to physically locate the computer servers in exchange data centres, right next to – or metres from – the exchange’s matching engine itself.The move comes ahead of the launch in September of Nasdaq’s pan-European cash equities trading platform, designed to compete with incumbent exchanges and rival “multilateral trading facilities” (MTFs) such as Chi-X, Turquoise and BATS.Being physically close to an exchange’s matching engine may seem immaterial in an electronic world. But, incredibly, it helps shave microseconds off the time it takes for a trade to be executed. Nasdaq claims its speed will be 250 microseconds. BATS claims about 400 microseconds.Algorithmic traders rely on computers to generate trades in response to tiny shifts in data or news.In the race to secure the best price, they want to be first in the queue – and microseconds count. The London Stock Exchange will offer co-location in August. It believes that most players will be “sub-millisecond” by the end of the year.By then, speed will no longer be the only “competitive differentiator”.But Chris Concannon, Nasdaq OMX’s executive vice-president of transaction services, disagrees. “Speed will continue to matter even after everyone’s under one millisecond,” he says. “If you asked me three years ago ‘if everybody was sub-millisecond, would speed no longer matter?’ I would have said ‘correct’. Today, I have customers concerned about microseconds that spike up within milliseconds.”Co-location, already common in the US, is arriving in Europe now thanks to competitive forces unleashed by Mifid, the Brussels directive requiring “best execution” in equities trading.Richard Evans, global head of electronic execution at Citi, says the market is becoming cheaper to access for high frequency funds.“People are starting to see more short-term trading opportunities and that means you have to react more quickly to market data – so co-location becomes important.”This week, SWX, the Swiss exchange, said it would also offer co-location services in conjunction with Colt, a telecommunications company.Deutsche Börse has offered the service since mid-2006 for both its Xetra cash equities and Eurex derivatives customers and has more than 70 users.
707;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-06-24T21:35:27Z;NYSE Euronext beats LSE to Doha deal;;NYSE Euronext has taken a 25 per cent equity stake in Qatar’s stock market, stoking the three-way battle for regional financial supremacy in the petrodollar-fuelled Gulf region.The transatlantic stock market operator paid $250m for its interest in Doha Securities Market as part of a larger strategic alliance aimed at developing the tiny, natural-gas-rich state’s bourse into an internationally integrated cash and derivatives market with international links and , with regional growth ¬ambitions.The NYSE Euronext investment throws down the gauntlet to neighbouring Dubai, which has led the way in forging alliances with international exchanges.NYSE Euronext submitted the most attractive offer in a competitive tender for the Doha deal, fending off competition from Deutsche Börse and the London Stock Exchange, in which the Qatar Investment Authority, the emirate’s sovereign wealth fund, holds a 15 per cent interest. Borse Dubaialso holds a 20 per cent interest in the LSE.“At this point, it looks like the LSE has missed the region, which has now clearly become a battleground for the American and Europeans,” a Dubai official told the Financial Times.John El-Khair, an adviser to the prime minister of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabr Al-Thani, said the deal with NYSE Euronext came after “extensive discussions” with a number of exchanges.The QIA had picked the combined group in part because it would help provide a range of products across multiple asset classes – including derivatives and commodities. Both are areas in which the LSE is either relatively weak or has no business.But Mr El Khair said the decision in no way affected the QIA’s view of the LSE as a long term investment. “As a long-term investor the QIA is not driven by short-term price fluctuations or changes in market capitalisation, “ he said, referring to recent steep falls in the LSE’s share price. “We remain supportive [of the LSE], it is clearly a global brand name and has significant long term value”.Shares in the LSE dropped 4 per cent to 834½p in reaction to the after NYSE Euronext’s move.The deal with NYSE Euronext is part of Qatar’s master-plan for revamping its financial architecture as it aims to raise the standards of its stock market and banking system in anticipation of windfall from gas exports that will double government revenues in the coming years.Qatar is also unifying its regulatory structure under a single regulator based on international standards.QIA will hold the remaining 75 per cent stake in DSM on behalf of the Qatar government, which on Tuesday said the deal would lead to knowledge and technical transfer into this fast-growing corner of the Gulf.NYSE Euronext will operate and offer technical support to the new DSM and hold three of the DSM board’s 11 seats.“This partnership lays the foundations for us to build Doha into a world-class financial centre,” said Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani, Qatar’s prime minister and head of the QIA.“Our country’s financial markets will be an integral part of a group which links together the world’s major trading centres across the US and Europe and now the Middle East.”Qatar will sell a stake in the new exchange in a domestic initial public offering within the next three years to allow its citizens to benefit from the new partnership.The Qatar alliance appears to be a blow to Abu Dhabi Securities Market, or ADX, which in March also signed an technical partnership arrangement with NYSE Euronext as the capital of the United Arab Emirates moves towards building its own derivatives exchange.However, Abu Dhabi said the NYSE Euronext-Doha tie-up would have no impact on its own deal.Dubai was engaged in a takeover battle with Nasdaq over Scandinavian exchanges group OMX, but switched tack and reached a deal with the US exchange that gave Nasdaq one-third of Dubai’s International Financial Exchange, while Dubai took a 20 per cent stake in the combined Nasdaq-OMX group, with another 10 per cent held in trust for regulatory reasons.International interest in the region’s underdeveloped bourses has soared as the oil-fuelled region’s dramatic growth seems sheltered from global economic turmoil.Institutional investors are keen to invest in these exchanges, which are revamping their regulations and products.MSCI is considering placing Doha, Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Kuwait exchanges in its emerging markets index next summer, which would rapidly increase international volumes on these bourses.
708;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-06-24T18:05:37Z;Dame Clara must move swiftly to square up to rivals;;"NYSE Euronext’s acquisition of a quarter of the Doha Securities Market has sent a chill round Paternoster Square, where the London Stock Exchange has its headquarters. The LSE might plausibly have thought of itself as the natural commercial partner for Qatar’s principal stock market.After all, in the Great Stock Exchange Share Reshuffle of September 2007, the Qatar Investment Authority, the Gulf state’s sovereign fund, ended up with a 15 per cent holding in the LSE. The London exchange – whose independence was thus secured – boasted about the QIA and LSE’s “longstanding relationship based on plans to develop the Qatar marketplace”.The Qataris remain committed to their strategic holding in the LSE, but with London’s principal US rival standing behind the Doha marketplace’s biggest stall, the commercial part of the relationship is dead.Comparing the Doha deal with Nasdaq’s purchase of a stake in Borse Dubai last year, Citigroup reckons the NYSE’s $250m price for the 25 per cent stake is a good one, reflecting New York’s simultaneous offer of technological and product expertise to Qatar. It is not, however, the London exchange’s style to take stakes in its partners. Such stakes don’t always guarantee commercial benefits and, if they do, those benefits often come with awkward conditions attached.So Dame Clara Furse, the LSE’s chief executive, has demonstrated again her purity and consistency. But we are a long way from the excitement that greeted the reshuffling of stakes last September, and pushed the LSE’s shares up nearly 25 per cent in two days. Bearish sentiment has swept London’s shares down from their peaks in the past five or six months. It’s all well and good if failure to secure a deal in Doha has left Dame Clara free to complete commercial agreements elsewhere on more acceptable terms. But she will have to produce them swiftly if she is to avoid leaving the impression that bigger rivals – NYSE Euronext and Nasdaq specifically – are stealing a march on her in fast-growing markets.Virgin boundBarring any late change of heart, SK Telecom of South Korea will shortly announce that its US mobile business is to be rolled in to Virgin Mobile USA.When the South Korean group launched Helio, then a joint venture, two years ago the breathless talk was of 3m upscale subscribers by 2009 lured by exclusive content and feature-laden phones.Having splashed out hundreds of millions of dollars to kick-start Helio, SK Telecom has learned to its cost that Americans care little for the sophistication of sleek Korean-style handsets.With just 200,000 subscribers, carrying on solo was always a tough ask given the economies of scale required in the fast maturing market. Note: Verizon Wireless this month announced the takeover of Alltel, which will give it 80m mobile subscribers, eclipsing AT&T’s 71m.SK Telecom does not want to retreat from the US as a failure and the deal with Virgin Mobile USA allows it to stay in the game, allied to Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin group. SK Telecom gets a near 20 per cent stake in the enlarged company and can piggy back off the more well-regarded Virgin brand. That means less marketing spend to project its range of phones.Virgin Mobile USA, which rents wireless capacity on Sprint Nextel’s mobile network, like Helio, will also inevitably look to secure a cheaper deal – which will also benefit its newly-captured subscribers.No foreigners pleaseLloyds TSB is the latest foreign bank to be mentioned in connection with Germany’s round of consolidation talk, joining the likes of Santander and Crédit Mutuel. So, is another foreign bank soon to join Unicredit, which bought HVB three years ago, in taking the plunge into Europe’s biggest and most competitive banking market?Not if Germany can help it, seems to be the answer. It is not only some politicians who want to make sure assets such as Dresdner Bank and Deutsche Postbank are used to create a bigger domestic player.Manfred Weber, who runs Germany’s private-sector banking association, has warned the government not to interfere and said in an interview this week that foreign bidders should have equal treatment. But he also made clear that the construction of bigger “national champions”, no doubt involving Commerzbank or Deutsche Bank, would be the best outcome for Germany.This smacks of Deutschland AG trying to get its own way – but it is also the most likely outcome. A domestic buyer would generate more synergies from a takeover of Dresdner or Postbank; foreign banks are less likely to overpay, knowing they would face tough competition."
709;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-06-23T16:44:41Z;Time for UK to show US it has the Balls clause;;Imagine for a moment that Nasdaq had bought the London Stock Exchange in 2006. Now imagine that US senators start to fret about “speculators” using the LSE to manipulate share prices to the detriment of American interests. They apply pressure both to Nasdaq’s bosses and to the US regulator that oversees them. They want rule changes. Reluctantly, the LSE tightens its trading regulations, but it isn’t enough: the politicians start to threaten legislation to close the “loophole”. What happens next?The answer seems pretty clear. City of London grandees and British politicians would kick up an enormous fuss about the extra-territorial use of American laws. Britain’s Financial Services Authority would be urged to use the the UK legislation drawn up by Ed Balls, then a Treasury minister, during the LSE takeover bid to prevent the imposition of excessive regulation on a recognised UK investment exchange.This is, more or less, what is happening at ICE Futures Europe, the London energy exchange, whose US parent, the InterContinental Exchange, last week agreed position limits for speculative traders of crude oil futures contracts accused of pushing up oil prices. The difference is that, as yet, there is no real fuss in the UK.The City of London Corporation’s head of policy has warned of “American imperialism” and a former chief executive of the International Petroleum Exchange (which became ICE Futures Europe) hinted in a letter to the Financial Times this week that the Balls Clause should be brought into play. But the FSA and ministers have stayed silent, letting Jeff Sprecher, ICE’s boss, take the heat.In part this is understandable. Good relations between the Commodities Futures Trading Commission of the US and the FSA should lead to improvements in exchanges of information about energy trading.But this dispute is escalating. While use of the Balls Clause would be a nuclear option, it is time for the FSA and the UK government to remind the US Senate that they know the launch code.‘Mini mac’ unappetising
710;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-06-09T07:08:39Z;CBOE announces deal with Korea Exchange;;The Chicago Board Options Exchange, the largest options exchange in the US, will on Monday strengthen its presence in Asia by signing an agreement with the Korea Exchange that sets a foundation for the joint development of listed options contracts.The agreement comes as the CBOE is expected to move towards an initial public offering following a $1bn deal last week to settle a long-running legal dispute with members of the Chicago Board of Trade, which had delayed its move to demutualise. The CBOE is one of the world’s last big member-owned exchanges.In the fast-consolidating global exchange sector, the CBOE is likely to be an enticing takeover target for a larger exchange, such as NYSE Euronext or Nasdaq OMX. International tie-ups such as the Korea Exchange deal make it an even more attractive proposition.The Korea Exchange, created in 2005 from the merger of the country’s three stock and futures markets, is the world’s second-largest derivatives exchange after the Chicago-based CME Group. Its listed options and futures on the Kospi 200 index are the world’s most actively traded derivatives contracts.Last year the CME Group signed a deal with the Korea Exchange to list the Kospi 200 futures contract on its electronic trading platform. While the listing was originally proposed to be rolled out this year, it may be delayed following a change in top management at the Korea Exchange in March.Bill Brodsky, CBOE chairman and chief executive, suggested that, with the legal wrangle with the CBOT behind it, the CBOE – the world’s fifth-largest derivatives exchange by volume – could now focus on positioning itself in the global derivatives industry.“The financial marketplace is increasingly becoming more global,” Mr Brodsky said. “Opportunities such as this to create cross-continent relationships are essential to growing our business.”Jung-hwan Lee, the Korea Exchange chairman and chief executive, praised the CBOE’s “considerable expertise and experiences in operating the derivatives markets”.Richard DuFour, CBOE executive vice-president, said the agreement could result in the development of new products within a year. He said: “We could trade something based on the Korean economy, they might trade something based on the US economy – there’s all kind of ways you can work together.”About 15-20 per cent of CBOE’s order flow comes from outside the US, mostly from Europe, with much smaller volumes from Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia.
711;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
712;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-06-06T19:50:36Z;LSE lifts head’s pay to near industry parity;;Clara Furse, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, has been given a 16 per cent rise in her total pay package after concern that her salary had “fallen so far below” the median for her industry.The disclosure, in the LSE’s annual report published on Friday, came as shares in the LSE and some of its global rivals fell to fresh lows this year.Ms Furse will be paid a base salary of £540,000 this year, up from £529,000, and was awarded a bonus of more than £1m – equivalent to 215 per cent of salary.However, her salary remains below that of her deputy, Massimo Capuano, who earns €750,000 (£596,250).Ms Furse presided over a 29 per cent rise in adjusted earnings per share in the year to end-March. In the past year, the LSE attracted 84 stock market listings from 25 countries, more than the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Deutsche Börse combined.The LSE also completed its acquisition of Borsa Italiana.The LSE’s remuneration committee said it was “concerned . . . that the chief executive’s salary had fallen so far behind” an 80 per cent median for the industry that it uses as a benchmark that “it was appropriate to adjust her salary in a single move rather than phase the increases”.Ms Furse told analysts last month that the LSE’s performance continued to be “significantly better” than its big rivals – the CME Group, the Chicago-based futures exchange, Deutsche Börse’s Eurex derivatives arm and Liffe, the derivatives unit of NYSE Euronext.Reto Francioni, Deutsche Börse chief executive, received a salary of €2.4m in 2007, with other benefits taking total compensation to €3.2m.Duncan Niederauer, chief executive of NYSE Euronext, is paid a salary of $548,077, with a bonus of $2m.CME Group paid Craig Donohue, its chief executive, $850,000, although other incentive-related compensation took his total package to $3.5m.The LSE on Friday said May equity trading volume was up 13 per cent year on year. However, analysts at Citi sounded a note of caution over the sector, pointing out that cash equities trading at Deutsche Börse fell by 27 per cent in May, compared with a year ago.The Börse’s shares are down 32 per cent so far this year, closing at €85.32 yesterday. CME Group, which relies on the derivatives business, has seen its shares fall by almost 42 per cent this year. The LSE’s shares are down almost 54 per cent.
713;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-06-05T22:31:27Z;Price could be bigger hurdle than nationalism;;"The governments of Sweden and Finland could barely contain their desire for a bid battle for TeliaSonera to begin. Mats Odell, Sweden’s minister for financial markets, actively encouraged more offers while a hopeful Jyri Hakamies, Finnish minister for state-owned companies, said “we may expect new offers in future”.But in spite of their eager anticipation, the proposed sale of TeliaSonera is rife with complications that present any potential bidder sitting on the sidelines with a formidable range of political obstacles to ponder before making a move.The planned deal involves the sale to an overseas buyer of a strategic telecoms company controlled by two national governments. (Stockholm holds 37 per cent of the company and Helsinki 14 per cent.) This is a volatile mix that has raised warning flags in the past.Security concerns have already emerged in Sweden, whose armed forces have expressed worries a sale to a foreign buyer could threaten national security.The armed forces, which use TeliaSonera’s network, will file a report to the
government on June 13 that will suggest investigating any buyer or breaking up TeliaSonera so military infrastructure does not form part of the sale.Even though security concerns have been used as a way to mask protectionism in the past, there are no indications this is the case with TeliaSonera.The Swedish government has a track record of welcoming foreign owners and has offloaded its stake in OMX, the stock market operator, to Nasdaq and Borse Dubai, and sold Vin & Sprit, the maker of Absolut vodka, to Pernod Ricard.Yet nationalism regularly plays a role in any takeovers involving French companies. Paris owns 27 per cent of France Telecom (a deal with TeliaSonera would see its stake in a combined group fall to 20 per cent) and the government on Thursday said it was supportive of the indicative offer, describing it as a “good European industrial project”.Yet with nationalism off the agenda in Sweden, equally vexing domestic political complications could still emerge. In 2000, the government sold shares in TeliaSonera to the public in an initial public offering at SKr85 each, and about 1m Swedes out of a total population of 9m participated.The shares crashed not long after when the tech bubble burst, prompting criticism that the government had cashed in. The current government will be under pressure to ensure it gets the best possible price. If it is seen to be selling too cheaply, it could undermine its popularity in the run-up to a general election in 2010.Bidders should be aware the Swedish government is prepared to walk away from a low bid, well-placed bankers warned on Thursday."
714;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-06-03T15:27:16Z;ICE in $625m deal to buy Creditex;;The competition between financial institutions to position themselves in the $62,200bn credit-default swap market grew more intense on Tuesday when InterContinental Exchange, which operates energy derivatives markets in the US and UK, announced a $625m deal to buy Creditex, an inter-dealer credit derivatives broker.Credit derivatives, which allow investors to make bets on the creditworthiness of baskets of corporate debt, have seen explosive growth in recent years. The notional value of CDSs – most of which are privately negotiated bilateral contracts – grew by 81 per cent last year. That has prompted fierce competition between traditional exchanges, dealers and inter-dealer brokers to establish themselves in the sector.ICE’s move came days after 11 of the world’s biggest investment banks announced plans to create the first central clearer for credit derivative contracts by September. The CME Group, the world’s biggest futures exchange, which is also trying to build its presence in the CDS market, acquired a pricing information service for CDS contracts in March.In part, these initiatives come in response to pressure from regulators, who are stepping up pressure on the industry to reduce the systemic risk in a sector that fuelled the global credit crunch.The Financial Stability Forum and the New York Federal Reserve are among those organisations demanding improvements in clearing and reduced counterparty risk in the CDS market. ICE, which operates clearing houses in the US and Canada, and recently established a clearing house in London to compete with LCH.Clearnet, sees itself as well positioned to meet these concerns.“I think everybody would suggest there are structural problems in the CDS space that are inhibiting its growth,” Jeffrey Sprecher, ICE chief executive, told the FT. “People that can solve those structural problems can release a lot of growth potential and help with the balance-sheet issues within the dealers.”Mr Sprecher has identified strategic acquisitions as a way to enable ICE hold its own as the fast-consolidating world of global exchanges, which is moving towards the creation of “super exchanges” such as Nasdaq OMX, NYSE Euronext and the CME Group, which is trying to complete its acquisition of Nymex, ICE’s closest rival in energy derivatives trading.Mr Sprecher surprised the exchange world last year when he entered a bidding war with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to take over the Chicago Board of Trade. Although he lost out on that occasion, the ICE chief has completed a string of acquisitions, including the former New York Board of Trade and Yellowjacket, an electronic platform for over-the-counter trading that is dominant in weather contracts.ICE already clears over-the-counter contracts in energy products such as natural gas and electricity. Such deals accounted for 39 per cent or $80m of revenues in the first quarter of this year. ICE said on Tuesday it intends to use Creditex’s OTC trading model to expand into inter-dealer OTC markets beyond credit derivatives.
715;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-06-02T22:25:47Z;Chicago exchanges strike $1bn settlement;;The Chicago Board Options Exchange, the US’s biggest options exchange, took a big step towards an initial public offering on Monday by striking a $1bn settlement to end a long-running legal dispute with members of the Chicago Board of Trade.The CBOE was created by the CBOT in 1973, a legacy that left many CBOT members holding trading rights in the CBOE. Those members who have maintained their trading rights argued they were entitled to a share of the CBOE when it demutualises.However, the CBOT was taken over last year by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a development that the CBOE argued eliminated the CBOT members’ eligibility to the exercise rights. The issue has been before a Delaware court since 2006.The move will allow Bill Brodsky, the CBOE’s chairman and chief executive, to fulfil his longstanding ambition of transforming one of the world’s last remaining big members-only exchanges. The CBOE declared itself a “for-profit” organisation in 2006, but a proposed demutualisation – the next step towards an IPO – has been on hold pending the court case.Under the terms of the deal, the CBOT members will receive an 18 per cent stake in the CBOE and a cash payment of $300m. Given that the CBOE is valued at about $4bn, the settlement is worth more than $1bn.“Attempting to reach agreement on this contentious issue has been difficult,” the CBOE said in a statement. The exchange said it had opted to avoid “a protracted legal battle [that] could significantly impede CBOE’s strategic options in a rapidly changing environment”.While the case could have dragged on for up to three years, the CBOE said, the settlement should be finalised within six-12 months.The statement hinted that as well as demutualising, the CBOE would also seek to be bought by a big global exchange group. “Many of our competitors are now partnered with larger, well-funded entities,” it noted. “In this environment, we believe that ongoing litigation would exact an unquantifiable cost to CBOE and its seat owners.”Brendan Caldwell, chief executive of Caldwell Investment Management, one of the biggest CBOE members with 45 seats, told the FT he favours an IPO followed by a takeover by a larger exchange such as NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX or the LSE.CBOE members will vote on the settlement on June 11. Mr Caldwell said that although some CBOE members felt the CBOT claimants deserved nothing, he expected little opposition to the settlement.The CBOT members’ decision to settle may have been influenced by the decline in the share price of their parent company. The CME’s shares have dropped from $710 in late December to $412.10 by Monday’s close of trading.
716;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-05-28T21:30:52Z;Incumbent exchanges in trouble;;"When surfing for pet insurance or a plasma TV, most shoppers don’t care which website they use as long as it is cheap, fast and reliable. The same principle now underpins equity trading. Deregulation and technology are finally transforming the industry.In the US 11 years ago, after a price-fixing scandal, the Securities and Exchange Commission required brokerages to display customer orders publicly so they could be matched elsewhere if better prices existed. That led to a proliferation of cheaper, faster trading platforms that have gradually eaten away at the incumbent exchanges’ market shares. Today, fewer than half the trades in NYSE-listed stocks actually happen on NYSE. A similar process has begun in Europe; European Union rules now require best execution and are agnostic about where it takes place.Can the incumbents stop the rot? The London Stock Exchange, Deutsche Börse and Euronext (owned by NYSE) have upgraded technology and services but the slippage has started. Chi-X, which launched in Europe just over a year ago, claimed a 3 per cent share in the EuroStoxx 600 index in April, Reuters estimates.Incumbents can try to buy their way out of trouble. NYSE and Nasdaq OMX both bought the two strongest upstarts, which themselves had bought some smaller rivals. But that has not stifled competition: witness the rise of Kansas-based BATS. It pioneered inverted pricing, where for some stocks the rebate for posting orders exceeds the fee for taking them. BATS, which should launch in Europe this year, now has about an
8 per cent share in Nasdaq stocks.Unlike the US, Europe lacks a unified clearing and settlement infrastructure linking all trading venues. But that will just slow the pace of migration, not stop it. Neither does Europe force exchanges and platforms to re-route orders to rivals that display better prices, as in the US. Fortunately, brokers and new exchanges are building the systems to do that anyway. Over the years Europe’s incumbent exchanges have seen off plenty of new entrants. This time round the threat looks much more serious.Post and read comments on this LexLex is the FT’s agenda-setting column, giving an authoritative view on corporate and financial matters.

717;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-05-18T19:10:28Z;Nasdaq OMX chooses Fortis unit;;Nasdaq OMX is expected on Monday to announce it has chosen a unit of Fortis, the Belgo-Dutch financial services group, to clear trades done on the exchange’s new pan-European trading system set for launch in September.The development is another sign of how upstart trading platforms are gearing up to challenge Europe’s established cash equities exchanges in the wake of Mifid, a Brussels directive aimed at reducing stock trading and clearing costs.A key element in the success of such ventures is likely to be their choice of clearer, since clearing and settlement costs in Europe are much higher relative to trading costs.Fortis has been among the main beneficiaries of the emergence of new trading platforms – also known as multilateral trading facilities. It already clears for Chi-X, an MTF launched a year ago and backed by large investment banks.Chris Concannon, Nasdaq OMX’s executive vice president of transaction services, said the choice of Fortis’s European multilateral clearing facility was partly because it was already “operational across Europe”.“Competitive clearing is going to be the number one factor that drives [the cash equities] business in Europe, so as we’ve approached this project we’ve always looked at the clearing part as the most important element of it,” he said.Nasdaq plans to offer trading in 300 blue-chip stocks across 14 markets as the operator tries to build on its relatively small European presence in Nordic equities, acquired through OMX.
718;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-05-14T21:56:35Z;Crosswell leads Nasdaq OMX’s European push;;Nasdaq OMX has rehired Charlotte Crosswell, the former head of its international listings business, as president of the Nasdaq OMX pan-European market, a platform being launched this year to link multiple trading pools across Europe.Ms Crosswell, who led Nasdaq International from 2004 until last summer, when she left to join the Pension Corporation, will be based in London and take responsibility for the operations and strategic development of the pan-European market.Linking numerous pools of liquidity is likely to be one of the key factors contributing to the success of exchanges in the future, with traders increasingly keen on a one-stop shop for all of their trading needs in order to save costs.The pan-European exchange also seeks to capitalise on the liberalisation of share trading across Europe since new rules on share trading, known as Mifid, took effect in November.The rules require brokers to secure the “best execution” for their clients, levelling the playing field across the European Union by ensuring investors have access to all markets at the same transparent price, regardless of location.The Nasdaq OMX Pan-European Market is scheduled for launch in September, pending approval from the Financial Services Authority, and is targeted at high-volume market participants such as hedge funds using algorithmic trading.Nasdaq OMX said the system would offer share trading in the constituents of all leading European indices, including equities listed in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK.Ms Crosswell will report to Chris Concannon, the New York-based executive vice-president for transaction services at Nasdaq OMX.“Charlotte has an in-depth knowledge of the European and global exchange business and this, in combination with her sales, marketing and investment industry expertise, make her an ideal leader to develop and take our new platform forward,” said Mr Concannon.At Pension Corporation, the London-based pension management company, Ms Crosswell was responsible for the business strategy, as well as developing relationships with customers, the actuarial community and the media.Before she joined Pension Corporation, Ms Crosswell was head of international listings for the Nasdaq stock market.Ms Crosswell has also previously held management positions at the London Stock Exchange, including head of international business development.
719;NDAQ;Nasdaq Inc;2008-03-11T16:07:19Z;View from the Top transcript: Bob Greifeld;;A transcript of the FT’s interview with Bob Greifeld of Nasdaq. He speaks to US managing director Chrystia Freeland about OMX, the LSE and sovereign wealth funds.Financial Times: Thanks for joining us, Mr Greifeld.Bob Greifeld: Good morning.FT: Walking into your building here there is a sign that boasts about the fact that you are the world’s biggest exchange.BG: Right.FT: On what do you base that claim? There are some other groups that might say that they qualify for that title.BG: Well we have a number of ways to make the claim. One is we are the only true global exchange. We have operations now on six continents. Two is we have the largest number of listings for any of the developed market exchanges. Three is we process more trades than any other exchange on the planet on a daily basis. So, three fundamental reasons why we are the largest and also the best.FT: In this period of consolidation in the exchange space, is your relatively small market capitalisation a problem?BG: No. Well first off, our market capitalisation has grown obviously as we have completed the OMX transaction and I think as we deliver upon the synergies that we’ve promised with the OMX transaction we expect to enjoy an increase in the market cap. So as we compete for listings, for trading volume, for market data products in our respective markets the market capitalisation doesn’t play in any issue at all. It’s really the strength and the quality of the products that we bring to market and…FT: Sure, but if you wanted to acquire more?BG: …and we have not had an issue with respect to our acquisition strategy. We certainly have a large palette in front of us. We’ve just completed the OMX transaction, we expect to close on the Philadelphia transaction in late April, possibly early May. The Boston Stock Exchange around the same time and the Nord Pool acquisition will close probably in the June time frame. In addition we’ll close on Agora-X probably next month. So that’s a large acquisition pipeline for any organisation. We’re now focused on integrating those operations into NASDAQ OMX and making sure we deliver to our customers and to our shareholders exactly what we promised.FT: What is OMX going to give you?BG: OMX certainly gives us a global footprint. It takes us from a US-centric exchange to one that’s globally focused. What’s unique about OMX…FT: Scandinavia gives you that?BG: Well, what’s unique about OMX is their market technology business is truly the worldwide standard. They have over 60 exchanges that utilise their technology and understand when you are the technology provider to an exchange you’re really providing the beating heart, the essence of the exchange.FT: How essential was your Dubai relationship to closing the OMX deal?BG: I think it was very essential. We see great opportunities. We like others love the potential in the Middle East and the developing world. We have a basic belief that their organic growth rate will be fundamentally higher than ours or in Europe in the years to come. We see there is an increasing pool of investmental assets which will want to come to capital markets operations such as NASDAQ Dubai’s and we see great opportunity there.FT: Do you see a merger as a possibility?BG: Well, we’ll own a third of the DIFX and we see that as kind of our equity interest today and we see that as a very productive relationship.FT: And how much influence will Dubai have on NASDAQ here in New York?BG: Well, they’ll be our single largest shareholder, owning 19.9 per cent. They will have two seats on the board. They will be restricted to 5 per cent voting rights and that’s not a Dubai rule. It’s really the rule the SEC has put upon any large shareholders, so we have a number of other shareholders who fall within the parameters of that rule and I think what’s important to recognise with Dubai and I think Dubai in particular is they have a very disciplined approach to the investments they make and the acquisitions they make, and as we discussed and got to know each other it was kind of interesting to see that they were essentially compensated in a manner very similar to how we are compensated here as a public company in the US markets. So there is certainly concern about the return to shareholders which is what drives our daily activity. So we see a very alignment of interest in terms of what we want to accomplish here at Nasdaq OMX.FT: We’ve seen Middle-Eastern investors’ sovereign wealth funds bailing out a lot of Wall Street banks over the past few months and there have been some concerns about the possible political influence that could follow.BG: Yeah.FT: Should we be concerned about that and should we be concerned about that with you?BG: No but I think it’s interesting to note that we voluntarily submitted the transaction to what’s known as the CFIUS review process which is the US government’s review. There’s 13 governmental agencies that then have the opportunity to opine upon the merits of those transactions and does it elevate any national security concerns. So we voluntarily went through that process, we passed that process and the CFIUS panel said fine to go ahead with the transaction. So I think our transaction is properly conceived. Right. It’s an important…FT: And why did you do that? Was that to sort of bullet-proof yourself against allegations of unfair foreign involvement?BG: I think part of that’s true but just really to make sure that we as Nasdaq were in proper standing with all aspects of the US government and it was the right thing for us to do. Now we also felt comfortable and confident that we would have a positive outcome because the structure of the deal I think showed wisdom in that the 5 per cent voting limitation really is a material I think safeguard to see that the collective will of the board will be looking out for all investors.FT: How meaningful is that 5 per cent limitation or similar ones that other companies have though when you have a single largest shareholder. Don’t you as the CEO have to listen quite carefully to what that shareholder says?BG: Well, we certainly do. I mean we have had the good fortune to have a number of large – single large shareholders in Nasdaq and I have always worked with them and sought their advice and counsel.FT: At a time of mounting protectionist sentiment in the United States do you worry that some time in the future this relationship with Dubai could cause political problems for you?BG: No. No, because we have a standstill agreement for the 19.9 per cent, subject to the 5 per cent voting limitation. So we have this agreement I think very well conceived, very well thought out and I think very well executed.FT: And do you think it could be a pipeline for business from this growing Middle-Eastern region for you?BG: Definitely. I mean one is we’re going to work very hard to have DIFX become a financial center for that part of the world. I mean we have a third interest in it and as I said we’ll bring our brand, our expertise, our technology to there.FT: There are some local competitors though. Why are you betting on Dubai?BG: Well, I think Dubai has the rest in regulation modeled more so on the UK FSA. They will be very attractive to issuers to come to so they know and they’ll be comfortable with a regulatory regime, and when you look at the climate, the infrastructure in Dubai, it’s far advanced as compared to any in the region in that you have the vast majority if not all of the major – global investment banks have strong office representation there, you have the legal community in place, so it’s the proper breeding ground for ultimate success and I think our involvement will help accelerate that progress.FT: Why didn’t the LSE deal work?BG: Well we have a strong discipline with respect to the acquisitions that we do and we said that we have to provide returns to our shareholders where the deal accretes within 12 months. For a larger deal such as LSE or OMX we’ll extend that out and it could go 18 months but not much longer than that because we’re not very good at predicting the future that far out. So the transaction was there.FT: That’s unusually modest.BG: Yes, maybe, but it’s also true. So the transaction was there for us to conclude. The shareholder register was hedge fund heavy. It was basically all hedge fund and they did not have any long-term holding desires with the LSC but we said it’s just not at a price point that we can provide a return to our shareholders. We also knew fundamentally that there would be change in the European market as Mifid rolled out and when you look at the price that’s charged for a transaction in the market in Europe, not just with LSE but in Europe, it’s dramatically higher than what we see here in the States. So we believe that over time those prices, those effective capture rates per transaction will harmonise because we do have certainly something coming towards a global market, and that made the model very hard to work. So we were very I think happy with the outcome whereas we sold our LSE stake. Our NASDAQ shareholders enjoyed a $430m profit, so that was obviously outstanding.FT: And that stake is now in sort of friendly hands, so maybe you could come back for another run?BG: We have a lot of work in front of us. We have turned the page. We are focused on…FT: It’s turned back again.BG: We’re not intending to. I mean we have turned the page. I mean we have clearly the OMX transaction to make that work. We have committed to our investors, to our customers to deliver and we will meet those commitments.FT: Did the LSE management make a mistake? How long can they survive as a stand-alone entity? Particularly as we see these now international US groups moving into Europe?BG: Well it’s something that I don’t focus on. We have a tremendous…FT: You must think about it a little bit?BG: We have a tremendous operational challenge in front of us and we’re going to exceed anybody’s expectations with respect to those challenges. So we’ve committed certain synergy targets on both the revenue and the expense side for the large deals and we’re doing what we do well, and that is to focus on the operation and the execution of the business plan, and that’s what we’re focused on right now.FT: We see a lot of banks right now talking about internalising liquidity and forming their own alternatives to exchanges.BG: Right.FT: Is that putting any pressure on the relationship between banks and exchanges like yours?BG: Well, the first thing is it’s now new. So the term “internalisation” has been around for a long period of time. What’s new is the term “dark pools.” So a dark pool is really a – just a form of internalisation. We at Nasdaq have been a believer in internalisation and in dark pools. Our exchange application was held up for five years because we fundamentally believed that dark pools internalisation could add value to the market place. So we see it as a strong competitive dynamic against the price-time matching engine.FT: And do you see that trend continuing?BG: I think it stabilised for the last six to nine months. So I would predict – and I could be wrong obviously – that the internalisation stabilizes. You see that…FT: And why is that?BG: Because it hit a very low mark. Right. Back in the day internalisation in the Nasdaq market would have been over 40 per cent of the overall volume. When I joined Nasdaq four and a half years ago it was about 33 per cent and today it’s in the low 20’s. So it’s been a dramatic decline and I think 20 – 25 percent is probably its natural level.FT: What has driven that?BG: The main market, the price-time market, the matching engines have got – have really increased their efficiency, the amount of liquidity available on-book, whether that’s on-book transparently to everybody or on-book in a reserved order. So, as that has received additional liquidity we’ve been able to reduce the price of trading on the on-book exchange and that makes it a more viable execution venue.FT: Thank you, very much.BG: Thank you.FT: Now we’re going to play long-short, Mr Greifeld.
