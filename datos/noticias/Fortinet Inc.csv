0;FTNT;Fortinet Inc;2016-10-12T16:10:10Z;Cyber security companies slide on Fortinet guidance cut;;Investors in cyber companies were in need of security on Wednesday after Fortinet sliced its third-quarter outlook, blaming delayed purchases for its downbeat guidance.Fortinet shares fell 12 per cent to $30.01 after the California-based company lowered its sales forecast to $311m from $316m, below its earlier estimates for $319m to $324m and shy of analysts’ forecasts for $322.3m. Its earnings outlook in the range of 15 to 16 cents a share was also below its previous estimates and analysts’ expectations for 18 cents.Fortinet also said it expects billings in the range of $343m to $348m compared to its previous guidance of $372m to $376m.The company said customers have been more “strategic in their purchases,” taking longer to make purchasing decisions or buying only what they immediately need, in the wake of “elevated” purchases in 2015. Since 2014, there have been data breaches at companies as varied as EBay, JPMorgan, Home Depot, Anthem, Sony and Yahoo, to name a few.The company also said that it had been impacted by “economic challenges of the Brexit in the UK, as well as the ongoing geopolitical issue and turmoil in Latin America”.Fortinet’s profit warning also saw investors sour on rival cyber security providers.
1;FTNT;Fortinet Inc;2012-09-25T23:11:21Z;Mayer replaces finance chief at Yahoo;;"Marissa Mayer has appointed a chief financial officer at Yahoo, the latest senior management change in the two months since she joined as chief executive.Ken Goldman, most recently chief financial officer at Fortinet, a security company, will replace Tim Morse, whose three years at Yahoo included a stint as interim chief executive.The appointment of Mr Goldman, a former Siebel executive with little managerial experience at consumer internet companies, marks the fifth senior executive change at Yahoo since Ms Mayer joined from Google in mid-July.The management changes reflect Ms Mayer’s determination to make a clean break with Yahoo’s past as she prepares to outline a new strategy for the company.“It’s unsurprising that she would just clear the decks as much as possible,” said Brian Wieser, analyst at Pivotal Research. “All forms of guidance around costs, capital return – everything is up for grabs.”Ms Mayer’s new management team includes Kathy Savitt, chief marketing officer and formerly at Amazon, American Eagle Outfitters and social-media start-up Lockerz; Jackie Reses, a private equity industry veteran who now oversees Yahoo’s human resources and business development; and Ron Bell, general counsel.Ross Levinsohn, the interim chief whom Ms Mayer beat to the permanent role, left in late July. Michael Barrett, the former Admeld chief hired in June, remains as Yahoo’s chief revenue officer.Although Yahoo has ruled out a mooted sale of its advertising technology unit and pledged to invest more in developing Right Media, its display network, Ms Mayer has made improving the Yahoo user experience her priority.One advertising agency chief told the Financial Times that Mr Levinsohn’s departure was like “hitting the reboot button on the sales force”. “All that continuity of relationship has gone,” the executive said. “Everyone that we talk to has left.”Reports of a staff briefing on Tuesday suggest Ms Mayer will prioritise user growth and the development of mobile platforms and search functions. She is thought likely to favour smaller, focused acquisitions over large purchases, after agreeing to return the majority of the $4.3bn net proceeds from selling Yahoo’s stake in Alibaba to shareholders last week.Yahoo declined to comment. Ms Mayer will present her strategy to investors in mid-October at Yahoo’s next quarterly results.Yahoo’s stock fell 2 per cent to $15.68 on Tuesday before the announcement of the new finance chief. Shares in the company have remained relatively flat since Ms Mayer’s appointment, during which time the Nasdaq has risen 7.6 per cent."
2;FTNT;Fortinet Inc;2020-04-25T18:31:28+0000;Fortinet plans $100m IPO;;Fortinet, the Silicon Valley network security firm, disclosed plans on Monday to raise as much as $100m in an initial public offering, the second technology company to announce IPO ambitions in just a week.Ancestry.com, a consumer genealogy site, filed a prospectus aimed at a $75m public offering the previous Monday. Two other companies got out the door in May: software company SolarWinds and online reservation site OpenTable. Before that, there had been no tech IPOs in nearly a year.Fortinet’s filing strengthens the belief in the Valley that venture-backed firms can start thinking about exits once more. It comes days after the official US unemployment rate unexpectedly decreased and at the same time as two acquisitions in other hot segments of the tech industry, as social networking firm Facebook bought the real-time updating service FriendFeed and virtualisation leader VMWare spent $362m on a cloud computing specialist, SpringSource.Even companies slashing technology spending during the downturn have spared security expenditures as they struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving cyber-threats. Beleaguered security officers must worry about new regulations from Washington and other countries covering data protection, and their employers insist they extend their mandates as more corporate data and programs are put off-site.At the same time, determined criminals are switching to fast-changing viruses that evade traditional screening methods based on blacklists. Hackers are also taking advantage of new entryways to corporate data, ranging from social networks to flash drives that can infect any employee’s computer before spreading internally.In the past, security firms have focused on warding off one type of penetration or another. But Fortinet is among those benefiting by trying to tackle everything at once, with gear known in the industry as Unified Threat Management. Like Check Point Software Technologies, McAfee and others, Fortinet simultaneously fights onetime intrusions, viruses, spam, phishing and other hazards.The combination can save companies money, and Fortinet swung from years of losses to a profit of $7.4m in fiscal 2008 as revenue increased from $155m to $212m. The company logged a loss of under $1m in the six months ended June 28, but sales continued to increase.According to IDG research cited in the prospectus, Fortinet had the leading share of the fragmented first-quarter market for Unified Threat Management hardware appliances, with 12.9 per cent. The overall segment is projected to grow from $1.3bn in 2007 to $3.5bn in 2012. Such hardware is particularly popular with small and medium-sized businesses.The cautionary notes in the prospectus include the fact that the company failed to register its stock when ownership spread past 500 individuals, although Fortinet said it is no longer violating regulations because of an exemption granted later when such broad distributions form part of a compensation plan.Fortinet has also been involved in a running dispute with big Japanese security firm Trend Micro. That company complained of patent infringement, and Fortinet settled the case by agreeing to pay $15m and royalties of not more than 1 per cent of revenue.Fortinet last year began trying to get the patents ruled invalid and stopped paying Trend Micro. Trend Micro filed suit again, this time for breach of contract, just last week. Trend Micro declined to comment on the case.Chief Executive Ken Xie and his brother Michael Xie, the company’s chief technical officer, together hold a 32.5 per cent stake. Investors Redpoint Ventures and Meritech Capital have another 15.5 percent and 10.9 per cent, respectively.

4;FTNT;Fortinet Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
