0;APA;Apache Corp;2020-01-07T15:45:24Z;Total and Apache tout ‘significant’ oil find in Suriname waters;Companies say discovery shows extension of oil-rich Guyana play;Oil producers Total and Apache announced a “significant oil discovery” on Tuesday that they said proves oil-rich rock formations off the coast of Guyana cross into Suriname waters, where they are exploring.The companies heralded the potential for “prolific” oil production after drilling work at the Maka Central-1 well off the coast of the South American nation showed that the neighbouring Guyanese Cretaceous oil play — in which rival ExxonMobil has discovered billions of barrels equivalent of recoverable oil and gas — extends into local waters.The two companies each own a 50 per cent stake in ‘Block 58’ where the well was drilled, after Total bought into it last month. Shares in Apache rose 20 per cent on the news to their highest level since May last year. Total shares were unmoved.“We are very pleased with this first significant oil discovery, made just after our entry into Block 58,” said Kevin McLachlan, senior vice-president for exploration at Total. “We are optimistic about the large remaining potential of the area still to be discovered and will test several other prospects on the same block.”Exxon has discovered an estimated 6bn barrels equivalent of recoverable oil and gas in its Stabroek block off Guyana since it started drilling in 2015, making the South American nation one of the world’s most promising areas for offshore oil exploration.A discovery of significant commercial oil deposits off Suriname could have major implications for the former Dutch colony, which is one of the smallest countries in Latin America and which has a population of less than 600,000 people.Its GDP per capita was less than $6,000 in 2017, according to the World Bank, with bauxite mining its largest industry, alongside some small scale oil production of less than 20,000 barrels a day.John Christmann, Apache chief executive and president, said that preliminary data from the Maka Central drilling “indicates the potential for prolific oil wells”.“Block 58 comprises 1.4m acres and offers significant potential beyond the discovery at Maka Central,” he added.But analysts were slightly more sceptical. Bob Brackett at Bernstein said it was difficult to judge the significance of the find “given lack of complete disclosure” in relation to it.“The discovery could be transformational for Apache but we lack details and currently (and highly conservatively) ascribe no value,” he said.

Exploration is very much alive, with lots of prospects generated and new wells to be drilled.”The North Sea was hit hard by the oil price crash that began in mid-2014 because it has been one of the most expensive places in the world from which to extract oil and gas. But the basin is rebounding as prices have recovered.The 30th offshore licensing round focused mainly on previously explored or “mature” areas of the North Sea.The number of licences awarded was marginally fewer than in the last round to focus on mature areas, in 2016, but the Oil and Gas Authority described it as “transformational” because companies have made firm commitments to drill eight exploration or appraisal wells and carry out nine new 3D seismic surveys.Fourteen of the licences will be advanced immediately to the field development planning stage.The Oil and Gas Authority said it hoped the licensing round would unlock 320m barrels of oil equivalent in about a dozen previously “stranded” or undeveloped discoveries.Although development activity in the North Sea has rebounded and several companies have committed significant capital expenditure to the basin following the price crash of 2014, exploration drilling has slumped until now.“There is a real sign of confidence,” said Mr Samuel. The results of the licensing round had demonstrated that exploration was not dead in the North Sea, he added.Kevin Swann of Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy, said: “The UK is in desperate need of new projects to fill a development pipeline that is all but empty beyond the early 2020s, and 14 new pre-[final investment decision] projects could go a long way to rectifying that.“The eight firm exploration wells among the awards, with big companies like Shell, BP, Equinor and ConocoPhillips among those set to drill, is a big vote of confidence in the UK.”

Energy was the day’s best performer, with the sector notching a 2.7 per cent advance after Brent crude rallied above $70 a barrel to hit its highest level since 2014. Of the day’s top five stocks on the S&P 500, three — Chesapeake Energy, Anadarko Petroleum and Apache Corp — hail from the oil & gas sector.The Dow Jones Industrial Average also resumed its winning ways, advancing 0.6 per cent to a new record of 25,511.58 as investors ramped up bets that US and global economic growth will stay on course this year.The gains on the Dow were led by Boeing, General Electric and Caterpillar – industrial groups that stand to benefit most from stronger economic growth.The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7 per cent at 7,203.07 – also a new high.
3;APA;Apache Corp;2017-09-17T15:57:33Z;Carson Block files lawsuit against Equifax;Veteran short-seller accuses credit-reporting company of ‘abysmal’ handling of hack;Veteran short-seller Carson Block has launched a private lawsuit against Equifax, accusing the credit-reporting company of an “abysmal” handling of one of the worst cyber security incidents in history.Equifax said on September 7 that its systems were breached by criminals in a raid that went on for more than two months — an admission that has prompted a flood of regulatory inquiries, dozens of private lawsuits and a more than one-third collapse in the company’s share price. The data of up to 143m Americans was compromised, the company said, along with up to 400,000 people in the UK.One of those was Mr Block, whose suit filed on Friday accuses Equifax of negligence in failing to safeguard and protect his personal identifying information from criminals, as well as a failure to disclose the breach in a timely fashion.Mr Block’s firm, Muddy Waters, has no short position that would benefit from a fall in the stock. In the suit, filed in the Northern District of California, San Francisco division, he seeks damages of at least $500,000 for the “stress, nuisance and annoyance” of dealing with issues stemming from the breach. The suit notes that Equifax’s business revolves around being a “secure storehouse” for data and providing a clear financial profile of consumers that lenders and other businesses can rely on. According to its own description, Equifax organises, assimilates and analyses data on more than 820m consumers and more than 91m businesses worldwide.Equifax could not be reached for comment at the time of publication.Hackers gained access to the Atlanta-based company’s systems via a vulnerability in Apache Struts, which is a popular open-source framework for developing web applications in the Java programming language.On Friday, Equifax said that it patched the hole on July 30, one day after it had detected strange activity on its servers. But cybersecurity experts note that the fix had been available since March, when the Apache Foundation put out an update which had been widely disseminated in tech circles.Mr Block’s suit names 11 senior executives at the company, including CEO Richard F Smith and Susan Mauldin, former chief information security officer. On Friday Equifax said that Ms Mauldin — a music major— would retire immediately from the company, along with David Webb, chief information officer.According to the suit, Equifax should have known that its defences were fragile, following two big breaches in 2016 alone. In one of those, in May, 430,000 names and other vital pieces of information were lost as a result of the company using “alarmingly poor” security for the generation of PINs from the last four digits of a social-security number and the four-digit year of birth.
4;APA;Apache Corp;2017-08-03T17:40:51Z;Energy shares drag S&P lower amid output concerns;;Energy stocks dragged the S&P 500 lower on Thursday as quarterly earnings from a number of mid-sized oil producers disappointed and moderating output growth raised concerns for the remainder of 2017.The S&P energy sector was the day’s biggest loser, dropping 1.1 per cent and weighed on the broader S&P 500, which was trading 0.2 per cent lower in midday trading. The day’s decline takes the energy sector’s losses so far this year to nearly 13 per cent – the most among the 10 major sectors on the S&P.Pioneer Natural Resources, Apache Corporation, Noble Energy and Conocho Resources were among the biggest laggards on the benchmark index after their latest results missed expectations and forecasts for production growth has been adjusted.Pioneer extended its losses from Wednesday, dropping another 5.6 per cent after closing 10.8 per cent lower last night. The oil and production company, which narrowly missed revenue estimates in the quarter, said it now expects production growth to be between 15-16 per cent – the lower end of its previous forecast of 15-18 per cent growth.Apache, which also missed revenue estimates, lowered its daily production forecasts following the sale of its Canadian assets last month. In 2017 it expects between 457,00 to 471,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day, down from 485,000 to 503,000. Shares in the group are 6.7 per cent lower at $44.67.Nobel Energy, in its quarterly earnings, posted a dramatically worse-than-expected loss of $3.20 per share, far more than the 13 cents loss analysts had expected. The decline stemmed from an exit of an upstream asset in Marcellus shale, though the company met expectations on revenue. Adjusted for this, the company said it expects annual production to be on the mid to upper end of its previous guidance. Shares are down 8.1 per cent to $25.78.Shares in Concho also fell 10.9 per cent to $114.65. Revenue of $635m missed expectations of $673m, though the group actually raised its production growth forecast. It expects a growth of between 24 per cent and 26 per cent.Appetite for energy stocks was also dented by the fresh drop in oil prices. After being boosted by the weaker dollar last week, crude has endured choppier trading over the past couple of days. West Texas Intermediate, the US marker, was down 0.8 per cent at $49.21 a barrel while Brent was down 0.3 per cent at $52.22.
5;APA;Apache Corp;2017-03-16T18:16:25Z;BP in talks to sell North Sea pipeline to Ineos;Network one of the most strategically important pieces of infrastructure in the region;"Ineos, the UK petrochemicals group, is in talks with BP to buy the Forties pipeline system, one of the most strategically important pieces of infrastructure in the North Sea.The Forties network is made up of about 100 miles of pipeline and handles around 450,000 barrels of oil a day — equivalent to 40 per cent of UK production — from 80 different oilfields.Ineos depends on the Forties pipeline for supplies to its Grangemouth refinery, on the banks of the Firth of Forth, which it bought from BP in 2005 and which remains Scotland’s biggest industrial facility.A sale of the pipeline system would complete BP’s withdrawal from assets that once formed the heart of its operations after North Sea oil production took off in the 1970s.The Forties oilfield was one of the first large oil discoveries beneath UK waters and remains a big producer for Apache, the US company that bought the field from BP in 2003.BP confirmed in a brief statement that it was “in discussions with Ineos regarding a potential sale of the Forties pipeline system” but gave no further details on valuation of the asset or the timetable for a possible agreement. Ineos also confirmed the talks.A deal would mark the latest step in BP’s efforts to sell older North Sea assets and highlight the wider retreat by the biggest oil and gas groups from one of the world’s most mature and high-cost offshore basins.However, BP has not given up on the UK continental shelf; it is making multibillion-pound investments in an expansion of its Clair Ridge and Schiehallion fields west of the Shetland Islands.BP has been looking for a buyer for the Forties pipeline system for more than a year.Finding a committed long-term investor in the infrastructure was crucial to the wider health of the North Sea industry because of its integral position in the web of interconnecting pipelines that take oil ashore.Industry leaders have long been worried that a lack of investment in North Sea infrastructure could accelerate the decline in the basin if existing oilfields and untapped resources were left stranded when old pipelines were decommissioned.A deal with Ineos would also signify the company’s growing importance within the UK industrial sector. Assembled by its founder, Jim Ratcliffe, from petrochemical assets offloaded by companies including BP and the now-defunct ICI, Ineos has grown in the space of two decades into Britain’s largest private company with annual revenues of about $40bn.About 300 BP staff are involved in the operation and support of the Forties network and the group said it was “committed to communicating openly with staff and our stakeholders as soon as we are able” if a deal is reached."
6;APA;Apache Corp;2017-03-07T00:13:13Z;UK North Sea operators show signs of revival;Trade body predicts companies will generate positive free cash flow in 2017;Energy companies active in the UK North Sea will generate positive free cash flow in 2017 for the first time in four years, as groups show signs of recovery following the oil price crash of 2014, says the industry’s trade body.Exploration and production companies working in the basin are collectively forecast to generate £5bn of free cash flow this year if the rebound in oil prices persists around current levels, said Oil & Gas UK, which represents North Sea operators.That would mark an encouraging turnround from the past four years, when companies’ costs exceeded revenues as they battled against falling oil prices.Costs were exceeding revenues even before the oil price crash that began in mid-2014, with companies collectively having negative free cash flow in 2013, and this reflects how North Sea operators ran up some of the highest operating expenses in the world.The slump in crude prices pushed operators to cut costs, and average unit operating expenses in the basin have almost halved in the past two years, from $29.70 a barrel to $15.30, said Oil & Gas UK.This has led to optimism that the North Sea industry may finally be turning a corner and the basin has witnessed a flurry of deals since the turn of the year. These include Royal Dutch Shell’s agreement to sell assets in the basin to Chrysaor, a small UK company backed by private equity, for at least $3bn. “Confidence is slowly returning to the basin,” said Deirdre Michie, chief executive of Oil & Gas UK.Oil prices have been fluctuating around $55 a barrel since last year’s agreement by Opec — as well as countries outside the producers’ cartel — to curb output. This is roughly double the price at the start of 2016.The trade body therefore believes the North Sea industry may now have reached the “bottom” of the latest downturn, although it is warning that exploration and production companies are likely to use most of their available cash flow to reduce debts rather than invest more in new projects.Alongside cuts to operating expenses, North Sea operators reduced project investments during the downturn — last year only two relatively modest field development plans were approved, involving BP and Apache.Up to six new projects could get final approval from operators this year, and a further eight in 2018, said Oil & Gas UK, but it warned in a report published on Tuesday that these are “not certain to be delivered and may be subject to delay or cancellation”. The UK North Sea will face “another significant production decline in the early part of the next decade if new capital cannot be secured this year”, added the report.North Sea production had been in protracted decline, with output falling between 2000 and 2015.Production started rising again two years ago as a result of projects authorised by operators before the downturn.Investment decisions made by operators this year and next will be “critical” and will have far-reaching consequences for North Sea jobs and skills in the coming decade, said Oil & Gas UK.North Sea employment, including jobs in the supply chain, has fallen by a quarter since 2013 to 330,400. The new projects due for approval next year include Premier Oil’s $600m Tolmount gas development in the southern part of the basin.Ms Michie warned life would remain tough for some companies in the North Sea, notably oilfield services groups.Mike Tholen, upstream policy director at Oil & Gas UK, urged Philip Hammond, the UK chancellor, not to use higher oil prices as a reason to increase the tax burden on the industry. 
7;APA;Apache Corp;2016-09-11T17:08:13Z;The region leading the US oil recovery;Permian basin in Texas is proving resilient following crude price crash;In the property business, it is often said that only three factors really matter: location, location, and location. Much the same is true in the oil business.In the tentative upturn in the US shale oil industry since May, most of the additional drilling and much of the acquisition spending has been focused on one hotspot: the Permian basin of western Texas and eastern New Mexico.This formation, about 300 miles long and 250 miles wide, holds some of North America’s most accessible shale oil reserves. Companies that have been lucky enough, or smart enough, to build strong positions there — such as Pioneer Natural Resources and Concho Resources — can expect to have a competitive advantage over other oil producers, in what remains a very difficult market.As share prices of US exploration and production companies have rebounded this year, those focused on the Permian have been the best performers. Shares in Diamondback Energy and RSP Permian, for example, have been hitting record highs, up 48 per cent and 66 per cent respectively over the past 12 months.Even ExxonMobil and Chevron — the two largest US oil groups, which were left behind by smaller, more innovative rivals as the shale boom took off — now have opportunities in the Permian to make up some lost ground.Although the Permian was not immune as activity across the US oil industry slumped after the crude price crash of two years ago, it has proved the most resilient of the “big three” US shale regions. From peak production, crude output has dropped by 40 per cent in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas, and by 25 per cent in the Bakken formation centred on North Dakota. In the Permian, by contrast, the drop is only 2 per cent.In a sign of the region’s attractions, EOG Resources, one of the most successful of the independent US shale producers, last week announced a $2.5bn deal to buy privately-held Yates Petroleum. Yates’ most valuable assets are drilling rights on 324,000 acres of the Permian.EOG pioneered oil development in the Eagle Ford, and it is still the largest producer there. But William Thomas, EOG’s chief executive, told analysts on a call last month that it would spend 45 per cent of next year’s capital budget in the Delaware, a sub-basin on the western side of the Permian.Since May, the number of rigs drilling horizontal shale oil wells in the US has risen by 77 to 325, according to the oilfield services company Baker Hughes. Of those, 49 were added in the Permian, compared with just four in the Eagle Ford and six in the Williston Basin, which includes the Bakken.At the same time, the Permian has been a focus for deals. Of the $30.4bn spent on mergers and acquisitions in the US exploration and production sector so far this year, 48 per cent has gone to the Permian, according to research company Wood Mackenzie.Companies have been attracted to the Permian because it holds some of the lowest-cost oil in North America.Production costs can vary widely within each area, and the best spots in the Eagle Ford and Bakken are still competitive but overall the Permian has the most attractive economics. At current crude prices, bringing a well in the Delaware basin into production will generate an internal rate of return of about 18 per cent on average, according to Platts Analytics. That is higher than for any other shale region.Coming relatively late to the shale party, behind the Bakken and the Eagle Ford, the Permian has offered greater scope for companies to cut costs and raise production. Since 2012, average peak output per well has risen by 122 per cent in the Permian, compared with 67 per cent in the Eagle Ford and 78 per cent in the Bakken, according to data analysis firm NavPort.Meanwhile, costs are falling sharply. Concho Resources told investors at a Barclays conference last week that it had cut the cost per foot of its wells by about 40 per cent since the first quarter of 2015.Long-term prospects for the region were also underlined last week when Apache, the US exploration and production company, announced the discovery of a “significant new resource play” in the Permian, which could hold more than 3bn barrels of oil and 75tn cubic feet of gas, in a part of a formation that had been neglected by other companies.Geologists sometimes describe the Permian as a “layer cake” of multiple different oil-bearing formations, with names such as Wolfcamp, Spraberry and Bone Spring. Companies are experimenting with techniques to optimise production from as many of these layers as possible.Exploration in the Permian has a long history, with the first oil struck in 1923, and west Texas has experienced several cycles of boom and bust. Drilling rights are often held by smaller companies that are prepared to sell out, giving larger operators a chance to build positions. That also opens the door for private equity investors such as Blackstone, which last month committed $1.5bn to two oil producers to buy Permian assets.Exxon and Chevron also see great potential in the region. Exxon came into the Permian through its takeover of XTO Energy in 2010, and added on subsequent smaller acquisitions, while Chevron has a large legacy position. But they see similarly bright prospects.Exxon said last month that it had cut unit development costs on the Permian by 70 per cent over the past two years, and “a large part” of the inventory of wells it could drill would be economically viable with crude at about $40 a barrel.Chevron said it had cut unit development costs by 30 per cent since last year, and raised production by 24,000 barrels per day. It was using six rigs there last month, and plans to raise that to 10 by the end of the year.Heightened levels of M&A activity suggest other companies will add more rigs, too, even if the oil price remains at its present level of about $45 for US crude. “You don’t typically do a billion-dollar deal and then wait for market conditions to improve,” points out Benjamin Shattuck of Wood Mackenzie. “You get rigs in the field.”On that basis, the Permian seems set to remain a hot location for a long time to come.While the Permian Basin of west Texas has become the focus for much of the US shale industry, other areas are also attracting increased activity, writes Ed Crooks.Of these, the most popular has been the “Stack”: a rather laboured acronym for the “Sooner Trend Anadarko basin Canadian and Kingfisher counties”, in Oklahoma.In those two counties, to the west of Oklahoma City, the number of rigs drilling horizontal shale oil wells has risen from 13 in July to 20 today. That is a faster increase than in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas or the Bakken formation of North Dakota, the original heartlands of the US shale oil boom.Activity is now set to pick up further. At the Barclays energy conference in New York last week, seven companies including Marathon Oil, Cimarex and Devon Energy highlighted their position in the Stack as an important prospect for future growth.Lee Tillman, Marathon’s chief executive, described the Stack as the group’s “first priority in the capital allocation process.” In June, Marathon agreed a deal to pay $888m for PayRock Energy, a private equity-backed company with drilling rights over 61,000 acres of the Stack.Similarly, in December, Devon Energy agreed to pay $1.9bn for 80,000 acres in the Stack from Felix Energy. Last week, Devon reported that it had already gone from running two rigs to four in the Stack, and was planning to bring on two more by the end of the year.David Hager, Devon’s chief executive, said results from its pilot wells had been “outstanding”, and the company was “very excited” about its prospects in the region.
8;APA;Apache Corp;2016-09-07T21:27:35Z;Apache buoyed by Alpine High discovery;S&P 500 and Dow flat on the day but Nasdaq reaches new high;Apache shares rallied on Wednesday after the US energy group announced a “significant” oil and gas discovery.The company said it found a resource called the Alpine High, located in Texas’s Delaware Basin. Apache believed that its acreage in there contains some 3bn barrels of oil and 75tn cubic feet of gas.Benjamin Shattuck of Wood Mackenzie, the research company, said the discovery was important both for Apache and for production in the Permian Basin region of west Texas.However, he cautioned that the development of the reserves was still in its early stages with only 19 wells drilled.For large-scale production, the area would also need investment in infrastructure such as processing plants and pipelines to transport the gas.“There is a lot of work to be done both below ground and above ground,” said Mr Shattuck.Houston-based Apache said it planned to increase its 2016 capital spending by about $200m to about $2bn as it accelerated the development of the region.The price of crude oil rallied sharply in early August, but then pulled back later in the month as the US dollar strengthened and concerns rose that higher prices could prompt companies to bring more production online.West Texas Intermediate, the US oil marker, traded at $46.14 a barrel on Wednesday, up from $26.21 in mid-February, but far off the high of $107.26 it struck in June 2014.Apache shares climbed 6.7 per cent on Wednesday to $55.13.Elsewhere, Western Digital zipped higher after it lifted its current-quarter outlook.The maker of data storage devices such as computer hard disc drives said it expected its revenues in the quarter to the end of September to come in at $4.45bn-$4.55bn, from a previous estimate of $4.4bn-$4.5bn.It also forecasted adjusted profits, which exclude certain items, of $1-$1.05 a share, from 85-90 cents.Wall Street analysts had forecast adjusted earnings per share of 89 cents on sales of $4.46bn.Western Digital shares rallied 12.1 per cent to $53.30. The advance trimmed the group’s year-to-date decline to 11.2 per cent.On the other side of the spectrum, General Mills shares were in the red after the maker of Cheerios and Jus-Rol said it expected to report a decline in an important sales metric in its last quarter.The company said organic net sales growth in the quarter ended August 28 will be below its full-year guidance range of flat to down 2 per cent.The shares were off 4.3 per cent to $67.85 but are still up 23.5 per cent over the past 12 months.By the close of trade, the S&P 500 was flat at 2,186.2 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1 per cent to 18,526.1. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.2 per cent to a record high of 5,283.9.Additional reporting by Ed Crooks in New York

10;APA;Apache Corp;2016-03-14T21:09:59Z;Investors have renewed appetite for energy bonds;Strong interest reported in Anadarko offering, following debt issuance by two other US groups;Investors showed signs of regaining their appetite for energy companies’ bonds following the recent rally in oil prices.Orders for a bond offering from Anadarko Petroleum, the US oil producer, exceeded $20bn on Monday, covering underwriter books more than six times, according to three people familiar with the transaction.Anadarko, which last year made an unsuccessful takeover approach to Apache, another US producer, will use the proceeds from the $3bn offering to refinance debt that matures later this year and next.The plunge in the price of Brent crude to a 13-year low of $27 per barrel in January slowed new debt offerings by energy companies to a trickle at the start of the year.But Brent has since rebounded about 45 per cent to more than $40, restoring market access for groups with the best credit ratings. On Monday, Brent was trading at $39.50, down 2 per cent.ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, rated triple A and single A respectively by Standard & Poor’s, have both completed multibillion-dollar bond offerings in the past two weeks.The strong showings for those bonds buoyed confidence that demand would materialise for the sale by Anadarko, despite it having split ratings among the three major credit agencies.Moody’s, which downgraded Anadarko to junk status last month, warned that the company faced “substantially lower forecasted cash flow generation . . . high debt levels relative to cash flow and Moody’s expectation of some production declines caused by reduced capital investment”.Standard & Poor’s and Fitch both maintain investment grade ratings on the company’s debt.Anadarko sold new 10-year debt with a yield of roughly 5.59 per cent, or 362.5 basis points above the benchmark Treasury. That marked an improvement from initial price talk of 412.5 basis points above the comparable Treasury on Monday, but remained wide of 10-year paper sold by Anadarko in 2014 that currently yields 5.41 per cent.The company also sold new five- and 30-year bonds in the transaction led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays and Mizuho, according to a person familiar with the matter.One investor who said he had placed an order for the debt characterised Anadarko as a “name everyone likes”.The bond sale should give some confidence to energy groups that face debt maturities between 2016 and 2020. Ahead of the Anadarko sale, only five energy companies had completed bond sales in the US this year, an 85 per cent drop from one year earlier, according to Dealogic data.The last junk-rated energy group to complete a US dollar bond sale was YPF, Argentina’s state-controlled oil company, which sold $100m last December.Fitch warned last week that one-in-five high-yield energy groups that have issued debt in the US will default this year.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt

The news comes after data released on Friday showed the number of US oil rigs had slid to its lowest level since December 2009.Saudi Arabia and Russia also said last week that they would agree to freeze oil output at current levels if other big producers agree to such a move.US crude oil prices rallied 6.2 per cent to $31.48 a barrel, having risen 20.1 per cent since hitting its lowest level since 2003 on February 11. Brent, the international benchmark, climbed 5.1 per cent to $34.69 a barrel.The advance pushed the S&P 500 energy index up 2.2 per cent. Among the companies posting large gains was Apache, an exploration and production company, which tacked on 6 per cent to $39.58. The shares are still down 40.2 per cent over the past 12 months.Chevron, a large integrated oil company, rallied 2.7 per cent to $88.82.Investors also bid-up miners as the prices of aluminium and copper logged solid gains. Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, wrote in a note to clients that industrial metals may be “putting in a bottom” after facing heavy losses over the past year amid concerns about the pace of global economic growth.Freeport-McMoRan, a copper miner, leapt 14.6 per cent to $7.93, cutting its 12-month decline to 61.5 per cent. Alcoa, an aluminium producer, rose 13.2 per cent to $8.91.The shares of many banks also showed gains on Monday, as rising confidence that the US economy is not headed towards a recession helped allay fears that the Federal Reserve may have to change course on its plans to gradually tighten monetary policy.Bank of America, one of the biggest US banks, rose 3.4 per cent to $12.54. The shares are still down 25.5 per cent for 2016.Elsewhere, Expedia was one of the worst performers on the S&P 500 index after analysts at Stifel downgraded the travel website from “hold” to “sell”. The investment bank said the cut came due to “increasing concerns over a moderating macroeconomic outlook”, increased competition from hotels that offer direct-booking services, and a “maturing” US online booking market.Expedia’s shares dropped 1.6 per cent to $106.96, extending their 2016 dip to 14 per cent.By the close of trade, the S&P 500 had jumped 1.5 per cent to 1,945.5, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.4 per cent to 16,620.7 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.5 per cent to 4,570.6.Every big S&P 500 sector was in the black, led by economically sensitive shares. Investors started the week on a bright note as several investment banks issued reports saying robust inflation and consumer spending data released recently underlie the strength of the US economy despite trouble in the energy and manufacturing sectors.“Investors are starting to see the glass as half full,” Francesco Garzarelli, co-head of markets research at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients.

Friday offered the latest evidence of the retrenchment as a survey showed the the number of US oil rigs had dropped to the lowest since December 2009.Saudi Arabia and Russia also said last week that they would agree to freeze oil output at current levels if other big producers agree to such a move.US crude oil prices rallied 7.1 per cent to $31.75 a barrel, having risen 21.9 per cent since hitting the lowest level since 2003 on February 11. Brent, the international benchmark, climbed 5.3 per cent to $34.77 a barrel.The advance pushed the S&P 500 energy index up 1.8 per cent. Among the companies posting large gains was Apache, an exploration and production company, which tacked on 5.2 per cent to $39.26.

13;APA;Apache Corp;2016-02-03T00:58:53Z;Standard & Poor’s cuts ratings of US oil and gas groups;Chevron hit and shale producers are downgraded to junk;Standard & Poor’s has cut the credit ratings of some leading US oil and gas companies, including Chevron, the country’s second largest, as a result of the agency’s lowered expectations for long-term crude prices.The decisions show how the plunge in oil and gas since the summer of 2014 is hitting not only the highly indebted exploration and production companies that borrowed to finance their growth during the US shale boom, but also the more financially conservative independent companies and even the large international oil groups Chevron and ExxonMobil. Three leading shale oil and gas producers, Continental Resources, Southwestern Energy and privately held Hunt Oil, were downgraded from investment grade to “junk” status. Exxon, the largest US oil group and one of only three companies in the country with an AAA status, was put on watch for a possible downgrade of the rating. S&P said it would decide on Exxon within 90 days.The moves follow the agency’s announcement last month that it would be using lowered long-term oil and gas price expectations to calculate ratings. Its new projection is that both international benchmark Brent and US West Texas Intermediate crude will average $40 this year, $45 next year and $50 from 2018 onwards. In December 2014, S&P was using a long-term Brent price assumption of $85. The agency said on Tuesday that the scale of the reduction in its price expectations meant that even investment grade companies were affected. It added that it expected many of those companies to continue to cut capital spending and raise their productivity, but “these actions, for the most part, are insufficient to stem the meaningful deterioration expected in credit measures over the next few years”. The agency said it would assess Exxon’s “financial policies and strategies for mitigating the potential impact of the downturn”, as well as look at its 2015 results. Exxon reported a 50 per cent drop in earnings for 2015, a smaller decline than for rivals Chevron and BP, and is cutting capital spending sharply, but its net debt rose by $10.6bn during the year to $35bn as it borrowed to pay its dividend. Ratings for Chevron as well as EOG Resources, Apache and Devon Energy, three large independent oil and gas producers, were cut but remained investment grade. Ratings for Hess, Marathon Oil and Murphy Oil, three other leading independent US exploration and production companies, were cut to BBB-, also still investment grade but just one notch above junk. ConocoPhillips, the largest US exploration and production company, was also put on watch for a possible downgrade within 90 days. S&P said this would depend on the company’s ability to achieve cost savings and asset sales, and to cut capital spending without hurting production rates. There was good news for four others, however: Occidental Petroleum, EQT, Cimarex Energy and Pioneer Natural Resources were affirmed at investment grade ratings. The moves follow S&P’s announcement on Monday that it had cut Royal Dutch Shell’s rating by one notch to A+ from AA-, and put a negative outlook on other large European oil companies including BP, Statoil and Total.Yields on investment grade energy bonds, which move inversely to their price, have climbed rapidly as oil tumbled over the past year, according to data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The yield on the US bank’s energy index had risen to 5.36 per cent on Tuesday, more than 1.9 percentage points above its low last April. The spread of the yield on the energy index above US government bonds has widened to its highest level since the country started to emerge from recession in 2009.

The shares, which were already down 38 per cent this year, fell 14 per cent to $40.41.“The department store sector has come under significant pressure in recent weeks as a number of brands commented on weakness in the US wholesale channel and elevated inventory levels driving a promotional acceleration,” said Daniela Nedialkova, an analyst at Atlantic Equities.The extent of the hit to sentiment was underlined by the performance of JCPenney, another veteran department store, whose shares began the day brightly after it said same-store sales in the third quarter had climbed a larger than expected 6.4 per cent.Its stock rose as much as 2.3 per cent to $8.88. But the move quickly unravelled after Macy’s results, which pushed the shares down 2 per cent to $8.51.JCPenney said it would pay as much as $50m to settle a lawsuit by customers in California over pricing. Although it denies the allegation that it broke Californian state law, the retailer said it was settling to avoid a protracted legal battle.The S&P 500 Consumer Durables and Apparel index, a broad measure of US retailers that includes Under Armour and Ralph Lauren, dropped 1.6 per cent, making it the second-worst performer on the S&P 500.Pharmaceuticals were also in focus. Shares in Horizon Pharma plunged 19.6 per cent to $17.99 after Express Scripts, which manages drug programmes for insurers and is a force in US healthcare, said it was suing the company and severing ties with pharmacy chain Linden Care, which dispenses Horizon’s products.Speciality pharmacies, which exclusively or predominantly sell medicines made by a single company, have been hit by concerns about some drug companies’ business models. Horizon said Express’s suit was without merit.In oil and gas, Apache shares fell 7.4 per cent to $49.38 after Anadarko Petroleum confirmed that it had made an approach. Anadarko added that it had withdrawn the bid. Energy companies are struggling to agree deals despite the pressure for consolidation.Some sectors fared better. The S&P 500 homebuilding index rose 1.9 per cent after surging 5.4 per cent on Tuesday. Results from DR Horton, one of the largest US homebuilders, buoyed sentiment after its profits rose more than expected. Its shares were up 2.8 per cent at $32.02 after jumping 8.3 per cent on Tuesday.US stocks overall struggled for direction on Veterans Day, a public holiday for many government employees, some businesses and the bond market. The S&P 500 slipped 0.3 per cent to 2,075.00, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3 per cent to 17,702.22. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.3 per cent lower at 5,067.02.
15;APA;Apache Corp;2015-11-11T15:35:36Z;Apache rejects Anadarko Petroleum’s takeover approach;Failed deal is a sign of how, amid low oil prices, some energy transactions are hard to finalise;Anadarko Petroleum on Wednesday confirmed that it made a takeover approach to Apache, a fellow US oil exploration and production company, but said the offer was rejected and has now been withdrawn.The failure of the approach is a sign of how, even at a time when crude prices are low and oil and gas producers are under severe financial pressure, it has been difficult to reach agreement on deals because of differences between buyers’ and sellers’ expectations.Al Walker, Anadarko’s chief executive, said his company’s attempts to reach a confidentiality agreement to explore a potential takeover for Apache had been “summarily rejected” and “no discussions of substance occurred”.The proposed offer was all in shares, and included a “modest premium” to Apache’s market value, he added.Apache declined to comment.Apache shares jumped 13 per cent on Monday after Bloomberg reported that it had received an unsolicited takeover approach. The shares were down about 6 per cent in pre-market trading on Wednesday following Anadarko’s statement.Mr Walker said Anadarko was unwilling to pursue the takeover without access to detailed non-public information, adding that its analysis showed that Apache “appears to trade at or near full value currently”.He argued that a takeover on the terms Anadarko had proposed would have been “highly accretive” to its cash flow, even before any synergies.For Apache shareholders, he said, given the company’s “historic financial and operating underperformance”, the deal offered “numerous value-creation opportunities given Anadarko’s demonstrated success”.Anadarko and Apache both have assets in the US and around the world, including acreage in the Permian Basin of west Texas, one of the most attractive North American shale oil regions.However, Anadarko has had a better record of success in exploration in recent years, including discoveries in the deep water off the Gulf of Mexico and large gasfields off the coast of Mozambique.Apache has specialised in buying mature fields from larger companies and squeezing extra oil out of them, and had great success with that approach in the US and in the North Sea.However, over the past five years its shares have dropped by 54 per cent, even after this week’s bump up. Anadarko’s shares have risen by 4 per cent over the same period, through a difficult time for the industry’s profitability.In a research note earlier this week, Jonathan Wolff, analyst at Jefferies, said he was sceptical about the outlook for Apache “due to concerns around its technical capabilities, its unimpressive capital allocation and low confidence in the acreage quality outside of the Permian”.He added that Apache’s assets in Egypt, which has been politically unstable, and decommissioning liabilities for removing old infrastructure in the North Sea, would be “poison pills” that would deter possible bidders.
16;APA;Apache Corp;2015-10-01T17:34:05Z;EOG Resources climbs on energy comeback;Big gainers are companies betting on America’s shale oil boom;After suffering in the past quarter, it was not all bad news for the energy sector as the fourth quarter began. Among Thursday’s big gainers were companies that have bet on America’s shale oil boom.EOG Resources, one of the biggest names in the industry, saw its shares climb as much as 4 per cent, helping bring down its year-to-date fall to 20 per cent by markets close.Smaller names rode the wave higher as shares in Apache advanced 1.4 per cent to $39.72 while those in Devon Energy rose 1.8 per cent to $37.75.The S&P 500 energy sector remained static in choppy trading on Thursday, slightly outperforming the broader stock market. That represents a sharp change in sentiment from the third quarter, where the sector shed more than 18 per cent.An early rally in crude oil futures helped propel the gains after the price of crude fell more than 20 per cent last quarter. US crude oil rallied as much as 3 per cent before pulling back gains to a 0.8 per cent loss.Energy majors, which have more diversified operations, benefited, but enthusiasm soon faded. ExxonMobil and Chevron, both blue-chip companies, zigzagged between gains and losses and settled 0.4 and 0.6 per cent lower at $74.05 and $78.40 respectively by close.The rally comes just a day after the US Department of Energy said American crude oil supplies jumped by some 4m barrels last week.Stocks remain at the most elevated level for this time of year in at least 80 years. Adding to potential headwinds for the sector, Morgan Stanley said this week it expected technological advancements would help companies continue making money at lower prices, meaning supplies could remain elevated for some time.General Motors climbed 2.2 per cent to $30.67 after it reported a 12 per cent increase in September auto sales. That considerably exceeded estimates of an 9.3 per cent sales jump.Apple dipped 0.7 per cent to $109.58. The decline came after DigiTimes, a tech-industry newspaper, cited unnamed sources as saying the world’s biggest technology company had trimmed smartphone chip orders for the fourth quarter.That comes just days after Apple said it sold 13m of the latest iPhones within three days of their launch.Separately, Apple said on Thursday that James Bell, a former chief financial officer at Boeing, was elected to join the firm’s board.Elsewhere in the tech sector, Twitter tumbled 8.4 per cent to $24.67.Traders digested a report that Jack Dorsey, its co-founder who has been serving as interim chief executive, would be permanently placed in the top spot. Mr Dorsey also leads Square, a mobile payment provider.The report said he would remain in both posts — which would represent an about-face by Twitter, which previously said it was only interested in a chief who was committed to the company full time.The utilities sector was the biggest laggard — a turnround from the third quarter where it was the only big sector to post a gain.Utilities are preferred for their dividends and frequently utilised by investors who wish to take a defensive stance. With many investment banks calling for gains in the final quarter of the year, traders may be positioning for a more bullish market environment.The S&P 500 closed up 0.2 per cent at 1,923.82, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1 per cent lower at 16,272.01 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2 per cent to 4,627.08.
17;APA;Apache Corp;2015-08-21T03:13:23Z;Santos chief David Knox departs after profit slump;Oil price slide claims scalp of Australian resources group boss;The collapse in oil prices has claimed a big scalp in the Australian resources industry with the resignation of David Knox, the chief executive of Santos, after he revealed a slump in first-half profits and flagged asset sales on Friday.The announcement followed a similarly poor set of results from Santos’ local rival Origin Energy this week, reawakening fears about the strength of the balance sheets of both companies in a low oil price environment.“As oil prices fall the companies with the highest leverage are being hit the most,” said John Hirjee, analyst at Deutsche Bank. “We have already seen Woodside buy Apache’s assets this year and more parcels of assets are likely to come up for sale now.”Peter Coates, Santos chairman, said he would lead a strategic review to restore and maximise shareholder value in the face of the continuing pressure on oil prices. “No options will be ruled out,” he said.Santos has appointed Deutsche Bank and Lazard to advise the board, which Mr Coates said would be talking to parties who had already expressed interest in “various assets and other strategic initiatives”.Mr Knox was chief executive of Santos over a seven-year period during which the company spent billions of dollars transforming itself from a mainly domestic gas supplier into a big exporter of liquefied natural gas to Asia.The company owns 30 per cent of a US$18.5bn LNG plant in Queensland, which will shortly move into production at a time when Asian LNG prices have declined. Santos also owns a share of LNG assets in Darwin and Papua New Guinea.Mr Knox had repeatedly ruled out raising fresh equity to bolster Santos' balance sheet amid the turmoil in commodities markets over recent months.Santos’ net profit fell 82 per cent to A$37m in the six months to the end of June, compared with the same period a year earlier. Increased production volumes were offset by a 47 per cent fall in the average realised oil price in the first half of 2015.Shares in Santos fell below A$6 this week, down from above A$15 a year earlier, amid concerns about its A$8.8bn net debt. The stock was up 1.6 per cent at A$5.70 early Friday afternoon on the ASX.One option Santos has been exploring is a sale of the gas pipeline to the LNG plant in Queensland, which it owns jointly with Malaysia’s Petronas (27.5 per cent), Total (27.5 per cent) and South Korea’s Kogas (15 per cent). But the project’s complex shareholding has complicated the process.Rival Origin on Thursday revealed a A$550m cost overrun for its LNG plant in Queensland, which it owns jointly with ConocoPhillips and Sinopec, sending its shares down 13 per cent. Origin reported a A$658m loss for the year through June, reversing from a profit of A$530m a year earlier.Gordon Cairns, Origin chairman, said the company would focus on reducing operating and capital costs, realigning debt across the group entities and divesting assets.
18;APA;Apache Corp;2015-03-19T09:58:16Z;Demystifying the ‘Fracklog’;Number of uncompleted shale wells will drop as oil prices recover;Sometimes new words are useful additions to the language. Sometimes they can create confusion.“Fracklog” is the catchy neologism for the backlog of US shale wells that have been drilled but not yet brought into production.More prosaically known as “drilled but uncompleted” or “waiting on completions”, these wells still need to be fracked and fitted with production equipment for the oil to flow.Interest in the fracklog started picking up last month when EOG Resources, the largest US shale producer, said it would “intentionally delay” completing some of its wells.Some analysts think this tactic, spread across the industry, will be significant later in the year. They argue that as soon as US crude prices recover a little, companies will start production from those uncompleted wells, bringing a rush of extra supply on to the market. This could stifle any recovery in prices.There may be something in this argument. EOG expects to add about 85 uncompleted wells this year, while Anadarko Petroleum said recently it would drill but not complete 125 wells this year.Apache said it would defer some completions, without giving a number, while Chesapeake Energy said it planned to build a “little bit of inventory” in uncompleted wells in the Eagle Ford shale.For some producers, deferring completions makes sense. Completing a well can account for between a half and three-quarters of its total cost, so slowing completions is a quick way to start delivering the cuts in capital spending.The contango in crude futures, with prices significantly higher for next year than for immediate sales, also creates an incentive to leave oil in the ground and extract it at a later date.And with activity slowing sharply, the cost of completing wells could be lower later in the year, too, as the companies providing fracking and other services cut their rates.However, it is still unclear just how widespread the practice of deferring completions really is.The diversity of US shale producers makes it difficult to generalise about their strategies. Extrapolating from large, financially sound businesses such as EOG and Anadarko is particularly hazardous.There are likely to be many shale producers, with debt payments to meet or loans to repay, that cannot afford the luxury of a fracklog. They may also have commitments with drilling contractors that mean there are limits on how quickly they can lay down rigs. If they have paid for the rigs already, they might as well use them.125Number of wells Anadarko Petroleum said it would drill but not complete this yearIndeed, other leading shale oil producers including Marathon Oil, Whiting Petroleum and Hess, have said they do not plan to defer completions at all.The number of wells “waiting on completion services” has been rising sharply in North Dakota, home to the prolific Bakken shale formation. They have risen from an average of about 650 last October to 825 at the end of January.Some of that increase may, however, be due to tighter regulations on flaring. In the fourth quarter of last year and again at the start of this year North Dakota cut the proportion of associated gas from oil wells that can be burnt off, forcing producers to work out other solutions.Others may also be waiting for the cuts in North Dakota’s state taxes on oil production that will kick in once West Texas Intermediate crude has been below $55.09 for five consecutive months, a point that looks likely to be reached in May.Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy, expects that across the US, the fracklog will actually be lower at the end of the year than its estimate of about 3,000 todayUS exploration and production companies may be able to sustain their production this year, but only through intense efforts to improve productivity and cut costs. Expecting them to coast to growth on a cushion of drilled but uncompleted wells would be a mistake.The Commodities Note is an online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times
19;APA;Apache Corp;2015-03-05T20:25:08Z;Buoyant ExxonMobil bucks sector’s gloom;World’s largest energy group uses downturn to put itself in a stronger position than its rivals;"Rex Tillerson, chief executive of ExxonMobil, is showing every sign of being that rare individual: an oil executive who is happy about low crude prices.His cheerful demeanour at the company’s presentation to analysts in New York on Wednesday contrasted with the grim mood of much of the industry following the 50 per cent fall in oil since last summer.With US production resilient in spite of the price collapse, and global demand growth anaemic, the market was unlikely to recover any time soon, Mr Tillerson suggested. Jack Williams, senior vice-president in charge of production operations, said that when Exxon looked at possible investments in US shale, it concentrated on scenarios with oil prices of $40 to $60 per barrel: close to today’s $52.Like other oil producers, Exxon is taking a hit to its profits. Its earnings per share this year are forecast to be about half the $7.60 it made in 2014.Unlike many other producers, though, Exxon, the world’s largest energy group, is not at any risk of going bust or being taken over. It can use the downturn to put itself in a stronger position relative to competitors.The company’s resilience was on display on Tuesday, when it raised $8bn from a bond issue, increased from the $7bn originally marketed because of strong demand. The company is one of only three US groups with a triple A credit rating — higher than that of the federal government — and it can borrow very cheaply.It also went into the downturn with stronger cash generation than most rivals. Free cash flow came to $17.9bn in 2014, compared with Chevron’s $2.6bn, which included $5.7bn of disposal proceeds.As a result, Exxon is under much less pressure to cut spending than smaller exploration and production companies, which are coming under varying degrees of financial strain. Although Mr Tillerson likes to say that Exxon invests “through the cycle”, it does not entirely ignore market fluctuations. Capital spending is being cut by 12 per cent for 2015 compared with last year’s level, and Mr Tillerson acknowledged the company would be “tactically resequencing” some of its investment plans.However, the company has retained its target from last year of producing 4.3m barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2017.Exxon’s display of stability is striking when set alongside the 30 to 40 per cent capital spending reductions generally announced by small and midsized exploration and production companies.Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

Further readingBeing able to keep spending at rates that others cannot, as Mr Tillerson put it, “provides us a whole lot of different kinds of opportunities” in two main areas: cutting costs and acquiring assets.On costs, Exxon’s executives expect to be able to pay less for drilling rigs and other oilfield services, and also for materials such as steel. Oil prices above $100 per barrel increased activity and stoked cost inflation, squeezing the industry’s returns. Now that process is starting to go into reverse.“The organisation is only now beginning I think to test that broadly in terms of what are we going to be able to capture,” Mr Tillerson said. While some might be one-off savings, he added, and not available in a year’s time, it might also be possible to embed some cost reductions for longer periods.On acquisitions, Exxon’s possibilities are almost limitless, and potential sellers are already getting in touch. Valuations look more attractive to a buyer now than they did a year ago. Mr Tillerson’s comment that “there really is no limitation on what we might be interested in or considering” in terms of possible deals suggests he is prepared to be ambitious. He also talked about wanting to keep financial capacity in reserve for when the right opportunity came along.While a bid for BP is not impossible, most analysts think it unlikely because of the political sensitivities of such a deal and uncertainty about the UK group’s liabilities stemming from the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.Paul Sankey of Wolfe Research in a note on Wednesday suggested Exxon would be most interested in a US-focused midsized oil company, and identified what he called “key potential targets” including Hess, Continental Resources, Devon Energy, Apache and Anadarko Petroleum.Timing will be a concern. Exxon agreed to pay $41bn including debt for shale gas and oil producer XTO Energy in 2009, at a time when gas prices were roughly double what they are today, and Mr Tillerson will not want to make the same mistake twice. But a deal at the right price would be a way to boost growth, which has been a problem for Exxon for more than a decade.

Big operators are ending a longstanding “two weeks on, three weeks off” regime and have told crews to work longer offshore shifts after a collapse in crude prices.Trade unionists have warned they are ready to ballot on industrial action after companies including US-based groups Apache and Marathon, Talisman Sinopec and Canadian Natural Resources requested the move to a more demanding shift pattern.Operators have asked crews to sign up to a “three weeks on, three weeks off” or equal time rota, viewed in the industry as tougher than the regime in Norway but comparable with conditions in the Gulf of Mexico. The changes will save companies money as fewer staff are needed on platforms.Union officials warned several thousand jobs could be at risk after they were told at a meeting with Oil & Gas UK, the offshore industry body, that member companies may introduce the shift changes across the North Sea. It is thought that Royal Dutch Shell and France’s Total are among other operators looking at such a move.The cost-cutting comes as the energy industry grapples with what BP has warned could be the worst slump since the 1980s, with the impact on the North Sea’s ageing fields likely to be severe. Thousands of self-employed workers have already had their pay cut by up to 15 per cent— the average offshore wage was $94,000 in 2013, according to a survey by recruitment group Hays.Letters sent to employees, seen by the Financial Times, have outlined plans to make workers redundant as part of the changes. One letter, from Archer, the oilfield services group, sent to workers in the Forties field, Britain’s biggest and operated by Apache, warned that any employees who failed to agree to the changes, effective from April 1, “will immediately be considered at risk of redundancy”.Some letters make it clear that holidays must now be taken in the periods that employees are onshore. Annual pay could be increased, albeit at “revised rates”.CNR, which operates fields including Ninian and Murchison, has told staff in the past few days it is preparing to move to a “three weeks on, three weeks off” rota.EnQuest, the North Sea producer, has confirmed it is looking at a similar move. “The industry is facing up to the challenges of the current environment and pulling the levers it can to reduce costs. It’s a battle of the fittest and, unfortunately, the industry is starting from a very high cost base,” said Amjad Bseisu, its chief executive.Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

Further readingApache, which also operates the Beryl oilfield, said that while it would use fewer rigs and contractors, it would be “one of the more active drillers” in the North Sea. Marathon, which operates Brae, said it had told contractors it was moving to equal time rotas, arguing that this was “imperative” to lower costs.However, the RMT union’s Jake Molloy called any efficiency gains “economics of the madhouse”, saying employees were being asked to work an extra 28 days a year for no more pay, while the workforce would be cut by a fifth.Union officials said catering staff might soon join drillers and construction workers in the proposed changes, which could cover as many as 20,000 workers.Unite’s Tommy Campbell said safety could be compromised: “There’s no way anyone would expect to see a lorry driver working three weeks through, 12 hours a day without a break, or a doctor, or a nurse. So why do companies feel it’s safe to do so offshore? If there’s no solution to the dispute, the union will have no alternative but to ballot for industrial action.”The Offshore Contractors’ Association is due to hold talks next week with representatives from Unite and the GMB unions to try to resolve the dispute. It said suggestions of strike action were premature."

Nymex March West Texas Intermediate gained $1.95 to $53.17 a barrel.Brent has risen more than 35 per cent since hitting a recent low of $45.19 a barrel in mid-January.Apache on Thursday said that it would reduced its rig count from an average of 91 in the third quarter of 2014 to an estimated 27 rigs by the end of this month.It will also cut its fracking crews by 50 per cent, as well as delaying completions of some oil wells.The company’s announcement came after leading oil groups such as BP and Statoil cut spending plans for 2015. Total of France also said it would cut spending and exploration investment this year.The spending cut announcements have coincided with the sharp falls in overall rig count in the US, which has also provided support for the oil bulls.As of February 13, the oil rig count in North America has fallen almost 34 per cent, according to Baker Hughes.While Apache’s announcement helped push up prices, it also presented a dilemma in projecting future prices, said analysts.While the company expects North American onshore production to be flat this year, it emphasised the flexibility to come back quickly if prices rose or costs fell sufficiently.“This is generally what makes most people doubt that the latest rally can be sustained because, if so, all the expectations on falling US production in the second half are unlikely to materialise,” said analysts at consultants JBC Energy.Despite the fall in drilling activity and spending cut announcements, crude oil production and inventories continued to rise in the US, as witnessed in the data from the US Department of Energy.Citigroup said “the storm has not yet passed”, adding that, although the fall in US drilling rigs was set to continue, “the cuts so far help US supply to slow down only later this year”.According to data from the department’s Energy Information Administration midweek, output in the week to February 6 stood at 9.23m barrels a day, the highest level since the EIA started collating the data in 1983. Inventories stood at 417.9m barrels, the highest weekly number on record.
22;APA;Apache Corp;2014-12-15T17:22:29Z;Plunging oil prices weigh on US stocks;Apache sells stake in two natural gas projects in latest example of industry cost-cutting;Apache, a $21bn US oil and gas company, sold its stakes in a liquefied natural gas project in Canada and another in Australia, in the latest example of the toll the falling crude price has taken on small oil and gas companies.Apache sold the stakes to Woodside Petroleum for $2.75bn, and said it would get back about $1bn from its investments in the project between June 30 and the completion of the sale.“We look forward to the redeployment of the proceeds from this sale, which may be used to reduce debt, repurchase shares and to pursue other opportunities that enhance our asset base and drive profitable production growth,” said Steven Farris, Apache’s chief executive.Small US oil and gas companies’ shares have been slammed over the past year due to the severe drop in oil prices. Apache’s shares have fallen 45 per cent since late July.Larger companies have not been exempt from the price slide. Shares in Exxon have slipped 15 per cent in the past six months, while Chevron has fallen 21 per cent and ConocoPhillips dipped 26 per cent in the same period.The price of brent crude fell 2 per cent on Monday, despite news that Libya shut down two of its oil terminals. Brent crude has now fallen 45 per cent, or $50.35, over the past year.Talisman Energy, a Canadian oil and gas company, on Monday confirmed the FT’s report that Spanish company Repsol is in talks to acquire it, sending its shares sharply higher.The Calgary-based company said: “Talisman confirms that it is engaged in discussions with Repsol regarding a potential corporate transaction . . . There can be no assurances that these discussions will result in a transaction or on what terms.”Shares in Talisman rose 19 per cent to $5.12 on the confirmation.Ford shares fell on Monday as the Detroit, Michigan-based automaker was downgraded by Deutsche Bank in a note. Deutche Bank lowered Ford from a buy to a hold due to the “significant challenges” facing US automakers, wrote analyst Rod Lache.“We believe that US vehicle affordability is reaching an inflection point,” Mr Lache wrote.Ford has invested heavily in revamping its product line this year, particularly for a new aluminium-bodied version of its flagship F150 pick-up truck, which was North America’s bestselling vehicle for more than three decades and is thought to account for as much as 90 per cent of the company’s profits.Deutsche Bank questioned whether consumers would pay higher prices for Ford’s newest F150 model, which incorporates “a number of advanced but costly” technologies, because the price of gasoline hovers between $2 and $3 per gallon.Ford’s shares fell 5 per cent to $14.28, and are down 7 per cent this year on lower than expected profits and a bumpy restructuring in Europe.Overall, US equity markets declined on Monday, after the benchmark S&P 500 saw its biggest weekly drop in two-and-half years last week.The S&P 500 was down 0.6 per cent to 1,989.63, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.6 per cent to 17,180.84. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 1 per cent to 4,605.16.
23;APA;Apache Corp;2014-12-09T18:08:39Z;US shale industry faces endurance test after Opec rejects cuts;Cartel’s refusal to cut oil output turns screw on US crude producers;"When Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries last month rejected calls for a production cut by Opec, the oil cartel, they put the responsibility for stabilising plummeting crude prices on to the US shale industry. Suhail al-Mazroui, energy minister for the United Arab Emirates, said US shale companies and other producers who had created an oil glut should “respect the needs of the market”. Less diplomatically, Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, one of the leading shale oil producers, said Opec had “declared war” on the US industry.Two weeks on from that Opec decision — and against a backdrop of a 40 per cent fall in the oil price since June — evidence of its negative impact on US producers is starting to emerge.Rather than a war, the US shale industry is braced for a test of endurance. As the pressure on oil producers mounts, weak companies face the threat of dwindling investment, faltering production, forced asset sales and possible bankruptcy.The successful companies will be the ones that both entered the downturn in the strongest position and are most effective at improving their efficiency. They can hope to make it through to better days when the oil price recovers and are also likely to be able to pick up some undervalued assets.On Monday ConocoPhillips, the US’s largest exploration and production company, unveiled plans to cut its capital spending by about 20 per cent next year to $13.5bn — a steeper reduction than analysts had expected — and said it would defer drilling programmes in several North American shale areas.Last Friday Baker Hughes, the energy services group due to be bought by rival Halliburton, published data which showed the number of rigs drilling for oil in the Eagle Ford shale of south Texas had fallen by 16 since October to 190. The number of rigs in the Bakken shale and related North Dakota formations had meanwhile dropped by 10 to 188.Also last week Drillinginfo, a consultancy, published figures showing that the number of new permits to drill wells had fallen by about 30 per cent in both the Bakken and the Eagle Ford areas last month compared with October. That may overstate the likely drop in activity, because companies will have a backlog of permits they can use, but it is clear the industry is responding to a steep drop in the oil price.Allen Gilmer, Drillinginfo’s chief executive, said: “Because production from shale wells comes on fast and drops off fast, their economics are more exposed to short-term prices.” This applies more than for other types of oil production, where projects can take many years to come on stream, activity and output from shale can be stepped up and down quickly.New extraction techniques and high oil prices boost US oil productionWhile all shale companies are under pressure, their responses to the declining oil price will often be different. The companies vary widely in terms of debt levels, financing, hedging against price falls, product mix, location and quality of their assets and operational efficiency, and those differences have been reflected in share price movements over the past six months.One important issue for companies is their gas production. From 2010 until this summer, many US shale companies were shifting away from natural gas and towards more lucrative oil production.But now gas is back in favour. It has fallen less than oil and is likely to rebound if there is a cold winter in the US. As a result, the shares of gas-focused companies such as Cabot Oil and Gas have often been less affected than their more oil-focused peers.Another critical factor is debt. The shale surge has been built by borrowing: companies have typically spent more on drilling and completing wells than they have generated in cash flows and over the past decade about $163bn worth of high-yield debt has been issued by US oil and gas producers. Some have relied much more heavily on debt than others, however.If US crude were to average about $70 per barrel next year, EOG Resources and Anadarko Petroleum would have debts roughly equal to a year’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation — a very comfortable level, according to analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt, the investment bank. Other larger companies including Marathon Oil, Apache, Devon Energy and Chesapeake Energy also have debt burdens that seem manageable.At the other end of the scale, companies such as Laredo Petroleum, SandRidge Energy and Range Resources would have debts about four times their ebitda, according to Tudor Pickering, while for Ultra Petroleum, Exco Resources, Goodrich Petroleum and Halcon Resources the multiple would be even higher.Beyond the financial metrics, the quality of a company’s assets is also important. Some of the companies that are focused on the Bakken shale, including Continental Resources and Whiting Petroleum, have been out of favour with investors, but the early evidence from rig activity and drilling permits is that there is no one “play” — as the different geological formations are known — that has been worse affected than any other.Latest news and comment on the global economic and political consequences of tumbling oil prices

Further readingMore than the broad region where a company operates, it can be the quality of its specific lease areas within the region that matters, according to Cody Rice of Wood Mackenzie, another consultancy. In an area such as the Eagle Ford, companies in the core where the rocks are most productive can continue to thrive, he says, “but if you’re underperforming your peers, and you’re not in the core of the play, it’s not going to be so good for you”.The other crucial variable is operational performance. Reid Morrison, the advisory leader for US energy at PwC, the accounting firm, says that up until this summer there was very little focus on efficiency in the shale industry. When he tried to advise on cost savings, “the reaction we were getting was: ‘We agree with that, but it’s not important right now’,” he says. “There was a lot of confidence that the new floor for the oil price was around $90 per barrel.” Now that view has changed completely: interest in ideas for cost savings is soaring.Market upheaval: Unwelcome newcomer is likely here to stayWhen Opec members talk about the US contribution to world “oversupply”, they are referring to the growth in US crude production of about 4m barrels per day, about 80 per cent, since 2008. US shale has caused an upheaval in oil markets, and many rival producers, in Russia as well as Opec, hope it will go away.The existence of a group of financially strong shale companies such as EOG Resources and Devon Energy, however, suggests that the US industry is not about to crumble. They have been covering their capital spending from cash flow generation, unlike many of their rivals, and have little debt. They may cut capex next year, but do not face pressure to make deep reductions.Any good US shale assets owned by companies that cannot afford to develop them are likely to be picked up by financially stronger groups. If these can drive down costs, helped by increased spare capacity in the energy services industry, the oil prices needed for development to be commercially attractive could be lower than previous estimates have suggested.Many investors will suffer losses on exposure to oil and gas if prices stay at current levels. But some analysts expect the overall impact on US oil production to be relatively modest.“The rate of increase in production is going to slow down,” says Philip Verleger, an energy economist. “Even at $50 oil, though, US production probably plateaus, but it doesn’t start going down.”"

26;APA;Apache Corp;2014-07-22T16:39:26Z;Apache Corp: acres and dollars;Activists want the energy explorer to give up some territory;Its namesake tribes might have sympathy: Apache Corporation is in a war over territory. Activist investors want the US oil and gas explorer to give up some of its land. On Monday, Jana Partners, a US hedge fund, demanded Apache sell off its international projects to improve shareholder returns.It is easy to see why Jana picked Apache. The shares have trailed the S&P US Energy index by 52 percentage points over three years. Apache has acquired increasingly large international projects over the past 12 years, including BP’s Forties field in the UK North Sea in 2003. Apache’s stakes in two liquid natural gas projects in Australia (Wheatstone) and Canada (Kitimat) may have pushed shareholders too far. LNG projects have decade-long gestation periods before profits appear. Return on invested capital collapsed to 5 per cent last year, from 17 per cent in 2005. So the activist cavalry trumpets for change.Apache’s management has done some trimming. Recent investor presentations hint that the company may sell all or part of Wheatstone and Kitimat. The shares have responded, up a fifth year to date. The annual savings if Wheatstone was sold would be $1.4bn, according to Deutsche Bank, the equivalent of last year’s cash flow deficit. A good start. Apache could do more. Its remaining Australian holdings, at $3.2bn, are worth more than Wheatstone, according to Wood Mackenzie.Apache’s valuation, at five times cash flow (adjusted for debt), is low relative to its peers with international portfolios. A premium valuation – say seven times – would also require better production growth. That should come from North American onshore assets, which provide almost two-thirds of oil and gas production.Financial wars are won with dollars, not acres. Apache should keep surrendering territory.Tweet the Lex team @FTLex or email on lex@ft.com
27;APA;Apache Corp;2014-06-08T07:58:58Z;Shale boom brings its own set of challenges;As the aftershocks of an energy revolution reverberate, the sector is rethinking everything from transport to markets;In one of his characteristically compelling turns of phrase, Bill Clinton said: “So far, every single person that’s bet against America has lost money.”The best recent evidence for the truth of the former president’s 2012 proposition to the Democratic National Convention has been in the energy industry. Ten years ago, the US seemed condemned to inexorably rising imports of both oil and gas.Since the shale production boom took off, the US has switched from worrying about imports of liquefied natural gas to planning its first exports, while in oil it is looking at the prospect of possibly regaining the previous all-time peak in production that it reached in 1970.For the businesses and governments of North America, the boom has created a fresh set of challenges for areas such as oil and gas transport, investment decisions and environment policy. The tensions that accompany success are generally preferable to the problems of failure, but they are real nonetheless.Rising US production has caused a sort of cosmic upheaval in North American energy. Before, the US was the dying star round which its smaller neighbours to the north and south would orbit, as their resources were sucked in by its gravitational pull. But not any more.Before the shale revolution, it was clear for oil and gas producers in both resource-rich Canada and middle-income Mexico that their principal focus had to be on supplying the needs of consumers in the US, the world’s largest energy market.Now they are realising that the US will not necessarily be prepared to buy as much as they are wish to sell.Oil and gas producers are now being forced to seek out new markets, both among domestic buyers and customers around the world. Indeed, both countries are becoming increasingly large importers of gas from the US.An entire trading system is being turned on its head. Across North America, producers and consumers of energy alike are fixated on issues of oil and gas transport.The US shale boom and growing production in the oil sands of western Canada have reconfigured the demand for pipelines and other infrastructure. Regions such as the Bakken shale of western North Dakota, which had very little oil production, have become important producing centres.A surge in gas prices in the north-eastern US during the cold weather at the start of the year was a reminder that, large as the shale gas resources of the US might be, they are not much use if they cannot be delivered to customers when they are needed.The announcement in the first week of June from TransCanada, the pipeline company, that it intended to invest C$1.9bn ($1.73bn) in a project to help supply gas to the proposed Kitimat LNG plant planned by Chevron and Apache for the west coast of Canada, was a reminder of the great opportunities that exist in building the infrastructure that will be needed.For Canada, though, the transport problem is compounded by politics.The Keystone XL project to bring diluted bitumen from the oil sands of Alberta to Nebraska, where it can connect with other pipelines in the US network, has been delayed for more than half a decade by a battle between the industry and environmental campaigners. Reluctant to offend either side, the Obama administration has repeatedly deferred the decision it needs to make on whether the project should be allowed to go ahead. As both sides of the argument admit, Keystone XL is of largely symbolic value. If it continues to be blocked, a big proportion – perhaps all – of the oil it would have carried will move in rail tanker cars instead.The US state department’s report on the project’s environmental impact concluded that greenhouse gas emissions – the focus of green campaigners’ concerns – would actually be higher if the pipeline were rejected and the oil went by rail, and the risk of accidents would probably be higher.Even so, the combatants are now so deeply dug in over Keystone XL that retreat for either side seems impossible.The continuing rapid growth in oil trains is causing safety concerns in both the US and Canada after a series of accidents.For oil and gas companies, the possibilities of shale are still attracting high rates of investment, as many companies reshape their portfolios to increase their weighting in the US.Marathon Oil, for example, said on June 2 it was selling its assets in the Norwegian North Sea for $2.1bn, to redeploy the capital where it would earn higher returns: in US shale.The attractions of the US also raise questions about other investments in North America. Total of France said late last month it planned to shelve its $10bn Joslyn oil sands mining project in Canada because the costs were too high.It comes as the oil sands industry is reflecting on what the implications of increased competition from US production might be.The Mexican government is having to make similar calculations, as it decides the terms for foreign energy investment.There is great interest from the global industry in the possibilities being opened up by Mexico’s energy reforms, but companies say the details need to be right before they can commit themselves.Meanwhile, as Michael Levi of the Council on Foreign Relations points out, there have been two energy revolutions in the US in the past 10 years. As well as the shale boom, there has been rapid growth in the production of energy from renewable sources.The announcement last week by President Barack Obama of plans to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants build on a series of subsidies and regulations that have been pushing in the same direction: towards decreased use of coal and a greater role for renewables.The US administration’s policies, which have been broadly supportive of both shale development and renewable energy, now face a pair of critical challenges.In oil, the boom in production of US light sweet (low-sulphur) crude from shale is creating a mismatch with refining capacity that in recent years has increasingly been configured to take heavy and sour (high-sulphur) crudes.The obvious solution would be to relax the tight restrictions imposed on crude oil exports, to allow overseas sales of light sweet oil, while the US still imports heavy and sour blends. Political pressure to keep American oil at home to benefit American consumers might stymie such a move, however, potentially leading to a glut of light sweet oil and falling prices, in turn hitting production.An unrelated but similarly trade-related issue has cropped up in solar power where, following a complaint from a German-owned company called SolarWorld, the US commerce department has said it plans to impose duties of up to 35.2 per cent on solar panels imported from China. Cheap Chinese panels have helped solar power become competitive with fossil fuels in some parts of the US, and if duties push prices up then its competitive position will be damaged.Above all, while confidence in the outlook for the US is generally high, no one can be certain how shale production will evolve.The US Energy Information Administration expects the country’s oil production to rise to a peak in 2020, and then begin to fall off, albeit slowly. In all the decisions they take, governments and businesses alike need to be alive to that uncertainty.
28;APA;Apache Corp;2014-06-02T16:45:26Z;Marathon Oil: in the long run;Shale oil, not natural gas, may be the US oil company’s motivation;Sell mature fields all over the globe and buy growing US shale. Marathon Oil is following a familiar pattern as it returns to its roots (it was founded in Ohio in 1887). On Monday the company announced the sale of its Norwegian assets to Det Norske for $2.7bn, including debt. The sale is the culmination of a $6.2bn divestiture plan Marathon has undertaken since splitting off its refining operations in 2011. With the deal complete, two-thirds of Marathon’s oil and gas production will come from North America. The company also has a string of exploration projects from Gabon to Kenya to Iraqi Kurdistan.Marathon will use the proceeds from the Norwegian deal – and from its recent disposal in Angola – to accelerate production in the Eagle Ford and Bakken shale fields, where forecasted production growth is a strapping, all-American 30 per cent this year.Marathon is also using part of the proceeds for a $2.5bn share repurchase programme – further underlining its appeal to growth investors by increasing earnings leverage.Is betting on US shale “best in the long run”, to quote Marathon’s 1930s slogan? For big oil, buying into shale fields has not always translated into turning a profit. Marathon is helped by many of its shale assets being “liquid-rich”. They produce oil and natural gas liquids, rather than only natural gas, which is languishing at $4.6 per million btu, well below pre-crisis peaks.So far the market has not been excited at Marathon’s strides into US shale. Marathon is cheaper than peers such as Apache and Hess in terms of valuation relative to debt-adjusted cash flow, according to UBS. After several years of strong performance, its shares have barely kept pace with the S&P this year. With net debt at a $4.5bn, roughly half this year’s expected ebitda, Marathon still has room to double-down on its best performing assets.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

30;APA;Apache Corp;2014-03-24T18:40:21Z;Delaware judge calls for end to ‘deluge’ of activist votes;;Activist hedge funds and institutional investors have never wielded so much influence on company boards but the trend is in danger of getting out of control, according to one of the most powerful legal arbiters of US corporate governance disputes.Leo Strine, chief justice in Delaware, whose courts have adjudicated many of the most hard-fought shareholder rights cases, has called for a rollback of shareholder powers to prevent a “deluge” of corporate governance votes that he says are distracting managements and costing companies a small fortune.The chief justice’s proposals, in an article in the latest issue of the Columbia Law Review, include limiting the frequency of say-on-pay votes and charging investors to submit proposals to a company’s annual shareholder meeting.Without such curbs, Mr Strine says, investors could “turn the corporate governance process into a constant ‘Model United Nations’ where managers are repeatedly distracted by referenda on a variety of topics proposed by investors with trifling stakes”.Mr Strine was confirmed to lead Delaware’s Supreme Court earlier this year, significantly expanding his influence over US corporate governance.He was previously the outspoken head of Delaware’s chancery court, which oversees businesses incorporated in the state, home to nearly half of all US public companies, where he was known for his colourful courtroom asides and for his activist judgments.In the article, he expresses scepticism that the shifting balance of power between corporate boards and shareholders has been of benefit to the economy, and that the resulting rise in hedge funds’ activist campaigns will be in the long term interests of investors.In particular, he criticises the convention of having annual votes for directors and on a company’s compensation policies, both of which should be judged over longer periods, he argues.Institutional investors are being overwhelmed by the number of votes they are required to cast, he says, and are failing to give them proper attention.On several occasions last year, including at the Texan oil and gas explorer Apache Corporation, compensation policies that had not materially changed from the previous year suddenly attracted considerable opposition.Say-on-pay votes could be held every three or four years, says Mr Strine. Shareholders should also be charged a fee for submitting other proposals, just as politicians must pay a fee to stand for election, and banned from resubmitting losing proposals year after year.Institutional shareholders have demanded, and won, considerably more consultation on company strategy and corporate governance, and boards are increasingly engaging with both long-term investors and activist hedge funds that turn up on the shareholder register.But activist hedge funds should be made to reveal more about their positions and motives, Mr Strine says, and to make those disclosures more quickly. He cites Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square which, together with Vornado Realty Trust, was able to acquire 27 per cent of the retailer JC Penney before having to disclose its stake..
31;APA;Apache Corp;2013-08-30T05:18:47Z;Sinopec buys into Apache’s Egypt venture;;Sinopec is to spend $3.1bn on a 33 per cent stake in the Egyptian operations of Apache, the US exploration and production company, in the latest sign of Chinese companies’ higher tolerance for political risk in resource-rich countries.Apache announced late on Thursday that Sinopec, China’s second-largest oil group by market capitalisation, would be joining as a junior partner in its oilfields in Egypt’s Western Desert, subject to Egyptian government approval. Apache will remain operator of the fields and retain a 67 per cent stake.The fields are mostly located in remote areas, and production has not been disrupted by the political turmoil in the country since former president Hosni Mubarak was ousted in 2011 and even more recently with the military coup against President Mohamed Morsi in July. Their average gross production was about 363,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day last year.The business has also been highly profitable, generating $2.7bn in cash flow last year, with none of the problems of late payments that have hit some other western companies in Egypt. The fields’ capital investment requirement in 2012-13 is only $1.1bn per year.However, Apache has been concerned that investors’ perceptions of political risk in Egypt meant that the full value of the asset was not being reflected in its share price. The price paid by Sinopec values the Egyptian fields at about $10bn, roughly a third of Apache’s market capitalisation, even though they produce only about a quarter of the group’s oil and gas.Following the deal, the proportion of Apache’s production that comes from Egypt will drop to 15 per cent.Jon Wolff, an analyst at ISI Group, wrote in a note that he expected a “strong positive reaction” in Apache’s shares when the markets opened.The deal conforms to the pattern of Chinese investments in natural resources, which have accounted for more than half the value of international acquisitions from China since 2000.Chinese companies are sometimes tolerant of a higher level of political risk than western investors, as demonstrated by the interest shown by PetroChina, the country’s largest oil company, in acquiring a stake in the West Qurna 1 oilfield in Iraq.Sinopec also knows Egypt, having had another joint venture there with Tharwa Petroleum, a local company, since 2005.Apache is unlikely to repatriate the proceeds from the sale to the US, which would crystallise a large tax bill. Instead, the company said it planned to use the cash to pay down debt and maintain its credit ratings, which have been under pressure following a $15bn acquisition spree in 2010-12.The sale will also help Apache fund investment in its onshore oilfields in the US. Apache is the most active driller in the Permian Basin region of west Texas, seen as the most promising new frontier for shale oil production in America.Steven Farris, Apache’s chief executive, told the Financial Times in June that the company planned to use its international operations principally to generate cash, while the focus for growth would be in the US.In the statement announcing the Sinopec deal, he said it would ensure that the Egypt business would continue to contribute to Apache’s growth and cash flow in the future.
32;APA;Apache Corp;2013-06-04T12:52:19Z;Apache bets on US oil boom;Texas and Oklahoma fields are core assets for growth;Apache, the US independent oil company, is pinning its hopes for growth on its onshore North American oilfields as it tries to sharpen its focus and cut its debts, its chief executive says.Steven Farris, Apache chief executive, told the Financial Times that Apache’s Texas and Oklahoma fields were “the growth core” of the company, with regions such as the UK North Sea and Egypt principally focused on cash generation.“We used to ask our US assets to stay even, and we’d grow internationally. And all we’re doing is flipping that,” he says. “We’re talking about having our international [operations] provide cash for our North American growth.”The strategy makes Apache the latest company to bet on the US onshore oil and gas boom, following precedents including Devon Energy, which sold its international and Gulf of Mexico businesses in 2010, and Hess, which is selling some of its international assets under pressure from shareholders.Occidental Petroleum is considering a spin-off or sale of its Middle East business to focus on its US operations.Apache spent about $15bn on acquisitions in 2010-12, buying assets from BP, ExxonMobil and Devon, and last year had a greater cash outflow from capital spending than its inflow from operations, meaning that its debts have climbed to reach a net $12.2bn at the end of March.Last month, Apache said it planned to raise at least $4bn from disposals, and use $2bn to pay down debt and use the rest for share buybacks.Mr Farris says: “We have a list of assets that is larger than $4bn that we would entertain offers on.”He highlights the North American onshore, the North Sea, Egypt, and Apache’s 13 per cent share of the Wheatstone liquefied natural gas project in Australia, as core assets for growth or cash generation. That leaves oilfields in the Gulf of Mexico and Argentina as among the most likely candidates for sale.One of the things that we have been able to almost patent is our exploitation prowess, and I can’t think of a better place in the world to do it than onshore North AmericaApache has had great success with its strategy of buying mature oilfields from larger companies and boosting their production. Its acquisition of the Forties field in the North Sea from BP in a $1.3bn deal in 2003 is legendary in the industry: Apache raised production from 40,000 barrels a day to a peak of 70,000 b/d, and benefited from soaring oil prices at the same time.Mr Farris says that while the company is no longer seeking acquisitions, it will be deploying the same techniques in mature regions of the US, such as the Permian Basin of West Texas.“One of the things that we have been able to almost patent is our exploitation prowess, and I can’t think of a better place in the world to do it than onshore North America,” he says.“Horizontal wells turn into a manufacturing business. And we are very good at cutting costs and increasing production.”Apache is now the second-largest producer in the Permian region, described by Mr Farris as “if it isn’t the hottest play on the planet, it’s one of the hottest plays on the planet”.Apache’s assets in Egypt are viewed with less enthusiasm by investors following the upheavals in that country, which have contributed to Apache’s relatively poor share price performance. While the S&P 500 has risen 18 per cent over the past five years, Apache’s shares have fallen 35 per cent.“I recognise that US investors are concerned about it [Egypt]. Europe and other parts of the world don’t have that level of concern, but we’re mostly a US-based company with US shareholders,” he says.However, Mr Farris says the Egyptian business still made an important contribution.“Egypt’s been a tremendous cash generator for us. We’ve had net cash flow of about a $1bn or $1.5bn a year out of Egypt.”The share price underperformance was reflected last month in Apache’s brush with the shareholder activism that has been hitting many companies in the energy industry.An advisory vote of investors went against the executive pay award, and the board responded swiftly with a cut in Mr Farris’s targeted pay for this year.“I’m embarrassed about it,” he says. “This isn’t about pay, it’s about being successful . . . And we’re going to try to do something about both: lower my pay and increase the performance.”
33;APA;Apache Corp;2013-06-03T22:55:38Z;Innovation: New gas deposits change trade flows;Demand is rising but very unevenly, Sylvia Pfeifer discovers;Halliburton, the US services group, has taken to YouTube to promote its recent innovation: the deployment of nearly 100 new light duty trucks across several of its field locations. What makes the trucks worthy of a video is the way they are powered: not by gasoline, but by compressed natural gas (CNG).The trucks come with bi-fuel tanks that are fully automated and run on CNG first and switch to gasoline when the gas tank is empty. They emit about 90 per cent less emissions and are expected to save Halliburton about $5,100 per truck in fuel costs every year. It is a pilot programme and the latest sign of how North America’s shale revolution is spreading.“Clean is good, domestic is good but the savings on a fuel is what make it happen,” intones T Boone Pickens, the Texan oil billionaire, in the video, headlined “The Right Fuel for Today”.Halliburton and T Boone Pickens are not alone in espousing the benefits of natural gas. Thanks to improvements in the techniques of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, North America’s energy landscape has changed as new supplies – of shale oil and gas – have been unlocked. The glut of gas has seen prices tumble, prompting utilities to switch from burning more expensive coal to gas to generate electricity.US industry is benefiting, with the petrochemicals sector, a big user of gas as feedstock, enjoying a revival. Gas is making inroads into other sectors such as transport, where companies from Warren Buffett’s railway, BNSF, to UPS and Royal Dutch Shell are substituting liquefied natural gas (LNG) or CNG for diesel. Others, such as Apache Corporation are using gas to power fracking equipment, one of the most energy-intensive processes employed by the industry.The US’s shale bonanza is transforming the global energy landscape. Last month, the Obama administration approved wider exports of LNG, raising the prospect that the US could become an energy supplier to the rest of the world. For its supporters, natural gas – cleaner burning than oil – looks set for a “golden age”.Yet the outlook for gas is not uniform. In Europe, where demand has slumped as a result of the recession, much investment into new infrastructure is on hold. In east Africa the discovery of conventional sources of gas off the coasts of Mozambique and Tanzania has sparked a scramble by the world’s largest energy groups and raised the prospect of significant exports of LNG to nations in Asia.Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy, estimates that commercially recoverable gas reserves increased from 4,700tr cubic feet to 7,800tr between 2007 and 2012. While the low prices in the US have prompted companies to slow drilling activities and focus on more oily resources, experts believe gas supplies will keep on rising.Gas resources continue “to be added”, says Noel Tomnay, head of global gas research, at Wood Mackenzie. “With the exploration budgets of companies growing, while they are not necessarily looking for gas, they will find it and the likelihood is therefore that the resource base for gas will keep expanding over the next few years.”Mike Bahorich, chief technology officer at Apache says: “The rate of return will drive activity. As gas prices go up a bit we will see a strong return to drilling.” He believes that the difference in price between gas and oil in the US “will last for a long time to come”.Apache has teamed up with Schlumberger and Halliburton to develop the increased use of gas in powering fracking equipment, which uses a lot of diesel. Potential cost savings go “straight to the bottom line”, says Mr Bahorich.The US shale revolution has driven investment in infrastructure such as pipelines. “There are a lot of opportunities [for investment] on the infrastructure side, and on the midstream side in companies that consume the gas to make other products,” says Tim Day, managing director at First Reserve, the private equity and infrastructure investment firm.If North America’s shale revolution is firmly entrenched, the development of unconventional gas elsewhere is less clear and is expected to take time. Companies are exploring in Europe, China and South America. The industry struggles to replicate the unique set of circumstances that enabled the North American revolution, such as a benign regulatory environment, an existing oil and gas infrastructure and greater incentives as landowners own the mineral rights themselves.An added problem for gas outside North America is coal, which is still much cheaper.In Europe, utilities have been burning coal instead of gas to generate electricity. Gas in Europe is generally sold on contracts linked to the oil price, which has remained relatively strong. Europe could see a big boost to gas supplies through potential shale gas developments at home and LNG exports from the US and Canada.“Demand for gas is rising but very unevenly,” says Eric Oudenot, principal in the energy practice at Boston Consulting Group.“In Europe, thanks to the recession and efforts to improve energy efficiency, demand has dropped for the second consecutive year,” he adds. “China and India are leading the way in terms of future demand for gas. There will be an increase in global gas production but a significant change in the trade flows and gas prices.”
34;APA;Apache Corp;2013-05-29T22:21:07Z;Oil rig built in Newcastle sets sail for North Sea;;"One of the biggest North Sea oil and gas platforms built in a UK yard for at least 25 years sailed out of the river Tyne on Wednesday, amid warnings that British companies are losing out on orders despite record North Sea investment.The topside structure, which is to be towed from the Tyne to the Forties Field, 110 miles off Aberdeen, is the final part of a £250m platform and link bridge completed by OGN, a manufacturer based in Wallsend, Newcastle.The contract, placed with OGN in 2010 by Apache Corporation, the US oil and gas exploration and production company, is an example of the revival of North Sea oil and gasfield activity in the past few years, supported by UK government tax allowances.This year, investment in UK offshore oil and gasfields is forecast to approach a record £14bn, outstripping the previous record of £11.5bn set in 2012. Overall, companies have just less than £100bn of capital investment in their business plans.Forties, one of the first North Sea oilfields when it was inaugurated by the Queen in 1975, was originally scheduled to start decommissioning in 2013 but its life has been extended by another 20 years.The Apache order provided work for 2,000 people at its peak at OGN’s Hadrian Yard, and supported a further estimated 5,000 jobs in the British supply chain. But most of the 2,000 have now gone; they are either working elsewhere or unemployed.Currently, OGN is building a smaller £50m so-called “jacket” for Talisman Sinopec for the North Sea, a contract that will employ 700 people at peak, but has an empty order book beyond February 2014.Contracts for more oil and gas structures for the UK continental shelf, awarded over the past three years, could have provided follow-on for OGN or work for other UK fabricators. Yet, to the frustration of its management team, which has spent £25m reopening and upgrading the previously mothballed 75-acre yard, all have gone overseas – even though UK tax concessions helped encourage the North Sea developments for which they are being fabricated. The contracts, with a total value of more than £10bn, would have supported more than 10,000 jobs.The issue, according to Dennis Clark, OGN chairman, is not one of UK fabricators’ competitiveness. “Nobody has proved that it’s better value for money to do this work overseas than in the UK,” he said.The problem, he believes, is partly financial incentives. “We don’t have cheap funding from our government which other countries have in the form of subsidy,” Mr Clark added.Also, he said, the UK government is restricted by European Union rules from taking steps to ensure UK-based companies are actively favoured.The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills confirmed yesterday: “Under EU law we are unable to require companies to award contracts to UK companies.” But, it stressed, it is important all operators allow “full and fair competition” for work.In its UK Oil and Gas Industrial Strategy, announced in March, the government emphasised its commitment to the UK supply chain, including fabricators. Mr Clark said the government can exert influence. “Behind the scenes they can rattle a few cages.”Michael Fallon, business and energy minister, said yesterday that the Apache platform had been built on the Tyne in record time, “proving without doubt that UK fabricators can compete with the world’s best”.He added: “This platform, part of a £400m project for the Forties field, is at the leading edge of a renaissance in the North Sea oil and gas industry.“The government is working hard with producers and British business to ensure they fully benefit from this resurgence in investment.”"
35;APA;Apache Corp;2013-05-14T23:03:27Z;Argentina: Would-be partners worry about the risk of shale;A US-style boom has not happened, reports Jude Webber;No one doubts the attractiveness of Argentina’s shale oil and gas prospects, particularly its vast Vaca Muerta (Dead Cow) formation, but unlike Eagle Ford in the US, which has rocketed from near-zero production to one of the world’s top producing formations in five years, there has been no rush into Argentina to mimic the US shale boom.Few countries need to crank up domestic oil and gas production more than Argentina. Its energy import bill, with its reliance on imported liquefied natural gas, was about $9.5bn in 2012 and is expected to leap to $13bn-$15bn this year.The sad reality, however, is that the game does not yet seem worth the candle for many would-be investors. Argentina is a country of regulated hydrocarbons prices, stubbornly high inflation, foreign exchange controls, unpredictable economic policy and a welter of requirements for businesses to buy locally and plough profits back into production.Nonetheless, state oil company YPF says its shale project is already “100 per cent launched”, with four times as many rigs drilling than six months ago. It also asserts that a planned joint venture with Chevron in Vaca Muerta will be in operation by midyear after a freezing of the US company’s Argentine assets stemming from a $19bn environmental judgment in Ecuador.More shale accords are in the offing, with US chemicals group Dow and Sino-Argentine energy company Bridas, for example, but others want to see YPF deliver on these projects before following suit.There have been some encouraging signs. The government of Cristina Fernández last year increased the price of new gas production to $7.5 per million British thermal units, more than triple the previous basic rate for production at existing wells. Yet, according to Chirag Sabunani, an analyst at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, shale gas still “isn’t economic even at $7.50 and shale oil isn’t economic at the $70 per barrel export price”.Moreover, Argentina’s stance still appears to be of the “bite the hand that feeds you” variety. Its expropriation of 51 per cent of YPF from Spain’s Repsol without compensation last year sent shockwaves through the sector.“Argentina needs the big companies that have strong balance sheets to develop this [shale] because it isn’t going to be cheap,” Mr Sabunani says.Companies such as Apache, ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Wintershall, Total and Americas Petrogas have Vaca Muerta interests but are showing no sign of rushing to large scale development. “They could happily sit on this acreage for years, just continuing to invest the minimum levels needed to maintain their contracts and keep other stakeholders satisfied,” Mr Sabunani says.“There’s no doubt of the potential there,” comments Laura Atkins, head of upstream research at consultants Hart Energy. Given the quality of its geology, Vaca Muerta could replicate the US shale success.Some observers in US oil services have suggested that Argentina might not drill 1,000 wells until 2020, which would be a drop in the ocean compared to the thousands needed, Ms Atkins adds.“A bad government doesn’t stop oil companies from doing business,” she says. “Companies always prefer to work in countries with stable, transparent governments although there are many bad governments – in Africa, for example – where companies are drilling wells. Much depends on whether they can negotiate good concession terms from the government.”Such an outcome seems elusive. Despite optimism from YPF that its Chevron alliance will be sealed soon, doubts linger about how fast the Vaca Muerta project can proceed.Even if Chevron this year makes a $600m investment expected by YPF as part of a $1bn shale pilot project, that probably equates only to 50 or 60 wells, says Ivan Cima, head of Latin America upstream research at Wood Mackenzie.Repsol, meanwhile, is not only suing Argentina for $10.5bn compensation over the YPF expropriation. It has also threatened legal action against any other companies that help YPF develop the shale resources it says it discovered. A hoped-for deal with Repsol to bury the hatchet has so far failed to materialise.Melissa Stark, a consultant at Accenture, which has studied shale prospects in Argentina, China, Poland and South Africa, says regulatory and technical problems have to be worked out, too, such as how to share scarce water resources with farmers. Yet she still ranks Argentina as the top shale play studied, with excellent geology and an existing oil and gas industry: “I have a hard time believing …[Vaca Muerta] will not get developed.”

37;APA;Apache Corp;2013-03-12T19:31:03Z;Chevron explores first Canada gas exports;Project to open new route for North American gas to Asia;Chevron is in talks with potential buyers for Canada’s first exports of liquefied natural gas, paving the way for a $15bn project that would open up a new route for North American gas to Asia.The planned Kitimat LNG plant on Canada’s west coast would export shale gas from fields in British Columbia that hold an estimated 50tn cubic feet of gas: enough to meet China’s entire 2012 gas demand 10 times over.However, Chevron, the second-largest US oil company by market capitalisation, is determined to sell the gas on the traditional basis of long-term contracts linked to the price of oil, which is much higher than the price of natural gas.Japanese buyers have been taking advantage of the prospect of cheap supplies of North American shale gas to negotiate prices for LNG contracts linked to the US Henry Hub benchmark. At about $3.60 per million British thermal units, Henry Hub gas in Louisiana is roughly a quarter of the price of LNG cargoes landed in Japan.John Watson, Chevron’s chief executive, argued at a presentation for analysts in New York that exports from the US would not necessarily be able to undercut exports from Kitimat, once the extra costs on top of the US gas price were taken into account.“There’s a big difference between natural gas produced in the United States and natural gas being delivered in Japan, Korea, or other consuming nations,” he said.“It’s going to take very significant gas prices, because of what it costs to liquefy it, transport it, regasify it and then distribute it.”He added that other competing LNG export projects planned around the world might not go ahead, whether because of objections in the US to LNG exports, or other problems such as the lack of a petroleum laws in east Africa.The Kitimat project is a 50/50 joint venture with Apache, the US independent oil and gas group. Chevron bought into the project in December, when Apache’s previous partners EOG Resources and Encana sold out.The project has already secured most of the approvals it needs, including a 20-year export licence from the Canadian government, and permits to build a pipeline to connect the gasfields up to the liquefaction plant on the coast.Chevron aims to sign contracts to sell about 60-70 per cent of the gas to give it the confidence to go ahead with a final investment decision.The plant is planned to have capacity to produce 10m tonnes of LNG per year, putting it on a par with the $29bn Wheatstone project in Western Australia, which will have initial capacity of 8.9m tonnes per year.
38;APA;Apache Corp;2012-11-21T19:52:00Z;Start-ups seek the smart roubles;Establishing a successful innovation economy in Russia will require fresh thinking on investment;"In 2002, Russian computer programmer Igor Sysoev began to work on a new program “as a hobby” in his spare time while working for a Moscow-based search engine.More than a decade later, the web-hosting software he designed is the second most popular on the internet – customers include Facebook, Netflix and Groupon.Last year, with the help of a $3m investment from a group of venture capital firms, he started a company known as Nginx (pronounced “engine x”) and moved into a swanky suite of offices in Moscow’s Prechistinka neighbourhood.From there, he and 12 employees plan how to wrest global market from Apache, the dominant web hosting software, and – more importantly – how to make money from their open source product. “We have 60 per cent of the Russian market but no one pays,” says Andrei Alexeev, head of business development.Nginx is a new species of company. Despite a few big success stories in the internet market such as Yandex and Mail.ru, the latest cohort of young Russian internet companies is struggling to grow.While Russia’s government has made an “innovation economy” an important goal, Mr Sysoev says that it is the private sector, rather than the government, that is vital if the industry is to grow.The key to getting more start-ups in Russia, Mr Alexeev says, is to get more investors. The right investors, he emphasises. Private venture capital firms are comparatively rare in Russia, which is why most Russian start-ups go overseas.“The most successful and active of our [entrepreneurs] go to work over there [abroad] because there are so few funds that will work normally with you,” he says.By “normally” he means funds that will not demand an extortionately high chunk of equity in exchange for modest finance. After much shopping around, Nginx found a consortium of American VCs that offered a “typical for Silicon Valley” deal for $3m initial investment – he will not reveal the size of the stake but experts estimate it to be about 30 per cent.A number of other Moscow start-ups, Mr Alexeev says, have not been so lucky, falling prey to a buyers’ market with power to extort large shareholdings in exchange for initial capital.“I don’t know what the wisdom is of leaving the founder with only 20 per cent of the company,” he says, speaking of some deals that he has knowledge of but will not name.● The number of funding deals in the Russian internet market more than tripled from 59 in 2010 to 215 in 2011.● Total investment into new internet companies and start-ups more than doubled from $220m in 2010 to $550m in 2011.● Fastlane Ventures estimates that there could be an equivalent number of undisclosed investments. With these transactions the total investment volume in Russian internet companies and start-ups could be approximately $500m in 2010 and $1bn in 2011.● The number of companies receiving seed funding grew fourfold from 22 in 2010 to 91 in 2011.● The total value of seed investment grew from $8.7m in 2010 to $14.1m in 2011.● The average seed deal value fell by 58 per cent from $400,000 in 2010 to $166,000 in 2011.● Sixty one start-ups received more than $20m in the form of grants in 2010 and 2011. Before 2010 the number was close to zero.

Research by Fastlane Ventures“Finding money for Russian venture firms is no longer a problem,” says Serguei Beloussov, head of Runa Capital, one of the three VCs that took the stake in Nginx. Runa, for example, set out to raise $15m a little over a year ago but last summer was able to announce that it already had $135m. “Tech companies need smart money and smart money is still in relatively short supply.”VCs typically take an initial stake in a high-risk venture, then help it navigate the markets towards a “big exit” such as a sale or initial public offering. A VC will help a start-up to hire executives, plan successive rounds of finance, and market itself to customers and investors. Mr Sysoev says Nginx, for example, is still learning how to “monetise” open source software through technical service agreements.The signs of a boom in Russia’s high tech sector are everywhere; good engineers are in short supply because start-ups are all the rage. “It used to be you would go into business and then after 10 years you’d start your own business,” says Stanislav Protassov, head of engineering at Parallels, a software company headed by Mr Beloussov. “Now it’s the opposite – you graduate, try a few start-ups, and if it doesn’t work out you go work for a corporation after a few years.”According to research by Fastlane Ventures, a Moscow-based incubator for internet ventures, the total value of high-tech deals more than doubled from $220m in 2010 to $550m in 2011. Among the big ones were Rakuten, a Japanese VC, which took a $100m stake in Russian online retailer Ozon.ru; Northwest’s $70m stake in Avito, an eBay-like website; and a $55m investment by Bessmer and Russia Partner in Kupivip, a shopping website.In May, Avito.ru, a Russian online classified site cofounded by two Swedes, raised $75m from local private equity firm Baring Vostok and global venture capitalists Accel Partners, alongside existing investors Kinnevik and Northzone.Pay-offs can be immense. In 1999, ru-Net, one of the pioneer tech investing firms in Russia, led a consortium that put $5m into a start-up venture known as Yandex, valuing the company at $15m. In May 2011, Yandex listed on Nasdaq with a value of $11.2bn.This makes Mr Beloussov optimistic. “Russia is the only country aside from the US and China that can
produce a tech company with a $10bn market cap today,” he says.The main obstacle to greater venture interest is not language or lack of prospects, he continues. Ironically, it is that Russian tech start-ups are too small. Most cannot absorb more than a few million dollars, and advising such a venture takes hours of staff time, with little immediate pay-off.The biggest Russian venture capitalists are no longer able to operate in Russia because “they can only write minimum $300m cheques, and there is no start-up here that can take that kind of money”, says Mr Beloussov.Such is the case with the largest Russian venture firm Digital Sky Technologies, which invested in Mail.ru and Vkontakte early in the game, and became a big investor in Facebook. “DST is now too big for Russia,” says Marina Treshchova, chief executive of Fastlane Ventures. “When they come back, we’ll know the Russian venture market has arrived.”Getting private capital involved is crucial says Alexander Galitsky, a prominent Russian venture capitalist. “Governments cannot do venture investing because governments invest taxpayers’ money and taxpayers’ money hates risk. And venture investing is the riskiest there is.”The government’s effort to jump- start a technology sector is focused on Skolkovo, a high-tech innovation hub located on the outskirts of Moscow, scheduled to open in 2013. It will offer grants, office space and support for visas for tech entrepreneurs.Mr Beloussov welcomes the Skolkovo project but says government money comes with too many strings attached. For comparison, he brings up the Yozma programme, which in 1992 successfully launched the venture industry in Israel. “I know it’s self-serving, but if we had bigger budgets we could help more companies,” he says."
39;APA;Apache Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Oil services companies: Closer working helps to plug the skills gap;Michael Kavanagh finds a sector of the industry is booming;As oil and gas gets more difficult and expensive to produce, there are almost imperceptible movements in the relationships between the owners of oil and gas assets and the services companies.These shifts, as subtle as the movements of the tectonic plates that play a key role in the production of these natural resources, are changing the way hydrocarbons come to market. As the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico illustrated, beyond the lead operator – in that case BP – of wells and platforms lies a supply chain of service companies, including the likes of Halliburton and Transocean and their subcontractors.But while Deepwater has led to disputes between BP, Halliburton and Transocean as to where fault for the disaster lay, traditional oil majors and national oil companies are increasingly letting services companies play a bigger role in deals that let both sides profit.In this arena oil services companies co-operate as much as they compete to win the favours of large oil companies.Schlumberger, the world’s leading oilfield services company, came together with Petrofac, the largest London-listed oil services supplier by market capitalisation, at the start of the year to offer a “one-stop shop for clients in emerging field development”. Both say the alliance is a way of pitching to “major resource holders” keen to further exploit reserves “against an industry environment characterised by a shortage of capability and capacity”.As Tim Weller, Petrofac’s chief financial officer, says: “Things are getting deeper, wetter, and colder.” This requires more contractor expertise. And while western oil majors are increasingly keen to sell on maturing fields to smaller independents, nationally owned companies are also keener than ever to compete globally to own and operate oil and gas assets.The result, says Mr Weller, is that an increasing number of oil and gas projects are being left in the hands of owners without the in-house experience to exploit them to the limit.An example of Petrofac and Schlumberger plugging a skills gap is a deal struck with Pemex, Mexico’s state oil monopoly, in June. They are being paid on a commission basis for production improvements in fields previously operated solely by their client.That deal followed Petrofac’s success in winning two of the first three private oil production contracts granted in more than 50 years by Pemex in August last year. The growing role played by oil service companies has helped to establish them as a growing constituency in the energy sector where their market capitalisations can often exceed those of their clients.Schlumberger, for example, enjoys a market capitalisation just less than BP’s, in excess of ConocoPhillips and well in excess of the next tier of US-listed oil producers such as Apache, Anadarko and Marathon. Companies in this tier compare in value with the likes of leading US oil services companies Baker Hughes and Halliburton.In the UK, too, Petrofac, Amec and John Wood Group, alongside oilfield pump supplier Weir Group, have emerged as FTSE 100 constituents whose value often exceeds those of mid-tier London-listed oil explorers and producers.And, while spluttering demand for fracking equipment in North America has damped a previously hot segment for some services companies, many have continued to outperform leading stock market indices handsomely in spite of some concern over softening oil prices.Mr Weller argues a shift in control over oil and gas assets away from so-called IOCs (western-owned independent oil companies) to NOCs (national oil companies) has left oil services companies well positioned to fill the skills gap created by sovereign states wishing to maintain formal control over their assets rather than simply hand them over to western oil majors.“In the past the NOCs had only one direction to go – the IOCs,” says Mr Weller. “The IOCs have to be able to take ownership of oil and gas reserves, but that is difficult and anathema to many countries as ceding ownership of reserves is not a popular thing.”At Amec, John Pearson, managing director of natural resources for Europe and west Africa, agrees this picture of countries keeping control of assets should benefit the sector. Meanwhile, a shift away from majors seeking to control all or most elements on projects, as well as selling maturing fields, should also strengthen the place of operators in the oil services marketplace.“Assets are being transferred to people with less record of running assets – whether NOCs or smaller independents – who may have less competency,” says Mr Pearson.Majors that used to dominate research and development and have large numbers of project management staff are now more willing to run “skinny teams” that bring the best suppliers together, he argues.Claudi Santiago, managing director and chief operating officer of First Reserve Corp, a private equity firm that invests in energy, agrees the sector’s tectonic plates continue to shift, but he says that their final destination is still unknown. “There’s been a huge transfer of expertise from IOCs to NOCs, and the oilfield service companies have played a key role in that. Over the next few years, we’re going to witness an interesting phenomenon. Will service companies help NOCs become totally independent? We will see.”
40;APA;Apache Corp;2012-10-07T23:04:56Z;North Sea: Calls for lower rates of tax to aid productivity;Michael Kavanagh finds some relief for infrastructure plans;The economic and political repercussions of mechanical failures on offshore rigs and platforms were well illustrated by the blowout at the Elgin installation, operated by Total of France, in the North Sea in March.In August, the UK’s Office of Budgetary Responsibility blamed the Elgin shutdown in large part for an unexpectedly sharp decline in North Sea output that had depressed UK tax receipts in July.No one was killed or injured in the emergency evacuation from the Elgin complex, 150 miles east of Aberdeen, which once accounted for nearly 10 per cent of UK gas output.The evaporation of 3,000 tonnes of gas condensate, and the escape of 3,000 tonnes of gas in a well blowout that took weeks to bring under control, has been matched by the evaporation of funds from Treasury coffers. Six months on, production has yet to restart at one the UK’s biggest gas producing platforms.If one clear message has emerged from the Elgin incident, it is that although UK oil and gas output from the maturing North Sea basin is well past its peak, the fiscal health of one of the world’s leading economies remains prone to the success or failure of its offshore industry.Fortunately there are signs that, while the UK sector of the North Sea remains in genteel decline, there is life in the old dog yet.Last month US group Apache Corporation began installation of a £400m extension of its Forties Alpha platform, aimed at extending the life of one of the UK’s most prolific fields, first developed by BP. Meanwhile, at the end of July, Premier Oil confirmed two orders worth £140m for oil platform components destined to be used in production at the Solan field west of Shetland. Both developments typify a two-pronged approach to eking out the remainder of the UK’s rapidly depleting oil and gas resources.While Premier is attempting to bring to shore one of the UK’s remaining unexploited resources in remote waters, much of Apache’s focus is aimed at extending and improving recovery rates at fields many thought would be abandoned by now.Apache’s decision to extend its Forties Alpha platform, installed its 1975 and designed to last 25 years, will be the most visible of a wave of further exploration and well drilling undertaken as part of a $3.5bn investment programme in the field since its acquisition in 2003.Apache aims to repeat this trick of sweating assets – developed by oil majors – at its Beryl field, which it bought through a $1.75bn purchase of oil and gas assets from ExxonMobil last SeptemberSuch large-scale investments in physical kit come despite warnings last year after a £2bn tax raid by the UK government on North Sea oil and gas operators– which raised marginal tax rates to between 62 and 81 per cent – created fiscal burden and uncertainty.Industry leaders argued such a move would undermine the confidence of operators in investing to ensure the UK’s remaining hydrocarbon resources were exploited to the maximum.Since then the chancellor has responded to lobbying from oil operators with the introduction of a range of tax allowances. While not reversing the increased rates of tax charged for many operators, they are aimed at reducing the tax bill for those attempting to access more difficult, remote, or smaller pockets of hydrocarbons that might otherwise be left in the ground.The latest move announced in September – to extend allowances to companies planning extensions to existing fields – signalled an “absolute determination to get more investment in the North Sea, a huge national asset”, according to George Osborne, the chancellor.Simon Lockett, chief executive of Premier Oil, says the North Sea remains an attractive arena to explore and develop projects, many of which can benefit from piggybacking on infrastructure developed decades ago. However, tax raids by the former Labour and current coalition governments have not been forgotten.According to Mr Lockett: “It’s possible to get more oil out of the North Sea that is taxed at a decent rate and create jobs for people so yards are getting work.”He adds: “What the government has done by putting in plans for certainty over abandonment liabilities, the introduction of small field allowances and brown field allowances, are a good package of incentives for the industry. But the problem is confidence – and people still remember when the government changed things negatively. People are looking for stable playing fields.”Graham Stewart, chief executive of Faroe Petroleum, which is drilling in both the Norwegian and UK sectors of the North Sea, agrees. He also argues the UK has still some way to go to creating the “feel-good factor” being enjoyed in Norway following several recent oil discoveries.“The UK has drilled a lot more, so what’s left in the UK is much more difficult [to reach],” he says. And attempts to repair the damage done to the sector’s confidence “through a patchwork quilt of [tax] allowances” has not been entirely successful.Nonetheless, the business confidence index from industry lobby Oil & Gas UK shows optimism at its highest since the survey began four years ago. The start of some large projects should see investment in the sector rise from £8.5bn in 2011 to £11.5bn this year.
41;APA;Apache Corp;2012-09-27T13:47:50Z;TNK-BP – price check;Hard to say what BP’s Russian stake could be worth;BP could be about to get lucky in Russia – for a change. A consortium of oligarchs is shaping up to buy out its 50 per cent stake in TNK-BP, their Russian joint venture. So is Rosneft, the state-controlled oil company. That amounts to a bidding war. Whoever buys the stake, the transaction will be the biggest in the oil and gas sector since the financial crisis. So what is TNK-BP worth?TNK-BP’s illiquid share price says BP’s stake is worth $22bn. In 2011, however, BP and Rosneft offered $32bn for the 50 per cent stake in the joint venture owned by the oligarchs’ AAR consortium. There were ulterior motives behind that offer, including BP’s desire to keep its proposed strategic relationship with Rosneft on track. AAR did not bite and, while the roles are now reversed, a benchmark has been set.Valuing oil companies is always finger-in-the-air (down-a-hole?) stuff. Best guesses are usually a mix of cash flow analysis and prices relative to reserves. Regarding the former, the venture has paid BP $19bn in dividends since its creation in 2003, including nearly $4bn last year. But 2011 was an exception. An annual dividend of $2bn looks more realistic during the next decade as the oil price fluctuates. Assuming no growth, a dividend discount model using an 8 per cent discount rate spews out a nice round $25bn.Meanwhile, BP’s share of TNK-BP’s proven reserves is about 4.5bn barrels of oil equivalent, or a quarter of the UK group’s total. BP has sold 5 per cent of its reserves (Apache and Plains Exploration) in the past two years for a combined $12.5bn. But a rule of thumb is that a barrel of Russian crude is worth half the value of a barrel of Gulf of Mexico crude for tax reasons and because much of Russia’s total production is priced for domestic consumption. That suggests $30bn for the stake. But, frankly, when doing business in Russia, who knows?Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
42;APA;Apache Corp;2012-09-11T21:45:11Z;YPF: of bonds and shale gas;;"Argentina’s nationalised energy company, YPF, faces its first hurdle in the eyes of domestic investors on Tuesday with the issue of three debt tranches designed to raise at least 1.35 billion pesos ($290m).The paper has 9-, 18- and 36-month maturities but the bulk of the offer, 1.2bn pesos, is in three-year bonds with a variable interest rate. That offer can be increased to 1.5bn, depending on demand.The issue – which YPF is confident will do well – is part of YPF’s fundraising efforts designed to finance its ambitious $37.2bn investment plan to boost production and develop vast Vaca Muerta shale reserves, and an international offer is expected to follow hot on the heels of the domestic issue, either later this year or early next.Why YPF needs the cash is clear: Argentina is sitting on what are believed to be the world’s third-biggest reserves of shale hydrocarbons, trapped deep underground in the bedrock. Vaca Muerta, or Dead Cow, is the best-known and most immediate of those projects, but there are others which point to Argentina’s long-term prospects as it starts to develop a shale industry to rival that of the US.Argentina has by far South America’s biggest shale reserves – some 77tn cubic metres (2,732 tn cubic feet) of gas in place of which 21.9tn cubic metres (774 tn cubic feet) is considered technically recoverable, according to the US Energy Information Administration.YPF and other international companies such as Chevron, Apache, EON and Americas Petrogas are exploring Vaca Muerta in the western Neuquina basin, but Los Molles, a deeper formation considered to have slightly less net gas in place but to have some richer sections than Vaca Muerta, is another nearby focus of interest.Further south are the Aguada Bandera formation and the D-129 formation in the San Jorge basin in Patagonia while further north is the Los Monos formation, part of the vast Chaco-Parana basin that spreads across much of Paraguay and parts of Bolivia, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil.The Los Monos formation – its name means monkeys – is perhaps the least talked-about of Argentina’s shale prospects and one of the least known, with the San Alfredo prospect appearing the most promising. There has been only scant drilling in the basin but oil services group Schlumberger said in a report last year that:The little information that is available indicates a shale matrix that has good characteristics for fracture stimulation.Schlumberger, which used EIA data for the report, said Los Monos could contain 59 tn cubic metres (2,083 tn cubic feet) of gas in place with 14.8 tn cubic metres (521 tn cubic feet) technically recoverable. That would make Los Monos a whopper capable – on paper at least – of boosting Argentina’s shale reserves by two-thirds.As well as seeking to tap capital markets, YPF is hunting for partners – a task made harder given the expropriation of the company from Repsol of Spain in May and heightened government regulation of the oil sector since then.By the end of this month, companies have to submit investment and production targets – and they can be thrown out by the government and, in the worst case scenario, concessions can be revoked. For now, companies seem to be limiting their investment, according to industry sources and this analyst, who is, nonetheless, upbeat about Argentina’s prospects in energy.So while a dead cow and some monkeys may hold the key to untold energy riches for energy-strapped Argentina, finding companies prepared to invest may be more of a struggle, at least in the short-term. YPF’s bond issue is the first step in what looks like being a long road.Related reading:

43;APA;Apache Corp;2012-09-02T15:46:19Z;Apache begins Forties field extension work;;Work has begun on the installation of a satellite extension to the main production platform serving the Forties field, aimed at extending the life of one of the UK’s most prolific oil discoveries. The £400m project by Apache Corporation is the latest investment made by the company based in Houston, Texas, following its acquisition of the declining Forties field from BP in 2003. The extension will sit adjacent to Forties Alpha, which since 1975 has served as the main production centre for four platforms installed in the field as the UK raced to exploit its oil wealth. Forties along with the Brent field were the cornerstone of the UK’s oil production, with the output from Forties peaking at above 500,000 barrels of oil a day three decades ago. The new satellite platform will initially boost output and then arrest the eventual decline of oil and gas production from a field that was once predicted to face exhaustion by 2000. The pile-driving on to the seabed for the 126m high 5,500 tonne base to the planned platform proceeds this month after its delivery last week from a construction yard at Wallsend on the River Tyne. Apache acquired the Forties field in a $1.3bn deal after production levels fell to 40,000 barrels of oil a day and was on a trend to drop to 10,000 by this year without any further investment to extend its working life. Since then, Apache has produced 180m barrels up to the end of 2011 from an asset that had notional remaining reserves of 144m when purchased from BP. Of this production total, Apache estimates half has resulted from a wave of further exploration and well drilling undertaken as part of a $3.5bn investment programme in the field. This has led to it boosting its proved reserves to 130m barrels by the beginning of the year. Apache extended its interests in the North Sea further last September through the $1.75bn purchase of oil and gas assets from ExxonMobil that raised its UK production and reserve levels by about half. These assets include the Beryl field, which was also first exploited in the 1970s.Jim House, managing director of Apache’s UK operations, said the latest project vindicates its initial investment in reviving the Forties. He added that attractive potential returns were still available from taking on interests from oil majors keen to reduce their exposure in the North Sea. But he said Apache’s strategy had relied on a willingness to invest in retrieving oil and gas that was “harder to get at, tucked away in more difficult spots”. The approach, he argued, provides a model for extending the lifespans of declining fields in the North Sea and ensuring the UK was “getting at all remaining oil”.It is also “pushing out to the right” the eventual decommissioning of platforms originally designed to last no longer than 25 years.

47;APA;Apache Corp;2012-07-10T18:18:36Z;Fairfield builds North Sea war-chest;;Fairfield Energy, the independent oil and gas company, said it would use $350m raised from private equity firm Riverstone Holdings to build up a war-chest for future acquisitions in the North Sea.Riverstone, which is focused on energy and power, agreed to inject $150m into Fairfield, with the option of adding another $200m to match future contributions from Fairfield’s current investors, led by Warburg Pincus, the US-based private equity group.Chris Wright, Fairfield’s chief executive, said the additional funds would be used to “bring in new assets and take advantage of the vibrant M&A atmosphere in the North Sea”.Under the deal, Lord John Browne, the former BP chief executive who is a partner at Riverstone, and Ralph Alexander, Riverstone’s managing director, will join Fairfield’s board as a non-executive directors.Fairfield was created in 2005 to acquire North Sea assets that were being shed by the majors and is one of a number of independents such as Enquest, Valiant and Premier that have built up large positions in the region over the past few years.The oil majors’ divestment programme has generated a steady stream of deals: last year, Exxon Mobil sold its Beryl field to Apache, while BP sold its gas fields in the southern part of the North Sea to Perenco in March. Fairfield acquired one of its largest assets, the Dunlin cluster of fields, in 2008 from Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon, Statoil and OMV, the Austrian oil group.“There’s a cadre now of companies who see genuine opportunities in the North Sea,” Mr Wright said. He said stronger oil prices and recent tax allowances announced by the UK government for certain field types had helped to make the area more attractive while the prevalence of smaller, undercapitalised companies there was creating options for farm-ins and other deals.Though the North Sea has been in decline for years, one estimate by industry consultancy Wood Mackenzie said there were 17.4bn barrels of oil equivalent yet to find and yet to be produced there.“Riverstone sees the North Sea at a very interesting stage in its evolution,” Mr Wright said.Mr Wright said the initial $150m would be used in part to drill wells at Dunlin and bring production there to 10,000 barrels a day.Fairfield is also planning to drill three appraisal wells this year at its Darwin field, together with its partner Taqa. In a statement, the company said it saw “significant opportunities in several plays and sub-basins in the North Sea” which require “major new investment to advance to full value”.
48;APA;Apache Corp;2012-05-07T18:05:44Z;Repsol warns rivals over investing in YPF;;Spain’s Repsol, stripped of a 51 per cent stake in Argentine oil company, YPF, by the government in Buenos Aires, has written to oil majors including Exxon, Chevron and ConcoPhillips warning it would sue if they try to invest in YPF or its assets.In letters sent on Monday and seen by the Financial Times, Repsol said it would take “actions and/or legal proceedings necessary to protect our investment … to prevent any improper interference or unfair competition by third parties seeking to take advantage of the current circumstances to directly or indirectly acquire interests in YPF assets in which we have an interest”.It said it could also sue companies which “profit at the expense [of Repsol]” or take any steps “prejudicing Repsol’s ability to fully defend and recover its rights”. The expropriation of YPF leaves Respol with a 6.4 per cent stake.Repsol, which has invested $300m in the huge Vaca Muerta shale reserves, has called the nationalisation “unconstitutional, discriminatory and unlawful”. It is writing to companies it had contacted before the expropriation about possible joint ventures in the area. “We are confident that we will count on your understanding and support,” it concluded.Cristina Fernández, the Argentine president, last Friday promulgated the nationalisation law, which had been approved in Congress by a wide majority. She appointed Miguel Galuccio as new YPF chief until shareholders meet on June 4 to elect a new board.The Argentine government needs deep-pocketed partners to help YPF develop what are considered the world’s third-largest shale reserves – oil and gas trapped deep in the earth’s bedrock that require costly, high-tech drilling to extract.The two senior government officials put in charge of YPF by decree on April 16 have sounded out Total of France, Petrobras of Brazil and US companies Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Apache Corp about partnering YPF, but there have been no announcements.YPF has advanced further than its rivals in developing shale in Argentina, but industry sources said some companies had been prepared to pay $10,000 to $12,000 an acre to join forces to develop Vaca Muerta.With its conventional oil fields ageing, Argentina’s best hope of regaining energy self-sufficiency is through shale. The government says it had to spend $9.4bn last year importing energy because of underinvestment and underproduction by Repsol.Repsol’s threat of legal action puts companies with an interest in shale in a tricky position because they need to keep on the right side of the government in Argentina’s highly regulated energy industry.Repsol said earlier this year it had discovered 1.5bn barrels in contingent reserves it expected could be extracted – in Vaca Muerta, of which 1.2bn would be attibutable to YPF. Of that, 116m were classified as reserves, meaning the investment decision to develop them had been taken. In all, it said Vaca Muerta had total prospective reserves of more than 21bn barrels.With the lure of Vaca Muerta, Repsol had been in late-stage talks to sell its YPF stake to Sinopec of China before the expropriation. It was not immediately clear whether it had sent a letter to any Chinese company on Monday.
49;APA;Apache Corp;2012-04-24T16:49:30Z;Argentine rules hinder oil exploration;;Argentina has the geological conditions to be the world’s next big frontier for exploration of shale oil and gas. But even before last week’s nationalisation of YPF, the Spanish-owned oil company, which sent shockwaves through the industry and has put shale development in the Neuquén basin in western Argentina on hold, Argentina’s new import restrictions were threatening to strangle exploration.The government of Cristina Fernández has been tightening restrictions on imports in recent months to shore up a shrinking trade surplus by favouring local production. Since February, importers in all sectors have been required to obtain prior permission from the authorities, which can lead to delays or shortages.“The rig market in the Neuquén basin is fairly tight at the moment . . . There are currently a number of import hurdles that make it difficult for the industry to bring in tools and equipment,” said Michael Bose, country manager for Apache Corp in Argentina.Argentina spent $9.4bn importing fuel last year – a key reason cited by Ms Fernández for expropriating the bulk of Repsol’s shares in YPF and putting the group under state control – and has high hopes of the hydrocarbon prospects in the Vaca Muerta (Dead Cow) bedrock formation in Neuquén. YPF has announced a 1bn barrel discovery there and the US has signalled that the country could contain the world’s third-largest shale resources, behind the US and China.But rigs and other specialist equipment are in short supply in Neuquén, and companies also need to prepare for the shale revolution with training, according to Rubén Etcheverry, head of Neuquén’s provincial energy company, Oil & Gas of Neuquén, which partners with oil companies in some exploration areas.“When this production boom starts, we won’t have enough people or rigs and pumping equipment,” he said. “We are trying to develop [the conditions] so that equipment can come.”Mr Bose of Apache said: “It will be very difficult to develop Vaca Muerta or any other large project because of the lack of infrastructure – equipment and resources – required to support that kind of activity”.Big US oil services companies, including Halliburton and Schlumberger, have been active in Argentina for decades. Schlumberger, which has a contract with YPF for a range of services, operates the first fully dedicated shale completions crew in Latin America and has performed more than 100 treatments in Vaca Muerta.To try to overcome equipment and training bottlenecks, the province is organising a workshop next month to bring service companies with shale experience together to help foster alliances between local and multinational companies. It hopes thiswill help spur local production of equipment for the industry.The YPF nationalisation, expected to be approved in the Senate on Wednesday before passing to Argentina’s lower house of Congress, was the culmination of months of speculation and government pressure on YPF that, even before last week’s announcement, was spooking investors.Mr Etcheverry remains optimistic that shale will take off in earnest in Argentina within the next three to five years. “There is an urgent need for local reserve development and production growth in Argentina and the country has few alternatives but to ensure they are developed,” echoed Mr Bose.Though Argentina’s shale promise has attracted big oil companies including ExxonMobil, EOG Resources and Total, as well as junior players, it is YPF that has advanced the furthest in exploration.Overall, 83 unconventional wells were drilled in the province in 2011, and 120 are planned, said Mr Etcheverry. “From 2012, shale will represent more than 50 per cent of all exploration in Neuquén,” he said. The province has half of Argentina’s gas and a quarter of its oil reserves. It is the top gas-producing province and ranks second for oil.
50;APA;Apache Corp;2012-04-14T21:27:12Z;Argentina’s shale potential at risk;;"Any hostile moves on YPF, the Spanish-controlled oil company, by the pro-nationalisation government in Buenos Aires could have implications that go way beyond the companies and investors at the heart of this bitter tug-of-war.Why? Because Argentina is sitting on what geologists and energy experts widely agree is one of the world’s most attractive reserves of unconventional gas and oil – known as shale – which are trapped deep in the bedrock below ground.Shale is potentially a very big deal indeed. It turned the US from energy importer to exporter – something that Argentina, which spent $9bn importing fuel last year, ought to take note of.Argentina has about a third of the US shale reserves, but they are less deep (which makes them cheaper and easier to access), seams are two to three times thicker than in the US and, for now at least, Argentine shale is concentrated in the Vaca Muerta (Dead Cow) formation, rather than being spread out across the country.So all other things being equal, shale producers should be brushing up their Spanish and heading south. Several big players – including ExxonMobil, Total and Apache – and smaller companies already have. But it is YPF which has the biggest acreage, and it estimates that as much as $250bn will be needed to develop a viable shale industry over the next decade.No one’s pockets are that deep, so partnerships are the way to go. Except that regulatory concerns are raising red flags before investors’ eyes now.YPF has been publicly criticised, stripped of a string of concessions after being accused of underinvestment and now the government is analysing how to give the Argentine state a bigger role in the company – something that, according to some proposals circulating in the government, could translate into the expropriation of as much as 50.01 per cent of the company.YPF is currently controlled by Repsol of Spain, which has 57.43 per cent, and 25.46 per cent is in the hands of the Eskenazi family’s Petersen Group. Just over 17 per cent is traded on stock markets.So enthusiasm among potential new players in the shale sector – where some were prepared to invest as much as $10,000 to $12,000 per hectare, according to industry sources – is screeching to a halt. “This is damaging shale (prospects), of course,” Alieto Guadagni, a former energy secretary, told beyondbrics.The government has been berating YPF for what it perceives as a failure to invest enough, yet the concerns its nationalisation dream are raising risks reducing investor appetite – which is perverse. And if concerns over contracts were not enough to dampen investors’ spirits, the prospect of partnering with a state that likes fast results and dislikes repatriation of dividends may give pause for thought.What is worse is that the shale prospects represent energy that Argentina badly needs. Underinvestment in the sector, analysts and industry players say, is the direct result of a regulatory regime that keeps prices in Argentina well below the international market.As Guadagni put it, Argentina pays domestic gas producers some $2.8 per million British Thermal Units, yet shells out some $11 per million BTU for gas from Bolivia (produced, ironically, by Repsol YPF), and some $17 for liquefied natural gas to plug its huge energy deficit.Meanwhile, the cost to Argentines for their domestic gas is about 50 US cents per million BTU of gas, and drivers of vehicles that run on compressed natural gas pay around $1.“The big question is whether these plans for YPF will improve or worsen Argentina’s prospects for recovering its energy self-sufficiency,” Guadagni said.Argentina had a $3bn energy surplus in 2006. This year, Guadagni reckons the deficit will be $6bn to $7bn, ballooning to $12bn in 2013. Argentina’s policy of cheap domestic energy to stoke demand and economic growth worked well after the country’s default of nearly $100bn in 2001. But it isn’t working now.Related reading:

51;APA;Apache Corp;2012-01-23T17:32:37Z;Apache in $2.85bn Cordillera deal;;Apache, one of the largest independent oil companies, is adding to its “unconventional” resources with the $2.85bn takeover of privately held Cordillera Energy Partners, in a deal that reflects how US oil reserves rather than gas have become the industry’s most attractive acquisition targets.The news was released as Chesapeake Energy, one of the largest natural gas producers in the US, announced it planned to cut its gas production by 8 per cent and cut sharply the number of rigs drilling gas wells because of a slump in prices.Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques have opened up previously uncommercial US oil and gas reserves, creating an oversupply of gas that sent prices tumbling to a 10-year low last week.However, strong global demand has held up the price of oil, which at about $100 a barrel for US crude is more than three times its level of a decade ago.Cordillera has oil and gas reserves in Oklahoma and Texas that can be produced using those techniques, in a region that has several resource-bearing rock layers stacked on top of each other, including the Granite Wash, Tonkawa, Cleveland and Marmiton formations.Liquids, including crude oil and natural gases such as ethane and propane that are used as chemical feedstocks or fuels, represent 53 per cent of Cordillera’s production but 80 per cent of its revenues.Apache described the deal as “a liquids play”. Rod Eichler, the chief operating officer, said: “We’re not paying much at all for the gas. It’s almost like we’re buying the liquids, and the gas is coming for free.”Apache calculates that if the value of “dry” gas, without liquids, is about $3 per thousand cubic feet, a “wet” gas well with liquids can make more than twice as much: about $6.95 per thousand cubic feet.The Cordillera deal will extend a shift in Apache’s strategy towards more horizontal drilling and unconventional resources.It has built a successful business by acquiring mature assets, often from larger international groups, and boosting production. It has had spectacular results with the Forties field in the North Sea, bought from BP in 2003, and late last year spent $1.25bn to buy more assets in the region from ExxonMobil.More recently, however, it has been doing more horizontal drilling onshore in the US. In 2009, horizontal wells, which extend laterally away from the drilling site to target pockets of oil and gas, were just seven of its total of 103 wells in Apache’s central region of the US. By last year, 53 out of 64 were horizontal.Mr Eichler said: “The impact of horizontal drilling cannot be overstated…Horizontal drilling cannot work everywhere, but has truly revolutionised places like the Granite Wash.”Apache is paying $2.25bn in cash and $600m in shares for Cordillera, and acquiring 254,000 net acres of drilling rights. Cordillera has proved reserves of 71.5m barrels of oil and gas equivalent, and a further 234.5m barrels of probable and possible reserves.Cordillera was advised by Jefferies and JPMorgan, Apache by Goldman Sachs and Tudor Pickering Holt.
52;APA;Apache Corp;2011-12-20T16:56:10Z;Japanese industry may be hit by new fighter;;In choosing the F-35 Lightning II as its new mainstay fighter, Japan has plumped for a weapons platform which lead manufacturer Lockheed Martin wolfishly boasts is of “unmatched lethality”.But rather than allowing some hostile intruder into its territorial airspace, the first fatality to be inflicted by Japan’s purchase could end up being the nation’s ability to build its own fighters.The choice – which critics say was driven largely by the desire of Japanese air force officers to have the most advanced available aircraft – looks set to deal a heavy blow to an isolated and inefficient defence industry.Japan is already facing its first fighter production hiatus in more than half a century, following the delivery in September of the last F-2 aircraft built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The defence ministry says MHI will have a role in making F-35 airframes, but US reluctance to share the technology behind its radar-evading stealth abilities and weapons networking is sure to limit the extent of Japanese involvement.This could be the final blow for many of the hundreds of smaller manufacturers vital to Japan’s military aerospace manufacturing sector, says Shinichi Kiyotani, a Japanese defence writer who argues that the F-35 purchase could “trigger the collapse of our nation’s defence industry”.Debate over the long-delayed choice of the “FX”, as the replacement for two squadrons of 1970s-era F-4 Phantom jets, has certainly highlighted the woes of Japan’s defence sector. Budget pressures and an informal rule keeping defence spending at about 1 per cent of gross domestic product has left little room for growth. Analysts say increasing numbers of small and medium-sized companies involved in making parts or specialist technologies have been going bankrupt or exiting the sector, in large part because, unlike larger contractors, they cannot balance military-related revenues with sales to the civilian sector.But times have been hard even for big companies like MHI and heavy machinery maker IHI Corp, which the defence ministry says will help to make engines for F-35s sold to Japan. Traditional defence budget-setting means that contracts for even the biggest weapons sales tend to be parcelled out into small lots over many years. The first F-35 deliveries are not expected until 2016, for example, but the government plans to include the cost of four fighters in its budget for the year starting April 1 2012.Such a system leaves procurement programmes vulnerable to change and makes it difficult for contractors to factor in upfront costs, such as those involved in research and development. Meanwhile, the erosion of once cosy ties with bureaucrats and politicians means contractors can no longer rely on the government.Just two months ago, Toshiba Corp launched a lawsuit against the defence ministry over its cancellation of billions of yen in contracts related to the remodelling of some F-15 fighters. Last year, Fuji Heavy Industries also went to court over the government’s decision to cut its purchase of Apache attack helicopters.Defence contractors’ problems are exacerbated by a legacy of Japanese post-war pacifistic principles that largely bars them from the kind of cross-border co-operation that is becoming the industry norm. Exports of almost all weapons systems are banned, meaning companies like MHI have no chance to play a full role in the sort of multinational programme that led to the F-35.Combined with Japan’s past determination to maintain an autonomous defence industry, the result is small production runs and fiendishly high prices. Japan’s F-2, for example, reportedly cost about Y12,00bn – more than twice the price of the US F-16 on which it was largely based.Given Japan’s increasing fiscal strains, it would not be unreasonable to simply decide to rely on imports for future air defence. Yet, the government is hardly entertaining such a shift. Instead, the defence ministry excitedly plans domestic development of a stealth fighter. An early test aircraft is scheduled to take to the air by 2014.How feasible such dreams prove could depend in large part on Japan winning significant access to F-35 technology. Without it, Japan risks merely driving up the cost of the new fighter while leaving itself incapable of creating a successor.Domestic media have already questioned a procurement process which appears to have favoured the largely untried F-35 over its rivals, Eurofighter’s Typhoon and Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet, which are already in widespread service. Both had offered far more domestic involvement in manufacture. At least such criticism should lead to greater public scrutiny of future procurement. For sections of the domestic defence sector, however, it may already be too late.Mure Dickie is the FT’s Tokyo Bureau Chief
53;APA;Apache Corp;2011-12-12T17:47:13Z;Argentina poised for shale oil and gas boom;;Argentina could be nearing a shale oil and gas boom similar to the one that transformed the US energy landscape as former state monopoly YPF eyes another 1bn barrel discovery adjacent to a Patagonian field whose reserves were more than six times bigger than thought.YPF has almost finished drilling a 502 sq km area just north of the discovery zone and believes full results will be equally vast. Two of the three wells are in production and “the yield is exactly the same,” says Tomás García Blanco, YPF’s executive director for upstream.Asked if this heralded another 1bn barrel discovery, Mr García Blanco says: “Yes. But until the third well is drilled … I would like to be cautious. We hope to know by the end of the year or January 2012.”The group, which is 57.43 per cent owned by Spain’s Repsol, announced in November that it had discovered 927m barrels of oil equivalent in a 428 sq km zone of the Vaca Muerta (“Dead Cow”) formation in south-western Argentina – more than six times higher than its initial estimate in May of 150m barrels. The discovery is three-quarters oil and one-quarter gas, it says.That, Mr García Blanco notes, is based on “conservative” estimates that only 4 per cent of all the hydrocarbons will be extracted. Some in the US believe recovery rates of 8 per cent or even 15 per cent may be possible in time – something that will lead to eye-popping estimates of the potential for shale worldwide.Argentina has some of the world’s biggest and best-quality reserves of shale hydrocarbons, which are trapped thousands of metres underground and released by fracturing rocks using high-pressured water, sand and chemicals. The US Energy Information Administration this year ranked Argentina third globally in terms of technically recoverable shale gas resources with 774,000bn cubic feet.With the YPF results and intensive exploration by companies with shale experience in North America – such as ExxonMobil, Total, EOG Resources and Apache – Argentina believes it can emulate the US in going from a mature, but declining hydrocarbons producer to a shale superstar.“The flood of companies started six months ago. Now we’re starting to get results,” says Sam Lee, portfolio manager of the $70m Melchior Resources Fund. It has 8 per cent of its assets in Americas Petrogas, which has a shale farm-out deal with Exxon, and some 5 per cent in other junior companies, and sees 2012 as “an inflection year for Argentina’s oil and gas industry”.Hydrocarbons output has nosedived in Argentina in recent years amid market unfriendly policies and heavy regulation of the sector that discouraged investment. As a result, the government expects to import a record 80 cargoes of liquefied natural gas next year, a 20 per cent increase on 2011.But industry observers note that royalties are low relative to other resource-rich countries and Argentina is offering higher prices for shale gas and oil under the Gas Plus and Oil Plus programmes, creating potentially advantageous conditions for a shale boom.Vaca Muerta, which lies at a depth of 2,500m to 3,000m and had been ignored for decades as geologists long considered such rock unproductive, compares favourably to major US shale formations, says Mr García Blanco: it is three times as deep as Eagle Ford in Texas and yields could be double, he believes.“It does seem to have some similarities to some very productive US plays,” agrees Robert Clarke, manager of the unconventional gas service at Wood Mackenzie, the energy consultancy.YPF remains upbeat that there could there be more shale-rich bedrocks, such as Vaca Muerta in the Neuquén basin. Next year, it plans to spend $40m to drill three wells on the Molles formation, which lies below Vaca Muerta at a depth of 3,500m to 4,000m. “Our expectations are very high,” Mr García Blanco adds.YPF is also looking further south, at the D-129 bedrock in the San Jorge basin, to explore shale potential there, he adds. In all, the company expects to drill 40 shale wells next year, at a cost of $11m to $12m per well.“Until two-and-a half years ago, I thought we would maintain production but never grow in oil, and in gas we would maintain or decline a bit,” Mr García Blanco admits. Now, he reckons that within five years, a third of YPF’s production will come from the Vaca Muerta shale, and the company will be self-sufficient in supplying its refineries.
54;APA;Apache Corp;2011-11-13T19:16:20Z;Lease sale offers hope for Gulf of Mexico;;"In the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans next month, the US Department of the Interior will hold one of the most keenly awaited sales of oil and gas leases in the country’s history, for the western Gulf of Mexico.The choice of venue does not look accidental. Made notorious in 2005, when it became a refuge for those fleeing the devastation of hurricane Katrina, the Superdome then became a symbol of the city’s revival when the New Orleans Saints won the American football Super Bowl in 2010.The areas on offer on December 14, in the western Gulf, are not the most attractive in the government’s portfolio. Even so, the Obama administration will be hoping that the lease sale reflects a similar recovery in the Gulf’s oil industry.The sale is the first for the US since the Deepwater Horizon disaster in April 2010, so it will be keenly watched for evidence of oil companies’ continuing commitment to the Gulf. The paradox is that while the near-term position, in terms of oil and gas production, looks even worse than had been feared a year ago, the longer-term outlook looks even brighter.Third-quarter results from the international oil companies showed most of them struggling to increase their global production. Of the largest western groups, only Royal Dutch Shell and Statoil reported a rise in oil and gas output. As they fight for growth, an area such as the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico, which offers a realistic prospect of expansion, is the ultimate prize.The six-month drilling moratorium that followed BP’s Macondo spill, and the subsequent slowdown in approvals of permits for wells – known to resentful oil companies as the “permitorium” – have had a significant effect on production.Output from deep water fields – defined as deeper than 400m (about 1,300ft) – will this year be about 1.39m barrels per day of oil and gas equivalent, according to Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy.An audit of the energy system of the US, and assessments of the leading companies and the most powerful policymakers that will shape that futureThat is down from 1.74m boe/d last year, and about 500,000 lower than the consultancy’s pre-spill forecast. Data from the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, the new offshore regulator, show that in 2009, 330 deep water drilling permits were granted, compared to just 218 in the 12 months to date.Many companies complain about the increased burden of regulation. Requirements such as checks on blow-out preventers, the valves intended to prevent leaks from a well, and “worst-case scenario” plans for a spill, are much more demanding than they were before the disaster.ATP Oil & Gas is the leader among smaller independent companies for securing permits post-spill. But Paul Bulmahn, its chief executive, says the paperwork required has gone from 39 pages before the Macondo accident to 3,654 pages today.Bob Dye, who oversees government affairs for Apache, another independent active in the Gulf, says it used to take 45-60 days to get a permit, but it now typically takes well over 100 days, and can even take more than 200.Yet for all the difficulties of the Gulf, activity is clearly on the rise. At the end of the moratorium in October last year, there was just one rig working in the deep water of the gulf, down from about 20 at any one time during 2009, according to Philip Dunham at Rice Voelker, the New Orleans brokerage. Now there are 12.Chevron, the second-largest US oil group by revenues, is drilling three wells in the Gulf this year, and is gearing up to drill more. Pre-spill, it had three rigs in the region; now it has four, and will bring in a fifth next year.As Bobby Ryan, Chevron’s vice-president of global exploration, puts it: “The Gulf continues to be a high priority for us, not only to develop discoveries we’ve had, but to continue exploring.”As a result of all this new surge in activity, production is set to bounce back. Wood Mac expects output to remain below its 2010 level until 2015, but to reach 1.9m boe/d that year, and climb again to 2.16m boe/d in 2016.Many of the worst predicted consequences from the spill have not come to pass. Operating costs do not appear to have soared, and insurance rates, while higher, are still not prohibitive for most companies. The smaller players such as ATP and Apache have not been scared off.Molly Reyes of Wood Mac says: “The deep water Gulf of Mexico is a still a very attractive region.“The Macondo disaster didn’t change the geology, or the established infrastructure, or the access to the market, or the fiscal regime. And those are all strong factors that continue to attract companies.”"
55;APA;Apache Corp;2011-11-07T20:29:27Z;Repsol announces big shale oil find in Argentina;;Repsol, the Spanish oil multinational, says its YPF subsidiary in Argentina has made a very large discovery of shale oil and gas that boosts the group’s overall recoverable reserves by nearly 1bn barrels of oil equivalent (boe), or about 50 per cent.The find of 927m boe, announced on Monday night, is Repsol’s largest ever and could end up being bigger still because the figure announced comes as a result of exploring only 428 sq km of the 12,000 sq km area where YPF is working.Repsol said the hydrocarbons were about three-quarters oil and one-quarter gas and had been found in the Loma La Lata area of the Vaca Muerta (“dead cow”) onshore shale formation, where oil is already being produced.Argentina has some of the largest shale reserves in the world. The US Energy Information Administration earlier this year ranked Argentina as number three in the world in terms of technically recoverable shale gas resources with 774,000bn cubic feet of gas. The potential has attracted investment from majors including ExxonMobil and Total, as well as independents such as Apache.The industry is keen to replicate the success seen in the US where unconventional gas production has radically altered the energy landscape. Shale gas is trapped in rocks thousands of feet underground and is released by fracturing rocks using high-pressured water, sand and chemicals.Repsol has profited from several big finds in Latin America in recent years, including in Brazil and Venezuela, but is concerned about the political risks facing foreign oil companies and has tried to avoid excessive dependence on particular markets by selling stakes to other investors.In Argentina, Repsol has reduced its holding in YPF and now holds 57.4 per cent of the shares, with the Eskenazi family holding another 25 per cent and the rest floated on the local stock market.China’s Sinopec took a 40 per cent stake in Repsol’s Brazil business for $7.1bn last year, and both sides said they planned to extend their partnership in new areas.Two years ago, Hugo Chávez, Venezuela’s combative leftist president, announced a “very large” offshore natural gas find in an offshore block being explored by Repsol and Eni of Italy.The Argentina announcement is likely to be a boost for Antonio Brufau, the Repsol executive chairman, and for the company’s share price, following months of corporate wrangling in Madrid.Luis del Rivero, a construction magnate whose Sacyr Vallehermoso group bought 20 per cent of Repsol, struck a deal with Pemex, the Mexican state oil company, to try to oust Mr Brufau.

Shipments are due to start in 2015.British Columbia’s moves coincide with a rising concern that Canada risks being left behind in the race for commercial opportunities in China and other fast-growing Asian economies.A report published on Wednesday by the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, a lobby group, concluded that “Canada has a reputation in Asia of showing up there but not being serious about establishing long-term relationships”.Lorraine Mitchelmore, head of Royal Dutch Shell’s Canadian unit, warned last month that Canada lagged far behind Australia in Asian-targeted energy projects. “Every major energy exporting country in the world is going after that market,” she said. “We are the only major oil and gas exporter in the world that does not have access to a global market.”The Kitimat LNG terminal is closer to Asian markets than similar projects in Australia.British Columbia is also seeking to attract more Asian students, partly by capitalising on a series of racial incidents on Australian campuses over the past few years.“It certainly seems to us that [the Chinese] are looking for a new place to send their kids,” Mr Bell said.“Australia has been very aggressive in its international education efforts, so we think there’s a window of opportunity that exists for us.”An estimated 94,000 foreign students, including 20,000 from China, are enrolled at British Columbia schools and universities.Randall Martin, executive director of the British Columbia Council for International Education, a non-profit group that coordinates its foreign marketing, said that “our reputation for safety, tolerance and diversity has stood us in good stead”.Mr Bell said that British Columbia was also seeking Asian investment in large mining projects. “We think they will be of real interest to the Chinese in terms of a long-term offtake opportunity, perhaps the Koreans, the Japanese or the Indians as well.”He cited the Galore Creek copper, gold and silver deposit in north-west British Columbia owned by NovaGold and Teck Resources. Construction was suspended three years ago because of rising costs, but the partners are now in the midst of fresh feasibility studies. NovaGold expressed confidence last week that the project could become one of North America’s biggest copper producers.The government has set up an office to speed up the biggest projects. Mr Bell said that the group had an open agenda item at cabinet meetings. “They will be able to get instantaneous decisions. Their sole mandate will be to move that project forward in a very timely fashion,” he said.
57;APA;Apache Corp;2011-10-10T16:35:26Z;Pipelines: US advances change rules of the game;Sheila McNulty reports on a shift of market emphasis;Canada has long billed its oil and natural gas resources as a solution to its southern neighbour’s ravenous demand for energy. But the discovery of a way to extract natural gas from tightly packed shale rock has meant the US no longer needs to import as much natural gas.And an environmentalist movement against the high carbon nature of Canada’s oil industry has raised questions about whether there will be big exports to the US as planned.The protests have centred on the proposed Keystone XL– a 2,673km pipeline extension that would start in Alberta and run south-east through Saskatchewan, Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska. It would incorporate a portion of the Keystone Pipeline that runs through Nebraska and Kansas to serve Oklahoma and, eventually, Port Arthur in Texas.The pipeline would be the third that imports fuel from Canada’s vast oil sands deposits, also known as tar sands. TransCanada, the pipeline operator, is waiting for the US State Department’s decision by the end of the year whether to let it build the Keystone extension.Roger Ihne, in the energy and resources practice at Deloitte Consulting, says: “Being in the industry, it’s easy for me to see what drives the project. The oil will be produced and consumed somewhere in the world. It is more economic and environmentally friendly to pipe it to the US than ship it to China or elsewhere.”Environmentalists are not only objecting to the higher carbon content of oil sands fuel, but also that the first Keystone pipeline has had a series of spills in its first year of operation. Russ Girling, president of TransCanada, says that nearly all the oil releases over the past 12 months “have been minor – averaging just five to 10 gallons of oil”.Mark Lewis, a partner at the law firm Bracewell & Giuliani, believes the arguments against the Keystone XL are red herrings. “Since 1972, we’ve been talking about energy security,” he says. “It seems a little silly to turn away this resource from the north.”Nonetheless, there is talk of building a pipeline to the coast to ship out what oil sands fuel the US does not buy. The export project makes sense to Tony Reinsch, senior director in the upstream and gas group at PFC Energy, the consultancy, regardless of what President Obama decides on Keystone XL.“The US and Canada won’t absorb all the oil sands [production] in North America,” Mr Reinsch says.Canada has 170bn barrels of oil sands reserves. The extension was being put forward as an exclusively oil sands development, yet it had other selling points, he says. “While the Keystone XL pipeline will move oil sands product to the Gulf Coast, it will also carry crude from the Bakken shale formation in North Dakota, where production is poised to grow from 400,000 to 700,000 barrels a day to 1.2m.’’He says that neither the industry and environmentalists have paid much attention to this point, presenting the likely passage of the Keystone XL as a debate between jobs and the environment.Yet the US needs to move its crude out of central states as shale oil production rises.Mr Reinsch says: “Right now, access to alternative markets is constrained, noting the differential between West Texas and Brent crude because of the glut of regional crudes in Cushing, Oklahoma.“There is strong industry focus on increasing pipeline access to the Gulf Coast refineries. You don’t want to be constraining US oil production with inadequate pipeline capacity.”On top of that, he says, the pipeline will provide jobs. “Pipelines are one of the few labour-intensive segments of the oil sector,” Mr Reinsch says. “It’s shovel-ready.”The industry’s position is that the project has undergone years of environmental reviews and would be constructed to the highest standards.Regardless of whether the US approves the Keystone XL, he says, Canada was likely to go ahead with at least one of the two proposals being considered for an alternative pipeline to move oil sands production to the west coast for export to Asia.Canada is also rich in natural gas, and a project to export that fuel is under way.Janine McArdle, Apache’s senior vice-president of gas monetisation and president of Kitimat LNG, a project to liquefy and export natural gas from Canada, says the company is in discussions with several north Asian buyers, including China, Japan and South Korea.The project, which is owned by Apache, EOG Resources Canada and Encana, already has its environmental approvals and Apache expects to make its final investment decision in the first quarter of 2012.Initial capacity will be 700,000 thousand cubic feet a day, but there is room to double that to improve the economies of scale, though that would require amending some of the permits.Apache is looking to supply natural gas in contracts running 15 years or longer, with the selling point that it has a “long life and a safe, reliable source of supply”, Ms McArdle says. The company’s view is that Canada must look beyond the US.“Historically, their big export market was the US,” Ms McArdle says. “But shale changed that. We have, in the US been pushing back on imports. It is important for Canada to find another outlet for its resources.”

The lay-offs are part of a broader restructuring at the group, prompted by cuts in global defence budgets that have led to delays and cancellations to orders for military helicopters.News of the cuts comes only a week after BAE Systems said it was shedding almost 3,000 jobs in the UK because of delays in delivery for the Eurofighter Typhoon and a slowdown in development work on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The company said manufacturing work was also moving outside the UK.AgustaWestland’s business in the UK, where it employs just under 3,600 people, is almost entirely military-focused. At its facilities in Yeovil, Somerset, the group makes Apache attack helicopters as well as Chinook and AW101 heavy lift helicopters. Cutbacks in global defence budgets have led to delays in contracts, exposing helicopter makers to greater pressure as competitors drop prices to secure the smaller number of contracts.The market for civil helicopters, however, has remained more robust, with strong demand particularly coming from offshore oil exploration. As part of this restructuring, AgustaWestland will shift more of its UK-based business to serve this expanding civil market.“These steps . . . will place our UK operation on a strong footing and enable us to keep the skills needed for the UK to retain a viable helicopter capability,” said Ray Edwards, managing director of AgustaWestland.“Our military business remains central to our success. This said, extending our capabilities in civil production and competing for export programmes, both areas where the government has shown considerable support, are the keys to AgustaWestland’s future.”Shares in Finmeccanica, AgustaWestland’s parent company, fell 1.1 per cent or 5 cents to €5.12 on Friday afternoon.

60;APA;Apache Corp;2011-09-26T15:34:35Z;Chevron approves A$29bn Australia LNG project;;Chevron, the US oil and gas group, has given the official go-ahead for one of Australia’s largest natural gas ventures by formally approving a A$29bn (US$28bn) investment in the Wheatstone project.Wheatstone, situated off the Western Australian coast, is the latest Australian LNG project to be given final investment approval this year, with more than A$50bn being spent on ventures in Queensland’s emerging coal-seam gas to the LNG industry alone. Analysts predict the Wheatstone project and others already planned will enable Australia eventually to become the world’s largest producer of LNG, eclipsing Qatar, currently the number one.George Kirkland, head of exploration and production at Chevron, on Monday said the US energy group would spend A$16bn-A$22bn for its share of Wheatstone’s development depending on the sale of additional equity stakes in the project next year. Construction is to begin immediately.Chevron is the operator of Wheatstone and owns a 73.6 per cent stake. Apache Corp, the US independent oil and gas company, owns 13 per cent, Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company has 7 per cent and Shellearlier this year bought a 6.4 per cent stake.“Energy growth in the world is heavily centred on Asia,” Mr Kirkland said. “It is a bigger part of the energy market and we are extremely well positioned being in Australia.”Wheatstone will initially have two LNG processing trains with combined capacity of 8.9m tonnes a year but Mr Kirkland said Chevron had already secured government approval to extend the project to 25m tonnes a year that would host five processing trains.Chevron is also the operator of Australia’s A$43bn Gorgon gas project, one of the largest in the world. Mr Kirkland said construction of Gorgon was close to 30 per cent complete with the first gas expected to be shipped in 2014.Craig McMahon, Perth-based analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said that Wheatstone and Gorgon have an “absolutely huge” combined LNG capacity of nearly 24m tonnes annually.He added that the approval of the Wheatstone project was important as it set the stage for a new LNG hub off the Western Australian coast.Wheatstone’s approval comes as Australia continues its march toward becoming a top global supplier of LNG. Frank Harris, head of global LNG consulting at Wood Mackenzie, said Australia would have 73m tonnes a year of capacity once all the projects that are producing or have been sanctioned, including Wheatstone, are taken into account. This compares with 77m tonnes a year of capacity in Qatar.However, if another project – the Ichthys project by Japan’s Inpex – is sanctioned by the end of the year as expected, and assuming enough build capacity in Australia, the country could achieve 81.4m tonnes a year of capacity by 2017-18, eclipsing Qatar.“This is Australia to the fore and it’s indicative of how much has happened in the country for these projects to be sanctioned,” said Mr Harris, adding that companies were engaged in “a real landgrab for LNG projects”.Higher prices and greater volumes pushed the value of Australia’s LNG exports up 34 per cent to A$10.5bn in the year to June. The Australian government’s Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics last week forecast a further 11 per cent increase to A$11.6bn in 2011-12.
61;APA;Apache Corp;2011-09-21T16:34:24Z;Apache buys Exxon North Sea fields for $1.75bn;;Apache Corporation, the US independent, has sounded a vote of confidence in the future of the North Sea in the UK, by agreeing to buy several assets from ExxonMobil for $1.75bn in a deal that will substantially increase its presence in the region.The deal, which includes the Beryl field, will significantly boost Apache’s production in the North Sea, increasing it 54 per cent and its reserves by about 44 per cent. It comes just six months after the UK government announced a surprise tax increase on North Sea production, sparking warnings from the industry that it would deter investment into the region.“These major legacy assets will expand Apache’s presence in the North Sea. They bring us significant remaining life, high production efficiency and quality reservoirs – the best North Sea assets we’ve evaluated since acquiring the Forties field in 2003,” said G Steven Farris, Apache chief executive.“There is a portfolio of low-risk exploitation projects, and we believe the complex structural setting holds reserve upside,” he added.Apache’s newly acquired fields produce 19,000 barrels of oil and 58m cubic feet of gas a day. As well as its Beryl asset, ExxonMobil has sold its operated interests in the Nevis, Ness, Nevis South, Skene and Buckland fields, and also its share of the Beryl/Brae gas pipeline and the SAGE gas plant. The deal includes ExxonMobil’s non-operated interests in the Maclure, Scott and Telford fields and the Benbecula exploration acreage west of the Shetland Islands.Brad Corson, ExxonMobil’s UK chairman, said: “ExxonMobil routinely assesses its assets to assure consistency with the strategic objectives of the company and its shareholders, and concluded in this instance that their best interests would be served by this sale.”Rex Tillerson, the chairman and chief executive of the US group, told the Financial Times earlier this year that the UK government’s tax increase had prompted concerns.“The fear I have, as we look at our own operation, is, is this just going to accelerate the end of life of marginal properties? As you accelerate that end of life, then the facilities and infrastructure that go with those marginal fields, that gets dismantled,” he said.Exxon said on Wednesday the sale did not affect its commitment to the North Sea and the UK, noting that it would continue to hold an interest in 40 producing fields, principally through the Shell/Esso joint venture, as well as its “substantial” refining and marketing assets in the country.The sale represents about 10 per cent of its daily UK production.A number of the world’s major oil companies, including BP, have in recent months put some of their North Sea oilfields up for sale to concentrate on larger developments elsewhere in the world.
62;APA;Apache Corp;2011-08-30T20:56:45Z;ExxonMobil targets Argentina shale;;"According to US Energy Information Administration, Argentina has the third biggest unconventional oil and gas resources in the world. And since new hydrocarbons discoveries can qualify for higher prices in Argentina’s highly regulated market, plus the fact that domestic energy market leader YPF has made a couple of major announcements and said there is much more out there to discover, it follows that this is a sector where interest could take off.Indeed, ExxonMobil of the US believes the next big shale frontier is in Argentina. It has signed a deal with Canada’s Americas Petrogas and is spending up to $76m to take a stake of 45 per cent in the Los Toldos blocks in the Argentine province of Neuquén – believed to be one of the richest and most promising of all shale regions in the country.Guimar Vaca Coca, managing director of Americas Petrogas’ Argentina subsidiary, says:We believe the next major shale development outside of North America will be in the Neuquen Basin.It is no surprise that foreign firms including Apache and Total are looking at unconventional gas prospects, with conventional hydrocarbons fields maturing in Argentina, and the market regulation a disincentive to exploration, as the table below, from a report compiled by former energy secretaries shows:Los Toldos is believed to be in a favourable location relative to other recent discoveries of shale oil and shale gas in the Vaca Muerta formation – where YPF has made big recent discoveries. The industry sees similarities to shale reservoirs (oil trapped in fine grained sedimentary rocks) such as the Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Horn River in North America that have yielded shale gas and shale oil. Unconventional energy of this type has revolutionised the outlook in the US.Americas Petrogas shares were 39 Canadian cents, or 23 per cent higher by Tuesday afternoon trade, after rising 49 cents earlier. With Argentina facing sliding energy output, companies may start betting big on Argentina’s unconventional gas prospects.Related reading:

63;APA;Apache Corp;2011-07-14T19:57:52Z;Shrink-to-grow strategy at heart of Conoco break up;;For years, Jim Mulva, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, believed that bigger was better. He oversaw the original merger between Conoco and Phillips that created one of the world’s five largest oil and gas companies. And then he kept on buying.Yet by early 2009, the US economic downtown had exposed the flaws in this strategy. ConocoPhillips disclosed a net loss of $31.8bn in the last quarter of 2008 after a $34bn writedown, together with 1,300 job losses.Praveen Kumar, finance professor at the University of Houston, explained that rising commodity prices had disguised the structural changes taking place in the oil and gas industry. Gaining access to hydrocarbon reserves was becoming ever harder with maturing fields, the rise of resource nationalism and tougher competition from national oil companies.The biggest international companies were scrambling to buy whatever they could, whether it was oil sands in Canada, deepwater fields off the Brazilian coast or shale gas in the US. But all these assets were more expensive to develop and had longer lead times. It had become harder for ConocoPhillips to keep up with its much bigger peers.Mr Mulva duly revised his strategy. First, he stopped buying assets. Then he decided to sell some, fixing a goal of $17bn of disposals by 2012.Now he has chosen to hive off ConocoPhillip’s refining and marketing operation so that the company can focus on exploration and production.“ConocoPhillips has been restructuring its portfolio in an attempt to release shareholder value for the past 18 months,’’ said Fraser McKay, senior corporate analyst at Wood Mackenzie, the consultancy. “This is by far the most dramatic event of that period.’’Shareholders have rewarded Mr Mulva for each of his decisions. The shrink-to-grow strategy caused the ConocoPhillips share price to outperform its peers over the past year. The decision to split the company into two new entities led its shares to surge to on Thursday.But Mr McKay cautioned that this did not mean other big oil companies would follow suit. “You’ve got to look at it holistically – a company’s size, scale and the number of businesses it has,’’ he said. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all model.’’That said, Marathon Oil hived off its refining operation two weeks ago – and was rewarded with a surging share price.But analysts note that Marathon and ConocoPhillips were among the smallest of the big integrated companies. The biggest players may have assessed the case for hiving off their refining and marketing operations, but this does not mean they will do the same.“BP has been looking at this,” said Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy, the consultancy. “But although Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil and Chevron have rationalised their portfolios, they are staying in the refining business.”These companies continue to believe in the synergies of being in both key segments of the oil business, he said.If they shrink too much, companies risk losing the hedges provided by diversified portfolios. This is particularly important for the exploration and production business, which is exposed to multiple risks, notably the volatility of commodity prices, environmental accidents and the expropriation of assets by foreign governments.The biggest benefit from splitting, said Mr McKay, was allowing companies to focus more clearly on the needs and investments of individual entities. And investors favour this option, he said, because it enables them to decide for themselves how much exposure to refining they want versus exploration and production.The challenge for ConocoPhillips, as an independent, will be its reduced size. Yet Barclays Capital estimates that it will still have more than twice the proven reserves of Occidental Petroleum and Apache, its new peers. Meanwhile, its refining operation will be the second biggest among US independents.“This will be `the super-independent’. But the key to a successful independent is the ability to grow,’’ said Mr West. “Eventually Conoco will have to grow the business.”
64;APA;Apache Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;ConocoPhillips unveils break-up plan;;ConocoPhillips, America’s third largest integrated oil company, will hive off its refining assets to focus exclusively on exploration and production.ConocoPhillips announced on Thursday that it will split into two publicly traded entities, spinning off its refining and marketing business by the first half of next year.ConocoPhillips shares rose 7.5 per cent after the announcement. Shares in Marathon Oil have also surged since it announced a similar plan two weeks ago.This marks the second attempt by Jim Mulva, chief executive, to restructure the company, following an earlier acquisition spree. ConocoPhillips is the smallest of the six oil majors.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Mulva argued that the company’s refining operations were a drag on the upstream division, especially in the face of increased competition from state-owned oil giants. “[The split] is a result of more and more competition,” he said. “The opportunities to continue to grow as we have in the last ten years have changed dramatically [for the worse].”“The downstream business is really struggling as an industry and the model is all about taking out costs and finding efficiencies,” said Jim DeNaut, Nomura’s head of investment banking for the Americas. “That is very different from the …growth that is going on in the upstream part of the business.”The restructuring will transform ConocoPhillips into a “super independent”, with what Barclays Capital estimates will be more than twice the proved reserves of Occidental Petroleum and Apache, its new peers.The spun-off refining operations will be slightly smaller than Valero Energy’s, making it the US’s second biggest independent refiner.“The cost of upgrading refineries and the potential environmental liabilities …can become a significant drain on capital that could otherwise go to growing the upstream business,” said Michael Hill, Nomura’s global co-head of natural resources.The formal separation of ConocoPhillips is expected to take place in the first half of next year, after which Mr Mulva will retire.Under the terms of the present plan, no shareholder vote would be needed for the separation to proceed. Instead, it would be subject to regulatory approvals and a final decision from the board.ConocoPhillips, based in Houston, has a global portfolio of exploration and refining assets, including a joint venture in the North Sea’s Britannia oilfield.
65;APA;Apache Corp;2011-05-27T10:22:05Z;Obama renews call for Libya regime to go;;Barack Obama on Friday reiterated calls for regime change in Libya, as the world’s richest countries agreed a multibillion-dollar aid package for Tunisia and Egypt, the countries at the forefront of the Arab spring uprisings.“We have made progress in Libya but meeting the mandate of civilian protection cannot be completed if [Libyan leader Muammer] Gadhafi remains in Libya,” Mr Obama said.The US president said it was time to “finish the job”, after meeting his French counterpart Nicolas Sarkozy on the sidelines of the Group of Eight meeting in Deauville.Summit participants, including David Cameron, UK prime minister, and Dmitry Medvedev, Russian president, will sign up to a communiqué “supporting a political solution that reflects the will of the Libyan people” according to a draft seen by the Financial Times.Meanwhile France and Britain said they were putting 16 ground attack helicopters on standby to launch attacks on Col Gaddafi’s regime amid claims in the west that his grip on power is weakening.France has sent 12 Tiger and Gazelle helicopters on the carrier Tonnerre, while British officials said on Thursday that David Cameron, UK prime minister, had signed off on the deployment of four Apache aircraft.The Apaches, aboard HMS Ocean in the Mediterranean, would be operational within days, with an expectation that Nato could send them into action soon.The escalation of the Nato offensive was discussed by Mr Cameron, Mr Sarkozy, and Mr Obama, on the margins of the G8 summit.Several large explosions rocked the Libyan capital Tripoli on Thursday night with a column of smoke seen rising from Col Gaddafi’s compoundEuropean diplomats claim to have intelligence reports that Colonel Gaddafi has become paranoid – although the Nato allies have seldom described the Libyan leader as a model of sanity.Western intelligence said the colonel had been sighted going from hospital to hospital at night in an attempt to take shelter in buildings that would not be targeted by Nato air strikes.“He’s on the run,” said one European diplomat.“We are hearing from various sources that the regime is increasingly feeling the pressure and is beginning to fracture. Our judgment is that it’s the right time to be turning up the pressure.”The comments may be seen as wishful thinking, given that Col Gaddafi has so far proved more resilient and elusive than many in the west had expected when they began their military operations in Libya in March.Nato military planners hope the deployment of helicopter gunships will allow them to hit targets more accurately and from lower levels now that the Gaddafi regime’s air defence systems have been largely destroyed.Mr Sarkozy and Mr Cameron said it was a good way to intensify pressure on the Libyan leader while staying within the remit of UN resolution 1973, which provides for Nato to protect civilians from attack by the regime.Meanwhile, forces loyal to the Gaddafi regime bombarded the rebel-held city of Misurata with mortar rounds on Thursday, reinforcing a view in Washington that a ceasefire offer from Tripoli was not credible.Spain said on Thursday it had received a message from Libya’s prime minister offering an immediate ceasefire, although Madrid supports the European Union’s position that any ceasefire must be credible and verifiable.The bombardment of Misurata was the heaviest for days and coincided with the start of the G8 summit, where western countries debated how to bolster the spread of reform in north Africa.Mr Sarkozy repeated his view that Col Gaddafi “had to go” and that the longer he waited, the worse it would be for his country.Mr Obama suggested during a visit to London this week that the west may consider that it had achieved success if it had ensured that the Libyan leader could no longer terrorise his own people.But Ben Rhodes, US deputy national security adviser, said the Libyan government was not complying with the UN resolution and that the effort to drive the Libyan leader from power would continue.
66;APA;Apache Corp;2011-05-24T13:53:17Z;Minister denies Apache Libya decision;;No decision has yet been taken on deploying armoured Apache attack helicopters to the Nato-led mission in Libya, Nick Harvey, the Liberal Democrat armed forces minister announced on Tuesday, despite official French claims to the contrary.Mr Harvey made a statement to MPs after Labour tabled an urgent question following claims by Gerard Longuet, the French defence minister, that the helicopters would be deployed alongside 12 French Tigre attack helicopters.“The British, who have assets similar to ours, will also commit. The sooner the better is what the British think,” Mr Longuet said at a European Union meeting on Monday.Jim Murphy, the shadow defence secretary, said on Tuesday that people would be concerned that French ministers knew more about British military deployments than parliament.However, Mr Harvey said: “My understanding is that the French have indeed taken a decision to deploy their attack helicopters in Libya.“No such decision has been taken by the United Kingdom. It is an option we are considering and there is absolutely no sense in which it is true to say that we have kept parliament in the dark about a decision.”The minister also denied that any decision to deploy Apaches would represent an escalation of the UK’s mission in Libya. Rather it would be a “tactical shift”.If the decision is made use Apaches in operations in Libya the would fly from HMS Ocean, which sailed to the Mediterranean at the end of last month as part of the Royal Navy’s new Response Force Task Group.The Apaches, which have been used in counter-insurgency operations by the UK in Afghanistan, would be better able to perform precision strikes in built-up areas than the conventional aircraft so far assigned to the region. Such strikes would likely to be more effective against Colonel Muammer Gaddafi’s forces which have cast off their uniforms and use civilian vehicle, which hiding armour close to civilian buildings such as hospitals.Mr Harvey appeared to concede this point on Tuesday, saying: “What we would have at our disposal is a weapon with a greater degree of precision, better able to hit targets and moving targets, and with a lower risk of collateral damage.”However, the Apaches would be more vulnerable to attacks from the ground – such as from rocket-propelled grenades – than the higher-flying Tornadoes and Typhoon aircraft which the UK currently has committed.The use of helicopter forces by the British and French could prove decisive in the fierce battle for the port city of Misurata, which has seen some of the worst fighting of the three-month long conflict between rebel forces and those loyal to the Libyan leader.At 22,500 tonnes HMS Ocean is currently the largest warship in the Royal Navy, carrying a mix of Apache attack helicopters, support helicopters and landing craft.
67;APA;Apache Corp;2011-03-20T23:14:43Z;Dominion wins Kenyan block;Aim-quoted company gets offshore rights;Aim-quoted Dominion Petroleum has beaten off competition to win one of three coveted Kenyan offshore oil blocks, marking one of the last awards in Kenya’s accelerating virgin oil scene.Kenya, yet to prove any oil reserves, has awarded 25 of 38 blocks nationwide and several larger companies, including the UK’s Tullow Oil, US independents Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and Apache Corporation, have recently farmed into blocks won by smaller companies.Martin Heya, head of petroleum at the ministry of energy, said: “We have signed the heads of agreement [which sets out terms] with Dominion, partnering with Flow Energy of Australia,” Mr Heya added that agreeing heads of agreement is “as good as signing” a partnership sharing contract, expected in April.Dominion has taken 60 per cent of offshore block L9 in the Lamu basin, although the Kenyan state may take a 15 per cent share at a later date. The terms commit the company to spend between $6.15m and $46m on exploration over the next two to six years.People familiar with the deal said the signature bonus, due on signing the PSC, would be less than $500,000, much less than others signed in the region. Two blocks in Democratic Republic of Congo went for $3m apiece last year while another Congolese block in which Dominion has a share is thought to gone for $2.5m.The award came as BG Group amended its efforts from a solo bid for three offshore blocks including L9 to lead a consortium of four companies for two offshore blocks, L10a and L11b. These have been conditionally awarded but the heads of agreement and PSC have yet to be signed.“BG wanted the three blocks but Dominion had better terms for block L9,” said Mr Heya. “They really wanted all those three but they have overcome their disappointment. Sometimes the small companies work harder than the big ones.”BG Group said the company was pleased with award offers it had received and hoped to finalise the PSCs “soon” but could not comment on other blocks. Its consortium partners are the UK’s Cove Energy and Premier Oil, and Australia’s Pancontinental Oil & Gas.It is the fourth country award for Dominion, which has already secured blocks in Congo, Uganda and both onshore and offshore in Tanzania.“It’s probably the last best acreage that was available in deep offshore east Africa – that’s why we leapt on it,” said Andrew Cochran, chief executive of Dominion.“It was tactical on our part – we considered if we bid for all three we might wind up for zero, but we thought the government might award us one.”Mr Cochran said the company may look to farm out its offshore blocks in Tanzania and Kenya as a package to the same partner. “Companies have already expressed interest in partnering in the acreage,” he said.Mr Heya said that although Kenya is playing catch-up in the region, the country may be able to move swiftly to production.“I believe when we discover oil ourselves we shall bring it into production faster than neighbours – we have the infrastructure, skilled people, we operate a product pipeline, and we have a refinery even if it is old – I think we can do it,” he said.
68;APA;Apache Corp;2011-03-04T22:12:41Z;War-gaming... with the FT;;An Apache attack helicopter thumps to the ground in flames somewhere in Tarin Kowt, north-east of Kandahar, Afghanistan. I bundle out and hit the ground, peering through shrubby grass. I am in utter confusion, but the team commander to my right is already scanning ahead through his binoculars. He barks to the signaller to call in a “sitrep”, our position and situation.The target is an Afghan compound, from where a truck-mounted gun shot down the helicopter. We get up and run to find a better vantage point. One of the team is in contact with a pilot flying an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) by remote control. On a tiny, reinforced laptop computer he receives a live aerial video feed of the compound.The team commander grabs the laptop and scans the video screen. “Taliban in compound,” he tells the signaller. “Fire at my command.”Single shells from six AS90 gun batteries promptly slam into the compound. But they are only fired to find the range. The commander gives his approval and a volley of five shells from each of the six guns lights up the horizon. The signaller is immediately on his radio: “Sitrep. Taliban compound neutralised, safe for aviation, over.”But the commander has seen something. “Beware, movement in compound to the rear,” he says, scrutinising the video. In an instant, another Apache appears and is over us, strafing the compound with machine-gun fire.The UAV feed shows just bodies now. We hear a Chinook transport helicopter and run through the dust cloud, scrambling aboard. It lifts up, banks, and I can see the smoke from the compound as the land falls away. Heart thumping, I lean back and reach for my cold coffee as the lights come on in a training room at the Royal School of Artillery at Larkhill, Wiltshire. I have just experienced “serious gaming”, the sophisticated computer simulation that promises to revolutionise military training.This exercise was played out over a huge screen using a battery of laptops, real maps, radios and video receivers. The military has long used expensive, bespoke simulators to help train personnel, but this system, called Virtual Battlespace 2, has its roots not in a high-security lab but in teenagers’ bedrooms.Major General Gerry Berragan, director-general of army recruiting and training, says: “What is different is that in the past, computer games such as Flight Simulator were industry products that were converted into games. But VBS2 is a game that we have taken to use as a training medium. So the games industry is paying the R&D costs.”VBS2 is a more sophisticated version of Operation Flashpoint, a popular computer game produced by Bohemia Interactive. New topographical databases or equipment can be programmed in with a speed and economy that is almost unheard of in defence procurement.“If we had a commercially procured system and we wanted to amend it, you can imagine how big the cheque would be,” adds Berragan.Real artillery rounds cost more than £1,000 each to fire in training, so computer simulation is cheap by comparison. But this is not about saving money, it is about making soldiers better prepared for conflict. Before VBS2, the first time young artillery captains faced the full co-ordination of surface-to-surface shells, helicopters and fast air strikes was in theatre because these sophisticated weapons can’t be fired in training.Lieutenant Colonel Martyn Armstrong, the Royal Artillery’s chief targeting instructor and the officer who is driving the VBS2 programme, says: “If you get battle space management wrong, you have the most potential for fratricide. It is the first time we have been able to train this and it’s made a huge difference.“Six months ago we were moving these things around for training,” he says, pointing to a cupboard full of small plastic tanks. “But these kids all play [the computer game] Call of Duty, and they expect better.”The simulation can go even further, combining live firing with virtual reality scenarios seen through binoculars and video receivers. This creates a “synthetic wrap” of the computer game on to exercises in the field. “I can put an Afghan village on Salisbury Plain,” Armstrong says with a smile.It is only in the “joint fires cell”, a faithful recreation of an operations room at a field base in Afghanistan which co-ordinates the battlefield strikes, that I fully understand what Armstrong means. Playing out the same downed Apache scenario, chaos engulfs me.Screens on the wall show video feeds, force trackers and electronic communications. Operators on either side of me are controlling air and artillery strikes, while a commander paces around, watching the videos for an attack on the base. I am trying to scan the screens and process commands but the sheer volume of information is overwhelming. I can only wonder at the split-second judgment calls needed.The major in charge of the training stations me on an automatic weapon, thinking that I might do less damage there. He is wrong. I open fire as a Taliban vehicle races along behind some local people. “Don’t shoot their goats, Bob,” he screams in my ear, before dissolving into laughter.“It’s called serious gaming for a reason,” Berragan stresses. “You can’t go on VBS2 and become Rambo. You see what a 500lb bomb does.”Playing Virtual Battlespace, I know that no one is really shooting at me and I am not humping 60lb of webbing across the desert. But I do begin to glimpse the complex calculations and dilemmas these men face, and the consequences of their decisions. At the end of my Apache mission a lone woman in a blue burka lies face down, the victim of a stray round. The graphics may look familiar enough to the PlayStation generation, but appearances can be deceptive: these guys are not playing games.Bob Sherwood is the FT’s London and south-east correspondent
69;APA;Apache Corp;2011-02-17T17:38:51Z;Oil spill response system launched;;Oil companies on Thursday launched a spill containment system in the Gulf of Mexico in a bid to restart the issuance of permits stalled after BP’s fatal Macondo well disaster.ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips unveiled the interim containment system, which they said was open to all operators in the gulf. A second response system, by Helix Energy Solutions Group, is to be ready at the end of March.The move comes in the wake of the first bankruptcy to emerge from the slowdown in drilling imposed by regulators in the Gulf of Mexico, which have increased tensions between the oil industry and the Obama administration.Seahawk Drilling, a gulf-focused driller, is filing for bankruptcy as part of a deal to sell its 20 shallow-water, or jackup, rigs to Hercules Offshore in a deal valued at $105m.Randy Stilley, Seahawk’s chief executive, took a parting shot at regulators: “The decision by regulators to arbitrarily construct unnecessary barriers to obtaining permits they had traditionally authorised has had an adverse impact not only on Seahawk but on the sector as a whole.’’The Obama administration issued a moratorium on gulf drilling following BP’s fatal Macondo disaster in April 2010. But even though the moratorium has been lifted, activity remains constrained.Michael Bromwich, the gulf’s lead regulator, said he would not issue any deepwater drilling permits until the industry had an adequate spill response system in place: “It would simply be irresponsible.’’While those operating in the deep water are bigger and can hold out longer, Mr Bromwich also has taken a hardline on shallow-water drilling. Permitting has slowed from up to 20 a month before the oil spill disaster to 31 in the 10 months since the accident.Mr Bromwich played down what he called “a new normal”, telling an oil industry conference on Friday there was no backlog of permits awaiting approval. But the companies accused him of misrepresenting the situation.“He’s being a little coy,”’ said Gary Luquette, head of North American production for Chevron. “No, there isn’t a big backlog because you couldn’t get a straight answer as to what it took to get a permit. The demand is there, and, if we can ever get the framework agreed and set down, it’s going to be like drinking out of a fire hose.’’While some rigs have left the gulf, the fees to do so are high – up to $15m for a shallow rig to go to Asia, for example.Nonetheless, John Rynd, chief executive of Hercules, said he agreed to buy rival Seahawk’s 20 rigs with a goal toward eventually moving some of them out of the gulf and into international regions where it is operating.Hercules is a global provider of offshore contract drilling, liftboat and inland barge services with operations in nine countries. Mr Rynd said regulatory uncertainty has put drillers in the gulf under enormous stress.“I think it’s going to be a slow process to get rigs back to work,’’ he said. “You can’t get clarity on what the government is asking for.’’He noted that 45 days into 2011, only 12 permits had been issued: “It’s very inefficient.’’“We’re very concerned,’’ said Jim Noe, executive director of the Shallow Water Energy Security Coalition. With many operators in shallow waters private, there is no public announcement when they go under, he said. But he predicts more bankruptcies.“Seahawk is a poster child for what happens when you shut down permitting,’’ he said. “Business has completely dried up.’’Meanwhile, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement said it was investigating an incident on Apache Corporation’s natural gas production platform off Lake Charles, Louisiana, on February 16 in which a worker died after falling in to the water apparently while being transferred from a vessel to the platform.“This tragic accident underscores why we are continuing to work with the industry to ensure the highest safety standards on offshore facilities,” Mr Bromwich said.
70;APA;Apache Corp;2011-02-13T22:00:56Z;Oil and gas groups hope Egypt will not interrupt output;;"Oil and gas companies working in Egypt and elsewhere in the Middle East said they did not expect their operations to be stopped by the ousting of Hosni Mubarak.However, analysts warned that the political volatility in the region could still lead to disruption to energy supplies.Egypt is not a large oil producer, with output of about 740,000 barrels per day, and has no net oil exports, but has become increasingly important as a gas exporter in recent years.Several Western companies, including BP and BG Group of the UK, Eni of Italy and Apache of the US, have operations there.The Iranian revolution of 1979 provides an uncomfortable precedent: the new government cancelled all contracts with foreign oil companies and production plunged. It has since recovered, but never regained its pre-revolution peak.But the companies that were prepared to comment about the political situation in Egypt said they expected their operations to continue.Apache said: “Our joint ventures with EGPC [the state-owned oil company] are an important part of the Egyptian economy, and we have no reason to be concerned at this time.”BG refused to comment on Mr Mubarak’s exit. However, when Frank Chapman, the company’s chief executive, was asked about the issue before the president’s resignation, at the company’s result’s announcement, he took a similar line.“Gas industry development has created massive amount of value, and the people of Egypt have benefited from that value creation, also directly in terms of jobs. And I believe that the government of whichever political shade will be very interested in sustaining continued flows of foreign direct investment,” he said.“There’s a lot of potential still and a lot of undeveloped resources in the Nile delta and that will need a lot of capital.”He added: “At the end of the day, the investment will be in resources that are owned by the people of Egypt rather than investment in any particular regime.”Some of BG’s operations such as drilling wells had been held up by the turmoil in the country, which has made it hard to move personnel, but Mr Chapman said he was expecting to resume work on new developments “quite soon”.Another fear about the fall-out from the crisis was that it would obstruct flows of oil from the Gulf countries to Europe and the US, though tankers travelling the Suez Canal or though the Sumed pipeline from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean. That appears not be have been realised; there have been no reports of any hold-ups on those routes.There are also other options for oil flows, including taking tankers around the Cape of Good Hope.Nansen Saleri, chief executive of Quantum Reservoir Impact, an oilfield services company, said the routes through Egypt carried about 1.6m-1.7m barrels per day, a relatively modest amount in the context of world oil demand of about 89m b/d.“From a global perspective, what’s happening in Egypt is not very critical,” he said.Oil prices have fallen back in recent days as markets judged that imminent cuts in oil supplies were unlikely.However, analysts warned that the pressure for change across the region could still affect oil and gas production.Robin West, chairman of PFC Energy, the consultancy, said, “Forces have been unleashed, and the impact is going to be tectonic.”He added that other Middle Eastern countries faced similar economic issues to Egypt.“One of the big problems in the Gulf countries is underemployment, and creating meaningful work that creates wealth will be a significant challenge.”Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy expert at the James A Baker III Institute for public policy, added: “There has been civil unrest over the last two or three years in all the countries of the Gulf: Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia. The idea that what happened in Egypt is unconnected from the Middle East is incorrect.”Asked about the impact of unrest in the region, Christophe de Margerie, the chief executive of Total, the French oil and gas group, said last Friday: “We know how to work in difficult places. Leaving really is the last resort. It is important to be in a position to be able to stay, and we know how to do that.”Total has no production in Egypt, but operates in other Middle Eastern countries such as Yemen, where it has a large liquefied natural gas project.However, concerns about the potential threat to oil prices are likely to remain.Ms Myers Jaffe said: “I think we’re in for several years with a Middle East premium in the price of oil”.Additional reporting by Sylvia Pfeifer"
71;APA;Apache Corp;2010-11-29T08:41:45Z;BP sells Pan Am Energy stake for $7bn;Move takes asset sale programme to $21bn;BP’s asset disposals have topped the $20bn mark after the UK oil group agreed to sell its interest in Argentina’s Pan American Energy for $7.06bn to its joint venture partner.The sale, announced on Sunday, means BP has now raised about $21bn from disposals – close to the $30bn target it revealed earlier this year to help pay for the Gulf of Mexico spill. BP agreed to set up a $20bn fund to help pay for claims from the April 20 accident.Bob Dudley, BP’s chief executive, said: “Today’s agreement demonstrates both the high quality and attractiveness of the assets throughout BP’s global portfolio and also the company’s ability to meet our significant financial commitments arising from the Gulf of Mexico tragedy”.Under the agreement, BP will sell its 60 per cent stake in Pan American Energy to its joint venture partner Bridas Corporation, which is co-owned by Bridas Energy Holdings of Argentina and China National Offshore Oil Corporation. The Chinese oil and gas group spent $3.1bn on the stake in March this year, marking its entry into Latin America.Bridas is paying a deposit of $3.53bn, with the balance due on completion of the sale, expected next year, said BP. The deal excludes Pan American Energy’s Bolivian assets.Pan American Energy is Argentina’s second-biggest oil producer and and its Dragon Hill field is the largest in the country. It has boosted its oil and gas production by 70 per cent between 2001 and 2010Dragon Hill’s robust production has enabled Pan American Energy to thrive in spite of government regulation in the sector that makes domestic prices a fraction of international levels.Before the deal, BP had agreed sales of about $14bn worth of assets, mainly through three deals. In July, it agreed to sell $7bn of onshore gas assets in the US, Canada and Egypt to Apache, the US independent oil and gas group. BP has also announced agreements to sell its assets in Venezuela and Vietnam to TNK-BP, its Russian joint venture, for $1.8bn, and its Colombian assets to Ecopetrol and Talisman Energy for $1.9bn.BP shares, which have risen more than 40 per cent since June, rose 0.6 per cent in early trading to 438.65p.Standard Chartered advised BP on the Pan American Energy deal.
72;APA;Apache Corp;2010-10-01T23:05:10Z;BP to cut assets in Gulf of Mexico;;BP is looking to reduce the number of operatorships it holds in the Gulf of Mexico as part of a move to cut its capital spending and rebalance its portfolio of assets in the wake of the Macondo oil spill.The UK oil group produces from more than 20 deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico and is the biggest operator in the region, as well as the largest licence holder.Until the accident on April 20, the US was BP’s principal strategic focus but the company faces a challenge to restore its reputation.It plans to raise up to $30bn (£19bn) from asset disposals within the next 18 months and has said it will cut capital spending by about 10 per cent this year to raise funds to help pay for the costs of the spill.Analysts have said it would make sense for BP to realise some of the value of the licences it holds in the Gulf of Mexico and people familiar with the matter confirmed BP was considering reducing the number of operatorships it holds there.Bob Dudley, BP chief executive, told the Financial Times earlier this week that while there might be some asset sales in the US, it would remain an area of strategic focus.BP declined to comment but on Friday confirmed it has relinquished its operatorship at Tubular Bells, a deepwater field discovered in 2003 and about 135km southeast of New Orleans, to Hess, the US company.Hess will pay $40m for an additional 20 per cent stake, raising its holding to 40 per cent.BP will retain a 30 per cent stake.BP had said in March it intended to make a final investment decision on the field later this year.BP is making progress with its asset sales. The company has so far raised almost $10bn, notably from a $7bn sale of onshore gas assets in the US, Canada and Egypt to Apache, the US independent oil and gas group.Apache had been in talks with BP about taking a stake in its Alaskan fields but that deal foundered.BP is considering an alternative plan which would see it transfer the operatorship of the Prudhoe Bay field to one of its existing partners, and then selling a stake.Analysts said Apache and Occidental were potential buyers of the stake.BP has been in talks with TNK-BP, its Russian joint venture, about several asset sales.A formal offer for BP’s assets in Venezuela and Vietnam could come as early as next week.Tony Hayward, who resigned as chief executive of BP after the spill, is joining the board of TNK-BP.BP’s shares rose 3 per cent to 440.9p on Friday.
73;APA;Apache Corp;2010-09-27T17:48:08Z;Pakistan voices anger at Nato strikes;;Pakistan has denounced rare strikes on its territory by Nato helicopters based in Afghanistan that killed dozens of suspected ­militants.The incursions have further complicated Washington’s fraught alliance with Islamabad at a time when President Barack Obama’s administration is pressing Pakistan to do more to support its Afghan campaign.Isaf, the Nato-led force in Afghanistan, said helicopters had crossed into Pakistan in pursuit of militants twice over the weekend. It said 49 suspected fighters were killed in the first attack on Pakistani soil and at least four in the second. Pakistani officials put the toll at more than 60.Isaf did not identify the nationality of the aircraft, but the Apache and Kiowa helicopters reported to have been involved in the incidents were almost certainly from the US, which uses these types in Afghanistan.US officials say they have an agreement with Islamabad that allows Nato forces to cross a short distance over the border in pursuit of militants, which often stage attacks from havens in Pakistan. Pakistan’s foreign ministry denied the existence of such an accord.“Pakistan has strongly protested to Isaf/Nato on the two incidents of aerial engagements from the Afghanistan side into Pakistani territory,” it said. “Such violations are unacceptable.”The incident runs the risk of aggravating sensitivities in Pakistan, where suspicions of US motives run high.Pakistani officials reacted angrily last week to revelations in a book by Bob Woodward, the veteran US journalist, that a 3,000-strong secret army of Afghan paramilitary forces run by the Central Intelligence Agency had conducted cross-border raids into Pakistan. The book, Obama’s Wars, documents divisions in the US administration over Afghan policy.In a reflection of widespread anti-US sentiment, protesters took to the streets in several Pakistani cities on Friday to denounce a decision by a US judge to jail Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistan neuroscientist. She was sentenced to 86 years in prison on Thursday for shooting at FBI agents and soldiers after her arrest in Afghanistan.Many Pakistanis believe Ms Siddiqui is innocent. Yusuf Raza Gilani, the prime minister, has told parliament that his government is determined to repatriate Ms Siddiqui, who he described as a “daughter of the nation”.Although the weekend’s helicopter incursion is an irritant for Pakistan, it will do little to change the fundamental dynamic of the allies’ complex relationship.The US is ramping up military and civilian aid to the country as part of the Obama administration’s attempts to persuade Islamabad to crack down on Afghan Taliban and other militants based on its territory. The US engagement has been mirrored in repeated increases in commitments to fund relief efforts for victims of the country’s giant floods.The US considers denying militants safe havens in Pakistan to be a critical component of the its strategy for bringing the Afghan insurgency under control, but the policy has enjoyed limited success.Pakistan has launched major operations against Pakistani militants and tacitly endorsed an escalating programme of US drone strikes against militants that has expanded sharply under the Obama administration.A suspected US missile strike killed four people on Monday near Mir Ali, a major town in North Waziristan, a haven for militants targeting Nato forces in Afghanistan, Pakistani intelligence officials said. It was the 20th drone strike this month.However, western officials suspect Pakistan’s security forces are hedging their bets by continuing a long-standing policy of backing Taliban militants to maintain leverage in Afghanistan, while providing enough co-operation to ensure aid continues to flow.US leverage over Pakistan is sharply constrained by its reliance on Pakistani ports and roads to ship roughly 70 per cent of the supplies needed by western forces in Afghanistan. Pakistani officials say their confidence in the US commitment to stabilising Afghanistan has been undermined by Mr Obama’s decision to announce his intention to start withdrawing American forces next July.
74;APA;Apache Corp;2010-09-23T21:40:40Z;BP chief faces tough call on US;;Robert Dudley celebrated a personal milestone this month when he turned 55. Next week marks another when he gets to grips with the biggest challenge of his professional life: after more than two months of waiting in the wings, the American takes the helm of BP from Tony Hayward on October 1.As chief executive, he will face a raft of challenges in the wake of the UK oil group’s spill in the Gulf of Mexico, from continuing the clean-up to determining BP’s strategy. But his most immediate will be to assess the company’s future in his native country. The appointment of the even-tempered Mr Dudley – who grew up in Mississippi – has helped calm some of the furore, but more than 150 days after the fatal accident and with the ruptured Macondo well finally sealed, BP’s reputation in the US remains battered.Before the accident, BP’s principal strategic focus was the US and in particular the deepwaters of the Gulf. The US accounts for just over 26 per cent of BP’s daily production of about 4m barrels of oil and gas. It produces from more than 20 deepwater fields, including Thunder Horse and Atlantis, and is the biggest operator as well as largest licence holder. The US has offered a benign operating environment for BP, with a stable legal and tax environment, but since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20, the group’s risks of operating there have increased sharply.Plotting a new route map for BP will be a difficult balancing act. Some BP investors believe the environment has become too risky and the company should reduce radically its presence over time and focus on other areas such as Russia, Angola and Azerbaijan. Others argue the US is too important a market to withdraw from completely.“The key thing is the Macondo well was an exploration well, not a development prospect,” says Jason Kenney, ING analyst. “The fact that it went wrong has not detracted from BP’s US business in the Gulf.”Prior to the accident, BP made six final investment decisions to develop discoveries. “These are all additional development commitments that will sustain production for BP in the medium-term,” says Mr Kenney.A key question for BP is what it does with its future drilling plan.“The immediate question for me in 2010 and 2011 is what percentage of BP’s future drilling plan was focused on the Gulf of Mexico,” says Amy Myers Jaffe, energy expert at the James A Baker III Institute for Public Policy. “It is not just a question of shifting future investment dollars out of the US. It’s how do they handle the leases they’ve already bought?”What BP does with those leases – does it sell them, sit on them or try and get a permit to use them – will in part depend on the conclusions of the US Coast Guard’s Marine Board inquiry as well as that of the presidential commission into the causes of the accident. Their conclusions will do much to set the political tone for BP in the US.A moratorium on deepwater drilling is due to be lifted in November but uncertainty remains for BP in the shape of the so-called Miller Amendment. The proposal, passed in July by the House of Representatives, would block BP from being awarded any drilling permits but is not certain to become law.Mr Dudley needs to convince US legislators it has put right the failings exposed by the accident. He has already identified improving BP’s safety and performance as one of his priorities.“Rebuilding the licence to operate in the US will take time but it can be done,” says one person familiar with BP’s thinking. “The US needs deepwater [drilling] and it’s now clear there are only a handful of operators who can do that and mount the kind of response to an accident that BP has.”Nevertheless, Mr Dudley also needs to convince his shareholders that staying in the US will be worthwhile. The world’s supermajors have not delivered stellar production growth in recent years and total shareholder returns – share price appreciation plus dividend payments – have been poor.BP, for example, has invested more than $100bn in its upstream (exploration and production) business since 2003 but its overall production has been flat: it has, in effect, invested to stand still.Industry observers argue the figure masks huge value creation in exploration. One option for Mr Dudley could be to increase BP’s expenditure on exploration but focus on high-value assets – including ones in the Gulf of Mexico – and downsize in those areas that generate lower returns, including refining and marketing.“The company should focus more on value, not volume,” said one observer. It is a message Mr Dudley will no doubt keep hearing over the coming months.
75;APA;Apache Corp;2010-09-12T21:47:00Z;US regulation: Energy industry is riled by new rules;;"On September 1, thousands of oil and gas industry workers demonstrated in Houston against a moratorium on new deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and taxes and other punitive measures being discussed in Congress.That was the first of seven rallies in five states through mid-September.“We’re concerned about our jobs,” says Robin Roger, an administrative assistant at Apache, the independent oil producer, while waiting for the speeches to start. “We’re concerned about how decisions the government makes are going to affect our futures.”Some decisions are already having an impact. After BP’s well explosion on April 20, the US government not only imposed the moratorium, which runs through November, but also added restrictions on operating in shallow waters.US congressmen Gene Green, a Democrat from Texas, and Charles Boustany, a Republican from Louisiana, wrote to the Interior Department, urging that new permits be issued in the gulf – an area providing roughly 30 per cent of the US’s domestic oil and about 15 per cent of its natural gas.The letter was co-signed by 37 congressmen.“At a time when the economy is still coming back from the worst recession in recent memory, we just can’t afford to lose more jobs,” Representative Green says.He notes that, before the disaster, some 10 to 15 drilling permits were issued each week. Since May 28, a total of four permits have been issued.The rigs that normally would have been out in the gulf have either been idle or sent elsewhere.This means that while the rigs themselves may still be under contract (and in some cases force majeure has been declared), everyone from the supply boats to the cooks and cleaning crews that would have worked on these projects in the US is out of work.Industry analysts do not believe there will be a surge of permits even after the moratorium is lifted. The government is drafting regulations to tighten oversight of the gulf. And insurance companies are raising rates.Some companies are reassessing whether they want to even be in the region.“The business just got more expensive because everybody saw this and got more worried,” says Maynard Holt, co-president of Tudor, Pickering, Holt, the energy investment and merchant banking group.“All of that suggests there will be some consolidation. The smaller companies will find it harder to do things.”Gary Adams, vice-chairman for the oil and gas practice at Deloitte, the consultancy, says companies must now ask themselves, “Do I bet my entire company on each well?”One option will be for smaller companies to pool resources and buy a group insurance policy. Another will be for operators to agree to cap the liabilities for smaller players at a dollar amount, rather than a percentage. And a third will be for them to abandon the gulf and move onshore.The US onshore has become a growth area for companies keen to extract natural gas and oil from shale rock.But even this is not free from controversy. Despite natural gas being far cleaner than oil or coal, environmentalists object to potential impacts on the ground and air of the drilling process.Extracting from shale involves drilling down, sometimes thousands of feet, and then sideways as much as 4,500ft. After drilling, water with fine grains of sand is pumped through at high pressure; this fractures the shale and leaves behind the grains of sand, which prop open the fissures in the rock and allow the gas to escape.Congress is probing the process and, despite the industry’s insistence that it is safe, has asked the US Environmental Protection Agency to complete a comprehensive examination of the safety of hydraulic fracturing.Some states are taking the issue into their own hands. In August, the New York State Senate voted to issue a temporary moratorium on the fracturing of shale until it can review the concerns. The moratorium, which would bar new drilling permits until May 15 2011, must be passed by the entire state Assembly before being imposed. But it already has riled the industry.The American Natural Gas Alliance insists that natural gas is safely and responsibly developed across the country every day, and that New York has some of the most stringent regulations in the country.Dan Whitten of the ANGA says: “New York is sitting on a vast natural gas resource, and yet the state is a net importer of 95 per cent of its natural gas and is the nation’s fourth biggest natural gas consumer.“The natural gas community believes that people should not have to choose between jobs and economic opportunities, and their environment,” he adds."
76;APA;Apache Corp;2010-09-05T21:43:57Z;BP revives bid to sell Alaskan assets;;BP has revived the sale of its fields in Alaska after failing to dispose of them to Apache of the US earlier this year. The UK oil group is hoping to sell part of its stake in Prudhoe Bay, the giant Alaskan field, according to banking sources.BP had been in negotiations with Apache, a US independent oil and gas group, to sell it half of its 26 per cent stake in Prudhoe Bay as part of a package of assets. That deal, however, became too complex and Apache finally agreed to pay $7bn for onshore gas assets in the US, Canada and Egypt.Apache is still seen as a buyer by industry bankers, who also cited Occidental, a US group, as another potential suitor. It is not known whether BP would be willing to sell the entire stake, which would include the operatorship of the field.BP remains in talks with its Russian venture, TNK-BP, to sell its assets in Venezuela. TNK-BP is understood to be willing to look at other assets offered for sale by BP, including those in Vietnam.The disposals are part of BP’s plan to raise up to $30bn from asset sales to help pay for the Gulf of Mexico spill. BP declined to comment on the details of its asset disposal programme.The company will this week publish its internal report into the causes of the April 20 accident by Mark Bly, its group head of safety and operations. The report is the first of several into the spill.BP said in July that it did not believe it was grossly negligent – a charge that would need to be proved if the company were to be fined the maximum of $21bn under the Clean Water Act in the US.BP revealed on Friday that its bill for cleaning up after the spill had reached $8bn.At the weekend the company recovered a vital piece of equipment from the seabed.The blow-out preventer, the stack of valves designed to prevent oil and gas from escaping but which appeared to have failed, has been taken into custody by the US Department of Justice as evidence in its own investigation into the accident, BP said in a statement on Sunday.Thad Allen, the US national incident commander, said on Saturday that the installation of a new blow-out preventer had “basically secured” the Macondo well.“I am pleased to announce that this well does not constitute a threat to the Gulf of Mexico at this point,” the retired Coast Guard admiral said.
77;APA;Apache Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;BP asset sales close to $10bn;;BP has raised close to $10bn (£6.5bn) from disposals to help pay for the cost of its oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.The oil company on Wednesday announced that it was selling stakes in two petrochemical production businesses to Petronas, the Malaysian state energy company, for $363m in cash. That brings the overall total for disposals to $9.3bn.The proceeds will go towards BP’s target of raising up to $30bn from asset sales.BP has committed to paying $20bn into an escrow fund to cover claims arising from the spill from the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico.The group, however, denied that the sale was motivated by the need to raise cash for the clean-up, noting that “this is something that had been mooted for some time”.BP announced plans to raise an estimated $8.7bn in July. Most of the cash came from a $7bn deal with Apache, the US independent oil and gas group, which is buying onshore gas assets in the US, Canada and Egypt. Those assets represented about two per cent of BP’s reserves.Apache had also been in talks about taking a stake in the Prudhoe Bay oil field in Alaska, in production for BP since 1977, but the two companies were unable to agree a price. Industry sources said BP has now begun a separate process to sell Prudhoe Bay.Assets in Pakistan and Vietnam, which are valued by analysts at about $1.7bn, are also up for sale and BP is in talks with TNK-BP, its Russian joint venture, about a sale of its Venezuelan assets. Robert Dudley, BP’s incoming chief executive, is a former chief executive of TNK-BP.The Malaysian deal has been struck ahead of a planned flotation by Petronas of its petrochemical activities in Kuala Lumpur.The assets BP is selling consist of a 15 per cent stake in a Malaysian ethylene business that is currently controlled by Petronas, as well as a 60 per cent stake in a Malaysian polyethylene business that is 40 per cent owned by Petronas.BP – which did not disclose details of the financial performance of the assets it was selling – said it would receive a $48m dividend from the businesses before the disposal went through. The deal is expected to close by the end of 2010.The company will retain its other operations in Malaysia, which include acids and lubricants businesses and a regional support centre.Shares in BP closed on Wednesday at 388.9p, up 8.3p on the day but still down 40 per cent since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20.
78;APA;Apache Corp;2010-09-01T18:42:02Z;US oil industry protests against drilling moratorium;;Thousands of oil industry workers rallied on Wednesday to lift the moratorium on new deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and head off new taxes and punitive measures in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon spill.Companies ranging from Chevron to Apache bussed in up to 5,000 employees to the Houston convention centre to underline to Washington the industry’s contribution to the country.“We make America run, we make America work, and they need to remember that,’’ said Carroll Robinson of the Citizens Chamber of Commerce to cheers and applause. “If you stop drilling, if you stop producing, America stops working.’’Attendants donned red T-shirts handed out at the door that proclaimed: “We are energy nation.’’ Others wore the “I am an energy citizen’’ and “Rally for jobs, our jobs, our future,’’ included in the gift bags. They roared when several speakers noted President Obama’s Air Force One flew on fuel the industry produced and the nation watched his speeches on televisions powered by industry fuel.“So why are we cutting off the Gulf of Mexico?’’ said John Hofmeister, former president of Shell USA and chief executive of Citizens for Affordable Energy. “You cut off your nose to spite your face, Mr president.’’Many of the workers said they were concerned that the longer the moratorium went on the more jobs would be lost. Brenda Barnard, a Chevron employee, said she remembered how her father had been affected by the oil bust of the 1980s: “The longer this continues, eventually it will reach everybody.’’“I have been in the oil and gas industry for 40 years, and this administration is trying to break us,’’ said Barbara Dianne Hagood, senior landman for Mariner Energy, a small company. “The moratorium they imposed is going to be a financial disaster for the gulf coast, gulf coast employees and gulf coast residents.’’Organisers, which included the American Petroleum Institute, the industry’s national trade organisation, said the oil and natural gas industry supported more than 9.2m jobs nationwide and accounted for 7.5 per cent of the US economy. It has invested nearly $2,000bn in US capital projects since 2000.The Houston rally was one of three held across Texas on Wednesday. Others are planned for Ohio, Illinois, New Mexico and Colorado in the next two weeks.
79;APA;Apache Corp;2010-08-27T14:43:05Z;My Portfolio: America the not-so-beautiful;;"While I have been more than happy with the performance and stability of my UK shares, the laggards this year have been my US-listed holdings, just five of them, which account for about 10 per cent of my portfolio.I am clearly missing something. In 2009, my UK shares produced a total return of 50.3 per cent, double the FTSE 100’s 25 per cent. Yet the US portfolio, which held similar shares, managed only 14.5 per cent, not much more than half its benchmark, the S&P 500. This year too, my American shares have continued to disappoint. Returns to date are a negative 12 per cent compared with only minus two per cent on the benchmarks. My UK shares are up one per cent in 2010, reflecting the defensive and high income holdings I have gradually been switching into since last September.The reasons for the US underperformance are varied. Some stocks I hold have a very high beta. Advanced Micro Devices, which I bought exactly a year ago as a geared recovery play on news of its $1bn settlement win against Intel, catapulted from $4.40 per share to $10, but has now sagged to just over $6.50. That’s one of the better stories. So too is the value raid on BP ADRs (American depositary receipts). They were $31 in June and I took profits at $39.75 for half the holding earlier this month. I’ve been a little unlucky with Anardarko, the oil company partner of Tullow Oil. The stock has recovered to as high as $55 but is still well below the acquisition price of $65
last September. Apache, another oil explorer, continues to languish well below my most recent acquisition price too.I have also been disappointed in my biggest US holding, General Electric, which I regard as an exchange traded fund (ETF) for the US economy. I piled into the shares in March 2009, pretty much at the stock market low, at prices varying from $4.99 to $6.91. At first, GE went great guns, getting up to $16 last September. But it hasn’t moved any higher, though I remain convinced that it will improve.However, the real damage was caused by the shorter-term activity in the account, and much of this comes down to trying to be too clever. That includes trying to hedge using an inverse SPDR ETF. Somehow I managed to lose heavily on this. Forays into technology stocks such as EMC didn’t do well in 2009, and overall there was just far too much trading. This year, however, I haven’t traded very much at all but there is still this nagging underperformance. Quite how to resolve this isn’t clear. Trying to replicate my UK strategy by going in search of yield would be fine if it were not for US withholding taxes, which crimp the income by 15 per cent (or 30 per cent if you don’t lodge the “tax alien” paperwork with your US broker). These payments can be offset against UK taxes, but the paperwork is time-consuming. I’d really prefer to retain growth stocks, since that is what the US excels in, yet the growth stocks I have chosen just don’t seem to be performing. Certainly
I think that I will have to sell down my holding in Anardarko, and possibly Apache too. While the US shares are dragging the entire portfolio’s performance down by only one point, it is the niggling investment mistakes I must be making, rather than their size, that worry me. If I don’t fix them, they could be replicated elsewhere on a larger scale.Nick Louth is an active private investor, writing about his own investments.

80;APA;Apache Corp;2010-08-17T19:01:13Z;Saudi arms deal set for smooth US passage;;One of the largest arms deals in US history, involving the sale of weaponry worth some $60bn to Saudi Arabia, is likely to go through Congress without significant objections, according to people on Capitol Hill.The deal would include 84 Boeing F-15 fighter aircraft along with Blackhawk and Apache helicopters. People knowledgeable about the deal say a big factor smoothing its passage is Israel’s relatively relaxed position, at a time when it and Saudi Arabia are both focusing on a possible threat from Iran.“The lack of Israeli opposition is very telling,” said a congressional staffer, who said he had not detected any groundswell of opposition. “I don’t think there is going to be a sense when people look at this, for all the immense nature of the transaction, that it represents much in terms of a real threat to Israel.”Although some people say the $60bn (€47bn, £38bn) figure is merely indicative – in 2007 the Bush administration announced $20bn in exports to Saudi Arabia and other Arab states, not all of which have been carried out – the sale would represent thousands of jobs at a time when the US is struggling with unemployment at almost 10 per cent.The transaction is likely to be divided into four packages – one for the F-15s and three for the helicopters. It is already the focus of preliminary consultations on Capitol Hill.But a formal notification to Congress, which would then have 30 days to pass legislation preventing the sale, is unlikely before next month.The initial response contrasts with the storm three decades ago over Ronald Reagan’s plan to sell Awacs early warning aircraft to Saudi Arabia, a move which was widely opposed on Capitol Hill.It also comes after private US warnings to Turkey that its position on Iran and Israel could endanger congressional backing for weapons purchases sought by Ankara. In June, Turkey used its membership of the United Nations Security Council to vote against imposing more sanctions on Iran.Saudi Arabia, by contrast, has registered much more concern about Iran’s progress towards nuclear weapons capability, in Washington’s eyes. Riyadh fears that a nuclear-armed Iran would be much more assertive in the Gulf. Such worries chime with Israel’s stance, which depicts a possible Iranian bomb as an “existential threat”.Ehud Barak, Israel’s defence minister, has received US assurances that the F-15s will not be equipped with cutting-edge technology. Diplomats say the US has also promised Israel full information about the Saudi purchases. They add that, by the time the F-15s are delivered, Israel will have possession of F-35 joint strike fighters, which are more capable.“We have had constructive talks with the US and everything was done in the framework maintaining Israel’s qualitative military edge,” said an Israeli official.The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, one of the most powerful lobby groups, has not signalled its view on the deal.
81;APA;Apache Corp;2010-08-10T16:03:36Z;BP;Apocalypse has been avoided, but the share price recovery has stalled;"BP is dead; long live BP. The leak at the Macondo oil well in the Gulf of Mexico has been plugged. The group has announced a $32bn charge against the cost of the incident, a new chief executive from October 1, and plans to dispose of up to $23bn of assets on top of last month’s $7bn sale to Apache. The news on the scale of the damage has been good, and the tide of reputation-sapping developments seems to have turned. BP can begin to reinvent itself. So why is its share price becalmed?As long as the well was open to the ocean, investors were unimpressed by BP’s huge response – 31,000 personnel, 5,050 vessels and dozens of aircraft. They mostly responded to the company’s stream of (usually bad) news by selling the shares. The price fell 54 per cent between April 20 and the trading low on June 25. Since then the stock has only regained about one-third of that. The rise since July 27, when BP announced the charge as well as Tony Hayward’s replacement by Bob Dudley, has been a paltry 4 per cent.There are three factors at work. One is that BP’s lost value can be recaptured only if and as its reputation is rehabilitated. Given the impact of the leak on future business prospects, that could be a slow climb. The second is concerns about the disposal plan: is it tinkering at the edges or a genuine start at repositioning BP? That is a pressing issue for Mr Dudley.Third, the Macondo script is far from over. The press conferences may be less dramatic, but there is hard work ahead for BP in courtrooms, boardrooms and behind the scenes in Washington. It may find, to its discomfort, that it has even less control on that front than it did on the sea floor.E-mail the Lex team confidentially"
82;APA;Apache Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
83;APA;Apache Corp;2010-08-03T16:10:43Z;BP agrees $1.9bn Colombian sale;;London, August 3 – BP said it would sell its Colombian assets to a consortium of Canada’s Talisman Energy and Colombia’s state-run Ecopetrol for $1.9bn.The deal is the latest in a string of divestitures BP has announced as it seeks to raise up to $30bn to pay for its oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.Ecopetrol and Talisman said they would pay $1.9bn, including around $145m in a working capital adjustment, for all shares in BP’s Colombia subsidiary. Talisman will get a 49 per cent stake and Ecopetrol, 51 per cent.BP will receive a cash deposit, which its local Colombian unit said would be $1.25bn.Ecopetrol – 89 per cent state-owned – said BP’s Colombian oil and gas fields had proven and probable reserves of 94m barrels of oil equivalent and estimated 2010 production of 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day.The deal includes BP’s stake in four pipelines totalling 1,600km (994 miles) of crude and 400km of gas pipelines, the companies said.The joint venture will have BP’s stake in gas plants.“This is completely marked out in the strategic plan, providing new reserves, production and potential areas for our exploration portfolio,” Javier Gutierrez, Ecopetrol president, said in a statement.Ecopetrol shares on the Colombian bourse jumped 1.74 per cent after the announcement.Ecopetrol says it plans to take on $23bn in debt and issue $6bn in shares to help fund its $80bn 2011-20 expansion plan.Last month BP agreed to sell a bundle of assets in the US, Canada and Egypt to Apache for $7bn, and said it planned to sell its assets in Pakistan and Vietnam, which analysts estimate at $1.7bn.Last week, BP announced a charge of $32.2bn in its second quarter related to the spill. Analysts said the final bill was likely to be much higher.
84;APA;Apache Corp;2010-07-21T06:34:36Z;BP to sell $7bn in assets to Apache;;"BP has announced plans to raise an estimated $8.7bn from asset sales, bringing the embattled oil group close to its initial target of raising $10bn from disposals to help pay for the cost of its huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.Most of the cash will come from a $7bn deal with Apache, the US independent oil and gas company, which is buying onshore gas assets in the US, Canada and Egypt.BP has also said it will sell most of its assets in Vietnam and Pakistan, which are valued by analysts at about $1.7bn as it accelerates divestments in an attempt to allay concerns over its financial health.Apache had been in talks over taking a stake in the giant Prudhoe Bay oil field in Alaska, in production for BP since 1977, but the two companies have not yet been able to agree a price.BP is likely to announce further disposals, but its ability to reach a significant deal so soon, just over a month after the disposal plan was announced, will ease the pressure for it to make further sales quickly.Apache is buying gas fields in Texas and New Mexico for $3.1bn, in western Canada for $3.25bn, and in Egypt’s Western Desert for $650m.The assets in total represent about 2 per cent of BP’s reserves, and are being sold for about 6.4 per cent of its market capitalisation last night. In total, they produce about 331m cubic feet of gas per day, and account for about 2.3 per cent of BP’s worldwide production.Steven Farris, Apache’s chief executive, said in a statement: “This is a rare opportunity to acquire legacy positions from a major oil company… We seldom have an opportunity like this in one of our core areas, let alone three.”The asset sale came as BP denied a report in the Times that Tony Hayward, chief executive, was to step down within the next 10 weeks.The company rejected the Times report saying that Mr Hayward “remains CEO and has the full support of the board”.Apache is a specialist in extending the lives of mature fields, as it has done very successfully with the Forties field in the North Sea that it bought from BP in 2003.BP was advised by Standard Chartered; Apache by Goldman Sachs, BofA Merrill Lynch, Citi and JPMorgan.Separately, BP has told staff and government officials in Pakistan and Vietnam that it intends to sell all its assets except its Castrol lubricants business.In Pakistan, where it produces 173m cu ft of gas per day, BP intends to sell onshore and offshore oil and gas fields, some of which are already producing and others where BP holds the right to explore.In Vietnam, where BP produces 63m cu ft of gas per day, the company wants to sell its Lan Tay and Lan Do fields and the related Nam Con Son and Phu My 3 pipelines. In total, the sales from both countries represent 2.7 per cent of BP’s natural gas production of 8.5bn cu ft per day.Jason Kenney, analyst at ING, said: “This is an opportunity to clear out the closet. BP can get to $10bn quite easily,” he said, noting that the company was merely accelerating the divestments of non-core assets it would have otherwise sold over the next 3-5 years.BP has also held discussions over selling its 60 per cent stake in Pan American Energy of Argentina worth about $9bn, as well as fields in Colombia and Venezuela.Despite political opposition by some US lawmakers, BP is desperate to maintain its position in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, one of its most important regions.A senior BP officer told the FT last week that the company could “easily” raise $20bn from disposals, twice its original target of $10bn within the next 11 months.Achieving this figure would negate the need for BP to raise funds by issuing new equity, he said.Tony Hayward, BP’s chief executive, has told BP employees that the company had to show it had the cash to pay for its liabilities by the time it presents its second quarter earnings on July 27."
85;APA;Apache Corp;2010-07-20T21:11:31Z;Cheer over earnings props up shares;But the euro retreats and 2-year Treasuries yields hit new low;"Tuesday 22:10 BST. Traders hold steady as investors are steeled by mostly positive earnings, though still veered away from taking on substantial risk by the fallout from European fiscal difficulties.The FTSE All-World equity index reversed its losses and was up 0.5 per cent, but the dollar bounced off near 10-week lows as its haven attraction trumps concerns about the US economy. The euro was also in retreat and US 2-year Treasury yields hit a new low.Gains appear likely to continue: After the close there was an anticipated agreement by BP to sell $7bn in assets to Apache; that will give backbone to those cheering a potential return of the bid premium to shares. And Apple, which has been going through a rare spell as a laggard, reported stronger-than-expected earnings on the back of brisk sales of iPads and iPhone 4 devices.But the trigger for the session’s early slide appeared to be news highlighting how the stretched budgets of many European nations, and the austerity drives designed to combat them, will place strains on financial systems and negatively affect the corporate sector.The UK’s fiscal situation came into focus following a profit warning from UK-listed telecoms group Cable & Wireless Worldwide. That brought home to investors how the slashing of government spending can hurt company earnings. News that the UK government’s borrowing in June was the highest on record for that month only serves to highlight the extent of cuts to come.In the US, the first substantially negative earnings report, from Goldman Sachs, knocked back sentiment early, as the S&P 500 opened nearly 1.5 per cent lower. However, growing revenues and earnings at IBM and Texas Instruments, plus earnings-forecast beating perormances by PepsiCo and UnitedHealth Group, attracted bargain seekers.Even Goldman Sachs, still the leading trading franchise on Wall Street, was higher later in the session as bargain hunters swooped in. The S&P 500 index was up 1.1 per cent.“The company reports we’ve had so far are inconsistent with the double dip concerns that the markets have been pricing in,” said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management.Yet many of the earnings reports contained notes of caution – notably forecast cuts by Johnson & Johnson and Tupperware, plus below-expectation business sales growth at IBM – that did little to dispel fears that the economy was slowing. Such is the worry about the US and global economy potentially slipping backwards, that some analysts see the Federal Reserve needing to consider further monetary stimuli.Indeed, Mr Schweitzer cautioned: “The strength of corporate profits is what leads me to expect that business hiring and capital spending will improve in the coming months, but it’s not going to be an overnight recovery. There are just too many negatives out there.”In addition, a poorly-received auction of three-month bills by Hungary showed investors are getting increasingly nervous about the stand-off between Budapest and the IMF/EU over the extent of the austerity package relating to the receipt of a €20bn loan. That has hurt the region’s banking stocks, which are seen having significant exposures to eastern european debt.Sales today of debt by Ireland, Spain and Greece have gone fairly well, but then the ECB stands as a backstop for such “peripheral” sovereigns. A six-year UK gilt auction was more of a struggle. US Treasury bonds saw buying in spite of shares rallying after housing starts were said to slow 5 per cent in June (though permits for future potential building did offer some hope).This only highlights the difficulties investors – and governments– know they face in trying to assess a patchwork global economy and thus the markets’ prospects in the medium term.Just north of the border, the Canadian central bank raised interest rates for the second time in six weeks – from 0.5 per cent to 0.75 per cent – as it seeks to normalise policy as activity rebounds.The move shows that areas of strength persist, a point highlighted today by the Asian Development Bank which, while acknowledging that issues such as the sovereign debt crisis had made the environment more uncertain, raised growth forecasts for most economies in the region.At the same time, Australia and Brazil are struggling over whether to slow their growth or keep their foot on the accelerator. The Australian dollar was higher on speculation of another rate hike, while Brazil’s real was lower (and its stocks higher) after a report showing a more moderate pace of inflation growth led traders to conclude that another rate hike was not necessarily imminent.New US housing data were also received with confusion. New construction was down 5 per cent June, leading homebuilding shares to initially tumble. But shares later rallied as markets focussed on a sub-data point showing permits for future building to be on the rise.● Asia. The FTSE Asia-Pacific index added 0.2 per cent, shrugging off worries about US growth and the poorly-received results overnight from IBM and TI. S&P 500 futures had fallen nearly 1 per cent after the bell in New York following those results, but by the time the Asian session drew to a close the contract had pared losses as investors in the region took a more phlegmatic view of corporate prospects.Shanghai sported its second consecutive good advance, rising 2.2 per cent as traders welcomed signs of currency liberalisation by Beijing. Hong Kong climbed 0.9 per cent, though Tokyo fell 1.2 per cent as Japan played catch-up after being closed for a holiday on Monday.● Europe. Bourses initially responded to Wall Street’s rebound overnight and saw decent gains from the off. However, the austerity worries took their toll as the session progressed and falls accelerated after the Goldman earnings hit the wires.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 was only fractionally higher even though miners did well. Banks, which were modestly higher as investors reasoned that the outcome of the eurozone stress tests due on Friday will restore confidence to the sector, faltered later on.The FTSE 100 in London was down 0.2 per cent, led lower by telecoms.● Forex. The dollar rebounded as equities slid. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of its peers, was up 0.3 per cent.The euro had earlier reclaimed the $1.30 mark, but the renewed fiscal worries, profit taking and haven trades left the single currency down 0.4 per cent at $1.2891.Notably, the euro seemed to ignore early rumours, based on reports in Spanish media, that all of Spain’s caja savings banks passed the stress tests. That news, if true, could go either way with traders. Either it means that Spain’s troubled lenders are healthier than expected, or that the stress tests were not stressful enough.● Debt. The market faced a deluge of sales, with Spain, Ireland, Greece and the UK auctioning debt of various duration. Eurozone auctions had been considered pretty successful of late, so any disappointing sale could have hit sentiment.Spain, for example, sold €4.3bn of 12-month bills and €1.7bn of 18-month bills, and though the bid-to-cover ratios were slightly lower than seen for an auction last month, so were the yields demanded, a sign of easing investor stress. Spanish 10-year benchmark yields are down 7 basis points at 4.33 per cent.US Treasuries enjoyed demand as traders seek havens. The 10-year yield is down 1 basis point at 2.95 per cent, while the 2-year note earlier hit a new all-time low of 0.5764 per cent. In late trading it had flattened out to 0.5845 per cent.● Commodities. The complex managed a stoic performance given the bond market’s flight from risk. This may partly be the result of the complex’s correlation to sentiment emerging from China, where stocks had another good day. Copper was up 2.7 per cent at $3.01 a pound in New York trading. Oil reversed an early slide, rising 1.2 per cent to $77.44 a barrel, helping to push the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index up 0.1 per cent.Gold was up 0.8 per cent at $1,191 an ounce, having hit a fresh two-month intra-day low of $1,175."
86;APA;Apache Corp;2010-07-15T20:57:36Z;BP speeds up $20bn asset sale to boost funds;;"BP has accelerated the sale of up to $20bn worth of assets as it attempts to ease concerns about its financial health after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.The company and its advisers are finalising details of the sales, including the disposal of American assets worth up to $12bn to Apache, the US oil and gas independent, according to people close to the situation. Announcements are expected in the next few weeks, possibly before the company’s second-quarter results on July 27.A senior BP figure said the company could “easily” raise $20bn (€15.5bn) from disposals, twice its original target.Achieving this figure would remove any need for the company to raise funds by issuing new equity, he said.BP is also expected to sell some or all of its 60 per cent stake in Pan American Energy of Argentina, valued at $9bn, and stakes in oil and gas fields in Colombia, Venezuela and Vietnam.A deal with Royal Dutch Shell to buy BP’s minority stake in the Mars field in the Gulf of Mexico has also been discussed.The sale to Apache would be an ambitious move for the US company, which has a market capitalisation of about $30bn. The deal would include a stake in the huge Prudhoe Bay oilfield in Alaska, which was one of BP’s key assets in the 1970s, but is now in decline.Apache has a record of taking on mature fields and boosting their performance. It bought the Forties field in the North Sea from BP in 2003, and boosted production from 40,000 to 70,000 barrels a day.Although Tony Hayward, BP’s chief executive, has held talks with international investors interested in potentially taking a strategic stake in the company, the group has committed not to sell new shares to raise funds.Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, Abu Dhabi’s crown prince, said this week that the emirate was still considering investing in BP. However, one person close to BP said that Abu Dhabi and other sovereign wealth funds were wary of investing in large stakes without securing preferential deals.BP’s shares have already risen 36 per cent from their lowest point at the end of last month, making purchases in the market less attractive.In a sign of where the company’s future may lie, BP on Thursday also announced a $98m deal to strengthen its position in the development of advanced second-generation biofuels.It has bought full ownership of its joint venture with Verenium, the US biotech
company, working on producing “cellulosic” ethanol from non-food crops such as switchgrass.Philip New, chief executive of BP Biofuels, said: “This acquisition demonstrates BP’s intent to be a leader in the cellulosic biofuels industry in the US.”"
87;APA;Apache Corp;2010-07-12T22:35:16Z;BP shares show faith in new well cap;;"BP’s shares rose 9.4 per cent on Monday on talk of potential asset sales and rising confidence that the new, tighter sealing cap it is installing on its leaking Gulf of Mexico well could allow the biggest-ever US oil spill to be stopped completely.But such a cap has never been used at 5,000 feet below sea level; testing will be done to see if it is capturing the oil – a process that will take at least 48 hours. To complete the installation process could take a week.”Our confidence is growing,’’ Doug Suttles, BP’s chief operating officer, told a news conference on Monday.BP shares rose 9.4 per cent in London, closing in London at 398.02p, 34.47 per cent above the 52-week low of 296.00 set on June 25.Investors are particularly heartened by reports that Apache has been named as potentially being interested in buying BP’s $10bn (€7.95bn, £6.65bn) Alaska oilfield assets, although neither company would comment on that possibility.The asset sales are aimed at firming up BP’s balance sheet to cover its liabilities from the spill.BP’s latest plan to stop the spill is to bolt and seal the 68-tonne cap into position as part of a plan to capture up to 60,000-80,000 barrels a day of oil from the well.The cap will hold the oil as it is funnelled to surface gathering vessels. The flow into the Gulf could be stopped altogether by closing off valves, if pressure permits.BP expects the cap will also help with the operation to kill the leaking well using relief wells.Since the explosion at its Macondo well on April 20, BP has tried multiple ways to stop the leak. A previous containment cap, in place since last month, was only resting on top of the well and had allowed a large amount of oil and gas to leak into the water.BP began work on a first relief well on May 2, and it has reached a depth of 17,810 feet. It is intended to intercept the original well at about 18,000 feet. At that point, BP will pump heavy drilling muds down into the relief well to block the oil leak. If that fails, a back-up relief well, which was started on May 16, is being drilled. It is just below 16,000 feet.Kent Wells, BP’s senior vice president of exploration and production, told a presidential oil spill commission, which began holding hearings on Monday, that if the relief wells both fail, the company will put in place a permanent oil-collection system by late August or early September.BP said the cost of its containment and clean-up efforts had risen to about $3.5bn."
88;APA;Apache Corp;2010-07-12T21:12:32Z;Wall St posts small gains ahead of earnings;;US stocks inched slightly higher on Monday as investors cautiously awaited Alcoa’s quarterly results, after the market close, to kick off the earnings season.The aluminium producer posted modestly better than expected second-quarter earnings of 13 cents per share.Frank Germack, director of the investment department at Rehmann Financial, a division of Rehmann, said: “Folks are nervous about the next couple of weeks. We’re probably going to have a pretty decent earnings season, but earnings are going to be driven by cost reductions, rather than top-line growth.”Until there is an improvement in the labour market, corporate revenues will struggle to grow, he added.At the close on Monday, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent at 1,078.75. The index has risen 4.7 per cent this month.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 higher to 10,216.27 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1 per cent to 2,198.36.Alcoa fell 0.6 per cent to $10.87. Analysts’ average earnings estimate was for 12 cents per share for the second quarter.Hewitt Associates jumped 32.2 per cent to $46.79 as Aon, the world’s largest insurance broker by market capitalisation, agreed to buy the provider of human resources outsourcing and consulting services for about $4.9bn in a cash and stock deal.The move is aimed at expanding Aon’s unit that advises companies on employee pay and benefits.Shares in Aon fell the most in the S&P 500 index, down 7.1 per cent to $35.62.US-listed shares in BP rallied 8 per cent to $36.76 as the oil company continued work on a new capping system for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The cap could still take several days to install.The company is also reported to be in talks with Apache on a deal to sell stakes in its Alaska operations. Shares in Apache were down 3.2 per cent to $85.07. ExxonMobil rose 0.3 per cent to $58.94 amid speculation that the company may be considering a bid for BP.Johnson & Johnson lost 0.6 per cent to $60.21 as the consumer products company said it would buy Micrus Endovascular for about $480m to expand its portfolio of medical devices that treat strokes. It represents a premium of about 5.5 per cent to Friday’s closing price of $22.19. The company expects the deal to be “slightly dilutive” to full-year earnings per share. Shares in Micrus were up 4.5 per cent to $23.19.Weyerhaeuser was the session’s best performer as the stock rallied 8.4 per cent to $38.86. The timberland and forest products company declared a special dividend worth a combined $5.6bn. The pay-out to shareholders is part of its plan to convert to a real estate investment trust.Financial services stocks were mixed ahead of a number of banks reporting their second-quarter earnings later in the week.Bank of America and Citigroup, both of which report second-quarter earnings on Friday, climbed 0.7 per cent higher to $15.21 and 1.7 per cent to $4.11 respectively. Playboy surged 40.9 per cent to $5.55 as Hugh Hefner, its founder, offered to buy all the shares he does not own to take it private, in a deal that values the company at around $185m.Mr Hefner has offered $5.50 a share in cash, a premium of about 40 per cent to its $3.94 closing price on Friday. He already owns about 69.5 per cent of the class A common stock and 27.7 per cent of its class B stock.Qualcomm advanced 3.5 per cent to $35.10 as Goldman Sachs added the phone chipmaker to its “conviction buy list”, citing accelerating smartphone sales growth.Rival chipmaker Texas Instruments improved 1.1 per cent to $24.75, while Fairchild Semiconductor added 1.8 per cent to $9.27.Marriott International, the hotel chain, was down 0.6 per cent to $30.97 as the stock was downgraded to “market perform” from “outperform” by Jeffrey Donnelly at Wells Fargo Securities.Shares in Paychex, a provider of payroll and human resources services, was down 2 per cent to $25.75 as Jonathan Judge, the company’s chief executive, resigned to pursue other interests.
89;APA;Apache Corp;2010-07-11T21:38:37Z;BP nears date with destiny over its future;;"BP is approaching a pivotal date in its history on July 27. Three months ago, the group’s second-quarter results would have been expected to be unremarkable; another staging post in the group’s steady improvement in its financial and operational performance under Tony Hayward as chief executive.After the company’s massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Mr Hayward will now have to demonstrate that BP can survive.Industry experts still generally believe a bid for BP is unlikely, although not impossible.ExxonMobil is the most realistic potential buyer; PetroChina, while keen on further links, would probably find a full bid politically impossible.As Fred Lucas of JPMorgan Cazenove pointed out last month, a bid at well above BP’s closing price of 364.8p on Friday could still be earnings-enhancing for Exxon. The risks involved in such a huge deal, while BP faces as-yet unknown liabilities, would make a bid an uncharacteristic gamble for Exxon, but if BP continues to flounder it could appear an attractive option.The attempt to show that BP can have a viable future as an independent company will start with the second-quarter results. In the BP camp, there has been talk of a package of announcements that could draw a line under the Deepwater Horizon story, showing how the company had responded to the accident; moved to prevent such disasters ever happening again; restored its finances; and given investors a sense of its future direction.The reality is likely to fall short of that ambitious vision; there will be many aspects of the disaster that will remain unclear by the end of the month, and probably for many months to come. But Mr Hayward will have to deploy the strongest set of arguments that he can muster.First and foremost, BP’s future depends on plugging the leaking Macondo well. It is moving as fast as it can, but that operation cannot run to a timetable to suit BP’s financial calendar. Rushing the job and causing another accident, in what is a challenging and unpredictable area of the Gulf of Mexico, would be catastrophic. The first relief well, which would allow the well to be plugged with cement, is only six feet horizontally and about 200 feet vertically from its target, but Kent Wells, BP’s senior vice-president who gives the presentations on the operation, is always careful to stick to the schedule that the well will be plugged in August. Similarly, the new sealing cap that BP began to install over the weekend could allow the well to be shut off, but BP is being cautious about whether it can be done.Until the oil stops flowing, it will be hard to be clear about the total liabilities that BP will face. It will give an indication on July 27, but the imponderables in terms of economic damage, legal decisions, possible fines and other factors are still huge. There is also still a question over how much BP’s partners in the well, Anadarko Petroleum, which has 25 per cent of the project, and Mitsui, a 10 per cent owner, might be forced to pay.That question will depend on the outcome of investigations into the accident, which are still under way. Mr Hayward told staff last week that BP’s own inquiry would not deliver initial findings until August. Without knowing clearly what went wrong, it will also be hard for BP to offer a convincing plan for how it will stop such accidents happening again and, without that, its strategy will be in doubt.BP still wants to pursue the vision it was developing before the disaster of being a pioneer of deepwater development. It will be hard for it to persuade the US government it should be allowed to play such a role, although it may be able to continue in deep- water projects as a junior partner, allowing other companies such as Royal Dutch Shell or Chevron to take the key operational decisions.In spite of those difficulties, BP will say something about its future direction, and then flesh out the details in the autumn.The area where it can show the most progress is in stabilising its finances. Although analysts' estimates of potential liabilities are still vast, ranging up to $70bn-plus, since the deal with the US administration was reached on June 16 worries about BP’s liquidity have been easing. The price of its credit default swaps – the cost of insuring its debt against default – has fallen sharply since last month, and its share price has risen more than 20 per cent.It is also closing in on some asset sales. A stake in the giant Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska has attracted potential buyers, including Apache of the US, and the 60 per cent stake in Pan American Energy of Argentina could also be sold, say industry sources.With one or two disposals agreed, the concerns about BP’s financial position would ease even more. But while the short-term crisis may pass, the questions about BP’s future will take much longer to resolve."
90;APA;Apache Corp;2010-06-30T04:48:22Z;Gulf storm threat to spill containment;;Tropical Storm Alex reached hurricane strength as it entered the southern Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday and was threatening to hamper containment efforts at BP’s stricken Macondo well.The first hurricane of the Atlantic season, which was rated a “Category 1” storm for low strength, was likely to miss the site of the oil spill but was on course to reach on Wednesday the border region between Mexico and Texas, where Governor Rick Perry issued a disaster proclamation for 19 counties in order to prepare for the storm.Officials said heavy weather on the fringe of the storm could affect oil containment efforts.Kent Wells, senior vice-president at BP, said on Monday that bad weather would delay deployment of an additional oil containment system at the site until next week. In the meantime, around 25,000 barrels a day of oil would continued to be siphoned to the surface and work on relief wells would continue.Thad Allen, the US Coast Guard admiral in charge of the crisis, said on Sunday a severe weather interruption that forced an evacuation of vessels and personnel would shut down containment operations for two weeks at a time.Oil prices dropped back on Tuesday as the storm headed north-west away from the site of the spill. Producers including Shell, ExxonMobil, Anadarko and Apache were on Tuesday evacuating non-essential staff from offshore platforms in Alex’s projected path.Officials in south Texas readied rescue vehicles, shelters in San Antonio and Laredo and rushed supplies to the Rio Grande Valley.Bob Pinkerton, mayor of South Padre Island, a coastal community where the entire economy rests on tourism, urged residents and visitors to evacuate.A hurricane warning was in place for the coast of Texas south of Baffin Bay to the mouth of the Rio Grande, and along the coast of Mexico from the Rio Grande to La Cruz. Dos Bocas and Cayo Arcas ports, which handle 80 per cent of Mexico’s oil exports in the Gulf, have been closed since Sunday.At least 10 people have been killed in central America in accidents related to Alex, local authorities reported.State-run oil giant Pemex said its platforms in the Campeche Sound were working normally on Monday although it suspended helicopter flights to and from the facilities. Pemex was due to release an update later on Tuesday.
91;APA;Apache Corp;2010-06-11T19:40:49Z;Florida frets as BP spill hits tourism;;Within three days of the warning that the oil sheen was heading for Florida’s panhandle beaches, Geron­imo’s Outpost sold out of one particular item.The beachfront gift shop, named after the Apache rebel who was incarcerated for years in a fort a few miles away, saw a surge in demand for its corked, empty glass bottles.People were filling them with the dazzling quartz sand from Pensacola beach.“Tourists think they are never going to see this beach again – it’s a matter of time before the authorities close it off,” said Valerie Unzens, who runs the gift shop.“They fill the bottles with sand and shells. Some of them are even putting tar balls into them.”So far, the tar balls, washing up in small clusters along the seemingly endless beach, are the only direct evidence that Pensacola has seen of BP’s gushing well.But the town’s seasonal visitors, who come from across the country to sample the surf and seafood of the “Sunshine State”, see a different picture on their television sets.Whether it is the image of oil pumping from the well-head or the ominous blotches of slick expanding across the maps provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Pensacola’s tourists are cancelling their holiday plans.The town’s economy, which depends on tourism and business from a large naval base nearby, has suffered a rash of cancellations in the past 10 days. Some hotels report a decline in occupancy from 97 per cent to 40 per cent within the space of a week. New bookings have shrivelled.“The phones have gone silent,” said Laura Lee of the Pensacola Chamber of Commerce.The impact has also been felt in the town’s property sector, which was only just recovering from the severe downturn. Florida – a haunt for “snowbird” visitors from the colder north who like to spend the winters of their retirement there – was badly hit when the subprime mortgage bubble burst in 2007.“I had seven property deals in the pipeline and every single one has now been put on hold,” said Fred Simmons, a local estate agent. “If there was a hurricane coming, I could live with that. But it’s the un­certainty of this thing that’s eating me up. I’m 58 and I’ve no idea how long this will take to play out. It could take a decade – who knows?”The uncertainty is causing a headache for the 60 or so BP “community outreach” officers, who have been sent to the area to deal with compensation claims and clean-up efforts.For small claims of up to $5,000 (€4,140, £3,440) – local oyster fishermen, whose boats have been grounded, or bar staff laid off – the process appears to work.But for anything more complex, such as the revenue Mr Simmons has foregone in stalled transactions, BP is taking much longer. “We have tried to be as accommodating as possible,” said Garry Willis, head of the company’s outreach team, who pointed out that no claim had yet been turned down.“For example, for a start-up company with no prior records and no means of proving its income has declined, we are being as generous as we can. We are here to help and listen.”Often, though, the BP officers are simply a target of mounting frustration.“Did you hear that? They said they were here to help and listen,” said C.C. Herr, a barwoman at Hub Stacey’s, which she described as the local “Cheers” – a place where lawyers and fisherman rub shoulders after work.The bar is just a block from the BP outreach office in downtown Pensacola.“We can all tell you a different story,” she said. “I have had friends who have lost their jobs already. Is BP going to pay their wages?”It is a refrain that is likely to become familiar over the coming months. Unlike the hurricanes and even the recession, what scares local Floridians is the uncertainty.People talk of long-term ecological damage to the shrimping grounds and oyster beds – many of which have already been closed off by the NOAA.The price of oysters has soared by about 30 per cent in two weeks. “At the moment we are absorbing the losses,” said Beeler Gaunsz, manager of Peg Leg Pete’s Oyster Bar on Pensacola beach. “But if it continues, we might have to change our menus.”According to Brian Loma, who writes a weekly fishing column, the fish have already thinned out because of the smell of the oil slick, just a few miles away.“This is worse than Hurricane Ivan [which devastated Pensacola in 2004],” said Mr Loma, who was standing knee deep at a fishing point just off Fort Pickens, where Geronimo was held.Ordinarily, he says, there would be 30 to 40 other people beside him fishing for king mackerel, grey snapper and flounder. But Mr Loma is alone.“It’s like a hurricane in slow motion,” he said. “It could go on and on.”

Overall, earnings are likely to pleasantly surprise the markets.“The question is what happens after the earnings cycle. We are probably looking at seasonal weakness around the summer, where we could get a 5-10 per cent correction.”After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent at 1,211.67, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.2 per cent to 11,144.57 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.4 per cent higher at 2,515.69.UPS added 5.3 per cent to $68.89 after the package delivery company, which is often regarded as a bellwether for the wider economy, reported better-than-expected quarterly results after the session’s close on Wednesday and raised its full-year earnings forecasts.Adjusted earnings were 71 cents a share, up from 52 cents last year and above consensus expectations of 57 cents.Revenue rose 7 per cent, helped by significant volume growth in international markets.Rival FedEx, the world’s largest cargo airline, was up 1.7 per cent to $95.62.Yum Brands rallied 2.6 per cent to $42.78 after reporting strong first-quarter results after the close of the session on Wednesday.The company, which owns KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and other restaurant chains, said profit in the quarter rose 11 per cent, boosted by strong sales in China and a Pizza Hut $10 pizza promotion.Shares in Citigroup pulled back 2.4 per cent to $4.81.

93;APA;Apache Corp;2010-01-22T18:08:47Z;Nick Louth: Thrice in a lifetime opportunities;;In just 12 months, UK investors have been offered three once- in-a-generation opportunities.In March last year, shares began a record- breaking rally that took prices up 57 per cent from their lows. In corporate bonds, the recovery started in October 2008 and lasted several months. In permanent-interest bearing shares (admittedly, a more obscure opportunity), it began in the summer – as I mentioned in this column in October. In fact, this third opportunity still appears to be open, as some smaller building society permanent-interest bearing shares (PIBs) are not covered by credit rating agencies, and look unduly depressed.I took up all three opportunities, to the great benefit of my portfolio. Last year’s total return of 45 per cent was my best since 1999, and the 50.28 per cent from the UK portion was my best ever – more than making up for the poor results of 2008.Many of the bargains that I picked up should continue to generate returns for years to come.Although most of the price appreciation in the fixed-income investments has already taken place, the income generating effect will continue. Many of these holdings yield well over 10 per cent. I constantly remind myself that the most reliable engine of long-term growth is the reinvestment of income.However, by the third quarter of 2009, I was convinced that shares in most cyclical companies were fully-priced, though profitability improvements should eventually allow them to earn out their extended price/earnings (p/e) ratios. I have also cut my emerging markets exposure from 12 per cent to 7 per cent.Even so, I still have great faith in my remaining holdings in this area: Indian film producer Eros, property company Hirco, and East European warehouse venture Raven Russia. I have double digit gains in the former while the latter two broke into profit in the last quarter of 2009 as confidence in their respective property markets improved.Oil shares still make up about 15 per cent of my portfolio. I have long believed that pressure on oil supplies is going to be a reality for years to come, and it remains a key theme in my investment strategy. The first week or two of 2010 has confirmed that ebullient economies, such as China, and a recovering US will continue to underpin demand for oil. Americans are returning to their SUVs, while the Chinese are increasingly giving up their bicycles for motorcycles and then cars.But while most investor attention is focused on these large economies, the behaviour of smaller developing economies is significant, too. I saw Humvees in Laos and stretch limousines in Vietnam when I visited both countries late last year. These are for the wealthy, of course. But there is also change afoot among the ordinary citizens. Bicycles dominated in Hanoi when I last visited in 2000. Now there are 4m motorcycles in that city and another 6m in Saigon. Almost no one in the cities rides a push-bike any more, or so it seems. It is different in the countryside, but rural citizens are being drawn into high growth urban areas. These same effects are being replicated across the developing world.Oil is one of the easiest ways to take advantage of this, and my money is spread across a number of companies – from the high-yielding megacap BP, through US oil and gas company Apache, to high-growth plays such as BG.Nick Louth is an active private investor, writing about his own investments. He may have a financial interest in any of companies, securities and trading strategies mentioned.
94;APA;Apache Corp;2009-12-16T20:50:26Z;Oil price lift buoys prospects for Petrofac;;Petrofac, the oil services company, raised its full-year profits guidance as a higher oil price pushed its order book to nearly $8bn (£4.9bn) in value.The Aberdeen-based company, which guided the market in October to expect “at least 20 per cent” earnings growth year-on-year, said on Wednesday that profits would grow to “at least $330m”. That would mark a 25 per cent year-on-year rise from $265m in 2008.Much of the profit represents the fulfilment of long-term contracts signed before the financial crisis. That is why analysts focused on guidance on the value of Petrofac’s undelivered orders on its books as a sign of how the company has been influenced by this year’s volatility.The company expects the backlog on orders to be $7.8bn at the end of the year, a record year-end figure and a jump from $4bn at the close of 2008. Most of that gain came from its engineering and construction division.The company’s activities range from engineering and maintaining offshore oil rigs to training workers.New contract wins from BP and Apache in the North Sea have added to its lucrative business in the Middle East, where its Petrofac Emirates joint venture handles oil and gas projects in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The company has been helped by its national oil company clients, including Dubai Petroleum, whose annual capital spending does not necessarily fluctuate with the oil price.Petrofac said in October an “improving oil price environment is beginning to encourage our customers to resume some of their more discretionary expenditure”.The benchmark price of oil has risen from an average of $52 per barrel in the first half of the year to $71 on Wednesday, a paring down of prices that have hovered at about $80 in recent months.“Oil services have been affected by this [downturn] quite badly,” said Keith Roberts, finance director. “The reason why we have grown is because we win new business and execute it, and national oil companies are still spending money, whereas international oil companies are in retrenchment mode.

At least five bombings were reported, with the explosives detonating within minutes of each other, starting about 10.15am.The violence marred a week during which the government had hoped two positive developments – the passing of an election law and the forthcoming auction of oilfield contracts to foreign companies – would dominate headlines. Iraq’s three-member presidential council voted on Tuesday to schedule parliamentary elections on March 6, a seven-week delay from the original date, after months of wrangling over balloting.Iraqi and American officials say insurgents will probably try to continue attacks in the months leading up to the elections.One bomb apparently targeted a courthouse in Mansour district, in central Baghdad. Another was reported near Mustansiriya University, one of Iraq’s most prominent colleges. Another one, in Waziryia, detonated close to the Judicial Institute, where judges are trained.In the south-western neighbourhood of Dora, a suicide bombing was reported at a technical institute for engineers.Plumes of smoke darkened an already overcast, chilly day. American Apache helicopters buzzed overhead as Iraqi emergency vehicles rushed to hospitals.The bombings appeared to be the latest in a series of co-ordinated attacks carried out by al-Qaeda in Iraq. They underscored the relative ease with which insurgents continue to smuggle amounts of explosives through checkpoints in Baghdad.The bombing near the judicial college, which is surrounded by blast walls, left a large crater in the pavement. Hours later, city workers wearing orange vests swept the street as American and Iraqi soldiers surveyed the scene.Under an overpass, police officer Mustafa Tarkish collected identity documents, school books and other bloodied and burnt items gathered from the dead and wounded. The officer’s eardrum had been perforated and he had shrapnel in his left leg.Explosions will continue, he predicted. “Of course,” he said. “If the checkpoints don’t search cars, no one will stop this.”With many roads blocked off, thousands walked for miles to get home. “It’s about to become worse,” said Teba Adeel, 20, a medical technician student. “This has become normal for us,” classmate Hussein Ali, 22, added. “Ever since the fall of the regime.”Unlike co-ordinated bombings carried out in August and October, the attacks did not appear to be directed at heavily guarded government buildings. However, one of the targets was the headquarters of the Rafaidyan Bank in central Baghdad, which has been used by finance ministry employees since an August bombing rendered its headquarters useless.People who live near the bank said the explosives were packed in a small blue pick-up truck that drove into a narrow alley adjacent to the building. After the explosion, several members of a family watched silently as Iraqi soldiers sifted through a pile of debris where their two-storey house once stood.“The election is close,” said Jamal Mutar. “The politicians are killing each other.” His daughter Shukaryiah Jawad, 19, held her one-year-old daughter. “We need help from the government,” she said “I have nowhere to live. We’re in the street now.”Nearby, two Iraqi soldiers became angry when a journalist took out a camera. His colleague then gestured for the crowd to disperse, hoisting his M-5 rifle in the air, threatening to open fire.“These people are a failure,” Mr Mutar said. “All they want to do is cover up their failures.”By agreement with the Washington Post

Another measure is that two years ago, they were camping out at Kinshasa Zoo, after the disabled refuge in which they had been living – most of the band are polio victims, the rest street children – burnt down. A final measure is that, seconds after they started playing, none of the back story mattered. They were, without qualification or allowance, the most exciting band to emerge from Africa in years.Their music is based on Congolese Rumba, but with that music’s tendency to the saccharine mercilessly stripped away. Montana Kinunu, playing a miserly drumkit barely larger than the tea-chest on which it was built, pounded out rhythms around which Coco Ngambali played guitar. But the distinctive sound came from the teenage Roger Landu’s hand-built satong, cobbled together from a milk-powder tin and electrical flex. The satong produces sounds at the edge of comprehension: like a Theramin on steroids it hovers in apposition to notes rather than playing them directly. When Landu sank to his knees like a 1970s rock god, it screeched like a guitar in overdrive, but it could also waver like a rubber band, or flute like a choir of penny whistles.All sorts of music found their way into the set: ton-up rapping; mutated doo-wop; a country thrash with the be-stetsoned bassist, Cavalier Kiara-Maigi, twanging into Landu’s Apache whistles, with war cries and whoops from the band; woodpecker hammering from the drums heralding a pogo thrash; “Sala Mosala” reached for a reggae lope that stayed just out of reach, the singers chorusing in harmony, the satong trilling like a flute.The singers commanded the stage on shiny new wheelchairs, tidier and more compact than the cannibalised, hand-cranked vehicles they use in Congo. They twisted and spun like basketball players; one of the singers dived to the floor, dancing with his legs folded under him, hurling chittering ululations hard into the microphone, ending with a flamboyant somersault. Another danced between his crutches, turning them into a stage rather than a literal prop. Ricky Likabu, the group’s leader, was centre stage, propelling Landu into increasingly frenzied solos, keeping avuncular discipline over the band.“Très très fort!” they cried. Very, very strong. Very, very great. Very, very loud.

97;APA;Apache Corp;2009-08-21T18:46:20Z;Nick Louth: Enjoying an Indian summer;;The extraordinary stock market performance in July took me by surprise. Although I had ridden the early part of the March rally pretty well, my move in May to bank some profits on the most cyclical stocks left me partly on the sidelines as the rebound took the FTSE 100 up to 4700.One consequence of this rise was that I have been forced to unhedge my US holdings, by selling – at a hefty loss – the ProShares Ultrashort S&P500, which is an inverse exchange traded fund (ETF) that would have made money had the US market fallen. I had only bought it in May. So, rather than participating in the US rally since then, I have lost money – the profits on my holdings in oil firm Apache were not sufficient to offset losses on this Ultrashort ETF.But, in spite of having a third of my portfolio still in cash, a few of my equity holdings have performed so well that I have more than kept pace with the rising market. Prime among these holdings are two Aim-quoted Indian shares: property company Hirco and film company Eros. Both have soared as money came surging back into emerging markets.Hirco is an investment vehicle for India’s largest residential/commercial developer builder, Hiranandani, which focuses on the self-contained middle-class enclaves being constructed around major cities in the subcontinent. My first, small investment was made in June last year at 285p and was followed by a much bigger buy in December at 74p – which was at an incredible 90 per cent discount to net asset value (NAV). My overall breakeven level of 131p has been comfortably surpassed, as the shares have doubled to 180p in a month. Following tussles with the activist investor Laxey Partners, the good news is that Hirco is due to pay a maiden dividend this year.Residential sales remain strong and the Indian economy is growing fast. So, while governance remains murky, and the shares may pause for a while after their recent run, I believe there is more upside to come. A NAV of £6.72 per share, 5 per cent down from the year before is, I believe, likely to climb over the next 12 months.Eros has been even more spectacular. The Bollywood film company had a pretty good track record of beating expectations – until it was enmeshed in production delays, currency losses and the damage to sentiment caused by the Mumbai terrorist attacks. All of this led to a profit warning in March.Its shares were tipped by the FT magazine Investors Chronicle back in January when they were trading at 138p, but they continued to fall. I was lucky enough to buy at 55.75p – the absolute low point in March when the price-earnings ratio was just three.Since then, the shares have almost quadrupled, aided by bumper results from recent cinematic releases and strong TV revenues. With most of next year’s releases already funded, this is a company that looks to have good long-term prospects.In terms of other opportunities, my failure to anticipate July’s extended rally may have been something of an oversight, but I think it would be a far bigger mistake to chase it now, and pile in cash just ahead of the seasonally weak September period.Although I may pick up the odd bargain in defensive shares in the next month or so, I’d like to see a reasonable consolidation before I’m confident that the next upward leg can be relied upon.Nick Louth is an active private investor, writing about his own investments.

98;APA;Apache Corp;2009-07-20T22:09:15Z;US troops confront new obstacle;;The tip was as alarming as it was unusual. A Sunni insurgent cell was planning a mortar attack on a large US base adjacent to Baghdad’s airport.A credible informant told US intelligence officials last week that several mortars launched from nearby Ameriyah would rain down around midnight.Over the next few days, US Captain Dustin Navarro and his Iraqi army counterpart wrangled over the appropriate response. In the end, it became clear Iraqis and US commanders have markedly different notions of what US troops in Baghdad are entitled to do to protect themselves under a security agreement that began on July 1.Also clear was that the balance of power, at least in the capital, has tipped, fulfilling a principle the US has long paid lip service to, and now appears deeply worried about: Iraqis are in the lead.“Late that morning,” Capt Navarro, 27, said, “we started looking at the options we had.”A year ago, the most likely response would have been dispatching Apache helicopters to the suspected launch site. The pilots would have needed no more than evidence of “hostile intent” below to send Hellfire missiles roaring down.A month ago, Capt Navarro could have sent soldiers on foot, with or without notifying an Iraqi commander.But neither is now an option. Ever since the July 1 agreement and nominal departure of US troops from cities, the Iraqi government has taken steps to sharply limit their mobility and operations in urban areas. It has barred Iraqi ground commanders from joint patrols with the US and has warned that those who give US commanders undue leeway will be punished.Conflicting interpretations of the security agreement, US officials said, have led to numerous stalemates on the ground, including cases in which Iraqi soldiers have prevented US convoys from passing checkpoints. US officials contend the security agreement gives them vast latitude on self-defence, while Iraqis have interpreted it very strictly.Capt Navarro — who commands C Troop of the 5th Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division — alerted his Iraqi counterpart in the area, Major Ali Abdul Hussein Khadum, about the threat that afternoon.Maj Khadum said he would beef up manpower at checkpoints and flood the neighbourhood with his soldiers. Capt Navarro urged a more discreet response in the hope of catching the insurgents.“Success in my mind was preventing the attack and capturing the individuals with admissible evidence,” Capt Navarro said. “Success in his mind is that there is no attack and no one gets caught. Any attack or any capture would have been perceived as a failure on his part because it means enemy forces and mortar systems were able to get inside his checkpoints.”But the US officer was overruled and said he would send his own soldiers into the neighbourhood, a move opposed by the Iraqis. But one that U.S. officials contend they can take under the vaguely worded right to self defence in the security agreement that regulates their presence in Iraq.Maj Khadum said he wouldn’t allow it, according to Capt Navarro. Any joint mission now had to be approved directly by the prime minister, the Iraqi said.“The conversation lasted about half an hour,” Navarro said. “It got very contentious and heated.”That night, after Maj Khadum had militarised the area and declared an impromptu curfew, his US counterpart dispatched soldiers to Ameriyah to monitor the situation. Within 30 minutes, Maj Khadum approached their leader.“He said he regretted to inform us that we had to leave Ameriyah,” Capt Navarro said. The US forces did as they were told.The following morning, the source told US intelligence officials that the insurgents had abandoned the attack due to the heavy Iraqi Army presence in the area. Instead they had hatched an alternative plan to strike the US Camp Liberty that night, the informant said.Capt Navarro passed the information to Maj Khadum and said US forces retained the right to swoop into the neighbourhood if US troops monitoring video feeds from drones detected an imminent threat. Iraqi troops at the checkpoint better not try to stop them, Capt Navarro warned. Maj Khadum reiterated that US troops would not be allowed to enter.“I understand you have your orders,” Maj Khadum told Capt Navarro, who recounted the conversation later. “But I have my orders too. You are not allowed to go inside Ameriyah.”They reached a compromise. Capt Navarro could send a small team to monitor the situation from Maj Khadum’s base, but the Iraqis would do all the fieldwork – alone.“I was frustrated that these individuals would decide Ameriyah is too secure and would go somewhere else and still try to attack an American base,” Capt Navarro said. But there was little he could do about it. Acting on information collected by the Americans, Maj Khadum’s men searched a home and briefly detained a man that night.The two men provided different accounts of what happened in the house. Capt Navarro insists the informant was credible but Maj Khadum is equally adamant there was no threat.The major said his men warned the residents that they would be blamed for any attack launched in the area. But said he believed the suspect his men questioned, at the urging of the Americans, was an unlikely insurgent. He was disabled, walked with a limp and had limited mobility of one hand.“I cannot say he is innocent and I cannot say he is a terrorist,” Maj Khadum said. “But we didn’t find any evidence.”The informant, who Capt Navarro said US officials believe was credible and acting in good faith, told his handlers that the insurgents had left the neighbourhood.On Sunday, Capt Navarro and two of his officers visited the major at his base. They wanted to give him more intelligence reports about the would-be mortar attack and to have a dialogue without the tension of an imminent threat.Maj Khadum studied the reports and the two studied a map.“There was no threat,” said Maj Khadum, as the Americans sat at times shaking their heads.Maj Khadum said he is pleased that the US forces have been sidelined, not because he dislikes them, but because his men have long yearned to be in control.“I want to test my guys,” he said. “When US forces do a joint patrol, we depend 100 per cent on them. US forces are leaving some day. We want to test our forces and see if they’re ready.”Violence may continue to wreck Iraq for years, the major said, but they will deal with it.“I think some small things are going to continue to happen,” he said, such as assassination attempts, roadside bombs and magnetic bombs placed under vehicles. But the insurgents have lost the war, he said. “They are not going to once again have control of entire provinces.”
99;APA;Apache Corp;2009-06-26T17:32:17Z;Nick Louth: No need to liquidate oil;;While I have turned much of my share portfolio into cash since May, there is one sector that I have been reluctant to liquidate: oil.Though I would be the first to agree that much of the rebound in oil prices since March is not sustainable in the short-term, in the long term I do not want to be short of holdings in this vital commodity. My view is that while the recession has temporarily dented demand for oil, gas and its by-products, a much lengthier hiatus has occurred in supply.When oil prices were high, small oil companies couldn’t get drilling rigs for love nor money, and there was a shortage of engineers and much else that the industry needs. However, when prices tumbled from $145 last summer to under $40 six months later, there was a different problem. Financing deals that made sense at $60 per barrel or more fell apart when $30 hove into view.I’m sure that industry executives expected oil prices to recover, but the banks weren’t willing, or able, to take the risk of lending to them. According to Fatih Birol, chief economist at the International Energy Agency, $170bn-worth of investments in oil production have been cancelled in recent months, equal to about 2m barrels per day, or roughly 5 per cent of world demand.So, while the short-term position for oil may be bearish, the two-year outlook is undoubtedly very bullish. As a result, I still expect a near-term pullback in equity markets, but I would rather take any short-term weakness on the chin and keep my oil stocks than leave myself short for the longer term.The clutch of oil companies I hold runs the full range from the largest and most financially strong to the smallest of minnows.The only one in which I have sold out of completely is BP, where a holding for less than three months yielded a near 14 per cent profit at the sale price of 520p. That was done for a purely tactical reason in that I couldn’t imagine the expected fall in the FTSE 100 not being shared by its single largest constituent.With BG Group, I took a more cautious approach. This company has a tremendous position in liquefied natural gas, and a large stake in one of the most exciting oil finds in recent years, in the pre-salt fields off the coast of Brazil. BG remains a bid possibility for reserve-poor companies the size of Exxon or, conceivably, Shell – so I have retained the bulk of my holding.Dana Petroleum is a more modestly-sized company, but is a busy and successful explorer with plenty of funding for its relatively low-cost drilling operations. So, although I am barely breaking even on my near £14 acquisition price, I am confident that this company will yield a profit – either by organic growth or by being taken over.My holdings in Apache, the US-listed oil and gas producer, which I first bought for $49 in November 2005, I regard as a similar proposition. It has a great balance of oil and natural gas holdings, particularly in Egypt.The remaining two Aim-listed companies I hold in the sector, Roc Oil and Sterling Energy, have been less successful investments. Roc is well-financed and I expect eventually to recover my average investment cost of 67p, which is 25p above the current price. With Sterling Energy, I am less sure. The shares need to treble to get me to breakeven, and that seems unlikely.Nick Louth is an active private investor, writing about his own investments.

101;APA;Apache Corp;2009-05-17T21:34:35Z;Property developers prepare for bargains;;Signs are emerging that developers are preparing to raise cash to snap up bargains in the property market, as Great Portland Estates, the commercial property developer, readies a rights issue tomorrow to raise up to £150m.The group is expected at the release of its full-year results to announce a cash call for £125m-£150m in a deal advised by JPMorgan Cazenove and Credit Suisse, according to a person familiar with the situation.The UK has witnessed a slew of rights issues this year as companies queue up to repair their balance sheets and secure their future.However, if Great Portland were successful in its cash-raising mission, it is believed to be the first publicly-listed property company to launch a rights issue just to fund acquisitions.The West End property specialist, which owns the headquarters of New Look, last recorded a loan-to-value ratio of 39 per cent at the end of last year – lower than most rivals which have already completed rights issues.In February this year, Hammerson, the property developer, asked shareholders for £584m to pay debt and help prevent a possible breach of banking covenants.A week later, Land Securities turned to shareholders for £756m of emergency funds to ease the pressure on its straining balance sheet.Great Portland is expected to use the funds to continue buying up office blocks in central London.Apache Capital Partners, a private property investment manager, said it was also planning to raise up to £300m by October this year to take advantage of cheaper residential and commercial properties.Paul Orchard-Lisle, who co-founded the group, said: “The property market is seriously depressed and we can buy property now at prices that we believe to be below what they’re truly going to be worth. The UK property market is nearing the perfect time for the counter-cyclical buying opportunity of a generation.”The group, which is based in London with an office in Bahrain, said it would split its investments between residential, commercial and infrastructure purchases, mainly in London.Its partners – Roxylight Group, Moorvale, Headlington AM and Hill Capital – will put in up to 5 per cent of the first phase of funding and, if successful, Mr Orchard-Lisle said he would look to raise a similar amount in a separate fund.
102;APA;Apache Corp;2008-12-29T19:34:34Z;‘Even our homes are not safe. There’s nowhere safe in Gaza’;;"When I began to write this late on Sunday I was staying with relatives in a temporary shelter in an already crowded family home. I had left my own house on Saturday because my neighbours – the family of the wife of a Hamas executive force member – had received a direct Israeli threat.As I tried to concentrate on writing, the local radio station announced that the home of my cousin, Hassan Wishah, had been targeted and bombed. A missile had hit the lower floor of his building while he and his family were inside. He lived next to our evacuated house.It was not the only sad news we had heard since Saturday. My cousin’s wife has a sister who lives next to the Emad Akal mosque in Jabaliya, which was bombed and levelled at 5am on Monday morning, killing five children, the youngest of whom was four years old.Upon hearing of the raids, my cousin’s wife tried desperately to reach her family over the phone. The lines were down and mobile phones were barely functioning. She finally got through to another relative, who told her of the child victims.It is not easy to write when the blasts are multiplying. It is not the electricity cuts that prevents me from writing, not the words, or information I need. It is that the atrocious aggression that Israel has been waging since just after 11 am on December 27 continues at full speed, full strength, despite more than 300 dead and over 800 injured.Monday morning, I travelled 15km to my office in Gaza City, a hazardous trip, as the roads are open to Israeli F-16s and Apache bombing. After arriving at my office, at the moment I resumed writing this article, I was again forced to leave, this time because the building next to my office received a threat that an Israeli F-16 strike was
imminent.Then someone called to say that many people, including my family, around Azzadin mosque, in the central Gaza Strip’s Nusseirat, were being evacuated. The building, he said, could be bombed in a campaign that is targeting mosques all over Gaza.The outside world rightfully wants to know what is going on in Gaza, and I too want to know. Gaza has become a collection of isolated areas, where people are trapped in their homes for fear of being out on the streets. And, as it turns out, even homes are not safe. There is nowhere safe in Gaza.

103;APA;Apache Corp;2008-12-13T00:15:54Z;Virtual hostility;;"“Oh, crap.” Bombardier Paul Greenwood looks dejectedly at a small bank of computer monitors in front of him. In his left ear, he’s listening to the pilots of aircraft flying above him; he’s holding the right headphone away from his ear so he can hear the string of instructions being shouted by members of his fire support team.After listening for a moment or two, he winces and responds: “Er, roger, apologies for that.”What just happened?“I tasked an Apache to engage a target, then I completely forgot about him,” Greenwood says sheepishly, nodding beyond his computer monitors to the Afghan valley laid out below his hilltop position. A gun battle down there is becoming decidedly heated. “He couldn’t get through on the net to tell me he was ready to engage, so he’s had to go back to base. Which means I’m gonna get shouted at later.”Recriminations will have to wait. A British infantry convoy has suffered a direct hit from a roadside bomb, and the wounded must be evacuated; but the convoy is under fire from Taliban forces occupying a series of compounds around a mosque, so Greenwood and his fellow officers are co-ordinating mortars, helicopter gunships, jet aircraft and ground troops as they attempt to clear a path for a rescue team to reach the injured men.Greenwood, particularly, can understand the urgency. On his last deployment to Afghanistan, he was among a group of seven soldiers who, following a Taliban ambush, spent four hours pinned down in an irrigation ditch, under fire from guns and rocket-propelled grenades.With the men almost down to their last bullet, he made a 300m dash across open ground to retrieve the ammunition that helped them hold out until Apache helicopters arrived to drive away their attackers. He was awarded the Military Cross, the third-highest medal for valour. The citation said that “his courage was infectious and leadership inspiring throughout the operation”.In this new crisis, the officer commanding the soldiers on the ground has determined that the worst of the hostile fire is coming from the mosque itself, and gets on the radio to ask the forward air controller – Greenwood – to order an air strike on it. But that presents a problem of its own: for Operation Herrick, the British armed forces’ mission in Afghanistan, minimising damage to buildings is almost as high a priority as avoiding loss of civilian life. So the plan develops: Greenwood is to call in an aircraft to drop a bomb through the mosque’s dome that will kill or injure the Taliban gunmen inside but leave the structure – dome excepted – intact.“I need ground commander’s initials for this one,” Greenwood says into his headset. Turning round, he explains, “It’s ‘danger close’ – we have people within range of the bomb, so it could kill friendly forces. I need the ground commander there, who’s asking for the bomb, to give me his initials – so that if it comes to court, it’s his fault not mine.”With the initials confirmed, Greenwood begins to speak directly to the pilot of the “hog”, or American A-10 (an aircraft designed precisely for this type of close air-support mission), which will deliver the bomb. On one of his monitors, Greenwood can see what the pilot is seeing, and can confirm that the correct building is being targeted. He tells the pilot to approach using a route that will minimise the “splash range” of the explosion. “The friendlies are 400m away,” he explains. “I’m bringing the strike in from behind me, so there’ll be less frag [fragmentation – flying shrapnel] when the explosion goes off.” Two minutes later, the A-10 is overhead. The bomb is released and Greenwood and the rest of his unit watch as it falls. It hits the ground a few feet away from the building.“Oh, crap,” says Greenwood again, thumping his forehead with his fist. Behind him, Warrant Officer Paul Lester begins to chuckle. Lester turns to me: “Shall we go through to the command tent? If we go up there, we’ll see the major, who’s ultimately in control, under a bit of pressure.” He stands up, throws back the netting camouflaging Greenwood’s perch, and steps out into the chilly interior of a 60-year-old hangar on an RAF air base in Lincolnshire.…The Air Battlespace Training Centre is the British military’s latest weapon in the fight against the Taliban, and a resource that points to a possible future for integrated training of the armed services. Set up in an all-but-forgotten second world war hangar in a corner of RAF Waddington, it was initially only intended to serve as a concept demonstrator, to show that the air force’s flight simulators could be linked together to allow large-scale training exercises to be “flown” in virtual reality. But since bids to build it were invited in 2004, it has grown into a multi-force tool that now helps ground troops, air crew and naval officers get used to working together in complex, realistic operations.Waddington may not quite offer a dress rehearsal for war – the messy realities of combat always include too many unknowns for even the most complex simulations to predict – but it’s as close as is presently achievable: a facility that allows all branches of the military to work through elaborate battle plans and scenarios, and to make mistakes without anyone getting hurt. “We’re not training pilots how to fly a Tornado or a Harrier, and we’re not training a forward air controller how to control a fast aircraft or an attack helicopter,” says Mike Costello, a wing commander and the centre’s commanding officer. “We’re training the whole team to work together better. The more we can drill into them at this stage, the more it becomes automatic for them when they’re on the ground and under fire. Ultimately, what we’re trying to do is save lives.”The holistic approach to training embraces new realities on the ground – literally. Whereas the prevailing wisdom since the second world war has been that wars fought by the west would be won through superior air power – and particularly so since the first Gulf war and the Nato bombings of Belgrade – conflicts such as Iraq and Afghanistan have demonstrated the vital importance of ground troops, and therefore of co-operation, too, between all divisions of western armed forces. Indeed, some of the most tragic stories of military casualties coming out of Afghanistan have been about those that may, in part, have been caused by a lack of troop co-ordination: for example, Robert Foster, John Thrumble and Aaron McClure, who were killed last year when an American fighter providing air support for ground troops dropped a bomb near their patrol; or Mark Wright, the 27-year-old who was killed in 2006 by a land-mine set off by the down-draft of a helicopter meant to rescue him and other soldiers from a minefield.…The Lincolnshire Centre is run by the RAF but was developed by Team Active, a consortium of industrial partners led by the private defence contractor QinetiQ and including the US aerospace giant Boeing. It is laid out in sections, and dominated by the flight simulators. Four giant, sawn-off golf ball-shaped structures are configured as Eurofighter Typhoons, their domed screens, like personal planetariums, wrapping around the cockpit to give a more realistic sense of flight. Opposite, sit four smaller, rectangular rooms in which Tornado bomber pilots practise using a large, flat screen. There’s also an attack-helicopter simulator and a room in which the interior of a surveillance aircraft – the E3-D Sentry AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System) – is mocked up and ready to use.At the end of this corridor of simulated aircraft, tents house the artillery’s synthetically rendered corners of the battlefield, where wall-sized screens replicate positions overlooking the exercise’s target area. Two of the tents are occupied by the front-line fire support teams (Greenwood’s colleagues) while a third is home to the joint fires cell – a sort of air traffic control centre for war zones – to which the fire support teams report. This cell has ultimate responsibility for ensuring that missions are “de-conflicted” – that aircraft aren’t hit by mortars, bombs don’t fall on ground troops and unmanned surveillance aircraft don’t get in the way of helicopters or fighter jets – a technical process because every weapon system works so differently.Long-standing attempts to minimise risks to air crew, coupled with the specific challenges of counter-insurgency operations, mean that unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) have largely replaced the fast, high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft of the cold war, expensive planes designed to fly over large-scale combat zones and nation states. The unmanned drones which have superceded them fly lower, slower and closer to each island in a archipelago of battle zones, so making them more suited to this new military environment of unpredictable, often small-scale, skirmishes with the enemy.But even as the UAVs remove pilots from the list of potential casualties – the Reaper, for instance, which the RAF uses in Afghanistan, is flown remotely by pilots stationed on a US air base in Nevada – their use has increased the workload for forward air controllers, or FACs, who direct air missions from the ground and ensure that UAVs, manned aircraft and ordnance do not collide.The search for a viable training regime for FACs has been going on since the role was created during the second world war, when the idea that front-line troops could help to direct aircraft first took root. Traditionally, FACs are trained in live environments, on bombing ranges, but for safety reasons the aircraft are kept much further away from ground-fired mortars and targets than they are in combat, so the training experience has always differed markedly from the reality.“I qualified as a forward air controller a couple of months ago,” says Greenwood. “At Otterburn [an RAF bombing range], we had mortars firing as we were calling the Tornados in, but they were dropping on targets that weren’t there – on cut-outs on the ground. Maybe elsewhere, in Canada say, there are ranges where we could engage with guns and practise on an air range as well, so we could do it all in one place.“But this” – the training centre – “is the next best thing.”Live exercises are hugely problematic on a practical level. The massive deployment of men and machines poses a logistical nightmare, while the increasing civilian demand for commercial airspace and the relative lack of large tracts of uninhabited land make them almost impossible to do properly in the UK. Factor in the costs – even after a five-year RAF stream-lining exercise halved Tornadoes’ running costs, it still took almost £6,000 to put one in the air for an hour last year – and the attraction of synthetic training becomes easier to grasp.Right now, the simulators at the training centre use landscapes from the deserts of the American south-west: a visiting US Air Force pilot takes control of a Typhoon simulator and buzzes the Bellagio fountains on a 10-second tear down the Las Vegas Strip. But programmers can insert whichever buildings, bridges, roads and people an exercise demands. By March, the centre’s systems will be using a database of Afghanistan’s landscape and infrastructure – an off-the-shelf, commercial product made by the American simulator company CAE – which will add a final layer of realism to the RAF Waddington experience.A serviceman just back from Afghanistan told Costello that, apart from the background, the simulators represented an exact facsimile of the military’s experience in theatre. “So,” says Costello, “having the Afghan database will make the experience completely immersive. People think Afghanistan is just a desert, but it’s not: it has forests and fields, and some of the areas look like the UK. Guys will be able to go out there and say, ‘I recognise this area.’”…The training centre has a further advantage over live exercises: as well as running the scenarios, the facility’s computers record every detail of every exercise. After each training mission is over, a team known as White Force, led by former military personnel now working for the private consultants Inzpire, analyse and collate the data, creating a three-dimensional animation depicting everything that went on in the battlespace. The animation can be stopped, speeded up or slowed down, and the images rotated through different axes to show the precise relative locations of every aircraft, weapon, target and simulated human (both friendlies and enemies) at any given moment. This forms the heart of an extensive post-exercise debriefing, where all involved get to see and understand exactly how the decisions they made affected everyone else.“The debrief is the jewel in the crown,” says Lester, who is at Waddington’s as part of the Royal Artillery’s gunnery training team. “That’s when they [the servicemen] get to see the bigger, three-dimensional picture, which they don’t get when they’re just playing their part in the exercise. The debrief is where you can see the penny dropping: the guys go from thinking in two dimensions to being three-dimensionally aware. It used to take years before you were like that.”Since its inception, ideas about the purpose of the Air Battlespace Training Centre have changed dramatically. At first it was thought of as a facility intended primarily to benefit pilots, whereas now it is also seen as a way of providing ground troops with indispensible training. Jon Saltmarsh, programme director for synthetic training at QinetiQ, recalls wondering, early on, whether forward air controllers would benefit much from the training or whether they would just be the cogs in a machine primarily aimed at pilots. “If you looked at any of the paperwork beforehand, it was all about airplanes,” he says. “Yet what’s actually come out of it was that this is the best training the FACs are seeing anywhere, and they want more of it.”That the centre exists at all is down to an unusual degree of co-operation between the different branches of the armed forces. Sea, land and air services are known to compete with one another almost as fiercely as they engage the enemy – but it’s a stereotype conspicuously absent here. Which is not to say that the experience jettisons internecine rivalry entirely; an armed forces internet message-board carried a post in June that read: “We simply would not have this capability if it weren’t for the fact that it is in RAF hands. The army would have comprehensively f**ked the whole thing up.”…If the training facility has a whiff of the business world about it, that may be because it represents the military’s logical extension of a 20-year trend in business life: teleconferencing. The Waddington simulators are linked to navy facilities at HMS Dryad, near Portsmouth, and to similar centres in Germany, Canada and the US. “The biggest exercise we’ve conducted involved five different bases,” Costello says. “Three from America, one from Germany and ourselves, all linked together, fighting a medium-scale war.” The simulators link up using standard public broadband networks, and, despite the data having to be encrypted and decrypted on its way in or out of each facility, there is no discernable delay. So when a pilot in a simulator in Canada flicks the switch to release a bomb, to all intents and purposes the weapon enters the battlespace at Waddington instantaneously.There were technological hurdles, but the main problems were legal and contractual. “I don’t like to say that the technical bit is easy to solve,” says Saltmarsh, “but the biggest challenges have been overcoming the security rules and getting the right bits of paperwork in place that say, ‘Yes, you are actually allowed to connect this up and get it to work.’The western world’s armed forces would prefer to increase the proportion of training that takes place this way: the cost benefits are considerable, after all, if you can “fly” missions with Canadian, German and American air forces without any aircraft leaving the ground.Yet, even as the new centre helped prove to the British armed forces that the technology could work over a distributed network, trainee feedback suggests that having the participants in the same location has several key benefits. The pilots and soldiers brought together today will be working side by side when their units deploy: when the ground troops, from 127 (Dragon) Battery of the 19th Regiment of the Royal Artillery, return to Afghanistan in March, these pilots, from 12(B) Squadron at RAF Lossiemouth, will head out alongside them. That means that the pilots the forward air controllers hear in their headphones during today’s training will be the same people they’re calling on for air support in a real operation in Afghanistan.As well as aiding the basics of communication in a high-pressure scenario, there are further, if less quantifiable, benefits. Both forward air controllers and pilots appreciate the chance to learn what sort of pressures other people on different teams are under, so the opportunity for a pilot to sit in on a fire cell and experience something of what they go through, or for FACs to stand in the simulators and see the ground situation from a pilot’s eyes, is already helping in live operations. “I understood the guns and mortar de-confliction completely before coming here,” Greenwood says, “but learning how the aeroplanes de-conflict themselves has helped massively. The pilot is really just another soldier, only he’s in the sky and has a bigger payload to engage targets.”Both servicemen and trainers agree that the training centre will have a profound impact on live operations. The last group to train there, from 3 Commando Brigade, have already reported that their experience earlier this year brought “significant” benefits in their current deployment.…This wouldn’t be true if the facility failed to provide a steep learning curve – and in the debriefing session, Greenwood’s mosque strike came under fire of the verbal kind. “You can’t do that,” was the clear directive handed down: and that came even before the bomb missed its target. (One of the remaining technical challenges facing Team Active is simulating the precision of a laser guidance system; in actual combat, bomb targeting is considerably more accurate.) Costello explained later: “If it’s a case of saving lives, then we may have to target a building like that, but it’s something we definitely would avoid at just about all costs. We’d first do a show of force over the top of the enemy position, and as we’ve found in the past, if you get a fast jet flying over the top of the Taliban, they’ll run away. They now know what comes at the end of that, and how it can escalate.”While the specific shape of the training at Waddington is closely tied to operational demands in Afghanistan, the people behind the Air Battlespace Training Centre are looking to the future. “The military as a whole are looking very seriously at taking synthetic training forward,” Costello says. “In around 15 years’ time, or possibly even sooner, we could have a brigade exercising out in Canada, and it will be feasible for us to provide them with air support from the simulators here at Waddington; we will see exactly what’s going on on the ground in Canada on our simulators, and they will see the aircraft flying overhead using their virtual reality helmets.“Beyond that, if we had a deployable training device over in, say, the Middle East, then the squadron there could link back in to the Air Battlespace Training Centre during their time off and practise different scenarios to make sure they kept their skill levels high.”Moreover, as new conflicts emerge, new databases can be added, so troops can train on any number of ever-more realistic landscapes – from Iraq and Afghanistan to prospective battle-zones, such as Iran.Still, there are limits. “You can never rehearse for war,” Costello warns. “But with the synthetic side, what you can do is say, ‘Right, this is what happened last week – let’s run it again synthetically and see if there’s a better way of doing it in the future.’”…………………………………………………………………………Making it real: From mod concept to international training centreThe commercial background to the Air Battlespace Training Centre is almost as complicated as the technology inside it. The Ministry of Defence initially invited bids from companies to build a concept demonstrator. This was to prove that a network of simulators allowing synthetic exercises to take place simultaneously in different locations was viable. Lockheed Martin, CAE, BAE Systems, Boeing and QinetiQ were among the companies to express an interest in the contract.Once Boeing and QinetiQ realised they were both planning bids, they decided to form a consortium, which went on to win the contract. Team Active (it stands for Aircrew Collective Training through Immersive Virtual Events) also brought in four other groups: Aviation Training International, a Boeing/Westland joint venture that specialises in Apache helicopter training; cueSim, a flight simulator company part-owned by QinetiQ; a second QinetiQ company, HVR Consulting, which handles contractual and research work; and long-time MoD supplier Evans & Sutherland, which, upon selling its simulation arm to Rockwell Collins, yielded its place in the consortium to the US aerospace company.The MoD asked for a 30-month programme for £7.8m or less. The concept demonstrator phase ended in March 2008, but the contract with Team Active has been renewed for another five years. The site is now undergoing a process of “ruggedisation”, turning its ad-hoc structure into something more permanent. It will reopen in March."
104;APA;Apache Corp;2008-12-12T22:32:27Z;Field of dreams;;An international food fair is part of the festivities at the Cathay Pacific Hong Kong International Races on Sunday. The British contribution, alongside the likes of Hungarian goulash, Swiss raclette and the local “glutinous rice with air-dried sausages”, is shepherd’s pie. Sturdy fare but hardly an eye-catcher.English horses will hope to provide a rather more exciting contribution to what is billed as the “Turf World Championships” at Sha Tin racecourse.It is a moot point who really stages the “world championships”. Dubai’s World Cup meeting in March provides the richest prizes but comes before the European season has begun. America’s Breeders’ Cup in October comes when that season has pretty well finished and lacks Asian and Australian entrants. Hong Kong, between the two, supports its claim with a significant, if not compelling, HK$62m (US$8m) purse for its four Group One races.In the Sprint, Mile, Vase and Hong Kong Cup races, there is a strong international line-up with 17 local horses being challenged by eight each from Britain and France, four apiece from Japan and the US, three each from South Africa and Germany, two from Australia and one from Singapore. The total includes 16 individual Group One winners.The hottest contest of this year’s four races could be the Sprint. To keep the foreigners coming, the Hong Kong racing officials might even welcome a home defeat, for local horses have won it on each of the past six occasions, including two victories for the local hero Silent Witness.The favourite this year is Apache Cat from Australia, trained by the little-known Greg Eurell. Apache Cat, whose white face on a chestnut body looks as though he ducked his head in a bucket of paint as a foal, has won five consecutive Group Ones this year at home on all sorts of ground.His main rival is likely to be Europe’s sprinter of the year, Marchand d’Or, trained in France by Freddy Head, whose three Group One victories included the July Cup at Newmarket, England.The Mile looks open too. Contestants include Good Ba Ba, Hong Kong’s horse of the year, who won it last year and then collected the region’s other four Group One races between 1,400m and 1,600m. He faces tough local competition from Egyptian Ra, who dominated Hong Kong’s trial race for this event but who is badly drawn.From the US comes Kip Deville, first in last year’s Breeders’ Cup sprint and second in this year’s contest, but the surprise packet could be Britain’s Pressing. He has looked magnificent in track work, goes well at this time of year and in September won Europe’s richest mile race, the Topkapi Trophy in Turkey.The 2,400m Vase was won last year by Doctor Dino, trained in France by Richard Gibson, who has picked up prize money with him as far afield as Canada, Singapore, Dubai and, most noticeably, in the US’s Arlington Million.His rivals include Australia’s Douro Valley, winner of the Group One Yalumba Stakes at home, and Luca Cumani’s Purple Moon, just beaten in the Melbourne Cup in 2007, the year he also won Europe’s richest handicap, the Ebor in England. Purple Moon ran poorly in the Japan Cup recently but there was no pace in that race and he will have the firmer ground that he prefers.The intriguing entrant here is another British competitor, Ralph Beckett’s Muhannak. He won at the Breeders’ Cup but there, and elsewhere, his significant successes have come on a synthetic surface, rather than turf. Can he translate his top form to the green stuff?The Cathay Pacific Hong Kong Cup, the world’s richest 2,000m turf race, is the prestige event and the home crowd will hope that local hero Viva Pataca, Hong Kong’s highest-rated horse for some while, can make it third time lucky. A fast-finishing second to Sun Classique in Dubai this year he was an unlucky runner-up in last year’s Hong Kong Cup.But Sun Classique’s South African trainer Mike de Kock might deny the locals their treat. De Kock admits he was “shouting like a man possessed” through the final stages of the Breeders’ Cup Turf at Santa Anita in October, sure that he was going to win it at his first attempt with Eagle Mountain. But the colt was just beaten over two furlongs further than tomorrow’s race by Conduit, winner of England’s St Leger.The 2,000m will suit Eagle Mountain perfectly. He has been second in an Epsom Derby, in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket and now in the Breeders’ Cup but De Kock will not hear of him being beaten tomorrow.Viva Pataca and Eagle Mountain, however, may not have it all their own way. Irish trainer Jim Bolger is quietly confident that in Lush Lashes, Europe’s filly of the year, he has one to beat the boys – and he is not one for making rash forecasts.They just may have to add Irish stew to next year’s international menu.
105;APA;Apache Corp;2008-11-16T23:24:28Z;Beijing pressures US over Taiwan arms deal;;China’s defence ministry is insisting that full military-to-military exchanges with the US cannot resume unless Washington scraps plans to sell more than $6bn worth of advanced weapons to Taiwan and stops contacts with the democratic island’s armed forces.The strong line from Major General Qian Lihua, director of the ministry’s foreign affairs office, suggests the Chinese military is determined to ensure that the US pays a price for a decision last month to sell Taipei arms, including Patriot air defence missiles, Apache helicopters and F-16 spare parts.China cancelled a series of military exchanges with the Pentagon after the decision by the outgoing administration of George W. Bush to approve the long-delayed sale, setting back a fragile warming of relations between the US military and China’s People’s Liberation Army.“The US government and military have used the Taiwan issue to …‘needle’ China,” Maj Gen Qian said.“We demand the US change its ways, cancel its plans to sell weapons to Taiwan and stop its exchanges with the Taiwanese military. Only if they do so can the PLA and ministry of national defence resume normal relations with their US counterparts,” he said.China, which considers Taiwan part of its territory, argues that continuing large-scale US arms packages for the island are a breach of a 1982 promise by Washington to gradually reduce such sales.However, US officials have insisted that any reduction of sales was always dependent on Chinese commitment to peaceful resolution of its differences with the now democratic island – and that the administration is anyway bound by domestic law to supply Taiwan with weapons for its self-defence.Last month’s package was much smaller than the original $12bn (€9.5bn, £8bn) arms proposal, a change one senior US official said was intended to achieve a balance between boosting Taiwanese security and overly antagonising China.During his campaign, John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate, called on the Bush administration to reconsider its decision not to sell new F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan, but President-elect Barack Obama has been more circumspect on the issue.Maj Gen Qian said China had cancelled some mutual visits and other exchanges with US defence counterparts, but declined to give details of which events had been affected, citing a “tacit agreement” not to discuss them publicly.While some analysts in the US have said that China has always been less enthusiastic than the US about military exchanges because of the PLA’s strategy of keeping its capabilities secret, Maj Gen Qian insisted that Beijing was well aware of the value of contacts and co-operation in maintaining regional peace.“However, such military-to-military exchanges have been subjected to frequent disruptions over the Taiwan issue,” he said. “The Taiwan issue remains the biggest obstacle in both state-to-state and military-to-military relations between our two countries.”
106;APA;Apache Corp;2008-10-13T14:01:39Z;Taliban fighters attempt to seize Helmand;;Almost two hundred Taliban fighters surrounded and attempted to seize the provincial capital of Helmand, the southern Afghan province that provides most of the world’s heroin, during almost eight hours of fighting on Saturday night.The extraordinary four-pronged, massed-attack on the headquarters of the UK military and diplomatic presence south of Afghanistan once again undermined Nato claims that Taliban insurgents have been weakened and are only capable of small skirmishes and guerrilla attacks.According to a British military spokesman, around 175 insurgents in four different groups attempted to encircle Lashkar Gah.Heavy fighting and airstrikes left around 60 fighters dead and 30 wounded.Apache helicopters were called in to fire missiles on insurgents near the Bolan bridge, just a few miles from the Provincial Reconstruction Team where British and US officials are attempting to develop Helmand from a heavily defended base guarded by one hundred UK troops.More fighting was expected on Sunday night, with reports that suicide bombers inside the city limits would be involved in coordinated attacks.And an extra company of UK marines were sent to the city to bolster security and to mount continuous patrols of the city.Local aid workers also reported rocket attacks on the city’s police headquarters and the compound of Gulab Mangal, the technocratic governor of Helmand who has earned a reputation in his seven months in the job for grappling with the province’s many problems, including rampant corruption and the drugs trade.Mr Mangal denied there had been any shelling of his compound and said the Taliban were just trying to prove that they are still a force to be reckoned with and to ”attract international media attention”.But details of the fighting suggest a concerted attempt to seize the city and destroy fragile gains made by Mr Mangal and his international backers this year.It also appeared part of a deliberate attempt to foil a major push to roll back Helmand’s poppy fields with the fighting breaking out on the same day as three day operation to clear the neighbouring district of Nad Ali was completed.The district is part of the 24,000 hectares of poppy fields around Lashkar Gah which Mr Mangal is hoping to transform into a wheat belt.Officials started distributing wheat seeds and fertiliser to farmers who had come into the city on Saturday.Counter-narcotic officials hope that farmers will take advantage of high wheat prices to abandon poppy this year, the highly lucrative crop which insurgents levy a 10 per cent tax on.”They are going head to head with the Taliban, and they don’t like it,” a western civilian in Lashkar Gah said on condition of anonymity ”They will find it much harder to tax lorries full of wheat than a few kilos of dope”.Mr Mangal claimed the fighters involved had come in from neighbouring Pakistan, who are thought to be more radical than local insurgents motivated more by hatred of a weak local government and corrupt police force.UK diplomats have recently claimed that while the situation in Helmand is fragile, security in the provincial capital has greatly improved and that the appointment of Mr Mangal was helping them turn a corner against the insurgents.But the difficulty of the mission has led senior UK government strategists to recently call for a greater concentration of British effort and resources in Afghanistan on Helmand, the country’s largest province.Security sources say that the government hold on Lashkar Gah is extremely weak, with the Taliban having effective control of the city after nightfall.Supporters of Sher Mohammed Akhundzada, a former governor of the province who was ousted at British insistence in 2005, are also thought to be undermining security in Helmand.Mr Akhundzada exerts strong informal control over the province and remains in the favour of President Hamid Karzai who pushed for Mr Akhundzada’s reinstatement in the last month.
107;APA;Apache Corp;2008-10-05T16:38:23Z;China attacks US arms sales to Taiwan;;Beijing has denounced US plans to sell Taiwan more than $6bn (£3.38bn, €4.3bn) worth of weapons as a “crude interference” in China’s internal affairs that would harm its national security and put obstacles in the way of peace.However, China’s foreign ministry stopped short of threatening any retaliation over the arms package, Washington’s biggest for Taiwan in more than 15 years, saying only that Beijing “reserved the right” to respond further.China, which backs its claim to sovereignty over Taiwan with threats of war, has long sought to restrict its democratic rival’s access to the advanced weapons needed to maintain a credible defence against the People’s Liberation Army.“We once again urge the US side to recognise the harmfulness of weapons sales to Taiwan …and avoid further damage to Sino-US ties and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” the foreign ministry said.Taipei welcomed the arms package, originally agreed by the Bush administration in 2001 but had been stalled by feuding in the Taiwanese legislature and US displeasure at former Taiwan president Chen Shui-bian.Despite its scale, the years of delay and a removal of some items from the package – which still includes Patriot air defence missiles, Apache helicopters and F-16 spare parts – means its impact on the military balance across the Taiwan Strait has been reduced.Analysts say Taiwan must rethink its defence strategy as China’s rapid military modernisation sharply reduces the island’s ability to achieve air superiority.Mr Chen’s strategy centred on keeping conflict offshore by holding Chinese submarines at bay with maritime patrol aircraft, fighting off air attacks and maintaining strong anti-missile defences – while also developing missiles able to hit the mainland.However, in a widely discussed paper this year, Bill Murray of the US Naval War College argued Taiwan should adopt a “porcupine strategy” aimed primarily at preventing China from taking the island.“New Chinese submarines, advanced surface-to-air missiles and, especially, short-range ballistic and land-attack cruise missiles have greatly reduced Taiwan’s geographic advantage.“Taipei can no longer expect to counter Chinese military strengths in a symmetrical manner, with Patriot interceptors, diesel submarines, surface warships, F-16 fighters, and P-3 maritime patrol aircraft,” Mr Murray said.
108;APA;Apache Corp;2008-10-03T23:13:55Z;US to go ahead with $6bn Taiwan arms deal;;The US plans to sell $6.5bn in weapons to Taiwan as part of a long-awaited package intended to boost the island’s ability to defend itself.The Bush administration on Friday notified Congress of the proposed sale, which includes Patriot missiles, Apache helicopters, submarine-launched Harpoon missiles, Javelin anti-tank missiles and spare parts for F-16 fighter jets.Taiwan will welcome the package following earlier signs that the US might not proceed with the sales. Admiral Timothy Keating, head of US Pacific Command, ignited controversy earlier this year by saying the US had frozen arms sales to Taiwan.The move comes as relations between Taipei and Beijing continue to improve under since Ma Ying-jeou assumed office as the new Taiwanese president in May. But the package is significantly less than an earlier $12bn proposal, and does not include Blackhawk helicopters or money to study the possibility of acquiring diesel submarines.In 2001, President George W. Bush approved a $12bn package, but the sales were delayed as the Taiwanese legislature repeatedly failed to provide funding. Although Taiwan approved funds in 2007, the US was by then reluctant to proceed because of a deterioration in relations between Beijing and Taipei under Chen Shui-bian, Mr Ma’s more assertive predecessor.One former US official said the slimmer package adhered to the “Goldilocks theory” of being “not too hard, not too soft to try to preserve things with Beijing”. A senior US official said the White House believed it could proceed with the sales now because Washington had restored a “very solid, very productive and positive relationship” with Taipei.“President Ma needs these sales to demonstrate that he is doing the right thing for his people. On the other hand, we did not want to put such a large package forward that it would disrupt the positive trends in cross-strait relations, so we made a calculation to reduce the size of the package.”The official added that some of the weapons not included in the package could be considered at a later point. But he said the Bush administration had decided not to consider submarines, since none of the countries that build the diesel vessels were prepared to sell them to Taipei.Michael Green, former senior Asia adviser to Mr Bush, welcomed the proposed sales, which he said would remove any doubt that the US was committed to the defence of Taiwan. But he said the decision to postpone consideration of submarines, and the unwillingness of the Bush administration to consider F-16 sales, would give the next administration a difficult starting hand in dealing with cross-strait relations.The Bush administration has refused to accept a letter from Taiwan requesting permission to buy F-16s. Mr Green said accepting the letter “would have been a nice additional touch” to the package announced yesterday. Another former Bush administration official criticised the decision, however, saying US credibility had been reduced by refusing to sell some items that had been previously approved in principle.Sources in Taiwan expressed relief that the overall decision had not been left to the next US administration.”The fact that the administration stalled these sales although funds for them were earmarked by parliament here more than a year ago has made many people feel that Washington was considering factors other than our defense needs, and that would be in violation of the Taiwan Relations Act,” said a senior government official in Taipei.”If that had led to the failure of the entire package, such a precedent would have changed the way the US’s commitments to Taiwan’s security are interpreted.”A failure to secure at least some of the heavyweight items – such as the Patriot missiles - agreed upon more than seven years ago would also have considerably weakened Mr Ma, who has lowered tension with China by taking a flexible and low-key stance on sovereignty, the key point of contention between Taipei and Beijing.Although the People’s Republic of China has never ruled Taiwan, it claims the island as part of its territory and threatens to attack it should Taipei officially declare its independence.In response to Mr Ma’s willingness to consider unification with China an option in the very long term and not to assert Taiwan’s sovereignty, Beijing has re-opened dialogue with Taiwan which had been frozen for almost a decade under Mr Chen. The two sides have started discussing measures to expand economic exchanges.In the political and military area, however, little progress has been made, and distrust sits deep. Military experts in Taiwan said a failure to secure the weapons systems would have been particularly dangerous as the government was neglecting adjustments of its defense strategy.”In our current situation, we would need a proper threat analysis, done by the military,” said Andrew Yang, one of Taiwan’s leading defense experts. ”But that is not happening. Instead, the focus is completely on politically improving relations with China.”Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2008Email the reporter at Demetri.Sevastopulo@ft.com
109;APA;Apache Corp;2008-07-15T22:30:30Z;Missile deal signals shift in MoD stance;;Britain has made a radical shift in the way it procures missiles, moving from competition towards partnership with industry.In an agreement signed on Tuesday designed to protect operational sovereignty, the Ministry of Defence awarded six new weapons programmes to a group of UK companies known as Team Complex Weapons. It comprises MBDA, Thales UK, Qinetiq and propulsion company Roxel UK.The £250m assessment phase of the contract was launched at the Farnborough International Airshow, from where Baroness Taylor, defence procurement minister, said the industry team would “help to maintain the UK’s key skills and technologies in missile development and protect our operational sovereignty in this sector for the future”.The move marks a shift away from a 20-year policy of competition towards protection of key industries. The government wants to secure the most effective mix of military capability, value for money and sovereign capability in the process of building, maintaining and upgrading missiles.The shift is expected to result in fewer types of weapons being developed, but those that are would be more adaptable and flexible to meet the requirements of the armed forces.New projects include a “Loitering Munition” programme for a weapon that hovers over a battle zone for several hours before striking an appearing target, and a 50kg air-to-ground missile for combat aircraft such as the, Eurofighter Typhoon and Apache helicopter.The initiative was first announced by Lord Drayson, predecessor to Baroness Taylor, two years ago. Since then the industry has undergone a significant transformation that has reduced its capacity by about 25 per cent in the UK.“Do not underestimate this agreement,” said Steve Wadey, industrial chairman of the team and managing director of MBDA. “This is a change in approach for the MoD and industry.”The MoD said that despite the partnership approach future competition would not be ruled out.Baroness Taylor refused to answer questions about the fate of specific procurement programmes. The MoD is reviewing its programmes in a bid to reduce costs.Baroness Taylor said that defence spending in the UK was higher than it had ever been, but she acknowledged that meeting the military’s urgent operational requirements was “very costly”.She said: “Our aim is to get the balance right and learn lessons from operations to ensure that in the next 10 years or so we can support operations while developing our capability for the long term.”BAE Systems, the country’s largest defence company, owns 37.5 per cent of MBDA and a similar stake is held by EADS, the Franco-German defence group. The balance is owned by Finmeccanica, the Italian company.
110;APA;Apache Corp;2008-06-27T15:11:59Z;Australia counts cost as gas output hit;;Between 3pm and 7.30pm every day, Raymond Gianoli, the owner of Western Australia’s biggest laundry, finds out whether his business will be allocated enough gas to operate the following day.“Last week we had no gas three days out of seven,” he says.“Our weekly turnover is down by about A$100,000 [£48,320, €60,990, US$96,000] and we are trading below our break-even point. How long can a business sustain this kind of situation?”It is a question being asked across Western Australia in the wake of a devastating industrial accident three weeks ago, an explosion at a natural gas hub on Varanus island, that has deprived the state of 30 per cent of its supplies of gas, its primary fuel source.The local energy office said this week that 46 percent of gas users in the state, home to globally important iron ore, nickel and gold mining projects, had been forced to reduce or suspend operations.In the immediate aftermath, Apache, the operator of the Varanus Island gas processing and pipeline facility, predicted it would be two months before normal operations were restored.But this week it said it would resume partial services only in mid-August and did not expect to be fully operational until December.The fallout from the shortage is being described by the state’s Chamber of Commerce as “the most significant challenge to WA business and the local economy in recent years”. It estimates that as many as 15 per cent of local businesses could close within three months.But with Western Australia’s resources boom lifting the national economy in recent years, the country’s gross domestic product is also set to take a hit. Macquarie, the Sydney-based investment group, estimates the fallout could shave a quarter-point off Australia’s third-quarter GDP. As it is, the Australian economy was expected to slow this year, with the consensus forecast for calendar 2008 about 3 per cent, down from the 4.3 per cent recorded in 2007.The difficulties have again highlighted the struggles of a vast, resource-rich but lightly populated country depending overly on a small number of suppliers in several key sectors. A similar accident 10 years ago at the Esso-operated Longford plant in Victoria left that state without gas for nearly three weeks at a cost to the local economy of A$1.3bn.Although some of the world’s largest known gas reserves lie off Western Australia, Apache is one of only two suppliers feeding the 1,500km Dampier-Bunbury pipeline that transports gas from the Pilbara region to Perth and beyond.With supply already tight because of strong domestic and export demand, however, the pipeline’s other provider, the Woodside-operated North West Shelf, has been able to make up only 50 terajoules of Apache’s 350 terajoule shortfall.Alcoa, Newcrest and Minara are among the resource groups that have downgraded profit estimates because of the disruption. Minara, Australia’s second largest nickel miner expects full-year production from its Murrin Murrin nickel mine in the state to be up to 7,000 tonnes lower than its 38,000 tonne forecast, a revision that has helped drive up global nickel prices.With the state government bringing a decommissioned coal-fired plant back into production and persuading the federal government to release part of the defence forces’ emergency stockpile of diesel, others may fare better.“It is hard to estimate who is going to lose production. There is a lot of substitution with other energy sources,” says Matthew Hassan, economist at Westpac in Sydney.Mr Gianoli says it will be at least a week before Prime Laundry is offered a possible alternative. “If you are large you can use your muscle to get to the front of the queue. It’s people like us in the middle that are in no man’s land.”
111;APA;Apache Corp;2008-06-11T18:18:45Z;Gas blast hits Alcoa profits estimates;;Alcoa saw its shares fall 6.5 per cent on Wednesday after the US metals group said it would be unable to fulfil its alumina supply contracts and downgraded its second-quarter earnings estimates.This is one of the consequences of last week’s explosion at a gas processing plant in Western Australia. Several other mining companies in the state, one of the world’s most important minerals-producing regions, are also cutting targets for this year following the accident, which has reduced local gas supplies 30 per cent.“We view the gas situation in [Western Australia] with some concern,” said Marius Kloppers, chief executive of BHP Billiton, the world’s biggest mining group.Alcoa, the world’s largest producer of alumina, said it did not yet know the impact on its customers but expected the disruption to reduce its expected earnings per share of about 72 cents by 2-3 cents.The US group is one of the first to quantify the financial impact of the accident at the gas processing plant and pipeline on Varanus Island. It is clear that losses will be substantial.Apache, the US energy group that operates the facility some 100km offshore, has said it will be about two months before normal services resume. Woodside, operator of the North West shelf, Western Australia’s only other significant source of gas, will only be able to make up a small proportion of Apache’s shortfall.The accident highlights Austalia’s vulnerabilities because of its geographical isolation.The state’s infrastructure was struggling to keep up with strong demand for minerals even before the incident. Exports have also been hampered by severe weather.“The fire at Apache’s Varanus Island gas plant has provided an additional headwind for earnings that were already struggling in the face of the Australian dollar, record oil prices, wet weather and infrastructure-constrained coal production and largely flat metal prices,” said Citigroup in Sydney.Newcrest, the gold producer, and Minara, Australia’s second biggest nickel miner, are among the other groups that have cut output targets. Minara expects full-year production from its Murrin Murrin nickel mine in the state to be up to 7,000 tonnes lower than its 38,000 tonne forecast. Newcrest expects to lose 30,000 ounces of gold production at its Telfer operation.Goldman Sachs JBWere estimates that each five-day loss of output at Telfer will cut Newcrest’s earnings by $7m, assuming no recoveries from insurance.The disruption will also complicate the planned A$2.5bn ($2.37bn) flotation of Burrup Holdings. The ammonia producer is one of the biggest users of Varanus Island gas and has been forced to cease operations for the moment.
112;APA;Apache Corp;2008-03-26T21:07:05Z;US shares fall as recession fears reinforced;;Wall Street stocks fell on Wednesday, snapping a three session winning streak after new data suggested the broader US economy faces a downturn and concerns about banks’ earnings weighed on sentiment.Durable goods orders in February unexpectedly dropped 1.7 per cent - and by 2.6 per cent excluding volatile orders for transport equipment - according to the Commerce Department.John Ryding, chief US economist at Bear Stearns, said: ”This weaker than expected report points to declining capital spending in the first quarter, falling orders, and a significant pickup in inventories in relation to sales. This is another report that has a strong recessionary feel about it.”The numbers for machinery orders were notably anaemic and the news hit shares in General Electric and United Technologies.GE fell 0.3 per cent to $37.15 while United Technologies dropped 0.8 per cent to $69.61.The series comes after another batch of economic indicators on Tuesday highlighted plummeting confidence among consumers in the US and further pain in the housing sector.Richard Parower, managing director at J&W Seligman, said: “Now that we have moved past the euphoria about Bear Stearns being bought out and the steps that central banks are taking, we are back to thinking about micro-economics and about consumer confidence and the like.”The benchmark S&P 500 index - which fell as much as 1.2 per cent - closed down 0.9 per cent at 1,341.13 points, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 0.7 per cent to 2,324.36 points.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.9 per cent to 12,422.86.Separately, the Commerce Department reported that new home sales in February fell less than expected but still at the slowest sales pace since February 1995.Analysts at Morgan Stanley said the data, in addition to other recent reports, suggested home sales could be approaching a bottom but shares in house builders tumbled nonetheless.Centex fell 8 per cent to $23.73 while Lennar lost 6.8 per cent to $17.59.Hovnanian fell 9.4 per cent to $11.05 after Moody’s cuts its rating, citing losses, high debt and a weak macro environment for the economy and for housebuilders.Moody’s said the ratings outlook for the company was negative.The banking sector was also in sharp focus again after Germany’s Deutsche Bank warned that disruptions to revenues and writedowns relating to the global credit crisis could threaten its annual profit targets.On Tuesday a number of banking analysts cut their estimates for the sector, pushing financials into the red.That trend continued after Oppenheimer analyst Meredith Whitney slashed her forecasts for earnings in fiscal 2008 by 84 per cent on average and said further downgrades were likely.Ms Whitney sharply cut her estimates for Citigroup by 309 per cent to reflect possible writedowns of $13.1bn in the first quarter of 2008, on mortgage backed securities and other assets.Citigroup shares fell 5.9 per cent to $22.05 and an index of investment banking shares fell 4.1 per cent.Bank of America, the second-biggest US bank by assets, dropped for a second day, falling 2.8 per cent to $39.84, while Wachovia lost 6.7 per cent to $28.02.Fresh doubts emerged about the Clear Channel takeover. The two private equity firms leading a $19bn buyout of the largest US radio operator are at odds with banks financing the deal, increasing speculation that the deal could collapse.Clear Channel shares plunged 17.3 per cent to $26.93 in morning trading.Technology stocks too were sold off as investors worried about what third quarter results from Oracle, after the close, might contain.Oracle, often seen as a bellwether of the US technology sector, was down 0.7 per cent at $20.94 at the close.Microsoft fell 2 per cent to $28.57 and Novell also dropped 0.6 per cent to $6.52.Commodity-related stocks were the exception to the bearish mood, climbing for a third straight day as oil prices rose and further dollar weakness sustained the recovery in gold, base metals and agricultural commodities after last week’s sell-off.Gold miners Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold and Newmont Mining added 5.4 per cent to $97.44 and 1.3 per cent to $47.44 respectively.Shares in oil companies rose after analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein said crude oil will average $92.30 a barrel this year, up 27 percent from last year as declining reserves increase extraction costs.The New York-based investment firm also raised its price targets for related companies including Apache, which was among the biggest gainers on the S&P 500, up 6 per cent to $119.75.But higher oil prices hit airline stocks. American Airlines shares slid 10.6 per cent to $8.61 and Delta shares fell 12.3 per cent to $8.74.
113;APA;Apache Corp;2007-12-21T16:57:22Z;Nick Louth: Still banking on the old faithfuls;;"I guessed 2007 would be a tough year in the markets, and so it has proved. In spite of having more than half my portfolio in cash from May and through most of the summer, it looks like I will end the year roughly flat, in line with the UK market as a whole.Certainly, I have done well to have kept a more than average amount of my resources in cash. Even now, about a quarter is on deposit at rates close to the Bank of England base rate. A top-down view shows up some sectoral errors during the year, though. I had too few holdings in mineral companies and relinquished the holdings I had too early. Having bought shares in Australia’s Consolidated Minerals at 77p, I took
profits at 118p in May, just before renewed takeover interest pushed the shares to 207p.My much larger interest in oil companies didn’t compensate for missing the mineral boat. Though I made large profits in both my American oil holdings, explorer Apache and refiner Valero, I assumed that oil prices would, like last year, peak around the Labor Day holidays when in fact price rises persisted well beyond. The oil stocks I have retained, explorers Roc and Sterling Energy, have basically shrugged off the price of crude and drifted for much of the year.Perhaps the biggest sectoral error was in buying back too quickly into banks. As I said previously in this column, I have long been a fan of banks, which have an enviable long-term ability to make money from us, and my portfolio is normally overweight in them. The average sectoral total return of bank shares (i.e. including reinvested dividends) is normally just behind tobacco and utilities, and way ahead of most other FTSE sectors.I had seen there would be trouble this year, and my exit was okay. For example, I was right to sell my Alliance & Leicester shares at £11.60 in July. However, I underestimated the duration and extent of the weakness which was to hit the sector, and the unprecedented liquidity squeeze. I bought some A&L back at £7.57 in September, which being 35 per cent below the sale price looked like a bargain. However, as we all now know, prices continued to tumble. I have bought more at 660p this week. Is that crazy? I don’t think so. The bank has no significant exposure to sub-prime mortgages, has funded itself into the third quarter of 2008 and has continued to buy back its own shares.My guess is that the worst is over for UK bank shares, so I am happy to have recently added to my stakes right across the sector. Yes, the mortgage market will continue to slow in 2008 and, yes, we will see a rise in defaults, but from a low base. Deposit growth, aided by the cannibalisation of Northern Rock’s customer base, and by a renewed interest in saving will help underpin balance sheets.I’m particularly bullish about Barclays, where I have upped my stake substantially in recent days. This is one sector where I intend to ignore the market and remain patient. The run on Northern Rock will be worth a chapter in UK banking history but it will still be a minor theme compared with the power of trusted and familiar brands which keep barriers to entry, and profits, so high.Sectors aside, I have been pleased with the performance of some stock picks in 2007. Tanfield, bought in 2006 for 24.5p brought me huge gains with a sale in July at an average 180p.Other equally good companies, whose fundamentals remain unimpaired, have fallen sharply in recent weeks though. Inspired Gaming, the gaming technology firm, and Inmarsat, the satellite telecoms firm, both fall into this category. Two recent picks, Charter, the engineering group, and Mothercare, the babywear retailer, have fallen quickly below purchase levels for no fundamental reason.For 2008, I’m anticipating some initial recovery in January and then a renewed slide in a broad range of sectors. I’ll stay away from small-cap stocks for now. Once again, keeping a larger than usual cash position is going to be important.Nick Louth is an active private investor, writing about his own investments.

114;APA;Apache Corp;2007-11-23T12:07:04Z;Nick Louth: Keep it in cash and hold nerve;;These are times for investors to keep their nerve. Soaring oil prices, rampant inflation in basic commodities and a credit squeeze across the banking sector have produced some of the most peculiar sector rotation I have ever seen in my near-20 years as an investor. The market seems to be saying that the emerging markets growth will be fine, even if there turns out to be a recession in the US, even if banks are afraid to lend money and even if the western consumer decides to start saving instead of spending.A bursting of the Chinese stock market bubble, again, will not have much effect either on Chinese economic growth or the investments western firms have made there.There is much here that makes me sceptical. As I have said before, the most natural reaction to this scepticism has been to stay in cash. With a third of my portfolio on deposit at high interest rates, I feel I am protected against the worst of the downturn, and am ready to move in a hurry should bargains appear.Commercial property has been one of the hardest hit areas in recent months, and I have been looking around to see if there was anything there that offered good value. I mentioned in this column in September that Land Securities was looking interesting at around £15. In fact I held off buying because although the discount to net asset value (NAV) looked good, the NAV on which it was based did not look secure. With the shares now at £13.80, I’m glad I waited. In spite of posting better than expected NAV figures this month, and having garnered a reputation for being unusually nimble, Land Securities is still enmeshed in a property world in which values are declining overall. I shall look again in a few months.For a surer footing in property, I have looked abroad. In this column in March I mentioned Dawnay Day Carpathian, an Aim-listed property vehicle that specialises in the very best quality eastern European retail property. The company has a NAV of 119p, which, according to Numis Securities, is expected to rise to 137p at the year-end. Why would I trust this if I doubt the figures for UK property companies? Quite simply because the trend in Dawnay Day’s NAV is up, not down, and there are several reasons for it. There is a rising middle class in eastern Europe, whose consumer aspirations are buoyed by the economic growth caused by accession to the EU. Not only is consumption underpinned by strong local economic growth, but in the case of Poland, Bulgaria and Romania, by soaring remittances from workers overseas. Many of the sites chosen by the company are either shopping centres or single- site supermarkets.I initially bought shares in Dawnay Day at 110p. However in recent weeks they have dipped as low as 88p. With a discount to NAV of 36 per cent and a dividend yield of 11 per cent, this is just absurdly cheap, so I almost doubled my stake at an average price of 90p. I am quite happy to keep taking the dividends until the market becomes a little more discriminating in its victims.My bullish position on oil shares, as I recounted on previous occasions, was to be aware of the US driving season as its effect on oil prices and refining margins is often quite marked. The season begins on the Memorial Day holiday, the final Monday in May, and ends on the Labor Day holiday, the first Monday in September. I had already done well this year with my large holdings in Apache, the US oil explorer, and Valero, the refiner, but when oil prices reached record levels in June I decided to take profits, assuming that the usual August correction would soon come. Apache I sold at $87, and Valero at $76 on average. While Apache cruised on to $106 at one point, my call was better on the refiner, which is now trading $10 below my sale price. Overall it was still enough to give me a 20 per cent profit on my US portfolio (reduced by the weak dollar). Still, with the S&P 500 flat for the year, I shouldn’t grumble too much.Nick Louth is an active private investor, writing about his own investments.

115;APA;Apache Corp;2007-11-15T20:12:50Z;Oil groups to invest $267m in southern Chile;;Chile said on Thursday it expected $267m worth of investments from international oil companies to develop nine remote oil and gas fields in the far south of the country.It was Chile’s biggest oil and gas tender and is part of an effort by the energy-starved country to secure future reserves. Chile relies on oil and gas for more than half its total energy needs and currently imports all its gas from Argentina, but artificially low prices and surging domestic demand there have led Buenos Aires to slash exports over the past year.“This is a record figure which has surprised us greatly,” Karen Poniachik, mining minister, said after the results of the tender in the Magallanes basin near Chile’s frozen southern tip were announced.Ten blocks were originally offered but Bahía Inútil received no bids. In all cases, the private companies will be the operators of the fields, but in three they will partner Enap, the state Chilean energy company.Greymouth Petroleum, a private New Zealand company, won four blocks – Porvenir, Brótula, Isla Magdalena and Caupolicán – in exchange for a total investment of $107.4m (€73m, £52m). In Caupolicán, it will partner Enap. Brótula and Isla Magdalena are offshore blocks.The US group Apache will invest $48.3m in two blocks, Russfin and Lenga, the latter in partnership with Enap.Total of France committed $44.5m to the Otway block, while Pan-American Energy, a unit of BP, is investing $34m in Coirón, which it will develop with Enap. The US-Swiss-based IRB-Manas consortium will invest $33.2m in the Tranquilo block.Chile has been producing very small quantities of oil from Magallanes for decades but discoveries by Enap in the Lake Mercedes area, which the company has still not quantified, have boosted interest in potentially commercial production.“These are big international companies and the fact that they are coming to Chile shows they are convinced [there are hydrocarbons],” said one Chilean official. “We know there is gas, but we don’t know how much.”Chilean factories suffered severe power cuts during the last southern hemisphere winter because of a sharp fall in exports from Argentina.The government just managed to avoid cuts in residential supplies, but ministers admit that 2008 will be a very tricky year. However, Chile expects a liquefied natural gas terminal it is building to free it of dependence on Argentine gas from 2009.
116;APA;Apache Corp;2007-09-19T15:34:45Z;Tango Fire, Peacock Theatre, London;;"As if to disprove the old phrase, it takes 10 dancers and four musicians to provide the rhythms for Tango Fire, now installed at the Peacock Theatre. This latest Argentinian import is great fun, of course, and is even more fun as the evening wears on – a certain amount of fake bonhomie and even more dubious emoting by the cast is lost in the flash and thrash of limbs.The opening moments are dire, as the women chuck everything except their shoes at the men and at us. The men riposte with an over-choreographed fight, eye-balling and indulging in what may pass for machismo, but the production by Carolina Soler then contrives to mind its manners, and we can enjoy the complexities of step, the helicopter-blade whirlings of the women’s legs as they are flung to the four winds by their chaps.This is tango on the rampage, sometimes like manic ice-dancing, often reminiscent of that ancient and dangerous sport, the Apache dance. Its theatricality is sure, its demands exact, its nature never in doubt. But if you seek more stylish, more elegantly sensual and more refined (odd word to use of the tango, but the greatest performers I have seen boast an almost Mariinsky sense of form) then look elsewhere.Yet if you do, you will miss the verve that is this show’s best card. Or almost best, for the music provided by the resident Quatrotango group (piano, bandonéon, double bass, violin) is sensationally good. These are very fine musicians, living absolutely inside their scores, with a pianist (Gabriel Clenar) of exemplary
artistry, nuance and rhythmic bravura. There is a singer, Javier di Ciriaco, who claims the songs for his own, and the five couples produce marvels of elaboration on the tango manner, the women thrown and twisted like scarves round the
men’s necks.The female costuming tends towards the flashy – richly sequined and cut to reveal nearly all – but the men stick mostly to suits with matching shoes, the occasional fedora, and brilliantine generously applied. A jolly evening.

117;APA;Apache Corp;2007-08-24T16:44:57Z;Nick Louth: Bargain-hunting with a wad of cash;;Sometimes you do the right thing without realising just how important it is destined to be. In this column on May 26 I wrote that I was intent on substantially increasing the proportion of cash in my portfolio. This is something I do most years in May, in accordance with market seasonality, and it has rarely proved a bad idea.This year, with the FTSE 100 moving closer to record highs and the interest rate ratchet gradually tightening, I felt further progress was in doubt. There were additional question marks over the Chinese bubble, funding for private equity bids and so on. I didn’t mention subprime lending in the piece, but it was clearly something with the potential to knock the US economy off the growth rails.Well, I pursued my strategy throughout June and July, taking the proportion of cash from 27 per cent to almost 80 per cent. I unwound most of my oil price hedge in June as crude prices approached the peak set in 2005. The hedge was designed to cushion the portfolio from rising oil prices and fulfilled its potential early in the US driving season. I took profits in US oil explorer Apache at $86.96 and in refiner Valero at an average price of $76.50. These have contributed to a year-to-date performance of 18.5 per cent in the dollar-denominated part of my portfolio.The other contributor was storage software maker, EMC, which I had bought a year ago at $10 and sold at $15.31 in May. Good though this profit was, I had failed to anticipate that it would reach $19 by the end of July.Among UK shares, I sold almost everything outside of a few Aim-listed minnows before the market falls began. These included most of my banking shares. Among these was Alliance & Leicester, which I acquired for £8.80 in January 2005 and sold at £11.60. I really don’t expect that a takeover is likely just at the moment, and on other fundamental measures the bank was a touch expensive. So convinced was I that the markets were due a substantial fall, that I sold some of my steadiest performers, outsourcing firms Capita and Serco, at 761p and 480p respectively. Like most of the sales, they were made with the intention of getting back in again at lower prices. By the time the sharp market falls struck on July 24, I could watch with equanimity as prices tumbled.Though I am a long-term investor, with most stocks held for a year or two, I do enjoy contrarian bargain- hunting. The trick is not to get too excited too quickly about the first scent of attractive prices, because they may become even more enticing as a correction develops.In my estimation we have long been due a substantial correction, as the 52-month rising bull trend since March 2003 is one of the longest on record. Though I do not regard myself as a chartist, those in this field who I respect expect some further falls in the S&P 500, and I will be leaving plenty of room for that.That said, there are some fascinating bargains already on offer in banking shares. They weren’t expensive before, and some are now astoundingly cheap. Though there may be undisclosed subprime exposure within the UK banking sector, it is hard to feel it is not discounted by the price falls we have already seen. I have already bought Northern Rock, being unable to resist a price of 645p, which gives a forward p/e of 6 and a dividend yield of 6.2 per cent. I also bought into HBOS at 845p, and Barclays at 610p. Those give forward p/es of 7 and 7.6 and dividend yields of 5.3 and 5.2 per cent respectively. I find the best way to get really good prices is to set limit orders at prices well below current trading levels, and see if they get triggered during volatile trading sessions.One of the firms I acquired this way was Xstrata. I had already sold my few stakes in mineral companies, but once prices got really low last week I could not resist a renewed foray into the sector. Despite the company’s phenomenal cash generation and share buyback potential, Xstrata has fallen 30 per cent from £35 to £25 in two months. With little chance of an immediate slowing of the Chinese economic juggernaut, this is just too low.All this activity has been a little frenetic for a month that is normally slow, but it has been worthwhile. If the market recovers sharply I will surrender some of these purchases into the rally, because we almost always get a second downward leg to market falls. I’m still determined to keep a hefty portion of cash. With the FTSE still 2 per cent down on the year to date, I’m well satisfied with my overall return of 9.2 per cent.
118;APA;Apache Corp;2007-08-13T21:30:06Z;Red faces at Facebook;;"The leak of a few hundred lines of Facebook’s source code over the weekend caused a bit of a tempest as bloggers questioned whether the breach had compromised security at the popular social networking site. But beyond some red faces at Facebook HQ, the accidental disclosure – apparently the result of a mis-configured Apache server – is unlikely to do lasting harm.This morning I spoke to Dave Marcus of McAfee Avert Labs, a web security outfit. Here’s what he had to say about the debacle:If you’re going to have some of your pages exposed though a server error, this is probably the one you’d want. There doesn’t seem to be any user data. This would be step one of an attack, information gathering. There’s good intel to be gained here about Facebook and the infrastructure it’s running on. But this doesn’t give me anything I want if I’m looking to root the server or make a duplicate application.As concerns about a dire security breach die down, tech-savvy bloggers have begun poking fun at some of the more colourful comments left by Facebook’s developers in between their bits of source code. Well-commented computer code is rare and to be commended, but in Facebook’s case, its ample annotation includes gems such as ""an error can also be here because the

119;APA;Apache Corp;2007-05-25T16:59:10Z;Nick Louth: I’m not looking so stupid after all;;Stupidity and brilliance are not always a state of mind but quite often a state of market prices. In this column in December I described how I had in the previous two years hedged my portfolio against the risk of higher oil prices by filling it with various types of oil companies.The idea was that if further squeezes on the supply of oil materialised, the price rises in my oil sector picks would mitigate the price falls caused in the more general universe of shares that I held.These companies, bought throughout 2005 and 2006, included explorers Sterling Energy and Roc, gas explorer BG, mid-size US production firm Apache and specialist US refiner Valero. Though I have tweaked these holdings, having disposed of gas explorer BG, I still largely have my holdings intact, and they currently account for around 12 per cent of my portfolio.The trouble with taking such a long-term hedge against a volatile price as that of oil is that at times you look brilliant and far-sighted and at other times you look, well, stupid.I was going through a ”stupid” patch when I last wrote about this subject in December when crude prices were languishing at around $50 a barrel. I can now report that I am feeling the tingle of “brilliance” beginning to course through my veins, as prices edge up towards $70. It will probably last until around August, when oil prices (if recent history is any guide) will temporarily peak, depending on how the hurricane season pans out. If I still hold all these shares by next December I will probably start to look stupid again. Indeed, having predicted here what might happen, I would be stupid indeed not to learn from last year’s experience.Though I should perhaps not have held on to my hedge beyond August as oil prices started falling, I did at least do something that wasn’t stupid. As I said in December, it would be a mistake to abandon these cheap oil companies when oil prices were low if, as seemed likely, a renewed price hike was on its way in 2007.One cycle to learn from is a seasonal one. The US “driving season” begins on the Memorial Day holiday, the final Monday in May, and ends on the Labor Day holiday, the first Monday in September.The driving season (an odd term which makes it sound like Americans might be tempted to walk at other times of the year) coincides with the peak of gasoline (petrol) demand. While other types of oil, such as heating oil, are in demand during the winter months, it is in the run-up to the driving season that stocks of gasoline become crucial.This is where my holding in refiner Valero comes in. The US is incredibly short of refining capacity. Not a single new refinery has been built in the US for almost 30 years, and none looked like being built until Hurricane Katrina came along in August 2005 and put a significant chunk of the country’s refineries out of operation.Permission was then granted in 2005 to construct one in hurricane-free Arizona, but a local judge has just this month halted work because the site may contain Indian artefacts. In any case, the $3.7bn plant will not be completed until 2011 at the earliest. The lack of new capacity not surprisingly puts a strain on the old plants. The usual refinery shut-downs for maintenance before the driving season begins have been unusually extensive and slow this year, which has hit gasoline stockpiles hard.That leaves Valero, as one of only a handful of pure play refiners sitting pretty. Gasoline prices at a record $3.19 per gallon (equivalent to 35p per litre) may look like a bargain to British eyes, but they are 10 per cent higher than the already hefty levels seen a year ago, and are enough to yield a massive $35 per barrel profit to refiners.It is perhaps not surprising then that Valero shares have climbed from $51 to $78 this year, outpacing the 18 per cent rise experienced in a more crude-orientated oil play such as Apache in 2007. Despite the 50 per cent profit I’ve reaped already on Valero, the stock trades at less than 10 times analyst consensus forecasts for fiscal 2007. No wonder I’m feeling clever now.The tricky part will be choosing the moment to sell. Certainly I would be surprised to be still holding all my Valero stake by the middle of August, but I may even sell up sooner if refineries start to come back on line rapidly. Stupidity or brilliance… it’s all in the price.

But the announcement was criticised by the opposition Conservatives.‘‘There have to be serious questions raised about why the British Army are shouldering yet more of the burden down in the south of Afghanistan,” said Liam Fox, the Tory defence spokesman.‘‘It cannot be acceptable that British taxpayers are funding a greater proportion of the cost and the British military are shouldering a greater part of the burden in the most dangerous part of the country.“‘Where are our Nato allies?’’ he demanded. ‘‘This is simply not an acceptable long term position.
121;APA;Apache Corp;2007-01-31T22:45:35Z;Oil mergers and acquisitions;;An old oil industry maxim holds that if it costs too much to go looking for barrels in the far-flung corners of the globe, it is worth drilling on Wall Street. Replacing barrels in the ground is an imperative. Whether that happens through investment in exploration or buying another company is a tactical decision.Oil executives are now likely to tend towards the latter. The costs of finding and developing – the amount oil and gas companies have to spend to explore for reserves and then bring them onstream – have risen rapidly in recent years. John S. Herold, an industry consultancy, thinks European and US oil companies’ average F&D costs almost doubled to between $12 and $14 a barrel between 2000 and 2005, reflecting not only cost inflation but also weak organic reserves replacement.Meanwhile, flagging oil and gas prices squeeze margins, with a disproportionate effect on upstream companies. This results in lower valuations, making them more vulnerable to takeover. The US, with its deep pool of upstream companies, is a particularly fertile hunting ground. On Citigroup estimates, the likes of Apache, Anadarko and Noble Energy all have an enterprise value per barrel that is about or below industry F&D costs.Apart from traditional potential suitors, other cash-rich predators can be expected to take an interest. Already, private equity houses are in the running for Dominion Resources’ oil and gas assets. Even as spot prices have fallen, long-term crude remains above $60 a barrel, enabling financial sponsors to lock in cash flows and pile on debt. Then there are the Russian, Chinese and Indian oil majors. CNOOC’s near-miss on Unocal in 2005 highlighted the political hurdles. But producing fields in the world’s biggest energy market make a tempting target for any emerging major with global ambitions.
122;APA;Apache Corp;2007-01-26T12:42:03Z;Nick Louth: So much for playing it safe;;Hedging can often negate risk, but I never realised it could be such hard work. My wife and I have just spent the weekend laying down a hedge of beech, hornbeam and hawthorn which I hope will protect one windswept edge of our garden for many years. Despite excellent tuition (my wife is a countryside ranger), I’ve got sore arms and shoulders from repeated swinging of the sickle-like billhook.I hope this hedging works better than the piece I did against the oil price last year. I was concerned that if the oil price continued to rise this would hurt equity markets. So, as a hedge, I bought some oil shares. The idea was that these shares would benefit from further oil price hikes offsetting losses in the rest of the portfolio.Throughout 2005 and 2006 I bought a range of shares in oil companies, including explorers Sterling Energy and Roc, gas explorer BG, mid-size US production firm Apache and specialist US refiner Valero. All did well until the end of last summer (though I sold and repurchased some during the May correction), with crude prices reaching a peak of $78.As so often happens, the oil price turned on the US Labor Day holiday in September, which marks the end of the US ”driving season”.When oil prices began to sag in September, the oil-related part of my portfolio (about 15 per cent) began to languish, but the rest of my holdings started to accelerate their recovery from the weaknesses of early summer. I did make some adjustments, immediately selling half my shares in BG for 696p at the end of August when it became clear that a UK gas shortage would not materialise. This was only a 1.5 per cent loss, but the sale of the second tranche in October incurred a 5 per cent loss.So far, so steady, but the effect on oil explorers was more dramatic. Sterling, a professionally-managed outfit with widespread assets from Africa to the Gulf of Mexico, has halved from a peak 32p in May. Australian explorer Roc, which had a promising find in the seas off China, was hard-hit by a dilutive fundraising in December from which UK investors were barred. The shares I bought for 170p are now worth just 115p, though there still appears to be decent upside on exploration prospects.Apache and Valero, my biggest oil holdings, have been disappointing, sliding by around a fifth from their peaks. The upshot was that my portfolio recorded a return of 13.8 per cent in 2006, comparable to the FTSE 100 but behind the mid-cap 250 index. If I hadn’t hedged at all, I would have had an extra 3-4 points of performance. With hindsight I should have been more vigorous in cutting my oil holdings after the August peak, but then I had expected a slide to just $60 a barrel rather than $50.The mistake now, with oil prices lower, would be to abandon the hedge altogether. Apache and Valero are trading at price/earnings ratios of 8 and 5.7 respectively, surely a massive undervaluation considering how much above historic norms oil prices still are. Valero, particularly, would make a tasty morsel for a US oil giant. Though I have trimmed my holdings, I shall retain the bulk of them.So far in 2007, my portfolio has performed well, notching up a 4 per cent gain helped by Tanfield, Genus and Ashtead. Zero-emission vehicle maker Tanfield, with a 25 per cent gain in January, has been the real standout, while US-focused machinery rental firm Ashtead, which I repurchased last year at prices between 130p and 148p, has added 8 per cent. My exit from the stock in May 2006 at 230p turned out to be well timed. Any subsequent gains I now get I expect to be far less than the 1,200 per cent I made on them first time around.This isn’t the only hedging I have done. Eight years ago, having written two novels and secured myself a literary agent, I was preparing to leave my day job. However, just in case it didn’t work, I took on some freelance work writing for this paper and others. It is just as well I hedged my career plans, because the books failed to find a publisher. Plan “B” hasn’t worked out too badly though.Now I’m having another go. Funny Money*, a book based on the columns I write for the Investors Chronicle, is being published on Valentine’s Day. This time I haven’t given up the day job, which is just as well. I wouldn’t want to end up wielding a billhook for a living.*Funny Money: The Investment Diary of Bernard Jones. www.bernardjones.co.uk
123;APA;Apache Corp;2006-10-13T12:54:20Z;Lunch with the FT: Forsyth’s saga;;"In his latest novel, The Afghan, Frederick Forsyth creates the figure of Mike Martin, an SAS veteran whose education and looks allow him to infiltrate an Islamist cell planning to commit a worldwide atrocity that would dwarf 9/11 and…but you may want to read the book, so enough.Forsyth himself could not be a man of many disguises: he has a long, strong and fleshy face and an upmarket Home Counties accent. The two adjoining tables fell silent to listen when he spoke. Not that they had far to fall: at the table on my left was a couple who looked long-married, occasionally addressing a brief sentence to each other; to the right were two men whose conversation was barely more animated: “Do you get a car with the new job?” one would ask. (Long pause.) “Yes, a rather nice one actually.” (Long pause.) “What sort?” (Long pause, sweet smile.) “I’m not sure I know.” (Long pause, self-deprecating smile.) “No, of course.”Bellamy’s, in a lane off Berkeley Square in Mayfair, was Forsyth’s choice and is a polished facsimile of an exclusive brasserie. The Queen dined there in March and had smoked eel mousse with 25g of Sevruga caviar followed by roast quail. Forsyth is a big enough name for the manager, Chris Steiger (formerly of Annabel’s), to come over and make wonderful-to-see-you small talk.Oblivious of the Queen’s example, Forsyth chose oeuf en gele, I chose whitebait, and he ordered a bottle of Puligny- Montrachet. In these surroundings and thus fortified, he talked of global terror.At the core of his book is the implicit belief that the world has become a network for potential Armageddon, in which young men become radicalised and hand over their lives to charismatic Islamists. Then, working in association with al-Qaeda, kindred organisations or in their own self-created groups, they plot mass murder. Like many of his novels, only more so, The Afghan hangs its fictional characters on real events and makes them interact with real people - such as John Negroponte, director of US National Intelligence - who play important roles, if off-stage.“You’ve got movements proselytising and converting at an extraordinary rate,” Forsyth told me. “They are now converting people in most major prisons - in the US, the Caribbean, and here. If you are looking for a spiritual home - something to cling to, a kind of brotherhood, membership of a sort of fraternity - they offer you all of this. I think a number of young black men are in that mood. There are a few whites, Anglo-Saxons I suppose you’d call them. The shoe-bomber was half white. And, well, there’s Cat Stevens, but he’s absolutely against terror, a good egg, goes around preaching for peace.”He finished his own good egg, and our main courses arrived: bouillabaisse for me, rabbit stew for him. I asked if he believed that there was something inherent in Islam which predisposed its adherents to violence. He doesn’t think so; and since he’s not a man for political correctness, it rang true. “I spent hours with Koranic scholars, including Muslims. They all said - two of them got very angry, not with me, with the bombers - that the Koran is absolutely explicit. They admitted that there were passages which, if taken out of context, could justify the killing of infidels, but not one passage in which it’s written: ‘Oh, by the way, if women and children get in the way, that’s OK by me, Mohammed.’”I could not put to him the more robust opinion of the Pope - quoting the Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaeologus, to the effect that Islam had brought nought but inhumanity and evil - since the pontiff had not yet spoken. But Forsyth would have disagreed: he’s much softer on Islam than the Holy Father. “Mohammed did say you should carry the battle to infidels but only in certain circumstances. He said that those who believe in the one true god - the People of the Book, including Christians and Jews - might be taxed under Islamic rule but not killed unless they declare war. But even that does not include women or children. The idolaters, people who have no god - atheists, animists, worshippers of many gods like I suppose Hindus - they are profoundly outside the pale.”“Not good for community relations in a multicultural society,” I suggest.“Not good for community relations, but of course Hindus are broadly in India, and when the [Muslim] Mughal emperors ruled India they didn’t wipe them out.”The Labour leadership row was blazing a mile or so from Berkeley Square on the day we met, and Forsyth condescended to say of Tony Blair: “I don’t like the man.” Three years ago, he had found himself in the awkward spot of agreeing with the prime minister about the invasion of Iraq. Now, however, he can return with obvious relief to dislike, with an added reason for feeling so: he thinks Blair is a liar, and outlined this view to me in some detail.“Red-faced as it makes one now, I did believe he had seen intelligence which he did not share which allowed him to say that he had authoritative proof that WMD was there and was ready for deployment. I now know it was not so. And the Secret Intelligence Service did not say they did. Then, later, the US weapons inspector David Kay scoured the country - and came back and said he found nothing.”I interjected: “But Kay also said that he was more sure than ever that we should have gone to war against Saddam Hussein, because of the threat he would become.”Forsyth responded: “The weird truth is that this extraordinary man Saddam did destroy his facilities - but then postured that he still had them. But you don’t go to war on the basis of guess. You go to war on a solid conviction, not lies.”Unconvinced except by his vehemence, I asked Forsyth about the special services - the elite troops of various detachments that figure prominently in The Afghan. His passion is clearly for soldiering and weaponry: once engaged in this, his already fluent conversation became more so. Turning angrily on Blair’s rival for the Labour leadership, he accused Gordon Brown of meanness in depriving the military of such “kit” as Predator drones (an armed, unmanned aircraft used with great effect in his novel) and Apache helicopters. Instead, he said, they wasted money on the Eurofighter, “a useless thing, when we could buy the F-16, much better, already tried and tested”.He has, he said, been accorded the signal honour of eating in the NCOs’ mess of the SAS regiment. “They really run the operation, you know. You will find a corporal in charge of crucial missions. The officers come and go - the men call them ‘boss’, and they get respect if they deserve it - but their tour is only three years and then they return to the regiments from which they were seconded. The men and NCOs stay. They go through training which is almost designed to kill them - some have died. But it’s an extraordinary solidarity. If you break ranks, you’re out forever. Look at Andy MacNab [the former SAS man and popular author]. Out.”Forsyth’s study of the Middle East - long predating the five months of research he did for the novel - has given him another bugbear: “I think this nation must get rid of its oil dependency. Ten years from now we might be looking at a world where, if we are dependent on oil for our power stations and our transport, we will be over a barrel - no pun - to Opec, and will be dominated by our worst enemies: Ahmadinejad in Iran, whoever might succeed the house of Saud, and Mr Chavez in Venezuela, no friend of ours. If they started to raise the prices then we might have to give up everything that makes life pleasant.“That’s why I’m for alternative sources - like nuclear power.”“You agree with the prime minister on this?”“Oddly, yes,” Forsyth conceded, adding that Conservative leader David Cameron might also have supported nuclear power “if it hadn’t been for Zac Goldsmith [editor of The Ecologist] advising him - an agreeable young man but quite preposterous.”By now, the tables to both sides had emptied and the lunchtime hubbub in the restaurant had subsided. Time for us to go. The famous novelist slipped away, to be lost in a Mayfair crowd unaware of the all-too real perils that his latest fictional creation had faced on their behalf.Bellamy’s18 Bruton Place, London W11 x whitebait1 x oeuf en gele1 x bouillabaisse1 x rabbit stew2 x double espresso1 x sparkling water1 x Puligny-MontrachetTotal: ₤145.48"

The S&P 500 hit a fresh five-year high.Steelmakers were boosted after Reliance Steel & Aluminum said third-quarter earnings would come in ahead of analyst estimates and its own forecasts, pushing its shares up 13.1 per cent to $33.06. Nucor added 4.9 per cent to $44.47 and Allegheny Technologies rose 7.2 per cent to $63.28.Bullish analyst comments helped push Ebay up 5.5 per cent to $27.67. Goldman Sachs issued a research note saying shares in the online auctioneer could reach $35 in the next few months as it improves revenue growth and listings.Intel gained 2.8 per cent to $19.96 after it announced it would release a new microchip with four processing cores.This pushed down other chipmakers. Broadcom shed 1.7 per cent to $29.86 and Advanced Micro Devices dipped 2.8 per cent to $26.00.PMC-Sierra sank 8.4 per cent to $6.00 after it cut its third-quarter revenue forecast due to weak demand for communications products.At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.8 per cent, or 93.58 points, at 11,669.39, its highest close since January 2000, and second-highest close ever.The S&P 500 finished at a five-year high of 1,336.34, up 0.8 per cent or 9.97 points on the day. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6 per cent, or 12.27 points, at 2,261.34.The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index rose to 104.5 in September, up from a reading of 100.2 in August and ahead of analyst estimates of 103, showing that falling oil prices have cheered consumers, despite the housing slowdown.Markets were further buoyed by the Richmond Federal Reserve’s manufacturing index, which also rose more than expected.Richard Cripps, chief market analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said money was flowing into equities as some investors realised their bearish forecasts for September had not been borne out.“A significant number of investors were expecting a difficult month,” he said.“Heading into the end of the quarter with the S&P 500 at a five-year high is pressuring a lot of sideline money to be invested. [Investment managers] do not want to show that they have bearish positions.”Gains in gold and copper prices buoyed miners. Barrick Gold rose 4 per cent to $30.25, and Freeport McMoran also jumped 4 per cent to $53.50.General Motors added 3.8 per cent to $31.75. It has gained more than 60 per cent since April.Heavy machinery groups continued to climb. Joy Global, a mining equipment, maker pushed up 7.9 per cent to $35.38. Farm machinery maker Deere leapt 5 per cent to $82.82.
125;APA;Apache Corp;2006-06-20T17:27:11Z;EU urged to review trade sanctions;;Sweden will on Wednesday urge Peter Mandelson, the European Union’s trade commissioner, to overhaul the EU’s anti-dumping rules to avoid “mistaken” and counter-productive sanctions such as those taken against Chinese and Vietnamese shoe producers.The Swedish pressure comes a day after Chinese shoemakers met European officials and threatened legal action.Representatives of 181 companies, accompanied by a Beijing government official, said they were preparing a case to take to the World Trade Organisation and European Court of Justice.“China has a cost of labour advantage. These measures are not going to change that. They will just protect inefficient European producers who will have to face competition some day,” said Emily Guo, manager of Apache footwear and secretary of the coalition threatening legal action.The EU has until October 6 to decide on definitive measures, such as tariffs or quotas.Commenting on the sanctions, Thomas Östros, the Swedish trade minister, told the FT: “I think it was a big mistake and it has really shown the problems of anti-dumping measures. Together with the textile row of last year, these two examples show that we have come to end of the road when it comes to using these kinds of protectionist measures.” In a letter, due to be sent today to Brussels, Mr Östros underlines the EU’s “anachronistic” reliance on anti-dumping action at a time when the 25-nation bloc should instead be trying to boost its competitiveness.By initiating the review, Mr Mandelson has himself sent a strong signal that he wants to learn the lessons from recent trade spats.
126;APA;Apache Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

It is a real danger that, if people do not feel safer in a year’s time, we may lose their consent,” Brigadier Ed Butler, the commander of British forces in Afghanistan, told the Financial Times.Three thousand British troops are being deployed in Helmand, which has been hit over the past few days by some of the worst violence since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. For the first time in combat, UK troops deployed Apache gunships in a clash in Helmand’s Musa Qala district, a Nato spokesman said.A string of pitched battles in southern Afghanistan has left more than 250 people dead in the past week, including two French soldiers, an American and a Canadian. Most of the dead were insurgents.In the latest incident, up to 80 Taliban were killed in US-led air strikes as Apaches pounded the village of Azizi in Panjwai district, Major Scott Lundy, coalition spokesman, said.On Sunday three people were killed in a suicide bombing in Kabul, the fourth this week and the second outside the Taliban heartland of the south.Across southern Afghanistan the Taliban is gaining strength, moving into areas held last year by the Afghan government and massing in force just 15 miles from Kandahar.However, Brig Butler said the violence was also being fed by a booming narcotics industry and rampant government corruption and tribal feuds. He said weak government was at the core of the problem.

ExxonMobil sought to counter such criticism by continuing the industry trend of emphasising the scale of capital investments.Exxon said its output rose by 5 per cent, the first increase since the third quarter of 2004, while earnings rose to $8.4bn, a 7 per cent rise or 14 per cent after items last year. Although a first-quarter record, profits missed analyst estimates and were more than 20 per cent lower than fourth-quarter profits. Revenues rose 8.4 per cent to $88.98bn.Exxon’s defensive stance on the scale of its results was evidenced in a conference call laced with references to new projects in the Middle East, Africa and Asia, as well as to awards for Exxon’s environmental and safety records.Henry Hubble, investment relations vice-president, said: “Our broad and diverse portfolio of projects creates ongoing opportunities to continue to bring new resources on line and help supply the world’s growing need for energy.”Exxon said investment in capital and exploration projects rose 41 per cent to $4.8bn, or more than half the profits it earned during the first quarter. The emphasis on investment reflected Exxon’s continued attempt to persuade the public and US politicians its profits are less outlandish than they look.The company said it would buy back $6bn of shares in the second quarter. In the first quarter it returned $7bn to shareholders through dividends and buy-backs, lifting its dividend for the 29th consecutive time by more than 10 per cent. Exxon earned $10.7bn in net profits in the fourth quarter and $36.1bn in all of 2005, more than any other US company in history.Shares recovered from earlier declines and were off less than 1 per cent at $62.85 in midday New York trading.Separately Marathon Oil said its underlying first-quarter profits more than doubled to $739m, or $2.01 per share on revenues that rose almost 28 per cent to $16.6bn. The results missed analyst expectations and shares fell 1.5 per cent to $80.64 in midday trading.Apache also missed forecasts with first-quarter profits that rose 18 per cent to $659.9m, or $1.97 per share.Steven Francis, chief executive, said that “barring some unforeseen world-changing event, the coming quarters should be even stronger..”. Mr Francis called politicians’ call for increased taxes “disappointing” and warned that higher taxes would lead to lower investment in the sector.

The following are excerpts from the interview:FT: In an interview with the FT four years ago, you predicted an end to the period of disruptive innovation from small technology companies and said that, in a maturing industry, there would be slower growth and a consolidation of power in the hands of the market leaders. However, the software world seems to be awash with disruptive innovation again, in the form of open source software, software-as-a-service, and the Web 2.0 movement. What has changed?LE: I still think that to tackle the big jobs, the consolidation will continue. Take software-as-a-service. [The stand-alone software-as-a-service ventures] are tiny companies. I do believe in it, Oracle has offered software-as-a-service for some time. I own 5 per cent of Salesforce.com, I was a founding investor. It’s a delivery mechanism for software. I believe, over time, more and more software will be delivered as a service – I totally believe that. I would argue I started the first big software-as-a-service company, [Netsuite]. I think you’ll see SAP and Oracle simply adapting to that.FT: Mark Benioff of Salesforce.com would say, though, that the multi-tenanted architecture of a true software-as-a-service company is a very different business to the kind of hosted software Oracle sells.LE: It wasn’t his idea. And it’s sheer nonsense: most companies don’t want multi-tenant. It’s a convenience for a supplier. Most companies don’t want their data co-mingled with other customers. Small companies will tolerate it.We make more money selling software-as-a-service than we make just selling software. I’d much rather be in the monthly service charge business, I’ve said this repeatedly. [At present] a huge percentage of our sales are done in the last week of the quarter: all of that goes away, it’s a much better business model.FT: But would Wall Street appreciate it? The stock market doesn’t seem to value Oracle’s recurring maintenance revenues as highly as your new licence sales.LE: I guess they don’t think recurring revenue at 90 per cent margins is very valuable. But then, Wall Street thought that Ariba was worth more than Daimler Benz [during the dotcom bubble.] All I can say is, our profit margins are now north of 40 per cent and will continue to grow past 50 [per cent] because more and more of our business will be in this recurring form, the form of subscription renewals rather than software sales.FT: But won’t your profit margins fall?LE: We make more margin dollars. In the end, the only thing that really matters is how many billions we make this year. I’d much rather make $10bn at 40 per cent margins than $8bn at 50 per cent margins. I want to make $10bn. Our margin dollars will increase at a higher rate with software-as-a-service. Plus there’s no piracy, and no need to maintain old versions. There are huge advantages to the model.FT: Will there be a difficult transition from new licence sales to regular recurring subscriptions?LE: If all people measure is our licence sales, they’re going to be really disappointed in our open source acquisitions, because I can tell them exactly what the open source new licence sales will be next year - it will be zero. On the one hand, people say open source and software-as-a-service are really hot – on the other hand, all they look at is our new licence sales. It’s the kind of absurdity that you find in the world at times.All I care about is that we keep growing our profits every year. We have a five-year plan to grow our profits at 20 per cent a year. Last year we overshot, we grew at 28 per cent. This year we will grow at 20. We’re growing our profits very, very rapidly.FT: Is open source going to be disruptive to Oracle?LE: No. If an open source product gets good enough, we’ll simply take it. Take [the web server software] Apache: once Apache got better than our own web server, we threw it away and took Apache. So the great thing about open source is nobody owns it – a company like Oracle is free to take it for nothing, include it in our products and charge for support, and that’s what we’ll do. So it is not disruptive at all – you have to find places to add value. Once open source gets good enough, competing with it would be insane. Keep in mind it’s not that good in most places yet. We’re a big supporter of Linux. At some point we may embed Linux in all of our products and provide support.Just like software-as-a-service, we have to be good at it. We don’t have to fight open source, we have to exploit open source. At some point we could very well choose to have Linux as part of the Oracle database server. We certify it, we test it. We could have JBoss as part of our middleware. It costs us nothing. We can do that, IBM can do that, HP can do that – anyone with a large support organisation is free to take that intellectual property and embed it in their own products.I’ve had this discussion with the CEOs of open source companies. We’ve looked at buying some, some with very high price tags – but since we already have access to all the intellectual property, why wouldn’t we just embed this technology in our technology and provide support.FT: Yet you have bought an open source database company – what did you buy it for?LE: The people. If the price is reasonable, and you’re getting a high quality development team – we love the Berkeley DB guys. It’s a great team.The way open source companies are valued now is interesting. Wall Street looks back at the historic growth rate and extrapolates it out forever, that’s the way it works. It’s kind of funny.What if IBM were to decide to support Red Hat Linux – what does that do to Red Hat? One of the big problems we have with Red Hat today is, they’re not very good at supporting the customers, so we help them a lot – we want them to be successful, because Red Hat is to some degree our way of competing with Microsoft down at the core level. But they’re a small company and they’re not supporting the customers very well.FT: What are the arguments against Oracle distributing its own Linux version?LE: They’re not very strong – now that Red Hat has bought JBoss and competes with us in middleware, we have to relook at the relationship – so does IBM. If Oracle were to have its own Linux distribution, or just provide paid support for Red Hat, that’s one thing – if Oracle and IBM both did it, it’s a whole new world. I don’t think Oracle and IBM want to create a second Microsoft in Red Hat. But you can’t – because Red Hat doesn’t own anything, they own nothing. They couldn’t [become the next Microsoft], they own nothing.FT: How well has Novell done in becoming a viable competitor to Red Hat? [Encouraged by large technology companies like Oracle and IBM, Novell bought German Linux company SuSe two years ago.]LE:I would say, not very well. Several of our big customers have switched to Novell because they get better service from Novell. But still, Red Hat competing with a Novell is one thing – Red Hat competing with IBM or Oracle is quite different.FT: Why didn’t you buy JBoss?LE: JBoss wanted to sell the company to us. Clearly if we wanted to buy JBoss we’d have bought JBoss. Why didn’t we buy JBoss? Because we don’t have to – if it ever got good enough we’d just take the intellectual property – just like Apache – embed it in our fusion middleware suite, and we’re done. We always have that option available to us – IBM always has that option available to them.The reason I have a hard time writing checks for billions or hundreds of millions of dollars for things that are open source is that if we could do this, other people could do this too. I don’t see how we could possibly buy Red Hat – IBM would just say, Larry, congratulations, we’re going our own way. They could hire Red Hat people and they’d be in business straight away. So I don’t see how anyone can buy Red Hat, not at anything near these prices, because anyone who feels like taking the code – they have no intellectual property.We see in China and India, all that stuff is freely available and Red Hat is just cut completely out of the market. I’m not gong to spend $5bn, or $6bn, for something that can just be so completely wiped off the map. They take all the Red Hat code, have their own equivalent of the Red Hat network, and Red Hat gets zero.So its all very interesting. You can build a sustainable business [in open source], you just can’t charge a lot for it. There’s brand value – there’s real brand – there’s people, and that’s it.[Click here for part two of the transcript]
130;APA;Apache Corp;2006-03-07T16:41:51Z;Is it time to throw away proprietary software?;;Not so long ago, open source was seen as merely a hobby for so-called technology enthusiasts.Today, it has broken into the mainstream, become a movement in its own right and is creating waves in the software world.The question now is: can we throw away our proprietary packaged software?The appeal of open source is as much about driving open standards as it is about the licensing model. But it brings with it opportunities and potential pitfalls.Organisations see the benefits of open standards and the integration headache it soothes.This relationship between open standards and open source software is driving business to consider it as a viable alternative to proprietary solutions.This year, we may well start to see open source challenge long-established and credible products and services in customer relationship management, enterprise resource planning and other enterprise software applications.But what will be different this year is that developments will be much more related to the consumer.Most big inroads from open source software to date have been in the development and server sides of technology – Apache and Eclipse are great examples.What is coming, however, is more likely to have the big consumer application vendors scurrying to the strategy desk.Unbundled office software, such as OpenOffice, provides all the functionality required for most users with no cost.Likewise, Mozilla Firefox operating in the web-browser and email space and Clamwin in the Antivirus space are genuine alternatives to more traditional paid for “closed source” products.The consumer is also becoming more educated. The numerous online forums which discuss these applications lend additional weight to their authenticity and usability.Word of mouth is driving consumers to try open source software.Applications are no longer differentiated from each other by pure functionality and extra bells and whistles. When that happens in a market, purchasers tend not to volunteer to pay for the privilege.Clever software bundling means it is difficult to remove the “paid for” applications. But hardware is made cheaper when it is unbundled, which means it might not be long before consumers buy a “skeleton”, ready to add the “application” flesh.Leading technology vendors are using open source to drive revenues as well as to gain market share.Existing vendors see open source as a way of gaining market share before looking to “upsell” into paid-for solutions with additional capabilities.It will take longer to hit the corporate desktop – the prior investment and perceived risk of change are still big issues – but eventually they will follow the consumer.Established software industry players should, if they have not already done so, develop an open source strategy, but it is probably a little too early to throw away the packaged software just yet.Businesses considering acquiring open source software should bear a few things in mind. Open source is sometimes mistakenly perceived as free – but its ultimate impact may be to redistribute, rather than sharply reduce, the flow of revenues to the software sector.Additional products and services, from maintenance costs to services support, may well consume technology budgets, rather than the core product itself.The bottom lineWhile the cost of software research and development – and hence the cost of products themselves – may decline in the short-run, pride, rather than profit, becomes a main motivator for developers.But there are some downsides to open source. Lack of adequate support is one of them.Businesses should think carefully about who they sign up to provide their software solutions.Just because a small open source company has access to world-class code, it does not mean it will be able to support its clients properly.The cost and effort of moving to open source far outweighs the saving that can be expected in the short-term. But the long-term costs of not switching could turn out to be much greater.Open source does not herald the dawn of “free” software, nor does it signal the death of the packaged software provider.However, it will lead to a redistribution of wealth, and some packaged software players may have to change their game.Royston Seaward is director in consulting at Deloitte
131;APA;Apache Corp;2006-02-15T21:10:37Z;Open source writers wary of Oracle’s real intentions;;Larry Ellison has just sent a ripple of excitement and fear through the open source software world. The chief executive of Oracle staked out a position in one of the fastest-growing corners of the tech industry on Tuesday with the acquisition of Sleepycat Software, which makes database software, and is understood to be negotiating to buy JBoss, a leading maker of “middleware” used to run applications over the internet.Part of the aim, say Oracle executives, is to take on a wider role in the open source movement. Sleepycat’s code, for instance, is often bundled with other widely used products such as the Linux operating system and Apache web server.“This gives us more of a seat at the table with these other open source projects,” says Robert Shimp, vice-president of technology marketing at Oracle.For many open source executives, though, the prospect of sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with Mr Ellison seems to invoke unease.“There’s a fair amount of nervousness,” says David Dargo, chief technology officer of Ingres, another open source database company, of the mood this week at a leading open source conference in San Francisco.The concerns spring partly from suspicion at Oracle’s motives. Sceptics claim that the software giant, whose fortunes are founded on its commercial database products, is really only interested in insulating itself from attack by a wave of new rivals whose cheaper products and different sales approach pose a long-term threat to its business. “I think Oracle is digging the moat a little deeper around the fortress of software and maintenance revenue,” says Mr Dargo. There are fears that rather than trying to co-opt open source, Mr Ellison is bent on subverting it.Oracle’s acquisition late last year of InnoDB, a small Finnish open source company, has added to these suspicions. The five-person company produces the storage “engine” that sits at the heart of MySQL, the database produced by Europe’s biggest open source software company. By seizing the core technology of a rival, goes the reasoning, Mr Ellison could disrupt its product development – or at least spread doubts among potential MySQL customers.Critics also fear that the intrusion of software giants such as Oracle will disrupt a development approach that has proved successful at creating big and complex pieces of corporate software. Often based on broad online groups of volunteer programmers, open source companies must master delicate community dynamics to drive their projects.“I’m not convinced any corporate entity can own an open source project,” says Mark de Visser, chief marketing officer of Zend, another open source company Oracle is understood to have had acquisition discussions with.If Mr Ellison’s motives are viewed with suspicion, however, his cash has had an altogether more welcome effect. The sight of Oracle and IBM buying companies generated a new level of excitement among the venture capitalists who have crowded back to the market in the past three years. “It’s good for open source – it validates the value that open source provides,” says Marten Mickos, chief executive of MySQL, which has emerged, along with Jboss, as the leader of the second generation of open source companies that have sprung up behind Red Hat, one of the companies behind the Linux operating system. MySQL nearly doubled in size last year and had revenues of about €30m ($36m).Oracle says its purchase of Sleepycat signals its belief that open source products are part of the mainstream.“We have definitely seen that our customers are adopting a combination of open source and closed source products,” says Mr Shimp. Being able to sell both types of software would make Oracle “a much more strategic partner”. The test for Oracle will be whether it can absorb Sleepycat and others without disrupting their approach to software development and business models.“Their DNA is not one of commodity software, where prices are low and volumes are high,” says Mr Mickos. “It’s about their culture and tradition. It’s a mindset question.”
132;APA;Apache Corp;2005-11-22T20:38:45Z;UK gas prices surge to new highs;;UK natural gas prices surged to record highs on Tuesday, with the early onset of cold weather boosting fears about the country’s winter gas supply.The price of gas for delivery in January traded as high as £1.20 a therm, according to Platts, the energy news agency. Spot prices traded as high as £1.70 a therm, up from about 31p at the start of the month.Because gas is heavily used in Britain to generate power, the wholesale price of electricity has also soared. The price of electricity for the next day rose from about £60 per megawatt hour at the end of last week to about £105 on Tuesday.Operators are drawing gas from the country’s limited storage facilities, a highly unusual practice so early in the winter.Supply fears deepened further on Tuesday when Apache, the US oil independent, said it had closed a crucial North Sea pipeline for several hours on Monday after a suspected gas leak.Some heavy industrial gas users, including Ineos Chlor and Terra Nitrogen, have been forced to cut production in recent weeks. John Shead, director of Total’s UK energy retail business, on Tuesday said electricity generators had also been forced to cut back their use.The rise in gas prices has touched off a storm of protest from energy-intensive industries, with some companies blaming the government for doing little to address what they call Britain’s “gas crisis”.On Tuesday, Malcolm Wicks, Britain’s energy minister, played down those suggestions, saying the “vast majority of industry is not directly affected by current wholesale prices and neither are household consumers”.But the minister admitted the situation was “highly unsatisfactory”. He said the government had worked closely with industry to try to increase gas supplies.
133;APA;Apache Corp;2005-11-07T22:16:14Z;Microsoft targets server growth;;"Microsoft’s server division, which has become its most significant source of growth, plans to accelerate its development cycle to avoid a repeat of the sort of delays that have characterised some of the company’s most prominent products, according to the executive who heads the division.The comments from Bob Muglia, who took over during the broader management changes at Microsoft two months ago, came as the software company on Monday released the latest instalment of its SQL Server software for databases, a product that has taken more than five years to complete. The delay echoes the long wait for Vista, the next version of the Windows PC operating system, which is due out late next year.Despite that, however, Microsoft’s server and tools division has continued its rapid expansion to become a key part of the group’s business as its more mature desktop software products have slowed. It has contributed more than any other part of the group to Microsoft’s overall growth during the past four years. That contribution has accelerated in recent quarters, with the division accounting for 40 per cent of growth in its last fiscal year, to the end of June, and 49 per cent in the most recent quarter.With its revenues expected to exceed $10bn this year, the server division has become Microsoft’s first successful venture beyond its stronghold on the desktop – though that success has attracted the attention of antitrust regulators over concerns that the company used its PC dominance unfairly to boost its standing in servers.The delay to SQL Server could weaken Microsoft’s efforts to persuade more corporate customers to buy subscription agreements to its software, a shift that is intended to make its revenues more consistent and predictable. Customers that bought three-year subscription agreements at the time the last version of SQL came out would have received nothing for their money, said Rob Helm, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft.Mr Muglia said that his aim was to release new versions of all of Microsoft’s server products every two years in future. He blamed the delay in SQL Server
on the need to rewrite the software to comply with Microsoft’s broader “dotnet” architecture, a framework for web-based software that has been under development for the past five years.Mr Muglia also outlined Microsoft’s plans to fight back against the open-source software product Apache, which dominates the market for web servers used to “host” software applications – a part of the market that is expected to explode in the coming years. While conceding that Apache was “a darned good product”, Mr Muglia claimed that Microsoft would have a better product once the next version of Windows was completed."
134;APA;Apache Corp;2005-09-20T15:42:08Z;Apache enjoys dominance on the internet;;Linux is a rare sight outside the technology industry but most computer users unknowingly use open source software every day, whenever they surf the net.The open source Apache web server has been the dominant system for hosting internet sites for almost a decade. Almost 70 per cent of internet domains run Apache, which is more than 48m websites, according to research company Netcraft.It has maintained its position in a valuable market against sustained competition from Microsoft and Sun, giving it a good claim to be the most successful open source (OS) project to date.In doing so, Apache has also developed from a coalition of volunteers into a formalised body, the Apache Software Foundation, with thousands of participants.It has extended beyond its flagship web server to launch hundreds of projects, including much of the unseen infrastructure that makes many internet applications possible, such as the widely used Jakarta Tomcat java web server.Typically deployed on servers running Linux, Apache can run on most server systems, including Windows. Together with the MySQL database and one of three scripting languages, Perl, Python, and PHP, it makes up the suite of OS server applications known as the Lamp stack.The web server owes its success not just to lower cost, but also the fact many of its supporters believe it is a better product.Germany-based 1&1 Internet, one of Europe’s largest web hosts, has been using Apache on Linux since 1996.Achim Weiss, chief technology officer, says: “There are more features integrated into Apache. Innovations using Apache are faster to come to market, and it is currently more efficient in usage and maintenance.”Microsoft now claims to be competitive on overall cost, but Apache’s market share is nonetheless close to an all-time high. All this has been achieved by an organisation whose spending on software development is nil. The ASF accepts donations, but they are spent on administration.Members communicate through electronic mailing lists and public collaboration pages known as “wikis”. Its governance structure is often described as meritocratic, as anyone can join and work their way up.New members can contribute bug fixes and suggest new features. Once volunteers have a track record of high quality contributions, they can be promoted to the status of “committer”, with access to the source code of their project. They can then be elected to the management committee of a project, or even the board of directors for the Foundation.It’s a model widely copied across the OS world. “That is how all the Apache projects are managed, and it is true for many, many projects that are not Apache foundation projects,” says Mr Goulde.The collaboration model is used within some organisations, including IBM, which runs its own ”open source” projects internally, where employees in different parts of the company work together on projects that will benefit all.The ASF is notable for its close collaboration with the likes of IBM and Sun, many of whom often donate software and other resources.The ASF is sometimes charged with being too close to vendors, and the vendors in turn are often accused of using the ASF to squash competition and pursue their own interests.Much controversy also surrounds Apache’s licensing model. Many other OS projects are licensed under the GPL (general public licence), which obliges any modified software to be returned to the OS community.But in some circumstances, it is impossible to release it back – for example, where a company wants to combine OS software with proprietary software belonging to someone else. So Apache licences do not oblige companies to republish changes to the code.Such debates are common in the technology industry, and the OS world in particular. Few, however, would dispute that the influence of the ASF has been enormous. If ever there was any doubt that OS was a viable model for developing software, the 10 year history of Apache disproves it.Amid all the hype about Linux, the rest of the diverse world of OS projects tends to get overlooked. But in spite of their low profiles, their effect on the world of computing is just as significant.
135;APA;Apache Corp;2005-09-01T21:14:23Z;Producers count cost of direct hit on hub;;Even as it struggles to restart installations paralysed by Hurricane Katrina, the oil industry has begun to count the cost of the first big storm to hit directly the US’s main energy hub.Independent oil producer Apache said on Thursday it had lost eight of its production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, which together had produced more than 7,000 barrels of oil and 12m cubic feet of gas a day. BP, Europe’s largest oil company, said that seven of its platforms were “missing”, accounting for about 1,000 barrels of oil production a day.One of BP’s terminals had also sustained “severe damage” after being struck by an unknown large object, the company said. The roof of one of the terminal buildings also flew off in the Force 5 winds and hit a pump.Royal Dutch Shell said its Mars and Cognac platforms were damaged, as well as a large pumping station in the central Gulf of Mexico area. ExxonMobil, meanwhile, said that about 45,000bpd of oil and 760m cubic feet per day of natural gas were “shut-in” because of closed offshore installations. But early aerial inspections had revealed no serious damage.All told, the hurricane closed down 91 per cent of daily crude production from the Gulf of Mexico and 83 per cent of natural gas production, according to US government figures. The Gulf of Mexico accounts for about a quarter of US oil and gas production.Companies were still scrambling on Thursday to assess the damage to their offshore installations after early overflights were hampered by a lack of fuel and pilots.“The real danger is not top-side damage but damage to pipelines, which will take much longer to assess,” said Bruce Evers, an analyst at Investec.“Clearly, even if there’s nothing wrong with your platform, if you’re not sure about the pipeline you can’t do anything.”The damage to offshore installations may be considerable but it could pale compared with the devastation on the onshore refineries that produce petrol and other vital oil products. The US government’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) yesterday warned that while some US oil refineries might be able to restart operations within two weeks, others would take “several months”.“Unlike 2004’s Hurricane Ivan, which affected oil production facilities and had a lasting impact on crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, it appears that Hurricane Katrina may have a more lasting impact on refinery production and the distribution system,” the EIA said.Nine Gulf Coast refineries are closed, three under significant amounts of water. Those refineries account for 1.8m barrels of refining capacity a day, more than 10 per cent of the US total. A further 10 refineries around the country have been forced to curtail production, according to government figures.ExxonMobil’s refinery at Baton Rouge, for example, has reduced its output because of problems getting crude oil into the installation and shipping products out.“Unfortunately, none of these problems can be fixed quickly,” said Philip Verleger, an independent petroleum economist. “However, the greatest problem may be the loss of manpower.”Thousands of people are feared dead and hundreds of thousands are displaced after most of New Orleans was inundated.Despite all the bad news, analysts say the losses are likely to be offset by the soaring costs of the products they produce. Because of fears of shortages, the price of petrol and other refined products is outpacing even that of crude oil. Reflecting the bullish outlook for the sector, energy stocks continued to rise on Thursday. ExxonMobil, the world’s largest publicly traded oil company, rose more than 3 per cent to $61.72.
136;APA;Apache Corp;2005-07-27T23:22:02Z;CNOOC in Unocal sale pledge;;"CNOOC was on Wednesday considering a pledge to sell all Unocal's US assets, including valuable deep-water drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico, to damp criticism of its proposed acquisition of the California-based company among US lawmakers.The Chinese energy group has already agreed to divest any assets required by the committee on foreign investment in the US, the government panel that would review its purchase of Unocal on national security grounds.But after a series of setbacks in Washington, including a congressional amendment this week that would delay the government review by as long as 51 days, CNOOC was feeling pressure to make additional concessions, according to people familiar with the matter.Although a pledge to sell all the US assets could come in the next few days, insiders cautioned that no decision had been made by Fu Chengyu, CNOOC's chief executive. CNOOC, which is mainly interested in Unocal's extensive Asian assets, has recently been contacted by a number of potential buyers of the US portfolio, which could be worth in excess of $5bn.Interested parties include Kerr-McGee, Occidental, Apache, and others, as well as private equity groups, according to people close to situation.In the meantime, Unocal appears to be reaffirming its commitment to an agreed deal with Chevron. Executives from both companies will today begin meeting Unocal shareholders to encourage investors to support the $17bn Chevron deal ahead of an August 10 vote on the transaction.In coming days CNOOC is expected to choose between raising its bid above the current $67 a share, or $18.5bn; walking away from the bidding; or launching a hostile offer.A pledge to sell Unocal's US assets could help CNOOC persuade Unocal's board to accept an offer for the company on grounds that it would reduce the regulatory risk. This is because such a move would make it more difficult for CFIUS to recommend the deal be blocked. But it would not automatically give the deal a green light. CFIUS would likely still review potentially sensitive technology transfers and other issues that could arise if CNOOC sealed a deal with Unocal.A CFIUS expert said a promise by CNOOC to sell the assets would only sway critics of the deal if CNOOC was able to finalise a sale with a powerful US partner.“To reduce the political bite, they would have to have a US company that is going to fight with them in Washington,” the person said.Additional reporting by Sheila McNulty in Houston"
137;APA;Apache Corp;2005-07-22T16:06:40Z;Nick Louth: The prudent path;;If there is one word that the chancellor of the exchequer, Gordon Brown, has revived it is prudence. Fiscal prudence may be an austere concept, redolent of Dickensian stepfathers or Scottish church commissioners, but for investors it can be useful, particularly in the summer months when market storms can strike from a clear blue sky.As years of research on both sides of the Atlantic have confirmed, stock markets tend not to make any progress on balance in the May-October period. That of course doesn’t mean in any May-October, but on average. So going into this summer I took a pretty prudent position in my own portfolio. Markets had been very subdued in the first few months of the year, and with soaring oil prices, flagging consumer spending and worries about the imbalances in the dollar there seemed to be more than enough to unnerve the global investing community. My response was to look hard at asset and sector allocation, to try to head off any dangers in advance.Dealing with the oil price rise was the easiest option, through further expanding my holding of oil shares. My first action was a year ago when I bought shares Shell Transport for 390p. Though the controversy about reserves accounting, lax management and the awkward dual-listing structure which had begun in January 2004 was still ongoing, I thought it an excellent recovery play just dying for a contrarian approach. Besides, while everyone was talking about its poor oil reserves, no-one was looking at Shell’s huge collection of refinery assets, which are now at a premium. My 45 per cent gain so far is fairly exceptional for a FTSE 100 stock in such a short time. I read that some index-hugging funds which have to increase their weighting in Shell ahead of its capital restructuring still haven’t done so. I’m targeting 580p, but we shall see.Shell wasn’t bought for its oil wealth, but Apache was. The US oil company has substantial oil producing assets in Egypt and Australia, owns a big stake in the mature North Sea Forties field and increased its proven reserves by 17 per cent last year. Despite this it still trades at only 9.7 times this year’s forecast earnings. That’s a 30 per cent discount to the likes of BP, which has bigger exposure to tricky areas like Russia. I bought my first tranche of Apache shares at $49 in November 2004, but only built a substantial holding in March when the price was already nudging $60. Oil shares now account for 14 per cent of my portfolio.A second leg to the prudence strategy has been holding utilities as an inflation-proofed income stream. I have long been an investor in National Grid Transco, whose dividends have produced a steady income of around 4-5 per cent a year. As utilities have become more fashionable in the past year or two they have outperformed the broader market.Finally, the sell-off of NGT’s local gas distribution networks has been an income producing master-stroke. In August shareholders will receive B shares worth 65p per existing share, and have the choice of taking the gain as income or capital gain. NGT and other utilities such as Scottish and Southern Energy account for 13.9 per cent of my portfolio.The third leg is commercial property. When owned directly such property has a weak correlation with share prices and offers the best hedge, but as a second best, a real estate investment trust (Reit) is hard to beat. Though we don’t have Reits in the UK yet, they are well-established in the US where they pay no corporation tax so long as they distribute 90 per cent of income to investors. I bought shares in CBL Inc, an owner of shopping malls, for an average of $34.30 (adjusted for a split) in January, and have seen them rocket 37 per cent to $43.50. Given that the US markets are still flat on the year, I am delighted to have picked two such strong out-performers.The final piece of prudence has been a larger than usual cash holding. When markets are running strongly I normally keep a very small cash holding, but I haven’t really trusted this summer’s rally. My cash holding has averaged about 15 per cent since April. While this summer has been a pleasant experience so far, I fear summer rallies are not to be trusted. Only when we are through the traditionally dire month of September and its untrustworthy successor October, will I feel that I can relax my prudence.Nick Louth is an active private investor, writing about his own investments.

138;APA;Apache Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Explosions mark first day of Iraq assembly;;BAGHDAD, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Five mortar bombs exploded near Iraq?s interim national assembly shortly before it met for the first time on Wednesday, providing a stark reminder of the country?s dangerous road to elections.Gunmen also opened fire on a convoy carrying prominent Shi?ite politician and former Pentagon ally Ahmad Chalabi as he travelled from the southern city of Najaf to Baghdad. He survived but two associates were wounded.The U.S. army said the five mortar rounds exploded before the assembly?s inaugural session inside the fortified Green Zone compound. The assembly, which opened on schedule at 0700 GMT, is charged with paving the way for elections due in January 2005. One Iraqi civilian was wounded, the U.S. military said.Two U.S. Apache helicopters circled over the area. Insurgents regularly fire mortars at the zone, which also houses the interim government and the U.S. embassy.When 1,300 delegates from across Iraq met to select the assembly last month, insurgents fired mortars at the meeting venue, killing two civilians nearby.Iraqi interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi is struggling to push the country?s fledgling political process forward while insurgents use everything from suicide bombers to mortars to undermine his efforts.Kidnappings have also destabilised Iraq, scaring away foreign investors who are badly needed to rescue the cash-starved economy.A militant Iraqi group said in an Internet statement posted on Tuesday that it had killed 12 Nepali hostages and showed pictures of one being beheaded and others being shot dead. It was the worst mass killing of captives since a wave of kidnappings erupted in April.France is anxiously awaiting word on the fate of two French reporters held hostage in Iraq after a deadline for Paris to scrap a ban on Muslim headscarves in schools apparently passed without incident.French President Jacques Chirac again rejected the demands by militants holding Georges Malbrunot and Christian Chesnot that the law be revoked, as Foreign Minister Michel Barnier drummed up a chorus of Arab support for France?s position.Tension rose as the reported deadline neared on Tuesday night, but was replaced by confusion after an Arab League official said he believed it had been extended by 48 hours starting on Monday, not 24 hours as previously reported.That theory appeared to be strengthened by the absence of a new message from the kidnappers on Tuesday night. Chesnot is a reporter for Radio France Internationale and Malbrunot writes for the dailies Le Figaro and Ouest France.GOOD FORTUNE FOR TURKISH HOSTAGEAs intense efforts were under way to win their release, militants holding a Turkish truck driver hostage since August 7 released a video announcing plans to free him after his Turkish firm supplying the U.S. military halted work in Iraq.?Because of the response from the Turkish …company to our demands…We have decided to release the Turkish hostage,? said a statement read out by a militant wearing a red headdress. The hostage, Tahsin Top Abdul-Rahman, then spoke in Turkish and kissed the Koran before the militants gave him an Islamic banner.Signs of hope were soon followed by more violence. Leading politician Chalabi appeared unruffled by the attack. ?It was an ambush. I don?t think there is anything further to say. These things are part of the job,? Chalabi told Reuters.Chalabi, a former Pentagon ally whose ties with Washington soured, has escaped several attempts on his life during four decades in exile, aides said.A U.S.-appointed Iraqi judge has accused Chalabi of counterfeiting. He denied the charges and said they were politically motivated.Chalabi, a Shi?ite, has tried to gain prominence in Shi?ite circles in recent months, forging allies with anti-American figures such as cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and keeping close ties to top Shi?ite cleric Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.He met Sistani on Tuesday in Najaf, an aide said. Chalabi returned to Iraq in August to face an arrest warrant for counterfeiting that could land him in jail for years but no legal action has so far taken against him.
