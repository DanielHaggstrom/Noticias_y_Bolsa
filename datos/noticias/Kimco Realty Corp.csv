0;KIM;Kimco Realty Corp;2013-01-10T18:31:40Z;Cerberus leads Supervalu deal;;Cerberus Capital Management has ended its quest to acquire many of the US grocery stores owned by Supervalu, leading an investor group that will acquire Albertsons and other chains for about $3.3bn.Working with real estate groups Kimco Realty, Klaff Realty, Lubert-Adler Partners and Schottenstein Real Estate Group, the Cerberus consortium will pay $100m and assume $3.2bn in debt for 877 stores around the US.The Cerberus-led group will also make a tender offer for up to 30 per cent of the remaining Supervalu company at $4 a share, a 32 per cent premium over Wednesday’s closing price.Discussions surfaced in October. At the time, a full buyout was being discussed that would have involved up to $5bn in debt and $900m in equity.But the deal that took shape will leave Supervalu as an independent, smaller company. The sale comprises the Albertsons, Acme, Jewel-Osco, Shaw’s and Star Market chains.Following the deal, Supervalu will consist of a large wholesale operation, the Save-A-Lot discount grocery chain and regional stores including Cub, Farm Fresh and Shop ‘n Save. The remaining company still expects annual revenues of more than $17bn.Cerberus has done deals with Supervalu in the past, buying 655 Albertsons stores when Supervalu bought Albertsons in 2006. At the same time, Cerberus bought 26 of Supervalu’s Cub stores in Chicago to address antitrust concerns.Those deals paved the way for Thursday’s transaction. When Supervalu bought Albertsons, it took on a massive debt burden it has been unable to escape. That deal created one of the largest supermarket groups in the country, but resulted in limited synergies and left the company with a debt load that limited needed capital expenditures.New management will take over Supervalu as part of the deal. Sam Duncan will replace Wayne Sales as chief executive, and five Supervalu board members will resign.“We are pleased to be making this investment and look forward to helping build long-term value for all stakeholders,” said Lenard Tessler, co-head of global private equity at Cerberus. “We believe these transactions will create stronger, more competitive businesses.”Supervalu was advised by Goldman Sachs and Greenhill, and received legal advice from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. Cerberus was advised by Lazard and Barclays, and received legal advice from Schulte Roth & Zabel.

Sales fell 0.6 per cent on a like-for-like basis in the company’s home market and also declined in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Strong demand in Europe helped the group post a 0.7 per cent rise in global like-for-like sales but it was the smallest monthly gain in five years. The restaurant chain’s shares were down 2.1 per cent at $60.61.A lower than expected profit forecast from 3M, the diversified manufacturer, also weighed on the market from the opening bell.However, it said it still planned to spend about $1bn on acquisitions over the next 12 months. Shares in the group, which makes Post-it notes, fell 1 per cent to $77.11.Kroger fell the most in the benchmark index after the grocery chain reported quarterly results sharply below estimates and cut its forecast. The retailer said it had suffered from greater competition and declining food prices. Its shares plunged 11.9 per cent to $20.13.The pessimism spread to its competitors, sending shares in Safeway down 6.8 per cent to $20.91 and Supervalu 8.7 per cent lower to $13.18.The S&P 500 closed down 1 per cent at 1,091.94 and all the S&P sectors were in the red. Energy stocks showed the sharpest declines as oil prices fell due to the stronger dollar. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1 per cent to 10,285.97 and the Nasdaq lost 0.8 per cent to 2,172.99.Elsewhere in the consumer sector, Procter & Gamble said AG Lafley, chairman, would retire in early 2010 and Bob McDonald, chief executive, would take over the role as chairman. Shares in the world’s biggest consumer products company fell 1 per cent to $61.87.Kimco Realty, the shopping centre owner, announced plans to sell 25m shares to pay down debt. Last month, the group trimmed its outlook after reporting a 63 per cent drop in third-quarter profit. The group has been plagued by rising vacancies as retailers have downsized in the recession. Its shares fell 4.4 per cent to $12.51.Strong demand for Jack Daniel’s whiskey helped Brown-Forman post quarterly profit above expectations, prompting the drinks group to raise its outlook. Its shares slipped 0.2 per cent to $52.12.After weeks of wrangling, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters sealed a deal to buy Diedrich Coffee for about $290m in cash. Green Mountain had been locked in a bidding war with Peet’s Coffee & Tea over the company but Peet’s announced on Monday that it would not raise its offer any further. Diedrich dropped 1.3 per cent to $34.68, Green Mountain gained 4 per cent to $62.82 and Peet’s was up 3.1 per cent to $31.95.In other deal news, Francisco Partners, the private equity group, announced it was buying QuadraMed for $126m, sending shares in the healthcare information technology company 29.6 per cent higher to $8.31.FedEx helped to lift investor confidence after the shipping company raised its profit forecast, sending its shares up 2.7 per cent to $89.88.Shares in Relm Wireless showed some of Wall Street’s sharpest gains, surging 61.3 per cent to $3.92.The maker of wireless communication products won a five-year contract to provide the US government with digital two-way radios.
2;KIM;Kimco Realty Corp;2008-05-07T20:14:53Z;US Reits;;Retail landlords started chewing their fingernails in 2007 as concerns mounted that key tenants might become bankrupt. Shares in US retail real estate investment trusts (Reits), as measured by the FTSE Nareit index, sank 16 per cent last year.But, since the beginning of 2008, as bankruptcies have started to pile up, the sector’s shares are up 9 per cent. After Linens ’n Things filed for bankruptcy last week, the shares of Kimco Realty and Developers Diversified Realty, both of which have exposure to the home goods retailer, barely blinked. Any reaction would have been largely symbolic – the stores Linens plans to close account for less than 1 per cent of their portfolios’ revenues, according to Green Street Advisors. Has the market already priced in the worst or are investors underestimating the extent to which bankruptcies could boost vacancy rates?Of the large public Reits, those whose shopping centres are anchored by “big box” tenants that sell home furnishings, apparel or electronics are likely to be most badly affected. They can try to recoup lost rent by recruiting new tenants and, in some cases, those tenants may pay more. But distinctive big box stores can be expensive to remodel and “unbrand”. If the economy continues to sputter, making survival difficult for stragglers such as Circuit City and Office Depot, emptied stores could stay vacant longer – especially in housing bubble markets. On the other hand, most of the supermarkets that anchor smaller shopping centres are better protected from the downturn.The biggest retail Reits have a broad range of tenants, which should insulate them against selected bankruptcies. Privately held regional developers – and their regional bank lenders – will be hit harder first. But investors should not assume that this year’s run of bankruptcies marks the turning point.Post and read comments on this Lex
3;KIM;Kimco Realty Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Kimco in $4bn deal for Pan Pacific;;Kimco Realty, a US retail property company, has announced a $4bn deal to buy Pan Pacific Retail Properties, the largest owner of local shopping centres on the west coast.Kimco has agreed to pay $70 per share – a total of $2.9bn – for Pan Pacific, with the option to pay up to $10 per share in company stock. Kimco also said it had access to financing commitments of $3bn from JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch to cover the costs of the merger.Pan Pacific, a real estate investment trust, owns 138 retail properties on the US west coast, mostly shopping plazas anchored by a single large store or supermarket.Kimco, the largest owner of similar properties with more than 1,117 across the US, said it expected a “substantial number” of the properties would be incorporated into its strategic co-investment programme, with investment from other partners offsetting the costs of the acquisition.Milton Cooper, Kimco chief executive, said the company felt “very good about the quality and long-prospects” of the properties.The deal is the latest in a series of Reit acquisitions in the US. On Sunday, Australia’s Centro Properties agreed to buy Boston-based Heritage Property Investment Trust for $1.83bn.By lunchtime in New York, Kimco’s shares had risen 1.46 per cent to $37.41.
4;KIM;Kimco Realty Corp;2006-03-29T21:33:52Z;Wall Street rallies as tech stocks shine;;The bulls regained the upper hand on Wall Street on Wednesday as the market rallied sharply from Tuesday’s interest-rate driven sell-off.The Nasdaq Composite led the charge, surging 1.5 per cent to 2,337.78, with a flurry of positive broker notes and good news from Apple Computer luring investors back into technology stocks.The Amex computer hardware index jumped 2.1 per cent while the Amex semiconductor index climbed 2.5 per cent.Sun Microsystems, the computer server maker, was among the top gainers. Its shares rose 4.4 per cent to $5.25 after Morgan Stanley raised its rating on the stock by two notches from “underweight” to “overweight”, citing an improved financial outlook.Qualcomm and other wireless technology companies, including Motorola, also benefited from an upbeat new coverage note from Cowen & Co. The broker gave the two companies an “outperform” rating, saying the outlook for the global handset market was positive this year. Qualcomm rose 2.8 per cent to $51. Motorola gained 3.8 per cent to $22.77.Google, which will join the S&P on Friday, rose 4.7 per cent to $394.98. Apple, which is facing a class-action lawsuit that claims iPods cause hearing loss, jumped 6.2 per cent to $62.33 after it released a software upgrade that allows users to set a maximum volume limit on iPods.Red Hat failed to capitalise on the upswing. Its shares lost 2.2 per cent to $28.19 after the Linux computer software distributor’s second quarter guidance failed to meet investors’ lofty expectations.Interest rate sensitive stocks such as financials, homebuilders and industrial blue chips recovered, buoyed by growing expectations that US economic and corporate profit growth would withstand the ill effects of rising interest rates.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.6 per cent higher at 11,231.94 while the S&P 500 added 0.8 per cent to 1,302.89.Elsewhere, news that Boston Properties and Kimco Realty were set to join the S&P 500 index drove shares in the real estate investment funds up 6.9 per cent to $96.87 and 6.8 per cent to $41.40 respectively as fund managers adjusted their portfolios to track the index.“The increased reit weighting in the S&P 500 means fund managers(both in the U.S. and abroad) have to pay additional attention to this once overlooked sector, which should expand valuations in the short-term,” said Steve Sakwa, analyst at Merrill Lynch.The S&P real estate index rose 1.8 per cent, with ProLogis up 2.3 per cent at $54.65 and Vornado Realty up 2 per cent at $97.43, among the other reits to advance.Other movers included General Motors, which fell 2.6 per cent to $22.15 after disclosures in the carmaker’s delayed annual report sparked fresh investor worries and led Standard & Poor’s to say it might downgrade the company’s credit rating further.Ameritrade shot up 9.4 per cent to $20.96 after the online broker raised its quarterly earnings forecasts thanks to surging customer trading volume
5;KIM;Kimco Realty Corp;2006-01-23T18:20:07Z;Supervalu set to become number-two US grocer;;Supervalu, a discount food retailer and wholesaler, is on track to replace Albertson’s as the second-largest supermarket group in the US, after Albertson’s said on Monday it had accepted a $17.4bn buy-out bid from a consortium of retailers and financial buyers.Under the deal, Supervalu will take over 1,126 of Albertson’s best-performing supermarkets across the US, including the Shaw’s, Acme and Jewel names.The transaction will triple the size of the retailer’s operations, and create a company with annual revenues of about $44bn with a major presence in Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and southern California. It will also mark a dramatic move upmarket for a company that built its retail business around cut-price formats such as the Save-A-Lot discount chain.The demise of Albertson’s, previously one of the three giants of the traditional US supermarket sector along with Kroger and Safeway, underlines the shifts in the business resulting from the steady rise of low-cost competition, in particular from Wal-Mart.Supervalu is shouldering the largest share of the buy-out transaction, offering $6.3bn in cash and shares and acquiring $6.1bn of Albertson’s debt. CVS, the leading drugstore chain, will acquire Albertson’s 700 free-standing drug stores for $3.9bn, continuing its strategy of seeking growth through acquisitions.A third element of the consortium, including Cerberus, a private equity group, and Kimco Realty, will take over 655 underperforming Albertson’s stores in Texas, Northern California and other western states, many of which are likely to be closed. It is also buying some of Supervalu’s stores in the Chicago area to reduce antitrust concerns.Jeff Noddle, Supervalu’s chief executive officer, said the stores to be acquired had significantly outperformed industry rivals, holding first or second position in their respective local markets. He also said that their experienced local management teams could fit easily into Supervalu’s own operations.“Wal-Mart has captured a lot of share of the business, but this is an enormous industry….We think the best operators are those regional operators who really care about their local consumers,” he said, adding that Supervalu was not planning major operational changes in the operations of the stores it is buying.The increase in Supervalu’s debt led ratings agency’s to warn that its debt would be given junk status if the deal went through. Mary Lou Burde, Standard & Poors analyst, cited risks including “the substantial execution challenges of acquiring a company larger than itself”.The deal will also give CVS the largest network of US pharmacies, with more than 6,100 stores. Dave Rickard, CVS’ chief financial officer, said the company was particulalry pleased to have secured Albertson’s Savon drug stores in southern California, saying it would otherwise have taken CVS “decades” to build up a similar presence in the region.The bidding consortium is offering $20.35 a share for Albertson’s plus 0.182 shares in Supervalu. Based on Supervalu’s Friday closing stock price of $31.85, the deal values Albertson’s at $26.15 a share, an 8.5 per cent premium over the previous close.Supervalu’s share’s rose 2.8 per cent on news of the deal to $32.79, while Albertson’s share’s rose 4.4 per cent to $25.60.Evercore, Lazard, Lehman Brothers, UBS and JPMorgan advised the consortium, while Goldman Sachs and Blackstone advised Albertson’s.
6;KIM;Kimco Realty Corp;2006-01-22T21:17:42Z;Albertson’s confirms bid progress;;Shares in Albertson’s rose a further 1.5 per cent to $24.15 on Friday as the second-largest US supermarket group said its board had authorised further talks on a buy-out proposal from investors by Cerberus Capital, the private equity fund.The shares gained over 4 per cent on Thursday on news that the retailer was again in advanced negotiations over a revised $9.6bn buy-out bid from the consortium, which includes Kimco Realty and Supervalu, the grocer.A deal was almost reached in December, but talks broke down after disagreements over which side would shoulder the risk that anti-trust regulators might block the Supervalu acquisitions.Albertson’s said that “after reviewing the new proposal the Albertson’s board of directors authorised management and its representatives to enter into negotiations.” Sources familiar with the talks said a deal is now likely to be announced as early as next week.The consortium emerged as the lead bidder for Albertson’s after the supermarket group said in September that it was exploring the sale of all or part of its business, and hired Goldman Sachs and Blackstone as advisers.Supervalu also confirmed the bid talks on Friday, and both supermarker groups warned there was no guarantee the talks would lead to a definitive agreement.The deal was to be linked to a separate sale by Albertson’s of its 695 freestanding Osco and Savon drug stores to CVS, the leading national drug store chain.Founded in 1939 in Boise, Idaho, Albertson’s has about 2,500 supermarkets and pharmacies across 37 states, and about 250,000 employees.The company had sales last year of $39bn, but it has been struggling to maintain its market-share in the face of low-price competition from Wal-Mart and other discounters.If it goes ahead, the deal is expected to lead to the break-up of Albertson’s network of stores, with Supervalu taking over and continuing to operate the grocer’s more successful chains, and Cerberus and Kimco selling off or closing down the remainder.Supervalu operates a range of hard discount and “cost-focused” stores, including the Save-A-Lot chain.The proposed buy-out would be the largest in the current surge of private equity deals in the US retail sector since last year’s $6.6bn buy out of Toys R Us by KKR Group, Bain Capital and Vornado Realty Trust.Albertson’s shares were more than 4 per cent higher by early afternoon in New York on news of the revived bid.
7;KIM;Kimco Realty Corp;2006-01-22T21:17:42Z;Supervalu set to venture into costlier aisles;;"Supervalu has taken a low-cost route to becoming the seventh largest grocery business in the US.Save-A-Lot, its largest brand with more than 1,200 stores, is a no-frills, hard discounter similar to Europe’s Aldi, that prides itself on having “no lobster tanks, cappuccino kiosks or floral departments”.Supervalu’s 230 larger format “price superstores” include Shop ‘n’ Save and Cub Foods – whose name stands for “Consumers United for Buying”. Almost half of Supervalu’s annual sales of about $19bn come from the unglamourous business of wholesale supplies.But the retailer is on the brink of venturing into far more costly shopping aisles, with its participation in a $17.4bn deal for Albertson’s, the second largest US grocer.Albertson’s has more than 1,700 supermarkets, most of them at least twice as large as the average Save-A-Lot store, and most including well stocked seafood counters, floral departments and Starbucks coffee kiosks. Its annual sales, at just under $40bn, are double Supervalu’s.The other members of the bidding consortium – Cerberus Capital and Kimco Realty – are expected to sell-off over 600 under-performing stores, while Albertson’s 700 free-standing drug stores will be sold to CVS.Left with the remaining stores - over 1,100 - Supervalu would join Kroger and Safeway among the largest supermarket operators in the US.“The sheer size of Albertson’s and the prospects of integrating its food retailing operations represents a massive shift in scale and price positioning for Supervalu,” wrote Ajay Jain, analyst at UBS Securities.Supervalu moved into retailing in 1980, when it acquired five Cub Foods stores in Minnesota. Under Mike Wright, its previous chief executive, it expanded, acquiring the innovative Save-A-Lot chain in 1991.The chain, now the largest extreme discounter in the US, has more than 800 stores operated under franchise agreements. It has a reputation for opening stores in tough urban areas and remote communities where other retailers fear to tread.Previously, Supervalu’s largest acquisition was a $1.2bn deal in 1999 for Richfield Holdings, a regional store operator. But Jeff Noddle, a 30-year veteran of the company who took over as chief executive in 2001, has shown interest in expanding its retail business through acquisitions.In 2003, a $400m takeover of Dominick’s, a Chicago-based chain, from Safeway was called off, and in 2002 it bought a St Louis-based chain of “dollar-stores” for an undisclosed sum.Mr Noddle told analysts this month that Supervalu viewed “the sale of Albertson’s and specifically the availability of its premier properties, as an extraordinary opportunity for the company to consider”.Karen Ghaffari, supermarket analyst at Fitch Ratings, the credit rating agency, also notes that Supervalu wants to expand the retail side of its business, over its lower-margin wholesale business. “This would move them very significantly into the
segment that they have been looking to grow in,” she said.But the acquisition will also represent a significant challenge. Currently, Supervalu’s store network includes only 60 traditional supermarkets, raising questions about the depth of expertise in a company that has been closely focused on discount retailing.The company’s Save-A-Lot unit, for instance, is still run by its founder, Bill Moran, while five of the company’s top seven corporate officers have been with Supervalu for more than 20 years.The sale of Albertson’s freestanding drug stores to CVS is also likely to increase the costs of operating the remaining in-store pharmacy network, although Supervalu does operate its own in-store pharmacy chain.But the biggest challenge will be moving into the heart of traditional supermarket retailing, at a time when the sector has been relentlessly battered by intense competition from Wal-Mart and Target among others, and by other low-cost discounters – including Supervalu itself."
8;KIM;Kimco Realty Corp;2005-12-22T22:51:52Z;Confidence filters through to Wall St indices;;Wall Street sprinted ahead yesterday after a string of generally positive economic figures renewed the view among investors that the Federal Reserve would soon end its cycle of monetary tightening.In addition to news of higher consumer spending and stronger US economic activity, investors were cheered by a soft PCE measure – the inflation gauge favoured by the Federal Reserve – which rose 0.1 per cent in the month rather than the 0.2 per cent expected by analysts.“The tame inflation data reinforced expectations that the US economy will accelerate, with inflation under control entering 2006,” said Peter Cardillo, chief strategist at SW Bach.The upbeat outlook on the US economy propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.5 per cent higher to 10,889.44 on an otherwise thin pre-Christmas trading session.The broader S&P 500 gained 0.4 per cent to 1,268.12, while the Nasdaq Composite, powered by a 1.3 per cent rally in the semiconductor sector, rose 0.7 per cent to 2,246.49.However, Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at Jefferies & Co, cautioned that the gains were nothing to write home about.“The gains follows the natural ebb and flow of market movement,” he said.Dow components Caterpillar and American International Group both advanced after being named sector favourites by brokerage firms. Caterpillar rallied 2.4 per cent to $58.45, while AIG firmed up 2.2 per cent to $58.45.Technology stocks were in focus after Research in Motion surged 10.6 per cent to $68.30. The Blackberry maker rose after reporting solid third-quarter profit.Investors were less enthused by Micron Technology however. Shares in the chipmaker slipped 3.5 per cent to $13.64 after it missed earnings estimates for its fiscal first quarter.On the deals front, General Electric rose 1 per cent to $35.42 after the conglomerate’s real estate unit agreed to buy commercial real-estate investment trust Arden Realty for about $3.2bn in cash. Shares in Arden fell 3.9 per cent to $45.18.Meanwhile, Barrick Gold looked set to become the world’s biggest gold digger after it agreed to buy rival Placer Dome for $10.4bn, or $22.50 a share. Shares for both companies fell, with Barrick easing back 0.4 per cent to $27.12 and Placer Dome dropping 1.4 per cent to $22.34.Shares of CVS, SuperValu and Kimco Realty all retreated after grocery chain Albertsons reportedly rejected the consortium’s $9.6bn takeover bid. CVS fell 1.6 per cent to $27.13, SuperValu dipped 0.1 per cent to $32.34 and Kimco edged down 0.3 per cent to $32.77, while Albertson traded 3.4 per cent lower at $23.28.Elsewhere, Google put on another 1.3 per cent to reach $432.04 after JMP Securities raised its 12-month target price for the stock to a staggering $575.Microsoft pulled back 0.5 per cent to $26.59 after the European Union threatened to fine the software giant $2.37m a day for anti-competitive practices.
9;KIM;Kimco Realty Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”

The market was knocked back on Thursday amid renewed fears of inflationary pressures, but Wall Street bulls will be looking for a positive finish for the week with strong corporate earnings and a slew of deal activity possibly giving stocks a lift.Half-way through the morning session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.3 per cent, or 31.54 points at 10,913.21, while the broader S&P 500 gained 0.2 per cent, or 2.57 points to 1,273.51. The Nasdaq Composite index struggled to make headway and was down less than 1 point at 2,258.67.Among early movers, design software maker Adobe Systems surged 9.6 per cent to $38.28 after it announced after the close on Thursday a 38 per cent rise in quarterly profits, beating market expectations.Fellow software maker Oracle fell however, losing 3.2 per cent to $12.42 after reporting lower quarterly profits.General Motors’ announcement that revenue may climb for fiscal 2006 failed to impress Wall Street cynics as the shares slipped 0.4 per cent to $22.04.Consumer electronics retailer Radioshack slumped 4.3 per cent to $22.70 after it said it was unlikely to meet its earnings target for fiscal 2005 because of weaker than expected sales of wireless products and high-margin items such as batteries and accessories.On the deals front, Albertson’s climbed 1.5 per cent to $24.35 on talks that the supermarket chain was set to be sold in a leveraged buyout valued at almost $10bn. An investment group of Cerberus Capital, Kimco Realty and grocery chain Supervalu was reportedly poised to win the auction for Albertson’s for about $9.6bn, or $26 a share.
11;KIM;Kimco Realty Corp;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Albertson’s board set to meet on sale;;The board of Albertson’s is expected to meet this weekend to evaluate final offers to buy the second-largest US supermarket chain, with many signs pointing to a difficult sale.The company, worth $14.5bn in enterprise value, had asked potential buyers of the company to submit their final proposals by Thursday night. But by Thursday afternoon, only one credible offer for the whole company, from a consortium including Apollo Management, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and Texas Pacific Group, had been tabled - and at a price very close to $23.25, where Albertson’s shares were trading.Albertson’s had been hoping that a sale of the company would value it above $25 per share. Despite the disappointing offer from the Apollo-led group, however, there remained hopes for a satisfactory outcome to the auction, which has lasted since September.Many of them rested on a group of bidders led by Cerberus Capital Management, the private equity group, which has teamed up with Kimco Realty, a real estate investment firm, and Supervalu, a Minnesota-based supermarket group. According to one person familiar with the matter, their bid, financed by UBS and Wachovia, was expected to come in at a “modest premium” to Albertson’s market value.There was also an outside chance that Kroger’s, the largest US supermarket chain, could re-enter the bidding by aligning itself with Thomas H Lee Partners and Bain, which had dropped out earlier in the process. But this seemed unlikely, as did the possibility that Yucaipa Companies, the investment vehicle controlled by California billionaire Ron Burkle, would emerge as a winner in the auction, although it did place a “timid” offer - according to one person familiar with the matter.The lacklustre final bids for Albertson’s do not necessarily mean that the supermarket chain, which has been struggling to compete with both discount retailers and more upscale food stores, will necessarily remain independent. The company’s management - and board members when they meet in the coming days - could decide to lower its expectations in terms of price. It could also choose to break up the company, by selling the drugstore unit to one of CVS and Walgreen’s, which have both expressed interest, selling the rest of the business to Cerberus or another private equity bidder, and refinancing the $6bn debtload.Albertson’s traces its roots to 1939, when Joe Albertson opened a small grocery shop in Boise, Idaho. Last year, it posted nearly $40bn in revenue, earning $444m in net income from more than 2000 stores in 31 US states.
12;KIM;Kimco Realty Corp;2005-12-02T06:00:51Z;Consortia prepare bids for Albertson’s;;"Three groups of bidders are this weekend expected to put the final touches on offers to take over Albertson’s, the US’s second-largest supermarket chain, which that has been struggling and could be worth as much as $16bn, including debt, in a sale.The consortia, which mostly include private equity firms, are facing a deadline of Tuesday to enter bids for the entire company, which could pave the way for a deal.However, because of the complex nature of the Albertson auction, and concerns about the health of the business, which experienced a sharp drop in its most recent earnings, a final outcome is not expected before late December.According to people familiar with the matter, one group expected to bid for the whole company includes Apollo Management, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Texas Pacific Group.Another potential buyer for all of Albertson’s is likely to be a group composed of Cerberus Capital Management, Kimco Realty and Supervalu, the Minnesota-based supermarket operator and wholesale supplier.A third consortium is expected to include Yucaipa, the investment vehicle of California billionaire Ron Burkle, and Dubai Investment Group.A fourth group, made up of Bain Capital, Warburg Pincus and Thomas H Lee Partners was said to be losing interest and no longer expected to make a bid.Kroger, the largest US supermarket chain, had been contemplating an offer for all of Albertson’s but recently decided against such a move.Instead, it could team up with one of the private equity groups, or wait until after a transaction is sealed to buy some properties that the purchaser might want to sell.Supervalu’s involvement in the bidding marks a significant shift for the retailer, whose existing network of 1,500 stores includes both price-focused chains such as Cub Foods and Shop ‘n; Save, and Save-a-Lot, a hard discount format similar to Germany’s Aldi.Mr Burkle is a veteran investor in the sector, who famously sold Dominick’s, a Chicago based supermarket, to Safeway in $1.8bn in 1989, having bought it for $693m three years earlier."
13;KIM;Kimco Realty Corp;2005-03-11T00:09:25Z;Toys R Us might consider sale of whole company;;"The sale of the Toys R Us global toy-retailing business has taken an unexpected turn after the company was forced to consider an outright sale as an alternative to its plan to split off the struggling toy chain from its Babies R Us division.The decision, which marks a dramatic about-turn, occurred following a board meeting held on on Monday to consider the status of the auction.According to people involved in the process, Toys R Us has returned to each of the potential bidders and asked whether they were interested in buying the whole company, in a deal that could be worth more than $5bn. However, that does not necessarily mean it is ruling out the sale of the toy division.Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and an investment group including Cerberus Capital Management, Goldman Sachs and Kimco Realty, a real estate investment trust, have both recently expressed an interest in bidding for the retailer's entire operations.The two other bidders include a partnership between buy-out groups Permira and Apollo; and an alliance between Vornado Realty Trust, a Reit, and Bain Capital.Shares of Toys R Us rose 2.69 per cent to $23.67 on Thursday, as investors began to speculate on the sale of the whole company.It was unclear on Thursday night what prompted Toys R Us to open up the auction to include the whole company, but bankers suggested that final bids for the toy business, which were estimated to be worth about $3.5bn, might have come in below expectations.The auction, run by Credit Suisse First Boston, has dragged on for seven months.One bidder on Thursday said the auction had lacked clarity. “They will have to come back and talk to all the bidders again,” he said.Another person said he had expected to hear news of the outcome within 24 hours of Monday's board meeting. “It was supposed to have been done and dusted by February 15 but it's still going on,” he said.Toys R Us, the second-biggest toy retailer after Wal-Mart, also has a joint online venture with Amazon.com and owns 48 per cent of Toys R Us Japan. It was unclear whether the Japanese operations were now on the block.Toys R Us did not return calls seeking comment."
14;KIM;Kimco Realty Corp;2005-03-04T00:01:17Z;Toys R Us sale enters final stages;;"The sale of Toys R Us's global toy retailing business has entered its final stages, and a deal with one of four potential buyers, or the selection of a preferred buyer, could happen within a week, according to people familiar with the matter.The 1,200-store chain is expected to fetch between $3bn and $4bn, although some Wall Street analysts believe that range is at the high-end of the estimates for the value of the business.Last August the retailer said it planned to separate its fast-growing Babies R Us division, which sells everything from diapers to baby furniture, from its toy division through a possible sale of the toy business or a spin-off of Babies R Us.The global toy business includes its US, international and internet operations.Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment bank, is conducting an auction that has been narrowed to four bidders: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts; a partnership between Permira, the European buy-out group, and US rival Apollo; Bain Capital and Vornado Realty Trust; and a fourth group that includes Goldman Sachs's private equity group, Kimco Realty and Cerberus Capital.The presence of the real estate investment trusts Kimco and Vornado - which also owns a 4.3 per cent stake in Sears, Roebuck - suggests the buyer could be keen to engineer a Kmart-style restructuring by breaking up the extensive property portfolio rather then trying to turn round the ailing US toy business.Specialty toy retailers have been under pressure in recent years by the big discounter retailers, mainly Wal-Mart and Target, which have aggressively cut prices on popular toys.Toys R Us was once the dominant force in US toy retailing but lost its top spot to Wal-Mart, which is now the largest toy seller.Shares of Toys R Us closed unchanged at $23 in New York on Thursday."
