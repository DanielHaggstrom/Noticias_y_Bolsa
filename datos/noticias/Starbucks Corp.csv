0;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-02-21T13:36:48Z;Coronavirus provides an opportunity for Chinese tech companies;Solutions for virus-related problems include contactless food delivery and anxiety tracking;"As the coronavirus crisis in China escalated, I began to notice glowing news reports about the latest technological innovation to fight the outbreak: contactless delivery.McDonald’s, Starbucks, KFC, Pizza Hut and a string of Chinese delivery companies were trialling apparently cutting-edge technology. Intrigued by the buzz, I tried it. I logged on to Meituan, my Chinese food delivery app of choice, ordered “contactless delivery” dumplings and waited. Within an hour, my groundbreaking online shopping experience was complete: the courier left my dinner at the entrance to my apartment.The coronavirus outbreak is proving a marketing boon for Chinese tech companies with products they can connect to fighting the virus — however tenuous that connection may be.An industry body affiliated with China’s ministry of industry and information technology has identified a list of over 60 companies that claim to provide tech solutions to the coronavirus problem.Are you feeling anxious because of the virus? So am I. Never fear, emotion recognition is here. A company in Shanghai says it can assess your emotional state through a 60-second video analysis of your “skin, eyeballs, corners of your mouth, eyelids and bodily vibrations”. Once the emotion recognition discovers abnormal levels of aggression or stress, please seek the appropriate psychological help.If by some chance the emotion recognition test fails, there is always crowd recognition. Police across the country are using big data, provided by a company on the list called Beiyang, to identify individuals (who may or may not have coronavirus) in crowds. Beiyang claims its technology has led to a 22 per cent drop in calls to China’s emergency hotline, a 36 per cent drop in muggings and 40 per cent fewer burglaries.If you have been identified as a coronavirus patient through emotion and crowd recognition, then Yelink, a Shenzhen-based company, will provide you with all the technology — the internet of things, more big data, cloud computing — to effectively self-quarantine at home.Your temperature, heart beat and blood oxygen levels will be tracked through bluetooth thermometers and wristbands, which feed this data to the government’s “public health cloud” to be analysed. The company will even throw in a lock for your front door which will only unlock if the company’s smartphone app deems you healthy. Don’t try forcing the door open — the police will be alerted.While in quarantine, you can pass the time playing on your phone. Just do not post anything politically sensitive. If you do, UiBot, a smart robotics company, will find out as it conducts automatic keyword searches on WeChat, the messaging app that millions of Chinese use every day and which forms the bedrock of the country’s internet.These keyword searches have been so effective that China’s internet censors have blocked students across the country — currently stuck at home because of the virus — from taking online classes in politics, modern history and Chinese literature because of “sensitive” content — or, in the case of biology, “pornographic” content.In fairness to the industry body’s carefully curated coronavirus solutions list, it includes some surveillance tech which seems genuinely helpful: increased monitoring of the health of nursing care residents who may be overlooked as medical resources are redirected towards coping with the coronavirus outbreak; AI temperature checks for crowds; and digital platforms to more transparently co-ordinate the procurement and logistics of medical supplies.How much of this technology is here to stay when the coronavirus outbreak ends? It is likely that governments and businesses that have invested in upgrading their surveillance tech will not unwind it once the crisis is over. I’m going to bet that “contactless delivery” will not disappear either: those dumplings I order online will continue to be delivered straight to my doorstep.suelinwong@ft.com"

Mr Ackman’s hedge fund Pershing Square sold its last shares in Starbucks on January 31, according to an investor presentation published on Wednesday.It said the coffee company had engineered a successful turnround of its business and achieved substantial growth in China as he had expected but returns would be more modest going forward. Mr Ackman said it would remain “one of the world’s most dominant, attractive and profitable brands”.Starbucks said on January 28 that it had closed over 2,000 outlets in China, more than half of its locations in the country, as the coronavirus spread. China is its second-largest market after the US.Mr Ackman’s 1.1 per cent stake in Starbucks ranked him among the coffee company’s 20 biggest shareholders.It signalled a back-to-basics approach by the 53-year-old activist investor whose hedge fund was hammered by a string of bad bets and four consecutive years of negative performance. Pershing faced major setbacks from a bet on Valeant Pharmaceuticals that cost the firm $4bn and an ill-fated $1bn short against the diet drinks marketing company Herbalife. Mr Ackman has since refrained from betting against companies and currently maintains a long-only book. Pershing was one of the best performing hedge funds last year, delivering a 58.1 per cent return to investors net of fees.Mr Ackman made several changes to Pershing’s book in 2019, which included adding a stake in Berkshire Hathaway, the investment firm run by his mentor Warren Buffett.In a departure from his activist persona, Mr Ackman decided to walk away from United Technologies after the company announced a merger with defence contractor Raytheon. The potential deal was also opposed by fellow activist Daniel Loeb’s Third Point but Pershing decided to exit the $700m position “rather than fight the transaction and replace management”.

3;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-01-29T00:31:23Z;Starbucks closes half of China stores as virus hits;Coffee chain expects shutdown of 2,000 outlets to ‘materially affect’ results;Starbucks has closed more than 2,000 outlets in China and cautioned that its annual financial results had been threatened by the coronavirus, highlighting the challenges facing corporate America from the spread of the deadly infection.In a sign of the scale of the disruption in China, the coffee chain on Tuesday said it had shut temporarily more than half of its near-4,300 cafés in the country, Starbucks’ largest market outside the US and its most important global growth engine.Patrick Grismer, chief financial officer, told Wall Street analysts that Starbucks had been planning to upgrade its full-year profit forecasts after the US-based company’s performance in its fiscal first quarter was stronger than expected.However, as a result of the rapidly expanding outbreak, Starbucks decided against changing the forecasts.Instead executives cautioned that results both for the current quarter and the full-year were likely to be “materially” affected, although they were unlikely to be able to quantify the impact before March.15,200Number of US Starbucks outletsStarbucks’ disclosure about its China shutdowns comes at a time of nervousness on Wall Street about the financial implications of the coronavirus, which originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and multiplied throughout the country and abroad.Food and beverage companies are among the most exposed. KFC, Pizza Hut and McDonald’s have also closed outlets, with the latter expected to divulge more details about its exposure in an earnings report on Wednesday.Starbucks has been among the most aggressive of western chains in expanding in China.Kevin Johnson, chief executive, has sought to capitalise on a growing taste for coffee and rising middle class. He described the virus-related disruption as temporary and said the company remained “committed to the long-term opportunity” in the country.Figures published on Tuesday showed the US coffee chain opened more than 600 outlets in China in 2019, helping total revenues in the country rise 13 per cent to $745m.Revenues in the US, Starbucks’ largest market, were up 9 per cent to $4.58bn, although in contrast to its China division the domestic business was driven more by existing outlets than new ones.Starbucks’ store count in the US rose 3 per cent, bringing its domestic total to almost 15,200, compared with the 16 per cent expansion of its China outlets.Shares in Starbucks, valued at $104bn, have lost 5.5 per cent since last Thursday and were down about another 1 per cent in after-hours trading following the results, even though its fiscal first quarter was better than forecast.Net income jumped from $761m a year ago to $886m, equivalent to 74 cents per diluted share.The update from Starbucks sent American depositary receipts in the company’s Chinese rival Luckin Coffee down 2.5 per cent after-hours, having lost 11 per cent since last Thursday.
4;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2019-12-06T13:07:40Z;Luckin Coffee/Starbucks: frothy latte;A cup of Chinese chain’s coffee seems a better buy than its shares this Christmas;Starbucks offers concoctions such as Toasted White Chocolate Mochas and Eggnog Lattes on its Christmas menu. China’s rival to the US chain has none of these but offers cheaper coffee, quick mobile payments and home deliveries. This has been enough for Luckin Coffee to quintuple customer numbers in the third quarter. But top-line growth has been at the expense of profits.Top Chinese movie stars endorsing its coffee have helped boost revenue by more than 500 per cent in the three months to September. New store openings have doubled since the beginning of the year. Luckin expects to overtake Starbucks, with 4,650 stores by the year end. That expands its delivery range, helps it access more customer data and increases its pricing power.While sales have soared, Luckin remains unprofitable. Sceptics see cheap coffee prices and high rents in central locations as a flawed business model. Operating expenses are an unsustainable 138 per cent of net revenues. Margins from coffee, where it gains three-quarters of its revenue, are further squeezed by steep discount offers and high delivery costs. Employing celebs to promote the brand is one reason why marketing costs exceed a quarter of sales.Shares are up 42 per cent since its New York listing in May, valuing Luckin at 13 times its enterprise value to trailing revenues. That is more than three times Starbucks’ multiple. It is also significantly higher than the value put on global food and beverage chains. Starbucks, which accounts for more than half of China’s market share, casts a long shadow as it calls the country its second home market. It has launched delivery services and express stores along with an aggressive marketing campaign.Luckin has relied on coffee discounts to lure customers for growth. That has kept its shares high. But once the discounts are gone, it risks losing its customers and investors. A cup of Luckin coffee seems a better buy than its shares this Christmas.Our popular newsletter for premium subscribers Best of Lex is published twice weekly. Please sign up here.

A record turnout helped pro-democracy parties win a majority in 17 of 18 district councils. Shares of companies hit by protests, including developer Swire Properties and train operator MTR, bounced on Monday.Bulls hope the poll result will inspire disaffected Hong Kongers to focus on conventional politics rather than street protests. But anyone expecting a quick reversal in the city’s depressed markets will be disappointed.The Hang Seng index has fallen 12 per cent since the latest bout of unrest started. The benchmark trades at a price-to-book value of 1.3 times, at the bottom end of its three-year average and just half where it was in August last year.Hong Kong’s economy relies heavily on property. Sky-high rents are justified partly by the spending of mainland Chinese tourists. These are likely to remain scarce for as long as the territory is at loggerheads with Beijing.Conglomerate Jardine Matheson gets a quarter of revenues from its developer subsidiary. Most of MTR’s profits come from commercial rentals. They can sweep up the broken glass from vandalised Starbucks outlets. Retail footfall and demand for fresh office space will remain subdued.A genuine rebound would require Beijing to shift ground. In Hong Kong, power lies with the Legislative Council, the city’s de facto parliament, not local district councils. Here, China and Hong Kong’s tycoons have a strong hand. Only 40 of 70 Legco seats are elected by the people. The rest are selected by groups that represent key industries like insurance, property and finance. These have long sided with the Communist party. Corporations have outsized votes.Further political gridlock therefore lies ahead, which means more protests. It is hardly surprising China’s tiny elite has supported Hong Kong’s tiny elite. Reducing its privileges would be a better strategy, however. It is not just politics that needs democratising in Hong Kong. Taxation and property ownership do too. Here, what hurts tycoons would help Hong Kong’s markets and its future as a financial hub.The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. Please tell us what you think of the outlook for the Hang Seng in the comments section below.
6;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2019-10-15T03:00:30Z;McDonald’s and Starbucks pour millions into eco-friendly cup hunt;Chains struggle to find mass produced alternatives amid global plastic crackdown;McDonald’s and Starbucks are pouring millions of dollars into developing eco-friendly alternatives to disposable coffee cups while struggling to find products that can be mass produced, as a global crackdown on plastic gathers pace.Six sustainable packaging businesses pitched their products before the two chains as well as venture investors at an event last month in New York, held during the UN general assembly meetings where the environment was high on the agenda.Styled after the popular television show Shark Tank, which involves entrepreneurs pitching their products to investors, the event was part of a broader project that McDonald’s and Starbucks have contributed $15m to in partnership with Closed Loop Partners, which pursues sustainable investments.The sums spent are a tiny fraction of the profits of $5.9bn and $4.5bn that McDonald’s and Starbucks reported respectively last year. Both companies said they have made additional investments in eco-friendly packaging from their research and development budgets, but declined to give a specific amountsDespite their name, conventional paper cups for coffee, soup and other hot liquids are not easily recyclable as their inside lining is made of plastic to prevent leaks. Polystyrene foam cups are also not recyclable.As soon as we scale up we will be price competitivePackaging has become a risk to the fast-food industry which is under pressure from consumers and shareholders to curb the use of plastic. Earlier this year, the European Parliament approved a law to ban a range of single-use plastic items, including straws and drink stirrers, while France is scheduled to ban single-use plastic coffee cups in 2020. The Californian city of Berkeley is also set to introduce a 25-cent fee tax on disposable coffee cups.Those companies that have bet on new products which tap into the growing environmental awareness of consumers have been rewarded. Bunge, one of the world’s oldest agribusinesses, has seen the value of its stake in plant-based burger maker Beyond Meat soar. Bunge’s venture capital arm invested before Beyond Meat’s flotation on the Nasdaq this year.Venture capitalists are also pushing into the sustainable packaging sector. Abe Minkara, director of business development at Mark Cuban Companies, a collection of businesses owned by the eponymous investor, said he was interested in compostable products. “The material-based solutions are definitely going to be more scalable,” Mr Minkara said. “The closed loop systems are great, but there is a certain behavioural element that is required for that programme to be successful.”Kate Daly, a managing director at Closed Loop Partners, said solving the sustainable cups problem can pay off in other areas. “We see it as a huge opportunity to take the lessons learned from this project and apply them to other sustainable food packaging opportunities,” she said.However, fast-food companies are struggling to find a sustainable solution that works on a large scale.“It is all about scalability,” said Jessica Marshall, sustainability manager at McDonald’s, who attended the event in New York. The group has pledged to recycle packaging at all its stores globally by 2025.Earlier this year, 44 per cent of Starbucks shareholders supported a motion calling on the company to report on its efforts to develop sustainable packaging.“We know our cups remain one of our biggest environmental challenges,” said Jane Tsilas, global packaging solutions manager at the Seattle-based group. It is evaluating the cup designs presented in New York last month to determine which it may develop further.Experts say there are two broad approaches to solving the coffee cup problem. The first involves reusing the same cups: UK-based CupClub provides cups to retailers that can be picked up, cleaned and dropped off again. Meanwhile, RECUP, a company in Germany, has partnered with McDonald’s stores in the country for a cup deposit system.However, this option requires customers to be disciplined recyclers and to change their habits. The alternative is to create cups that are recyclable or compostable. US-based Footprint and Colombier of Finland have produced liners that help with this but these products can be expensive.“As soon as we scale up we will be price competitive,” said Henrik Bjornberg, chairman of Colombier. He said the company wants to open a facility in North America to produce cups as well as a second processing machine in Finland.Three businesses at the New York event presented cups that could be exchanged for reuse while the other three had developed cups that can be recycled or composted.About 300,000 tonnes of drinks cups and lids are consumed each year in the EU with about 40,000 tonnes dropped as litter, according to a European Commission report published last year.
7;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2019-09-30T11:37:15Z;Starbucks latest corporate casualty in Hong Kong protests;US coffee company targeted after person linked to group criticises demonstrators;Starbucks has become the latest corporate casualty of Hong Kong’s four month-long political crisis, which has seen companies come under increasing pressure to balance the demands of mainland China and pro-democracy protesters in the territory.The American coffee company, which is one of the fastest growing multinationals in mainland China, saw a number of its Hong Kong outlets targeted on Sunday, after a person linked to the company was critical of protesters.In one of the most violent days of the protests to date, on which police fired live rounds in warning, used tear gas and pepper sprayed journalists, and protesters smashed a subway station and threw Molotov cocktails, Starbucks was a particular target.At least one outlet had its windows smashed, while a number of others were graffitied.Starbucks in Hong Kong is operated by Maxim’s Group, one of the largest catering companies in the city. Maxim’s has become a target for protesters after Annie Wu, the daughter of the group’s founder, described the protesters as “rioters” who did not represent Hong Kong, at a visit to the UN on September 11.The company subsequently released a statement on September 24 distancing itself from Ms Wu. “We hereby state that Wu does not hold any position at the company, nor is she involved in any managerial decisions,” it said.Neither Starbucks nor Maxim’s had responded to a request for comment at the time of publication.Starbucks has a sizeable presence in Hong Kong, with close to 200 cafés in the city. That is dwarfed by the company’s mainland presence, where it already has more than 4,000 stores and is rapidly expanding.With China its biggest market after the US, “Starbucks can’t do anything to alienate Beijing”, said Shaun Rein, managing director of China Market Research. “Very few businesses want to take a strong stand: it shows the danger of the joint venture model or the licensing model.”Maxim’s, which also owns the local franchises for The Cheesecake Factory and Shake Shack, has more than 1,000 outlets in the region.Following Ms Wu’s intervention at the UN, more than 50,000 people have signed a petition calling on Starbucks to cut ties with Maxim’s, and protesters have called for a boycott of the company.The boycotts were likely to be short-term and consumer behaviour would soon return to normal, said Joseph Fan, a professor of finance at The Chinese University of Hong Kong.“Boycotting is just a declaration that I am against you. But if the company is providing a good service and a good product, eventually they will go back to buying their stuff,” he said.Starbucks follows a succession of other multinational companies that have found themselves caught in the fallout of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.Multinational banks such as BNP Paribas have been rebuked by Chinese media in recent months, while Hong Kong’s de facto flag carrier Cathay Pacific has been targeted by Beijing for supporting the protesters’ cause.For companies operating in Hong Kong, “you can’t duck your head and say you’re non-political. It’s a really dangerous time right now, for anyone”, said Mr Rein.Additional reporting by Alice Woodhouse in Hong Kong
8;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
9;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2019-09-24T08:28:14Z;EU court annuls Brussels’ €30m tax ruling against Starbucks;Margrethe Vestager failed to prove ‘existence of an economic advantage’;EU judges have struck down a European Commission order for Starbucks to pay €30m in back taxes to the Netherlands, in a blow for Brussels’ state-aid enforcer Margrethe Vestager.The EU’s second highest court on Tuesday ruled that Brussels was “unable to demonstrate the existence of an advantage in favour of Starbucks” from a “sweetheart” corporate tax arrangement for the US company in the Netherlands. The general court annulled the decision from Ms Vestager, who in 2015 ruled that the corporate tax arrangement constituted illegal state aid.In a similar case, the general court, however, found that carmaker Fiat Chrysler would have to pay as much as €30m in back taxes to Luxembourg under a tax scheme that did constitute illegal state aid.Both governments had challenged the commission’s decisions, which marked a significant escalation in Brussels’ investigation of multinational tax avoidance.Menno Snel, the Netherlands minister responsible for tax, welcomed the decision and said the Dutch government was in compliance with international standards on corporate tax laid out by the OECD. “This ruling means that the tax authorities have not treated Starbucks better or differently than other companies,” he said.Luxembourg’s ministry of finance said it would analyse the judgment. “We will continue to participate actively and constructively in the ongoing discussions on a reform of the international corporate tax system,” it said.The rulings are being closely watched as Apple is also appealing against a decision from Ms Vestager that it must repay the Irish government €13bn in back taxes — by far the highest repayment bill Brussels has handed to any company.The Irish government is also challenging the ruling. The case is expected to take years to conclude.The commission will continue to look at aggressive tax planning measures under EU state aid rules to assess if they result in illegal state aidMs Vestager will serve her second five-year term as the EU’s competition commissioner from November 1. In a statement, the Danish commissioner said she would “study the judgments carefully before deciding the next step”. Brussels can appeal against Tuesday’s ruling. In both cases the court agreed with the approach taken by the commission to assess whether a tax measure by member states was illegal.“The commission will continue to look at aggressive tax planning measures under EU state aid rules to assess if they result in illegal state aid,” added Ms Vestager. “The judgments confirm that, while member states have exclusive competence in determining their laws concerning direct taxation, they must do so in respect of EU law, including state aid rules.”In the Starbucks case, the judges said the commission had not managed to prove the “existence of an economic advantage” from the corporate tax arrangement offered by the Netherlands. However, the general court said Brussels was within its rights to investigate member state tax arrangements under an “arm’s length” principle and it was not impinging on governments’ tax sovereignty. The annulment is the latest setback for Ms Vestager’s battle to use the EU’s powerful state aid rulebook to crack down on tax avoidance. This year, the general court struck down a commission ruling against a Belgian tax scheme worth €700m.Last year the commission decided that arrangements between Luxembourg and McDonald’s, allowing the US company to pay nearly no tax, were legal under EU state aid rules.“The mixed outcome of today’s cases demonstrates that the general court is willing to support the commission in its state aid investigations into transfer pricing rulings in principle, within certain boundaries,” said Natura Gracia, a competition partner at Linklaters.Since November 2014, the commission has analysed more than 1,000 tax rulings in all 28 member states, including tax arrangements relating to about 300 companies. Brussels still has 42 continuing investigations, including into Nike’s tax treatment in the Netherlands and Ikea’s arrangements in the country.“We do not anticipate that [today’s] judgments will materially alter the commission’s approach,” added Ms Gracia.
10;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Corporate America is over-caffeinated ;Let us hope our dependence on the fragile US consumer holds up;"Starbucks isn’t just the world’s largest coffee chain; it’s a bellwether stock, one that tells us a disproportionate amount about the American economy and where it may be headed. When Barack Obama was president of the US, he used to call Starbucks founder and former chief executive, Howard Schultz, for a read on the American consumer. The store sales figures coming out of thousands of communities around the country, four times a day, were much more sensitive than any Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Last week, Starbucks told us something important and disturbing. The company’s stock took a dive after it signalled, during a presentation at a Goldman Sachs retail conference, that its recent 10 per cent rate of profit expansion wouldn’t carry into next year. In large part, this was because the benefits from President Donald Trump’s tax cuts were tapped out. As Patrick Grismer, the chief financial officer of Starbucks, put it, “far and away the driver of our outperformance in fiscal 2019 relative to our original expectations was our effective tax rate”. Now that the tax boondoggle is over, so is Starbucks’ outperformance. The company also announced it was pulling forward $2bn worth of share buybacks it had planned for 2020 into the current year, as its sales and earnings are falling short of expectations. Using equity repurchasing to bolster share prices is nothing new for Starbucks, which has seen its share price grow by some 80 per cent in the past year thanks not only to those Trump tax cuts, but to share buybacks (much of the company’s earnings per share growth comes from them). The money raised from new bond issuances is often used to pay for those buybacks. Starbucks’ own debt load has roughly tripled over the past few years as it has pivoted to what it calls a “more highly leveraged model”.Starbucks is of course by no means alone in its employment of such financial engineering. One of the biggest market stories of the past several years has been corporations capitalising on cheap money, using record low rates to issue bonds and then using the money raised to buy back their own equity in order to bolster share prices. It’s a shell game that has always made my head spin, particularly when done at a market peak, rather than a trough, which tells you that the strategy isn’t a bet on a real, underlying growth story but an attempt to make headlines.I thought we’d reached a peak in such Faustian financial wizardry a while ago, but no. In recent days, Apple, which has $200bn dollars of cash or cash equivalents on hand, announced a $7bn bond offering, part of a slate of $54bn worth of corporate debt issuances in the past week or so. Just when you think the bond bubble can’t get any bigger, it does.Given the looming risk of recession, a spate of recent corporate trouble (involving heavyweights such as GE, Kraft Heinz, Boeing, PG&E, and now Johnson & Johnson, which is under fire for its role in the opioid crisis), you would think investors might steer clear of even “high grade” corporate debt. But the asset class seems to fill an existential need for something between equities, which many worry could crash, and the glut of negative-yielding government bonds. In today’s bizarre and bifurcated market, any middle ground, it seems, is better than none. To me, all this says that corporate America is over-caffeinated and due for a crash. Starbucks would say the American consumer is not. As Mr Grismer says, “we see in the US a very healthy consumer”. And it’s true that, while tax cuts and buybacks have been a big part of the Starbucks story over the past couple of years, they aren’t the only part. Consumer confidence in the US has, at least so far, been surprisingly resilient in the face of the US-China trade conflict, monetary policy uncertainty, and the sound and fury coming out of the White House. Starbucks same-store sales growth, a good measure of underlying demand, has been robust.But policymakers worry that this resilience may not last. As New York Federal Reserve president John Williams put it recently, “the consumer is now carrying all of the weight, or much of the weight, for growth going forward.” Or, as Dallas Fed chief Rob Kaplan, who worries that bad macroeconomic data could shift consumer sentiment, says, “if you wait to see weakness in the consumer, you’ve likely waited too long”.This reminds me of something Mr Schultz told me in February of 2015. Starbucks had just released impressive quarterly numbers. But Mr Schultz worried that economic bifurcation and political dysfunction following the 2008 global financial crisis had created a new and more “fragile” consumer, one that was quick to button up their wallet at the first real sign of economic trouble. “There is no company you can point to that is as dependent as we are on human behaviour, the human condition,” he told me back then. In a nation divided between latte makers and latte drinkers, any small piece of bad news could trigger a downturn.Economic bifurcation, political dysfunction, and our dependence on the fragile American consumer has only increased since then. For the sake of the markets, and the global economy, let’s hope they’ve had their double shot. rana.foroohar@ft.comSomething stinks in supply-side economics / From Niels Erich, San Francisco, CA, US"
11;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2019-09-04T13:27:59Z;Starbucks forecasts 2020 earnings below target;Coffee chain blames absence of a tax benefit and slower share buybacks;Starbucks warned earnings growth in the 2020 financial year will come in below its forecasts, sending shares down nearly 5 per cent in premarket trade.Patrick Grismer, chief financial officer, in a presentation at a retailing conference hosted by Goldman Sachs, said adjusted earnings growth in the upcoming financial year would probably be below the company’s longer-term target of 10 per cent.That compares with a previous forecast, provided at the company’s investor day last December, for growth of “at least” 13 per cent in the 2020 financial year.Factors including a one-time tax benefit and the pulling forward of share repurchases that are supporting earnings in the 2019 financial year will not be around in 2020.Mr Grismer said the company’s operating growth model remained “intact”, though.The company revealed in July that like-for-like sales during its third quarter — from the start of April to the end of June — rose 6 per cent from a year earlier, the highest quarterly figure since 2016, boosted by solid growth in the Americas, China and Asia Pacific.That prompted Starbucks to upgrade its outlook for the 2019 financial year — a forecast it reaffirmed on Wednesday. Adjusted earnings would grow about 16 per cent to a range of $2.80 to $2.82 a share for the current financial year ending September 30.Shares fell as much as 4.9 per cent in pre-market trade, before trimming declines to be down 3.2 per cent. They closed at a record $99.11 in July and are up 50.3 per cent so far in 2019.
12;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2019-07-25T20:56:15Z;Starbucks brews up biggest quarterly sales rise in 3 years;Growth in US and China help coffee chain boost annual outlook;Starbucks on Thursday lifted its outlook for annual revenues and profits after the US coffee chain boosted quarterly sales by the most in three years, sending shares up 6 per cent in after-hours trading.Like-for-like sales in the 13 weeks to the end of June rose 6 per cent from a year ago, the highest quarterly figure since 2016, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. They were up 7 per cent in the Americas and 5 per cent in China and Asia Pacific.Kevin Johnson, chief executive, has been leading an expansion by Starbucks into China, trying to capitalise on the country’s growing taste for coffee and expanding middle class.He is also trying to breathe new life into its US business with initiatives including improved menu offerings and the roll out of coffee delivery through a partnership with Uber Eats.As a result of the better than expected quarterly performance, the Seattle-based company said it now expected to deliver earnings per share for the full year of between $2.86 and $2.88, up from a previous range of between $2.40 and $2.44. It also expected comparable sales to rise 4 per cent, punchier than its previous guidance of between 3 and 4 per cent.In the quarter, Starbucks produced net earnings of $1.37bn compared with $852m last time, on net revenues of $6.82bn. Earnings per share came in at $1.12.

14;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2019-07-22T21:33:55Z;Starbucks takes stake in restaurant tech start-up;Eatsa rebranded as Brightloom after strategic rethink;Starbucks is taking a stake in Eatsa, a San Francisco-based restaurant tech company that has closed all of its automated cafés and is now trying to sell its systems to other chains.As part of a $30m fundraising alongside other investors, the world’s largest coffee chain with 28,000 outlets is also taking a seat on the board of the four-year old company, which is being rebranded as Brightloom.The investment from Starbucks is the latest sign of how some of the world’s largest restaurant companies are dabbling in new technology, from facial recognition to augmented reality, as they look to strengthen mobile ordering and delivery systems. Other deals this year include McDonald’s $300m purchase of Dynamic Yield, a machine learning company.Some of the ventures have had mixed results. Eatsa itself had promised to bring the once-popular coin-operated “automat” food service format into the 21st century through its own restaurants. Customers placed salad orders on iPads and collected their dishes from tech-enabled collection points without dealing with staff.But the company has closed all seven of its outlets, and Adam Brotman, a former Starbucks executive, joined the company in April to implement a change in strategy.“There’s a bigger opportunity — to change an entire industry,” he told the Financial Times, adding that Brightloom was now focused on providing its underlying technology to other restaurants. At present, he said, only 3 per cent of orders across the industry were digitised.Kevin Johnson, Starbucks’ chief executive, said in a statement: “We have experienced first-hand the power that comes through digital customer connections that are relevant to the customer . . . We’re excited to apply these innovations toward an industry solution that elevates the customer experience across the restaurant industry.”Starbucks is investing in Brightloom alongside the coffee company’s licensees Alshaya and Alsea, as well as Tao Capital Partners and Valor Equity Partners, which already invest in the start-up.As part of the deal, Starbucks is granting Brightloom a licence to parts of its proprietary system so the start-up can improve its offering to restaurant brands. The pitch to other chains is a “one-stop-shop” for mobile, payment and ordering systems as well as customer loyalty and personalisation schemes.
15;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2019-06-27T06:26:45Z;Starbucks pays more tax in UK despite loss;Coffee chain hopes delivery and drive-through will offset ‘challenging’ high street ;Starbucks increased the amount of tax it paid on profits from its European business last year, despite revealing a loss in the UK for the first time in five years.The coffee chain has been under particular scrutiny for its tax affairs since it was revealed in 2012 that it had paid just £8.6m of corporation tax in the UK over a 14-year period.It subsequently moved its European headquarters from Amsterdam to London to quell the public outcry but the company’s corporate structure still makes it complicated to see the full picture of its finances and has drawn criticism from tax campaigners.Starbucks revealed in its latest accounts that it had paid UK corporation tax of $23.6m across its European companies in the year to September 2018, from profits of $99.5m. That was an effective rate of 23.7 per cent — higher than the UK’s corporate tax rate of 19 per cent — and compared with a $13.9m tax bill in 2017.However, the amount the business paid in dividends to its US parent company, based in Seattle, dwarfed its UK tax bill.In 2018, its European business paid the publicly listed US business royalties of $448m, benefiting shareholders including the single largest holder of the company’s stock — its billionaire founder Howard Schulz.“That they’ve paid 23.7 per cent tax doesn’t prove anything to me. I want to know whether the profits are correct and where the royalties are going,” said economist and tax campaigner Richard Murphy, who added that moving profits around in this way would continue to damage Starbucks’ reputation.The UK subsidiary of the coffee group reported revenues of £387m for 2018, up from £372m the year before. But, because of a 10 per cent increase in costs relating to renegotiating leases and closing stores, it fell to a loss before tax of £17.2m, from a £4.5m profit in 2017.In its latest accounts the group said the loss was a result of “very challenging” conditions on the British high street, where low consumer confidence had hit footfall. “While not reflected in these results, we have already identified a clear strategy to respond to the ongoing pressures,” said Martin Brok, president of Starbucks’ Emea business.The strategy includes a £50m licensing deal with Nestlé to create Starbucks Nespresso coffee capsules, as well as a delivery service with Uber Eats. This is the toughest it’s been in more than two decadesStarbucks said it was also exploring smaller store formats and increasing its number of “drive thru” stores to cater for changing patterns of coffee consumption.“This is the toughest it’s been in more than two decades,” said Jeffrey Young, chief executive of Allegra Strategies, a food retail consultancy firm. He added that while coffee had been resilient through the 2008 financial crisis, consumers now had more demands on their wallets such as spending on apps and subscriptions, and that “Brexit was definitely a factor”.He also said that delivery was risky: “It’s difficult to keep up the quality of the coffee. Black coffee is no problem but a beautifully crafted flat white — impossible.”The UK business reported a tax expense of £4m, which arose because of £20m put aside for underperforming stores that was not tax deductible.Starbucks’ European operation — not including the UK — reported a total profit before tax in 2018 of $1bn, inflated by a dividend payment that the company said came largely from its Netherlands subsidiary and had already been taxed at source.Mr Murphy said that Starbucks should adopt country by country reporting, as that would be the only way to see whether the accounts presented a “fair result”.Are you interested in the latest company news?

16;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2019-06-18T22:00:24Z;Money cannot buy a Chinese coffee market;Forget the hype surrounding Luckin — China much prefers its tea;China remains a nation of committed tea drinkers, despite the persistent, considerable hype surrounding the Luckin Coffee chain. This 18-month old, homegrown brand, which is on track to open more stores in China than Starbucks, believes it can beat the Seattle-based coffee pioneer through the simple — if costly — strategy of persuading customers to drink coffee by paying them to do so. The evidence is unconvincing. Most urban Chinese are not drinking much more coffee than they were two years ago, an FT Confidential Research survey shows, with only those living in first-tier cities — China’s richest consumers — increasing their intake markedly. Just 29 per cent of respondents from third-tier cities said they drank coffee once a week, down from 31 per cent two years ago (we did not survey in rural areas, where the frequency would be much lower). China imported less coffee last year than it did in 2016. If anything, Chinese consumers are drinking more tea than ever before — including new variants such as fruit and bubble tea. Tea shops make up more than 70 per cent of freshly-made drink outlets compared with 53 per cent two years ago, according to Meituan Dianping. The food-delivery app says the tea orders it receives rose 24-fold from 2016 to 2018, compared with a 10-fold increase in coffee orders. The fact that the Chinese drink an average of 6.2 cups of coffee per year compared with Taiwan’s 209.4 cups — according to the Luckin IPO prospectus — implies there is plenty of untapped potential. But this arguably says more about China’s refusal to drink more coffee, two decades after Starbucks first opened in Beijing and 40 years after the opening up of the Chinese economy. This undermines the investment case for Luckin, which went public in New York last month. The Xiamen-based company’s prospectus boasted a “technology-driven new retail model” to drive consumption of coffee in China and aims to have 10,000 stores operating by 2021, a dizzying pace of expansion compared with the 20 years it has taken Starbucks to open 3,700 stores. Although most Luckin outlets are designed for takeaways, rather than offering the cookie-cutter lounge experience of Starbucks, this is an expensive business to run. Since inception, Luckin, whose losses ballooned to Rmb1.6bn ($231m) last year from Rmb56m in 2017, has essentially lost two cups of coffee for every cup of coffee sold. (Luckin did not respond to a request for comment.) Shares fell below their $17 IPO price in the days after Luckin’s May 17 debut but were last trading above $21, boosted by positive coverage from analysts. Starbucks flatters Luckin in emulating chunks of its business model, such as co-operating with Alibaba’s Ele.me on delivery and introducing ordering and pick-up functions via the Starbucks app. But take away Luckin’s generosity with consumers and the business model does not look so rosy. In our survey, Luckin did well with consumers regarding the taste of its coffee, but the results also showed that coupons and discounting are the biggest motivator for buying the brand. Luckin is notoriously generous with consumers, even by Chinese online-to-offline service standards. Sign up to the app and get a free coffee. Get a friend to sign up and get another freebie (Luckin’s claims of 17m transacting customers include these). Buy two, get a third free. The offers are so generous and so abundant that a small market has emerged online in Luckin coupons. Consumers have come to rely on such offers — lower spending on marketing, including coupons and discounts, helped the company cut losses by just over Rmb100m in the first quarter of 2019, but the number of new customers fell by more than a third from the previous quarter. Factoring in discounts, we estimate consumers are paying barely less than Rmb10 for a cup of Luckin coffee — cheaper than coffee served in convenience stores such as FamilyMart and 7-Eleven. FT Confidential Research has spent years surveying consumers on online to offline services. This is the first time that the generosity of discounts has been cited by consumers as their main reason for choosing a brand (in April 2017, for example, it came third among reasons for consumers to choose ofo, a now near-defunct bike-sharing service). This partly reflects how little coffee is drunk in second-tier and lower cities, where nearly 45 per cent of respondents said they drank Luckin because of the price. Asked what they would do if the discounts were taken away, 38 per cent of respondents in first-tier cities said they would still drink Luckin, and just 6 per cent of those living in second-tier and smaller cities. China’s car-hailing and food-delivery apps have been criticised for burning billions to build market share, but such companies can at least claim credit for trying to disrupt an established service. Luckin is trying to create something out of nothing, and spending hundreds of millions of renminbi doing so. Lu Zhengyao, Luckin’s founder and its biggest shareholder, tells a good story about Chinese market potential. In Luckin, he is repeating a trick he first performed with Car Inc, a company looking to cash in on a culture of car renting in China that is yet to emerge. Car Inc went public in Hong Kong in 2014 — giving early investors their exit — where the shares have languished below their IPO price for more than three years. Without a dramatic change in Chinese consumer tastes, Luckin shares are at risk of a similar fate.— Frank Zhang, Director of Consumer Research, FT Confidential ResearchscoutAsia is a corporate data and news service from Nikkei and the FT, providing in-depth information about more than 660,000 companies across more than 20 countries in east Asia, south Asia and Asean.

17;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2019-06-04T03:00:28Z;From bean to cup, what goes into the cost of your coffee?;Farmers get just 1p from a £2.50 brew, so why is your morning brew so expensive?;"With consumers drinking more coffee than ever before, it should be a great time to be a grower. However, the price of arabica beans — the higher quality, milder-tasting of the two main coffee beans — is trading just above $1 a pound on New York’s ICE, well under half the value it was just five years ago because of a flood of beans from the leading producer, Brazil.Many growers around the world are having to abandon their farms or turn to illicit crops such as coca. This, in turn, is casting doubt over the future sustainability of supplies — and could, ultimately, prove costly for consumers.Consumers might assume that at least part of any price increase for their morning cup of coffee is passed on to the farmer. But in an everyday £2.50 brew, the coffee itself accounts for just 4 per cent of the cost, or about 10p, while rent, labour and tax make up three-quarters of the overall price, according to consultancy firm Allegra Strategies.The long coffee value chain means that just a fraction of the 10p spent on coffee grounds ends up with the farmer.A lot happens after the coffee berries are picked from the tree.Processors wash the berries to remove the raw beans from the fruit, dry them and prepare them for export. Bagged, green beans are then passed through middlemen — importers, traders and exporters — to eventually end up in the hands of roasters.Using a 2012 test case cited by the International Trade Centre’s Coffee Exporter’s Guide as a benchmark, roasters end up taking almost 80 per cent of the wholesale coffee price. The grower takes a little more than 10 per cent, the equivalent of just 1p from a £2.50 cup of coffee.Over the years, the margin made by middlemen, such as traders and logistics companies, has been squeezed further. “Since I started 30 years ago, the prices we charge have been pushed down and down, and margins are getting tighter and tighter,” said Raf Roggerman, a commercial manager at Pacorini, a logistics group for commodities.While cafés and retailers end up taking most of the margin on a cup of coffee, of the wholesale value of coffee the roasters are the leading beneficiaries.Experts argue that not only does roasting turn green coffee beans into something that is drinkable, roasters spend time and money finding and blending the coffees that fit the flavour demands of their customers.“There is a major research and development cost to understand the flavour preferences of different consumers,” said Dan Webber, founder of speciality roaster Chimney Fire Coffee.Jamie Banwell, director of European sales at Diedrich Roasters, says a good roaster has experience of buying different coffees, visiting farms and will be able to taste and understand their product consistently and objectively. They are also able to roast the coffee more accurately and professionally.Roasters also carry much of the risk, often being left out of pocket because they only recover the cost of the beans when it is ready for sale.Nestlé and large retailers such as Starbucks have been taking advantage of the margins in roasting for some time, but smaller café chains are now starting to do the same.“At one point, roasters were the ones hoping to own a coffee shop, but now the reverse is happening; practically every café with more than one shop is interested in starting to roast themselves,” said Mr Webber.With the popularity in coffee continuing to grow, money is still flowing into the sector. “Coffee has been booming over the past 10 years. Often it seems like a bubble, but even smart money is investing and takeovers are still happening,” said Mr Banwell.Consolidation has followed the coffee craze, with larger players acquiring smaller roasters and retail chains. The world’s top 10 roasters — led by Nestlé, JAB (an investment company owned by Germany’s Reimann family, which has been building up a global coffee empire), and Lavazza — handle about 35 per cent of the world’s coffee, according to the Coffee Barometer Report by a group of sustainability non-government organisations.The costs affecting the price of a cup of coffee vary significantly by country.“Whilst coffee is a tradable commodity, a latte in a coffee shop is not,” said Michael Schaefer, global lead of food and beverages at Euromonitor International. “Most of what you’re paying for in any market is the space you’re in and the expertise of the staff making the product, along with the value of the brand relative to other products.”For example, a tall Starbucks latte in Russia is four times more expensive than the same drink ordered in the US when considered in relation to the costs of other goods. In some markets, where Starbucks is still positioned as a luxury brand, it is found in high-rent areas of the largest cities. The customer base tends to be well off relative to average incomes, and people are willing to spend more on the brands they like.Elsewhere, staff pay can be a significant part of costs, and in other markets, currency effects matter — a strong local currency can make a latte look quite expensive when viewed in dollar terms.This article has been amended to clarify the relative cost of coffee in different countries."
18;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2019-05-17T20:15:30Z;China’s Luckin Coffee closes 20% higher on market debut;Chain is spending heavily in bid to surpass Starbucks by number of outlets in home country;Shares in Starbuck’s Chinese rival Luckin Coffee closed 20 per cent above the issue price on it first day of trading on the US market, defying recent IPO weakness.The group raised $561m in an initial public offering to give the Chinese start-up a pre-trading market valuation of roughly $4bn, less than two years after the company opened its first outlet in Beijing.The IPO refuels the fast-growing company as it spends heavily in pursuit of its goal to surpass industry giant Starbucks in China by the number of outlets.In a sign of strong demand for the offering, Luckin sold 33m American Depositary Shares on Thursday, upsizing from the 30m originally planned. The $17-per-share price was at the high end of the price range of $15 to $17 it had indicated earlier. Each ADS represents eight ordinary shares.The shares opened nearly 50 per cent higher at $25 and went as high as $25.96 before profit-takers gradually chipped away at the gains. They closed nearly 20 per cent higher at $20.38.Alongside the IPO, the company has said it was offering ordinary shares to Louis Dreyfus, the agricultural commodities supplier, with which it is creating a joint venture for constructing and operating a coffee roasting plant in China.A statement by Luckin on Friday suggested the additional funds raised from Louis Dreyfus would be only $10.2m, taking the combined total to $571m. But the company said it could raise as much as $650.8m if its underwriters exercise a greenshoe option to purchase additional ADS after the listing.Luckin said last year that it plans to open 200 to 300 outlets a month, putting it on track to overtake Starbucks, which has more than 3,300 locations in China, by the end of this year.The shares priced at a rocky moment for financial markets, which have been rattled by a flare-up in trade tensions between the US and China and the disappointing IPO of the ride-sharing company Uber.The Luckin valuation marks a sharp increase from the company’s recent private funding round in April. Luckin raised $150m in that round from investors that included the US asset manager BlackRock, in a deal that valued the coffee chain at $2.9bn.Luckin differs from Starbucks in that its core business is deliveries and pick-ups and most of its stores do not have seating. About 10 per cent are delivery only. It claims to be able to deliver anywhere in major cities within 20 minutes. Luckin’s success was one reason Starbucks partnered with Alibaba to start beverage delivery in China last year.Since its inception in June 2017, Luckin has expanded from one store in Beijing to 2,370 stores in 28 cities in China at the end of March, with almost 17m customers. More than half are repeat customers. The company is growing so fast that it doubled its number of takeout customers in just eight months last year.Luckin has positioned itself as tech-savvy — its stores do not take cash — but as a bricks-and-mortar retail business with a sizeable cost base, analysts have questioned the sustainability of its business model, which uses heavy discounts to lure customers.Last year Luckin had net revenue of Rmb840.7m ($121.6m), compared with Rmb250,000 in the seven months it was operating in 2017. The net loss widened from Rmb56.4m to Rmb1.6bn. Revenue growth slowed significantly in the first three months of this year, compared with the previous quarter.For the first three months of 2019, net revenue was Rmb478.5m, up sharply from Rmb13m in the same period the year before. Its first-quarter net loss of Rmb551.8m was up from Rmb132.2m.The company was co-founded by Guo Jinyi, who remains its senior vice-president, and Charles Lu, who is non-executive chairman. Mr Lu, a Chinese entrepreneur, also founded Hong Kong-listed CAR, one of China’s largest vehicle rental companies.
19;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2019-05-07T12:20:57Z;Luckin Coffee: grounds for caution;IPO may deliver more froth than caffeine hit;Coffee chains are fighting five millennia of heritage in China. According to legend, tea-drinking started in 2737 BC when leaves blew into an emperor’s cup of boiled water. Starbucks and local rival Luckin want to rewrite local tradition in favour of newfangled coffee. To fuel expansion, the Chinese café group is raising funds in the US. The initial public offering may deliver more froth than caffeine hit. Luckin will raise up to $510m by selling 30m American Depositary Shares (ADS), each worth eight ordinary shares. Seen as Starbucks’ only serious rival in China, the group is valued at $2.9bn from funding rounds by investors including BlackRock of the US and Singapore’s GIC.Luckin plans to open up to 300 new stores a month and losses are rising. It will soon overtake Starbucks by number of stores, but not much else. Net losses were $241m on sales of $125m last year. The deficit stood at $82m in the first quarter of this year. The valuation suggests a forward price-to-sales ratio of around 18. The figure would be higher if the issue price is set near the top of the range of $15 to $17 per ADS. Starbucks, by comparison, has a price-to-sales ratio of 3.8. The group has the wired rating of a hot tech start-up. But Luckin is not one of these. It has hefty rents, for one thing. There are 2,400 stores and counting.Luckin is relying on fast delivery, low prices and a growing taste for coffee. As the Chinese middle class prospers, low prices will matter less. Sitting in a café run by the Seattle business synonymous with coffee may appeal more. Starbucks has a head start after 20 years in China.Right now, the average Chinese person drinks about five cups a year compared with 300 cups for the typical American. With consumption growing at a little over 10 per cent on an annual basis over the past decade, it will be a long time before coffee can become a daily staple. If it does, investors should seek a taste through the shares of Starbucks.Lex publishes two popular newsletters for premium subscribers. Wednesday: Lex Letter From London, New York or San Francisco.

20;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2019-04-25T21:14:06Z;China boost for Starbucks as chain faces off with Luckin;US coffee shop chain plans to expand delivery service to 50 Chinese cities;Starbucks is planning to bring coffee delivery to another 15 cities in China as the US chain faces off against fast-growing rival Luckin Coffee in the world’s second-biggest economy.Kevin Johnson, Starbucks chief executive, said that the company had already expanded to 35 Chinese cities in just four months, with 2,100 outlets, and by October would be offering delivery services from 3,000 outlets across the country.Results published on Thursday showed how Starbucks, as its once-rapid US expansion has levelled off, is capitalising on China’s growing taste for coffee and expanding middle class.Yet the company is being challenged in China by fast-growing Luckin, the country’s second largest coffee network, which filed paperwork with regulators this week for a New York stock market launch.Luckin specialises in delivery and takeaway coffee, and is trying to open more outlets on the mainland than Starbucks. It was valued in a recent funding round at $2.9bn.The “long-term opportunity” in China would “continue to attract many competitors”, Mr Johnson said. But he added: “Our leadership position is underpinned by our brand strength and operating results, which are the key points of competitive advantage in China.”He said the delivery service, in partnership with Alibaba, was “still in the launch phase” but that early results were encouraging. Beverages were brought to doorsteps in less than 20 minutes on average.The company also planned to make it possible to order and pay from mobile devices in China by October. “We’re building a meaningful and sustainable delivery channel, to complement our in-store experience,” Mr Johnson said.Sales at Starbucks’ coffee shops in China that have been open 13 months or longer ticked up 3 per cent from a year ago in the first quarter, yet new openings helped power a 9 per cent rise in net sales in the country to $703m.The Seattle-based company’s global café count passed the 30,000 mark after it opened about 1,000 outlets in the Asia Pacific region over the past year. About 94 per cent of openings were outside the US in the three months to the end of March.The figures also indicated Starbucks was driving growth with higher prices rather than attracting more customers. Volumes ticked 1 per cent lower in China during the quarter, and were flat in the US, where the company has about 14,780 outlets. In both markets, however, average prices rose 4 per cent.Total net quarterly revenues across Starbucks rose 4.5 per cent from a year ago to $6.3bn, while net income rose from $660m to $663m.The company raised its projections for full-year earnings, from a previous forecast of between $2.68 and $2.73 per share to a new forecast of between $2.75 and $2.79.Starbucks shares were just under 1 per cent higher at $77.73 each, in after-hours trading on Thursday

The company said last year it plans to open 200 to 300 outlets a month, putting it on track to overtake Starbucks, which has over 3,300 locations in China, by the end of this year.The company was valued at $2.2bn in a December in a funding round which included Singapore’s Government Investment Corporation. Luckin's core business is delivery and takeaway coffee, and unlike Starbucks many of its stores do not have seating, allowing it to expand more rapidly.Guo Jinyi, co-founder and senior vice-president at Luckin, told the FT last year that the company was not focused on profitability in the short term. The company continues to offer heavy discounts to new customers as it seeks to gain market share from established players.

Since then, the Brooklyn-born billionaire has been on a media carousel, with a series of high-profile TV interviews not to mention a cross-country book tour, which will take him to San Francisco, Los Angeles, Cleveland, Dallas and Atlanta.Joining him for the ride will be Mr Jackson’s network and supporters, culled from groups like Indivisible, the progressive protest movement that sprung up in the wake of Mr Trump’s election, and American Bridge, a liberal political action committee. In DC, Mr Jackson and his supporters had been doing a drive-by tour of the capital’s Starbucks branches, blasting Carly Simon’s “You’re So Vain” as their truck’s mobile billboard beamed anti-Schultz slogans.“People are giving us thumbs up. They’re saying things like, ‘We don’t need another billionaire president’,” says Mr Jackson. His work has been arguably easy. Besides the president, no one, it seems, has done more to unify the Democratic party in recent weeks than Mr Schultz, who appears to be relishing his role as the disrupter of the 2020 race.According to a recent poll for The Economist by YouGov, Mr Schultz has managed the difficult task of posting a negative net favourability of minus 17 percentage points — worse than Mr Trump’s, never mind the fact that Mr Schultz has a fraction of the name recognition. What accounts for Mr Schultz’s unpopularity? He would likely blame the entrenched interests of America’s two-party system, particularly Democrats who are loath to see an outsider claim the privilege of kicking the president out of office.Critics argue that the Starbucks chief is running solely to satisfy his own “grande ego” (as the protesters’ placards put it) and that his candidacy will siphon votes from the Democratic nominee, handing Mr Trump a victory — a “venti mistake”.The billionaire is undeterred: “How can you spoil a system that’s already broken?” he asked during a CNN town hall interview in Houston last week. He denied that the campaign was an ego trip. “It’s a lot less about me than giving the American people a voice they don’t have,” he said. “I’m running not as an independent. I’m running as an American, wrapping myself in an American flag.”Mr Schultz was eager to criticise both Mr Trump and the Democratic candidates lining up to run in 2020, but provided few details about his own policy platforms.He tore into Mr Trump’s ethical lapses and conflicts of interest but did not explain how he would navigate conflicts posed by his large Starbucks shareholding. He declined to say whether he would sell his shares in the company or handle the chain’s increasing dependence on China. He criticised Republicans’ 2017 tax cuts and Democrats’ plans for a new wealth levy. But he failed to provide counter proposals about how much tax billionaires should pay.Mr Jackson and his supporters are unimpressed. “The implication of Howard Schultz running for president is potentially severe consequences for our country,” he says, recalling Ralph Nader, who ran as a third-party candidate in the tight contest between George W Bush and Al Gore in 2000: “[He] couldn’t win — just like Howard Schultz can’t win if he runs — but he was able to peel off enough votes . . . to throw the election to George Bush. The consequences of that was we ended up going to war in Iraq . . . Thousands of Americans died.”Mr Jackson’s allies are already starting to research Mr Schultz’s history at Starbucks to go “beyond the public relations” fluff. “We’re escalating,” he says, raising his voice to be overheard over the strains of Nat King Cole’s “L-O-V-E”, blaring in the background. “This is basically day one.”courtney.weaver@ft.com
23;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Interview with Peter Harf: the man behind one of Europe’s biggest fortunes;Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing ;FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.Odds are you haven’t heard of Peter Harf. You may have heard of JAB Holdings, which has gone on a $50bn consumer industry deal spree since 2012.Harf, a 72-year-old German, steers JAB on behalf of one of the country's wealthiest and most secretive billionaire families, the Reimanns, who Forbes estimates is worth $17.6bn. But if you aren’t familiar with either, you probably have come across the portfolio of brands they control. The list includes Pret A Manger, Panera Bread, Jacobs Douwe Egberts, Krispy Kreme, Einstein Bros, Caribou Coffee, Keurig Green Mountain, Dr Pepper Snapple and Espresso House. For DD’s hipster readers, JAB even owns Intelligentsia and Stumptown Coffee. And it is bidding to take back majority control of Coty, the cosmetics and fragrances group it floated back in 2013.All that dealmaking has turned Luxembourg-domiciled JAB into a challenger to consumer industry giants, such as Nestlé, Starbucks and even L'Oréal.JAB’s journey is largely thanks to Harf’s efforts, which is the focus of this feature by Leila Abboud and DD’s Arash Massoudi, based on a rare 90-minute interview.The Reimann wealth dates back to when Johann A Benckiser founded Benckiser, a chemicals business in 1823. Ludwig Reimann would marry Benckiser’s daughter five years later and go onto inherit the business. Fast-forward to 1981: Harf joins Benckiser, which was a mid-sized Mittelstand company with a bleak future.He set about recruiting talented managers and doing deals to boost Benckiser’s fortunes. By 1999, Benckiser had effectively undertaken a reverse takeover of the UK’s Reckitt & Colman, forming the household goods group we now know as Reckitt Benckiser. He installed one of his best recruits, a Dutchman called Bart Becht (pictured below), to run the business. Harf told us his key to success was hiring people better than him: “Lions hire lions, and sheep hire other sheep.” Whatever the trick, he turned the remaining, and reclusive, Reimann heirs into billionaires. By 2012, Harf set about building an investment company that would deliver a succession path and allow JAB to survive his eventual departure. He recruited Becht, who had just stepped down as Reckitt boss, and Olivier Goudet, a Frenchman who had spent most of his career at Mars, the family-owned US foods group.The trio remade the consumer industry, using a playbook driven by Goudet’s financial engineering prowess and a vision for coffee as the asset class that JAB should corner. They bought everything in sight and paid top dollar. We’ve broken the news about some of the deals in DD, including last year’s takeover of Pret, and we’ve also been critical about the ones that made no sense to us.But all is not well inside JAB. Coty, its cosmetics business, has been problem-plagued. Then last month, we broke the news that Becht had quit JAB after falling out with Harf and Goudet over the pace of dealmaking and calling for JAB to pay more attention to cleaning up the operations of its portfolio companies. Until our story, the exit had been characterised as a “retirement”, despite the protestations of a highly paid spinner in Manhattan trying to cover-up the real story.Following that, Harf seems to have decided to take control of JAB’s messaging. In our interview, he confirmed the split with Becht, who declined to comment. Harf told us: “This is my mistake, a construction mistake, at the beginning,”He added: “What I didn’t realise at the time [I hired him] was that Bart is really more interested in operations, in operating, and we were trying to form an investment company. An investment company . . . is fundamentally different from a company that operates as its major thing.”With Becht gone, the task of steering the Reimann fortune now falls to Harf and Goudet. DD will be on top of it.After US sanctions against Russia over aggression in Ukraine saw western investors leave Moscow in droves, Baring Vostok’s Michael Calvey was in a tiny minority who bucked the trend.But, as of last Friday, Calvey earned an unwanted, rarer distinction as the first American executive in Russia to face criminal charges.Calvey and three other Baring Vostok partners are in pre-trial detention over a Rbs2.5bn ($37.8m) fraud case brought by minority shareholders who complained to Russia’s feared security services.Calvey told the court that the case is an extension of a shareholder dispute over Vostochny Bank, a Baring-owned top-30 lender, where the firm is alleging fraud in London arbitration. The minority shareholders deny this.According to the FT’s Max Seddon in Moscow, the unprecedented move has left some senior figures fearing it could be the death knell for Russia’s foreign direct investment — which fell from $27.1bn in 2017 to $1.9bn last year.Alexei Kudrin, Vladimir Putin’s longtime economic guru, called the case an “emergency.” Sberbank chief Herman Gref said he hoped it was a “misunderstanding.” The Kremlin says Putin won’t intervene on Calvey’s behalf.While Calvey isn’t the first foreign investor to fall foul of the Kremlin, the arrest of such a Russia-savvy businessman has spooked many of his peers.The Oklahoma-born private equity founder’s focus on Russia and hiring of local talent who could spot potential early saw him grow the fund to $3.7bn under management held on behalf of western pension funds, endowments, and portfolio investors. Even as foreign direct investment in Russia plummeted, Baring Vostok made $900m of investments in the last three years.“We are practically the only people still buying Russian assets, so it seems like it could be a good cycle for investment,” he told the FT’s Anne-Sylvaine Chassany in 2014.With Calvey behind bars, you have to wonder who else is going to buy them now.For all the scolds worrying that companies are exploiting their debt contracts to get away with murder, last Friday brought a moment of joy.A federal judge in New York ruled that Windstream Holdings had violated a covenant in a bond indenture when it created a spin-off subsidiary in 2015 that housed its copper and fibre optic telecom infrastructure.The suit was brought by Aurelius Capital Management, the famous distressed debt hedge fund known for tangling with the government of Argentina. Read the news story from DD's Sujeet Indap and Robert Smith that describes the nature of the conflict as well as this analysis that describes the idea of “net short debt activism”.The decision is the latest flashpoint in the ongoing clash between companies and hedge funds. Sceptics of covenant-lite debt worry that companies can exploit creditors for the benefit of shareholders, often private equity firms, and can increase risk-taking.In pursuing its lawsuit Aurelius took the position that it was standing up for debt holders rights not to be taken advantage of.Mark Brodsky told the FT in September, he had taken on Windstream because, “there’s nothing new about lenders enforcing covenants. What has changed is the aggressiveness with which corporate borrowers have been circumventing or ignoring key financial covenants. Windstream is not unique in this regard, but it is at the extreme end of what I have seen.”William Chalmers will join Lloyds Banking Group in June as its new chief financial officer. Chalmers, who is presently co-head of Morgan Stanley’s global financial institutions group, will replace incumbent George Culmer.Petra Diamonds has appointed Richard Duffy as chief executive. The former gold miner was previously chief financial officer of African operations at AngloGold Ashanti.Stephen Peel has resigned as a member of the non-government organisation Global Witness Board after his private equity firm Novalpina announced it would buy the cyber intelligence company, NSO.European sustainable investment fund Ambienta has made seven senior hires to expand its investments in Europe.

24;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2019-02-14T16:45:27Z;ECJ overturns commission’s ruling on Belgian corporate tax scheme;Court annuls verdict that scheme worth about €700m amounted to systematic state aid;"The European Commission suffered a defeat on Thursday in its drive to tackle illegal tax deals for multinationals after an EU court annulled its state aid decision against a Belgian tax scheme worth about €700m.The ruling by the European Court of Justice’s general court to overturn the European Commission decision is extremely rare and could have implications for a host of other tax cases including the appeals of past decisions against Apple, Amazon and Starbucks.The commission confronted Belgium over an “excess profits” tax scheme for multinationals, arguing that the arrangements gave them an unfair advantage over smaller rivals by allowing them to reduce their corporate tax base by 50-90 per cent.At the heart of the case was a decision by the commission that Belgium’s arrangements, used by 35 companies, amounted to a systematic state aid scheme.However the court concluded that Belgian authorities had “a margin of discretion over all of the essential elements of the exemption system”, meaning it could not be classified as a systematic scheme. The court did not examine whether individual decisions amounted to state aid.This defeat limits the commission’s ability to pursue cases against umbrella tax schemes that are not clearly defined. However such arguments have little impact on Brussels’ most high profile tax investigations, which have focused on tax rulings for individual companies.EU enforcers did win on another argument with more relevance to other high profile tax cases — including the commission’s decision to force Ireland to collect €13bn of back-taxes from Apple.Ireland supported Belgium’s argument that the commission had strayed beyond its remit by intervening on an issue of taxation that is a national power under EU treaties.The court concluded that the commission “cannot be accused of having exceeded its powers in the present case”. While that ruling is not unexpected, it rejects an argument likely to feature in the other appeals.The Belgian case was part of a wide-ranging crackdown by Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, on tax deals considered to be illegal state support.Ireland was forced to recover €13bn in back taxes from Apple; Luxembourg recovered €120m from Engie, €250m from Amazon and €20-30m from Fiat; and the Netherlands recovered €20-€30m from Starbucks. All these cases have been appealed in the EU courts, with decisions in the Fiat and Starbucks cases are expected soon.Ms Vestager concluded that a tax deal for McDonald’s in Luxembourg did not break the bloc’s rules, while she is still investigating Ikea, Nike and a UK tax scheme for multinational companies.The UK case was “more mechanical” than the Belgian one and “easier [for officials] to prove it is a scheme”, said Nina Niejahr, a state-aid expert with lawyers Baker McKenzie.The commission can appeal against Thursday’s decision.Additional reporting Alex Barker in Brussels"
25;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Starbucks’ Schultz shuns Democrats in bid for White House;Coffee billionaire says party has shifted too far to the left for him to support it;Howard Schultz, the billionaire founder of Starbucks who is considering an independent bid for the White House, will not run as a Democrat despite worries that his entry into the race could increase Donald Trump’s chances of being re-elected in 2020.Mr Schultz told a town-hall meeting with voters in Texas that there was no situation in which he would consider running as a Democrat because the party had moved too far to the left.“No. I didn’t even have to think about that,” he replied when asked by a CNN moderator if there was any scenario that would lead him to run in the Democratic primary.When Mr Schultz announced last month that he was considering a presidential run, he said he would not be a “spoiler” who would help re-elect Mr Trump. At the Texas town hall, he refused to say whether he would commit to dropping out of the race next year if he was having that effect.“How can you spoil a system that is already broken. It is just not working,” he said. “If the math doesn’t tally up when I get to the next three or four months and I take my message out to the American people . . . I will not run for president because I will not do anything whatsoever to re-elect Donald Trump. No one wants to see him fired more than me.”He also said that millions of Republicans who dislike Mr Trump would vote for him if the other choices were the president and a far-left Democrat.Michael Bloomberg, the founder of the eponymous media group, considered a run as an independent in 2016 but concluded that it would be impossible for a third-party candidate to win. The billionaire is now considering running as a Democrat.Some Democrats still blame Ralph Nader, the consumer rights campaigner, for Al Gore’s loss to George W Bush in 2000. Some Republicans believe that George HW Bush would not have lost to Bill Clinton in 1992 had Ross Perot, the businessman, not entered the race.Eleven Democrats have either launched campaigns or created exploratory committees which usually lead to formal announcements. More than a dozen others, including Joe Biden, the former vice-president, are also eyeing presidential bids. Beto O’Rourke, the former Texas congressman who duelled with Mr Trump over immigration policy on Monday night, is also considering a run.At the Texas town hall, Mr Schultz pledged to ensure that he would have no conflicts of interest as president — either related to his big shareholding in Starbucks, which has a large and growing presence in China, or any other investments. But he declined to say whether he would be willing to sell his entire portfolio of shares in the coffee company.Mr Schultz owns about $2.6bn in Starbucks shares, which represents about 69 per cent of his net worth of $3.8bn, according to Bloomberg data.“I think we are getting way premature. This is my third week since 60 Minutes,” Mr Schultz said.“There’s multiple ways to do this, to set up a blind trust, to do lots of things to remove any conflict of interest,” he added.Mr Schultz took repeated shots at Mr Trump but also stressed the difference between his views and some of the more liberal proposals — from healthcare to climate change — backed by the progressive Democrats running for president.He took particular aim at the “Green New Deal”, a proposal launched by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York lawmaker, to tackle climate change. He said the plan was unrealistic, arguing, for example, that its goal to make every US building use clean energy by 2030 would require the conversion of as many as 3,000 buildings a day for a decade.“Let’s not just throw stuff against a wall because it’s a good slogan or we get a press release. Let’s be truthful,” he said. “When I see politicians start throwing things out that I know is not realistic, that is not being honest with the American people.”Follow Demetri Sevastopulo on Twitter: @Dimi
26;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2019-02-01T11:27:44Z;CEOs with political ambitions should wake up and smell the coffee;Starbucks founder Schultz may find there are drawbacks to swapping C-suite for Oval Office;The presidential bid of Starbucks founder Howard Schultz has drawn a furious reaction. That is unusual: the idea of a successful chief executive in the White House tends to have currency in the US. Donald Trump won, in part, because of his role as a successful chief executive — which he played on television for decades. Creeping disenchantment with traditional politics has fuelled the appeal of the CEO-president and drawn a host of contenders, including Michael Bloomberg toying with a run and the 2008 campaign of Mitt Romney, who co-founded Bain Capital before entering politics. Carly Fiorina, former chief of Hewlett-Packard, ran in the 2016 Republican primary. Even Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg has embarked on a “listening tour” that looked very much like spadework for a presidential bid. The venom directed at Mr Schultz was greater than any aimed at those other exploratory tours or full-fledged campaigns. Today, many Americans worry that a third-party candidate would suck votes from a Democratic candidate. Or as a heckler put it more succinctly this week: “Don’t help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire asshole!”In addition to this reasonable objection, Mr Schultz should consider other drawbacks to swapping the C-suite for the Oval Office. No other country has so many business leaders jostling for high office. Thaksin Shinawatra moved from business to government in Thailand — but it did not end well. Silvio Berlusconi reached the pinnacle of business and politics in Italy, with plenty of controversy. The only current example in Europe is Andrej Babis, who built Agrofert, his agriculture, food and chemicals group, into the Czech Republic’s third-largest company before switching to politics and ultimately becoming prime minister. Often the system of government militates against CEOs becoming political leaders. Even if the UK adopted a presidency, though, it’s not obvious that billionaire business people would be rushing for the post. Many are, like Richard Branson, non-residents — surely a disqualification. Most others prefer to keep a low profile or, like JCB scion Anthony Bamford, put politicians on the payroll rather than stand for election.Most business people outside the US hesitate to wade into political debate. By contrast, many American chief executives have entire manifestos. Mr Bloomberg’s policies include combating climate change and gun violence. The boss of the financial data group was at least mayor of New York. JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon, who has never held elected office, included in his last letter to the bank’s shareholders eight points on its business strategy — followed by 10 on public policy. Mr Schultz is only beginning to flesh out his policies, although he has written four books. Above all, they show tremendous self-belief, a vital quality for running the country. For example, he acknowledges in one that many people consider Starbucks coffee to taste “burnt” but concludes this is because of the “lesser-quality coffees they’d grown up drinking in diners and restaurants or at home”.His growth experience could be useful. He took Starbucks from one store in Seattle to 28,000 in 74 countries. But such an expansionist foreign policy would be frowned upon. In theory, executive (or military) experience would help avoid a repeat of the drift of President Jimmy Carter’s administration. But the main challenge for a powerful CEO, as Mr Trump has found, is the limitations of the office.You can order a nuclear strike but, as Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker, recently showed Mr Trump, you cannot even decide the timing of your annual presentation to shareholders.Regardless of Mr Schultz’s appeal to the American voter, he should question whether the job has appeal to him. The Starbucks boss once summoned managers to his home at 9pm on a Sunday and expressed amazement that one did not immediately comply. The loss of control would be a bitter brew. 
27;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2019-01-28T18:14:58Z;Howard Schultz’s presidential ambitions draw backlash;Critics try to keep former Starbucks chief from third-party run in 2020;The backlash was swift. One day after former Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz announced he was flirting with a run at the presidency — as a third-party-independent — a chorus of critics descended on him.They branded him as selfish and self-serving, and warned that a third-party run would only destroy Democrats’ chances of re-taking the White House and hand Donald Trump a second four year-term.Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who considered running as an independent in 2016 and is weighing a 2020 bid as a Democrat, issued a statement saying he ruled out his independent bid because there was “no way” to win, arguing such an effort would now undermine attempts to defeat Mr Trump.“In 2020, the great likelihood is that an independent would just split the anti-Trump vote and end up re-electing the president,” Mr Bloomberg said. “That’s a risk I refused to run in 2016 and we can’t afford to run it now.”I would encourage Schultz and Bloomberg to have a conversation with Ross PerotMr Trump also entered the fray on Monday, appearing to goad Mr Schultz. “Howard Schultz doesn’t have the ‘guts’ to run for President! Watched him on @60Minutes last night and I agree with him that he is not the ‘smartest person’. Besides, America already has that,” he wrote on Twitter. “I have two words for Howard Schultz on a potential run for president as an independent: Just Don’t,” said Tina Podlodowski, chair of the Washington State Democratic party. She added: “Howard Schultz running as an independent isn’t about bringing people together. It’s about one person: Howard Schultz.” The 65-year-old Mr Schultz has been toying with the possibility of a 2020 White House run since June of last year when he announced he would step away from his role as Starbucks executive chairman. The speculation was stoked when he hired Steve Schmidt, the 2008 presidential campaign manager for John McCain. Mr Schmidt has since left the Republican party. In a 60 Minutes interview on Sunday, Mr Schultz confirmed that he was “seriously thinking of running for president” but would do so as an independent. He said both the Republican and Democratic parties were not doing what was “necessary on behalf of the American people” and instead were engaged in “revenge politics”. “What we know, factually, is that over 40 per cent of the electorate is either a registered Independent, or currently affiliates themselves as an Independent. Because the American people are exhausted. Their trust has been broken. And they are looking for a better choice,” Mr Schultz told 60 Minutes. While Mr Schultz has insisted that his candidacy would not act as a spoiler in the 2020 race, Democrats have been sceptical.Mr Schultz — whose wealth is estimated at $3.5bn according to Forbes — has said he believed he would have enough resources to get on the ballot in all 50 states. Barry Burden, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who has studied third-party runs, agreed. However, he said Mr Schultz would face other obstacles to a winning candidacy. “He has a shot, but it’s a long shot, and that would be true of any third-party candidate. There are just so many structural barriers built into the election system that make it difficult for a third-party candidate to succeed,” Mr Burden said. “There are real psychological barriers on the part of voters to support third-party candidates, particularly among Democrats. At the moment there are bad memories of [Green Party candidate] Jill Stein in 2016 in a few states and Ralph Nader in 2000 in one state,” Mr Burden said. He added: “I would encourage Schultz and Bloomberg to have a conversation with Ross Perot,” the billionaire who ran for president as an independent against George HW Bush and Bill Clinton in 1992.Mr Perot briefly led in the polls before campaign infighting caused him to pull out of the race, then later jump back in. Like Mr Schultz, Mr Perot was also sometimes accused of running for president as a vanity project, Mr Burden said.“There is a lot of learning to be done.”
28;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks sticks with China expansion despite slowdown;Economy still among fastest growing in the world, says top executive;The head of Starbucks’ overseas businesses has said the coffee shop chain retains a “firm belief” in China despite data this week that showed its economy was growing at its slowest pace in almost three decades.John Culver, who runs Starbucks’ operations in 58 markets outside the US, including China, told the Financial Times that the company stood by its plans to open nearly 600 coffee shops in the country over the next year.“Even with the [latest GDP] numbers, it’s one of the fastest growing economies in the world,” he said.Earnings published on Thursday underlined the growing importance of China to Starbucks, where the Seattle-based company is seeking to capitalise on a rapidly expanding middle class.Sales at cafés in China open 13 months or longer ticked up only 1 per cent — a decline from 6 per cent the same period a year ago — yet the addition of 560 new cafés helped total revenues from the country almost double to $652m.But as China develops a taste for coffee, Starbucks’ dominance is being challenged. Rivals include homegrown brand Luckin Coffee, which has expanded rapidly to about 1,700 stores across 21 cities.Starbucks is planning to expand in China at a time when investor concerns are growing about the outlook for the world’s second-largest economy.Apple cited a slowdown in China when it issued a revenue warning this month. The 6.6 per cent increase in gross domestic product recorded for 2018 was the lowest since 1990.“We’re committed to the strategy we have in place,” Mr Culver said, adding that he had confidence in the business in China in the “short, middle and long term”.The wider Asia-Pacific region will have about half of the more than 2,000 net new coffee shops Starbucks plans to open globally over the next financial year. The almost 600 planned for China add to an existing portfolio of 3,684 in the country.Starbucks had almost 30,000 company-operated and licensed cafés globally as of the end of 2018, up from just over 28,000 a year earlier.Shares in Starbucks, which have risen more than a third since they hit three-year lows last summer, rose as much as 4 per cent in after-hours trading, when its latest batch of figures reassured Wall Street.Like-for-like sales in the US, where slowing growth last year concerned investors, accelerated from 2 per cent in the same period a year ago to 4 per cent in the final three months of 2018. Total revenues from the company’s home market rose 8 per cent to $4.2bn as it opened another 595 coffee shops.Roz Brewer, chief operating officer, said the chain had sought to improve its offering after the disappointing performance over the 2017 holiday season. The company decided to fit out stores in a traditional red and green decor for Christmas 2018, for instance.Changes behind the scenes had also freed up staff to have more time to deal with customers. “We’re getting greater performance in the stores,” she said.Weakness in Europe, the Middle East and Africa held back the group performance. Total Emea revenues declined 1 per cent to $266m even though the company opened 324 new stores, because of fewer transactions.Total net revenues rose 9.2 per cent from a year ago to $6.63bn. Net earnings came in at $760m, down from $2.25bn last time when the figure was flattered by one-time gains, including from the sale of its Tazo brand.
29;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Uber and Starbucks’ hot idea has a tepid future;Coffee delivery services aim to tap our indolence and impatience;At the peak of Starbucks’ 1990s expansion programme, the satirical newspaper The Onion ran a story with the headline “New Starbucks Opens In Rest Room Of Existing Starbucks”.The ubiquitous coffee-shop chain has surpassed even that fantastical vision with its latest announcement that it will extend a pilot project with Uber, the logistics and technology group, to deliver coffee to your home or office from 2,000 US outlets.Finding a Starbucks café is not hard. The group has almost 15,000 in the US, and some 30,000 worldwide. If the chain has not yet reached caffeine saturation point, it is getting close, particularly in its home market. Predictions of slower growth unsettled investors earlier this year.Exploiting a global surge in impatience and idleness is one way to try to escape this bind. Food delivery services such as Uber Eats are already tapping the bottomless well of customer indolence with seamless chef-to-sofa offerings. When the service launched a few years ago, Uber boasted it could bring lunch to a customer waiting in line at a sandwich shop before he or she had even reached the front of the queue.Still, coffee and tea have certain characteristics that make them a difficult candidate for delivery. The overheads and logistics of delivery threaten what the entrepreneurial brains in Seattle or Silicon Valley would say were the drinks’ “unique selling points”. The product needs to be piping hot (or, in the case of Starbucks’ Frappuccino, ice-cold) and relatively cheap. A tepid, frothless latte, at a price higher than that charged in store, is not going to lift the spirits of the desk-bound drone who ordered it. It could even damage the Uber and Starbucks brands.Capitalism and technology will, of course, try to find a way. Marketing subsidies for such services in China sometimes cut the cost of a couriered cappuccino to below the store price. If the revolution in restaurant food distribution is anything to go by, someone is already devising a network of “dark” coffee shops, where pallid baristas pump out espressos solely for home delivery. Nobody has yet mentioned an airborne service, but IBM has filed a patent for cup-carrying drones that will buzz customers who appear to be in a “pre-determined cognitive state” for coffee.Kevin Johnson, Starbucks’ chief executive, says coffee for delivery is made hotter than usual. In China, where Starbucks has partnered with Alibaba, the temperature on arrival is already “very close” to that in store. The scale of Starbucks and Uber means such deliveries can be combined with others in dense urban areas.Extreme innovation, even if it falls short of the first stated objective, can yield other benefits, too. One of Mr Johnson’s colleagues has described the Chinese partnership, in a line that could come straight from The Onion, as “the rocket fuel for our holistic digital flywheel strategy”. Experiments in coffee conveyance may offer clues to Uber and others about how to make it easier to complete the difficult “last mile” leading to customers’ doors or desks.Cynics frowned at Starbucks’ original vision to bring decent coffee to the masses and were roundly disproved. Even so, it is hard to avoid the feeling that this latest move could turn out to be a cautionary tale of what happens when free capital can be splurged on implausible sounding projects.As lazy coffee-drinkers suck down their fourth hand-delivered gingerbread latte of the day, some are bound to decide that it would be cheaper, quicker, healthier, and more sociable to saunter round the corner to the café where the drinks were prepared.
30;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2018-12-14T12:42:30Z;Amazon is rewriting the rules for loyalty cards;Consumers want rewards and exclusivity and brands are scrambling to oblige;There is one thing about Christmas shopping that frustrates me above all else. That is when, frazzled and overheated from elbowing fellow shoppers, I finally reach the till and the shop assistant further delays my purchase by demanding a loyalty card. Either I end up having to fumble through tattered receipts and 15 bits of plastic, or I don’t have one and have to insist that I don’t want to spend time signing up. Either way, the card has little impact on my purchase.It was not always this way. Shopping loyalty programmes date back to the 1790s as a way to monitor recurrent custom. US merchants would give copper tokens to customers that could be claimed against future purchases. Since then, via Green Shield stamps and the Tesco Clubcard, the loyalty business has boomed.A survey of more than 28,000 North American consumers found that the average person is enrolled in 14 loyalty programmes. More than three quarters of Brits are members of a scheme. Yet, the same American survey estimates that around $100bn worth of loyalty points go unused. Points mean prizes — but not ones that shoppers want.The two supermarket chains gaining market share in the UK — Lidl and Aldi — have neither loyalty programmes nor plans to start them. Year-on-year UK profits at Aldi increased by nearly 30 per cent in 2017. Lidl claimed to be the ‘fastest growing supermarket’ last Christmas with a 16 per cent increase in December sales.Shoppers wooed by Waitrose with free coffee for myWaitrose members, now defect to Lidl in search of luxury Christmas puddings at less than half the price. Was Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff right when he declared last year that consumer “loyalty is dead”?Céline Fenech, Deloitte’s UK research manager for consumer products, says no: the area is merely evolving. While traditional point-based schemes are on the way out, brands can find other ways to build relationships with their customers. “It’s not just the purchase of a product that should be rewarded,” she says. “For example, how much of a brand ambassador you are is also important, especially for the younger generation.”Ease of use is vital. Customers are flocking to new apps such as Stocard, a digital holder for store cards. And LoyalCoin, a multi-store loyalty point system based on a digital currency, has gained 40,000 WhatsApp users in the last three months.But what consumers want most are personalised rewards and exclusivity — and coffee chain Starbucks is happy to oblige. Its “rewards” customers can claim free coffees and early access to new and seasonal drinks — such as the pumpkin spiced latte, which has its own Instagram account with 36,200 followers. And they can all be ordered on the Starbucks app. This year the scheme’s membership grew 13 per cent to 15m people.But there is one loyalty scheme that outdoes all others, and is so popular that people pay to participate. This year, Amazon revealed how many of its customers belong to Prime, its paid membership service that includes everything from free shipping to video streaming and discounts at the grocery chain Whole Foods. Participation has now topped 100m people, even though the service costs £9.99 per month in the UK.With the clout to offer big benefits, Amazon can afford to ask people to pay to join. A study of the company by the Max Borges Agency found that 45 per cent of US millennials visit the platform daily and that 77 per cent would rather give up alcohol for a year than Amazon. More worrying, 44 per cent would rather give up sex.Still, even Prime members can be grouchy. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos recently wrote in a shareholder letter that one thing he loved about his customers is “that they are divinely discontent”.My commitment to the site ebbs and flows. In a vague stand against Amazon’s dominance, I cancelled my Prime membership last year. But renewal is only a matter of time. The nearer Christmas gets, the more appealing next day delivery becomes.alice.hancock@ft.com
31;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Uber to start delivering Starbucks;Coffee chain to offer delivery from 2,000 US outlets in bid to counter dimming growth outlook;Starbucks is teaming up with Uber to offer coffee delivery from 2,000 of its US outlets as it pushes for new sources of sales in its domestic market in the face of declining expectations for long-term earnings growth.Kevin Johnson, chief executive, said in an interview that Starbucks was mimicking in the US the kind of delivery partnership it recently launched in China with Alibaba. In China, it offers delivery in 30 cities, having launched only three months ago.“We’ve learned a tremendous amount about delivery and we’re now applying those learnings here in the US,” he said.The push into coffee delivery is Starbucks’ latest initiative to reinvigorate growth in the US, following an aggressive expansion that has taken its global coffee shop count to almost 30,000.The company had previously unnerved investors with slowing growth in its domestic market, although its most recent financial results suggested it had found new ways to drive revenues and profits, with the strongest like-for-like sales in the US in five quarters. Its shares have rallied more than a third since July, giving the company a market capitalisation of $83bn.Delivery is all about scale economics — the more transactions and deliveries you get, the more efficient you can beShares in the Seattle-based chain, which hosted its biennial investor day in New York on Thursday, rose 1.2 per cent during the day — but fell 2.9 per cent in after-hours trading after it spelt out its financial targets.While Starbucks kept its guidance for the current financial year unchanged, the company reduced its targets for earnings per share growth over the “longer-term” from at least 12 per cent to at least 10 per cent.Other initiatives the company is undertaking to drive growth include new products, such as Draft Nitro Cold Brew, a shake-up of its loyalty scheme and concepts such as high-end “Reserve” stores.Starbucks has tried coffee delivery in the US before. The chain tested a similar initiative with Postmates, the logistics company, three years ago. The fee proved prohibitive for some customers, however, costing more than a regular coffee. Mr Johnson said Starbucks was still “experimenting” with what fee to charge.“Delivery is all about scale economics — the more transactions and deliveries you get, the more efficient you can be,” he said.Following a successful pilot in Miami, Starbucks plans to roll out the delivery service to about 2,000 US outlets — almost a quarter of its 8,500 company-operated cafés in the country.Mr Johnson highlighted the working relationship he had established in the past six months with Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive. The San Francisco ride-hailing company coded software to integrate with Starbucks.Challenges include delivering the coffee at the right temperature, although Mr Johnson said that in China it was “very close” to being as hot upon delivery as it would be in a café.The tie-up with Starbucks is a win for Uber as the ride-hailing company prepares to launch on the stock market next year. Uber has held up its Eats division as an example of how it can diversify its business into new markets and new lines of revenue — and support a public valuation that bankers believe could exceed $100bn.Uber Eats, launched in 2014, has become the largest food delivery service outside China. The business operates in more than 350 cities in 36 countries and has been pushing into new markets across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and suburban North America this year. Corporate partners include McDonald’s, Popeyes and Subway.Gross bookings — the total amount Uber Eats takes in before paying couriers and restaurants — hit $2.1bn in the third quarter, up 40 per cent from the $1.5bn in the first quarter and 150 per cent higher than a year ago. Eats’ bookings accounted for about 16.5 per cent of the company’s overall gross bookings.
32;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
33;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;China’s Luckin Coffee valued at $2.2bn in latest fundraising round;;Chinese coffee chain Luckin Coffee has raised $200m in its latest funding round, bringing its valuation to $2.2bn as the fast-growing company challenges the dominance of Starbucks in China.Investors in the round include Singapore’s Government Investment Corporation, China International Capital Corporation alongside Joy Capital and Centrium Capital, the company said on Wednesday.Luckin has expanded to 1,700 stores across 21 cities and claims customers in downtown Beijing and Shanghai now have a store within a five minute walk.The latest investment follows on from its July funding round when it raised $200m, valuing the chain at $1bn. GIC, Joy Capital and Centrium Capital also invested in the earlier round.“We will continue to increase capital investment in product research and development, technological innovation and business development, and continue to optimize product and user experience,” Luckin chief executive Qian Zhiya said.Rival Starbucks had an 80 per cent market share of China’s $3.4bn coffee shop market, according to Euromonitor.
34;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2018-12-09T05:00:24Z;Starbucks’ Kevin Johnson: taking on a founder’s brand;The coffee chain chief is building a robust company that can outlast any leader;"Howard Schultz’s books are still on sale at 1912 Pike Place, Seattle, but in March last year the man who built Starbucks into an $84bn consumer brand handed the brass key to its first store to a new chief executive. This June the de facto founder stepped down as executive chairman, signing off by writing “Onward with love” on the narrow store’s yellowing wall. Now, at 6.45am on a dark Monday morning, Kevin Johnson is standing beside his predecessor’s motivational graffiti, joking with the cup-tossing baristas as he instructs a visitor in how to make espresso. A triple-shot macchiato man, the 58-year-old is already caffeinated after an early start in the office. It is a chance to check in with a handful of his 350,000 “partners” about how the season’s juniper lattes are selling, and to talk about what he describes as a transition “from a founder-led to a founder-inspired company”. Inspiration has been a part of Starbucks’ mission statement for most of its 47 years and its new boss shares Mr Schultz’s taste in uplifting management mantras. Mr Johnson’s Starbucks is one where each store is a community-boosting “third place”, where empowered baristas “nurture the human spirit” by remembering their regulars’ names and just how they take their brew. It is a venti-half-full description that does not chime with every customer’s experience of a chain that now serves 100m people a week from 29,000 stores in 78 countries. Mr Johnson concedes that ubiquity makes it harder to replicate the premium buzz that draws tourists to the Pike Place store where it all began, but his recipe for making Starbucks stand out again starts with the 350,000 people he must inspire to follow someone other than the man who personified their company for decades and may run for the presidency in 2020. The “life journey” Mr Johnson likes to talk about when he visits stores is very different from Mr Schultz’s. Born south of Seattle, he grew up in Los Alamos, New Mexico, the son of a theoretical physicist and a nurse. He learnt to write software en route to a business administration degree and first worked as an IBM engineer. Over 16 years with Microsoft he rose to run its Windows and online services division, leaving after its failed bid for Yahoo to become CEO of Juniper Networks. In 2001 he met Mr Schultz, after the latter wrote to Microsoft founder Bill Gates to propose a partnership to bring WiFi to Starbucks branches. Mr Schultz asked Mr Johnson to join Starbucks’ board in 2009, and to become chief operating officer in 2015. Mr Johnson says that working with founders for 25 years helped him engineer a handover at Starbucks that let him “get the best out of Howard” while staying focused on his own task: to create “a multigenerational company” that could outlast any one leader. Taking the reins required “having the wisdom to know what to honour from the past and the courage to reimagine the future,” Mr Johnson says, and he has already done a fair amount of reimagining. His early moves include cutting 350 head office jobs and closing underperforming US stores — hard decisions that he says he prepared staff for transparently, using open forums to explain the need for change. He has signed a $7.15bn global licensing deal for Nestlé to market Starbucks products outside its cafés, pledged stronger shareholder returns, and outlined a clearer focus on the US and China, where he struck a delivery partnership with Alibaba and stated the goal of tripling revenues in five years. Colleagues credit his tech background with helping Starbucks outpace other retailers in mobile ordering and payments. Mr Johnson cannot afford to coast on his predecessor’s legacy because competition is intensifying. Rivals from Lavazza of Italy to JAB, the Luxembourg-based investment group, are snapping up smaller brands, and Coca-Cola has shaken up the sector with its £3.9bn acquisition of the UK’s Costa Coffee chain. The challenge is to differentiate Starbucks, and one of Mr Schultz’s responses was to launch a premium brand, Starbucks Reserve, with its first “roastery” near the original Seattle store. It is a theatrical place where beans fly through tubes into copper-clad roasters, the aroma of fresh loaves escapes cast iron ovens and obsessive baristas lovingly fold grounds into bubbling glass flasks.“This is a brand uplifter,” Mr Johnson says, but while the company initially said it may open 1,000 Reserve stores (most without the roasters) its new leader is not about to sign off on such an investment unless early pilots pay off. “The team has very clear objectives they have to meet before we move forward,” he says carefully. On the eve of a biennial investor day this week, shareholders are also looking for discipline and results. After a market-beating run from 2009 to 2015 the stock drifted sideways, and when Mr Johnson announced a slowdown in US expansion plans in June, it dropped 9 per cent in a day. In recent weeks, though, signs that new products are boosting growth have sent Starbucks’ shares to new highs. Mr Johnson’s biggest test so far came in April, when he was alerted to a video of two black men being arrested in a Philadelphia Starbucks store because an employee had called the police after they sat at a table without ordering. As the footage shot around social media, prompting calls for a boycott, he flew to Philadelphia to meet the men, his staff and local officials. Mr Schultz was still in a full-time role, but it was an ashen Mr Johnson who appeared on television pledging to learn from the incident. His response was personal, swift and concrete: he fired the employee who had called the police, agreed a settlement with the two men and closed all 8,000 US stores for an afternoon of anti-bias training. “It was not something I was going to shy away from,” Mr Johnson explains. “I’m an experiential learner so I’m going to get involved. I’m accountable for it and I’m going to show up.”Who is your leadership hero?Growing up, my father would tell me stories about [UCLA Bruins basketball] coach John Wooden . . . What influenced me was, number one, his humility. He was a values-driven leader who put the team first. He was disciplined: [on] the first day of the season he would teach the players how to put on their socks and lace up their shoes because those were things they could control and therefore it was their responsibility to do that. And all of that came together in the results he achieved. The analogies between creating a team, creating discipline and focus and being connected to a mission that’s bigger than any one of us . . . I think that shaped me quite a bit.What was your first leadership lesson?At 15-years-old I got a job as a little league umpire; I umpired at baseball games for the nine to 12-year-olds. One of the leadership lessons you learn quickly, calling balls and strikes behind home plate, is you’ve got to understand the rules and you’ve got to be decisive. If you have parents of young children sitting in the bleachers you learn very quickly you’ve got to understand what you’re doing, be decisive and communicate . . . why you made the decisions you made. If you weren’t doing this, what would you be doing?I guess I’d try to be a musician. [He picks up a Les Paul electric guitar propped against a wall in his office and starts strumming quietly.] I play in here every day. It relaxes me . . . I play this while I’m walking around in here thinking."
35;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2018-11-13T20:18:57Z;Starbucks to lay off 350 corporate employees;The coffee chain announced a broader reorganisation in September.;Starbucks will lay off about 350 corporate employees as part of a broader restructuring plan, according to a memo chief executive Kevin Johnson sent to employees on Tuesday.The move is part of a reorganisation announced in September aimed at allowing the US coffee chain to better compete with rivals. Starbucks has shifted its focus to rapidly expanding its footprint in China while sales in its home market have slowed.The lay-offs will mostly impact employees in Starbucks’ Seattle headquarters, Mr Johnson said. Starbucks began informing affected employees on Tuesday.“Every single decision was made after very careful consideration and reviewed with leaders across the company,” he wrote in the memo, obtained by the Financial Times. “And while incredibly difficult, they came as a result of work that has been eliminated, de-prioritised or shifting ways of working within the company.”The company employs about 5,000 people in its headquarters. The job cuts do not include retail staff.Starbucks also laid off an unspecified number of senior leaders in September.Mr Johnson told employees in September Starbucks would lay off some non-retail employees and make changes to its leadership team and corporate structure. In June, the company said it planned to close 150 stores in the US next year.Shares were down 0.9 per cent in afternoon trading on Tuesday.
36;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2018-11-12T00:01:00Z;Prada, Starbucks and Kraft censured over human rights transparency;;Prada, Starbucks and Kraft Heinz are among companies criticised for a lack of transparency on human rights in their businesses and supply chains, despite pressure from governments and an investor-backed group.Forty per cent of companies fail to show any evidence of how they identify and address human rights issues, according to the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark, a not-for-profit group based in London.The CHRB released its second annual ranking of 101 global companies today. The body is backed by asset managers including Aviva Investors, APG and Nordea, as well as the Swiss, Dutch and British governments, and uses the UN guiding principles on business and human rights.It analyses companies using criteria including whether a board reviews human rights issues, how it ensures workers in supply chains are paid a living wage, and efforts to avoid child labour.“The overall picture is deeply concerning,” said Steve Waygood, chief responsible investment officer at Aviva Investors and chairman of the CHRB.“This raises questions for investors and consumers as to whether these companies are serious about avoiding harm to people in their pursuit of profits.”Forty of the 101 companies scrutinised could not show whether they were identifying human rights risks in their operations.The average score across all companies in 2018 was 27 per cent, up from 18 per cent in the first survey last year. The increase partly reflects methodological changes but CHRB said the main reason was better company disclosures, policies, processes and practices.Almost two-thirds of companies scored less than 30 per cent in the 2018 survey and more than a quarter scored less than 10 per cent.CHRB’s research, which was assisted by EIRIS Foundation, a responsible investment research group, was based on public information and voluntary additional disclosures from companies.Human rights is an area of increasing concern to investors. In part this reflects the emphasis on responsible investment but is also a recognition that violations can have a financial cost through lower share prices or litigation.Aviva, APG and Nordea, which manage more than $1tn between them, have told the CHRB that the 2018 benchmark will be a factor in their investment decisions. “It is an enormous risk,” said Alexandra Morris, investment director at Skagen Funds, a NKr65bn (£5.9bn) Norwegian investment manager. “We as investors have to push [company] managers.”Kraft Heinz, which scored 5.2 per cent, said it was disappointed with its score. “We do not believe it properly reflects our strong commitment,” the US food group said. “Kraft Heinz places a high value on an ethical and transparent supply chain.”Starbucks, which scored 8.5 per cent, said it would review the CHRB report in detail and would challenge it “in areas we feel the report inadequately reflects our robust commitments”.“We have instituted practices for decades…that give insight into our entire coffee supply chain, including our zero-tolerance policies for human rights infractions,” the group said.Prada, which scored 3.6 per cent, declined to comment.Those that performed well in the ranking included miner Rio Tinto, Marks and Spencer, the UK retailer, and consumer goods giant Unilever, with scores of at least 65 per cent. Adidas was top performer with 87 per cent.

In the previous quarter, growth in the Americas had been just 1 per cent.Roz Brewer, chief operating officer, highlighted “innovation” in Starbucks’ product lines. She cited cold brew and Instagram-friendly Refreshers, whose colourful flavours include Mango Dragonfruit and Acai Lemonade.Starbucks is also introducing healthier offerings, shaking up its loyalty scheme and bringing in new concepts such as a high-end “Reserve” store to revive growth in the US.The company plans to add a net 2,100 new coffee shops globally over the next financial year, down slightly from the 2,300 for the year just ended. China and the wider Asia Pacific region is expected to account for about half of them. Another 600 will be opened in the Americas and 400 in Europe.The latest results come four months after Mr Schultz stepped down as executive chairman, ending a 36-year tenure at the helm. Bill Ackman’s activist hedge fund Pershing Square disclosed last month it had built a 1.1 per cent stake, making it one of the company’s 20 biggest investors.Shares in Starbucks rallied 8.6 per cent in New York to $63.64 in after-hours trading. The shares have missed out on the stock market rally since the start of 2016, being little changed over the period while the S&P 500 advanced 34 per cent.Fourth-quarter earnings per share came in at $0.56, up 4 per cent from the same period last year.
38;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2018-10-10T17:59:33Z;Ackman/Starbucks: many happy returns;Pershing Square chief may have found contentment, but investors have not;Firmly in middle age, Bill Ackman may have finally found some contentment. At an investor conference this week, the now-humbled activist investor announced he was engaged to be married, to a high profile scientist at MIT. The past several years had been difficult, on a professional level, for Mr Ackman. His hedge fund, Pershing Square, endured billions of losses caused most notably by its disastrous investment in Valeant, the renegade pharma company.So far in 2018, though, Mr Ackman has rediscovered some investing success. His publicly listed Pershing Square vehicle has returned 15.8 per cent net of fees, as various holdings have finally paid off. At this week’s conference he touted his latest thesis, a $900m bet on Starbucks, the once-hot coffee chain. Whatever the merits of the Seattle-based company, this kind of pure value-style investing feels different for a man who made his reputation as an ornery activist.Starbucks’ shares, on a total return basis, are flat over the past three years on slowing like-for-like sales in a highly competitive marketplace. Mr Ackman noted that the growth in big coffee platforms like JAB and Nestlé signal the attractiveness of both cafés and espresso machines on kitchen counters.He believes the Starbucks brand still has plenty of room to grow, particularly in China. As its price-to-earnings multiple of just over 20 times is well below its historical average of 26, he anticipates a sharp rebound in the shares if earnings improve. Mr Ackman’s analysis, however, compares Starbucks’ trading valuation with various coffee merger deal multiples, which include takeover premiums. This is mistaken.The broader success at Pershing Square in 2018 comes from the fund’s other slate of US large capitalisation bets, such as Chipotle, Lowe’s, and Automatic Data Processing. While so far Mr Ackman has beaten the broader market by a few percentage points, many hedge funds have not. Charging high fees (which admittedly have been reduced of late) while making traditional long-only stock bets does not appeal the way it once did. And it is too early to say he has found his investment mojo. The Amsterdam-listed Pershing Square vehicle trades at a one-quarter discount to its net asset value, the widest in its four-year history.While Mr Ackman has achieved some fulfilment, his public shareholders cannot say the same.

Mr Ackman told a conference in New York that his fund had taken a position equal to a 1.1 per cent stake in the chain, arguing the shares had the potential to more than double in value over the next three years.His interest in Starbucks comes three months after Howard Schultz stepped down as executive chairman, ending a 36-year tenure at the helm, and as the company deals with slowing growth in its home US market after rapid expansion.Mr Ackman pointed out on Tuesday that Starbucks’ stock had missed out on a broader market rally, noting that even including reinvested dividends it had delivered a shareholder return of 0 per cent in the past three years.Nevertheless he was supportive of the company’s management, describing as “encouraging” efforts to improve Starbucks’ fortunes by Kevin Johnson, the recently installed chief executive.“Starbucks’ recent challenges are fixable with appropriate management execution,” the presentation said.Highlighting the company’s plans to expand in China, Pershing Square said it expected Starbucks’ earnings to rise in the country at nearly twice the group’s overall rate.Although Starbucks has more than 14,000 stores across the US, the hedge fund also said the company was “relatively underpenetrated” in the American Midwest and south.It blamed the recent slowdown in Starbucks’ domestic market on factors including competition from boutique coffee shops at one end and lower-cost rivals such as McDonald’s on the other.The presentation also identified sales cannibalisation, a “consumer shift” away from the iced and blended Frappuccinos, and problems with the rollout of a mobile ordering service.In June, Starbucks said it expected to open fewer stores in the US in the next fiscal year and would close about 150 stores across the country. Its forecast for sales growth fell short of analysts’ targets. Still, Pershing Square said premium coffee was a “secularly growing and attractive category” and that healthier offerings, a loyalty scheme shake-up and new concepts including its high-end Reserve store should revive the US business.This week Starbucks appointed Hyatt Hotels’ Patrick Grismer as its new chief financial officer, replacing Scott Maw.Shares in Starbucks rallied 2.6 per cent after the disclosure on Tuesday, giving the Seattle-based company a market capitalisation of $78.3bn.

He previously worked at Yum brands, which owns Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, and served in a number of finance and strategy positions at Walt Disney.The Seattle-based company has been confronted with a change in its top ranks after executive chairman Howard Schultz and chief financial officer Scott Maw both announced earlier this year that they would be stepping down.Mr Maw said he would retire on November 30 but stay on as a senior consultant until March 2019 to ensure a smooth transition.Kevin Johnson, Starbucks president and chief executive officer, said:As a seasoned CFO of multiple global, consumer-facing growth companies, Pat brings tremendous finance expertise, a customer-centric mindset and a wealth of restaurant industry experience to StarbucksThe coffee chain disappointed its investors in June as it announced it expected to open fewer stores in the US in the next fiscal year, and that it would be closing 150 stores across the country. But in the fiscal third quarter the company posted an 11 per cent rise in revenues ahead of market forecasts.Grismer will join the company on November 12.Starbucks shares are down 3 per cent from the beginning of the year.
41;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;Chinese rival to Starbucks pursues growth at expense of profit;Newly minted Luckin Coffee aims to take lead in store openings in the country;"Luckin Coffee, a Chinese chain that has become the country’s first coffee shop valued at $1bn, says it is not worried about profits as it moves to challenge US rival Starbucks’ dominant position in the country’s fast-growing market.Starbucks had an 80 per cent share of China’s $3.4bn coffee shop market last year, according to Euromonitor. The market research consultancy expects the sector to generate revenues of $4.1bn by 2020, making China a key growth market for coffee chains.Luckin, which was founded last year, was valued at $1bn in July in an investment round involving Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC. It has opened 1,000 stores since January and aims to have 2,000 outlets by the end of the year.It plans to continue to open 200 to 300 outlets a month, putting it on track by the end of next year to overtake Starbucks, which has 3,300 stores in China and opens about 50 new ones a month.“I think we will overtake them in store numbers,” Guo Jinyi, co-founder and senior vice-president at Luckin, told the Financial Times. “We are increasing the density, so that in the centre of cities where we have stores, our outlets can be found within a 10-minute walk.”Given its recent fundraising, Luckin is not worried about losses, he added: “We are still in a stage of fast development . . . We are not thinking much about profits at the moment.”By pursuing expansion at the expense of profit, Luckin is following a playbook developed by the country’s tech giants such as ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing, which this month confirmed a loss of $580m in the first half of the year.Luckin this month announced a partnership with Tencent for marketing on its social media platform WeChat, a month after Starbucks announced a tie-up with Tencent’s arch-rival Alibaba to enable coffee delivery.“The co-operation with Tencent is mainly in the technical domain; it’s not a capital injection. But we are discussing the possibilities for deeper co-operation,” Mr Guo said.While Luckin still lags behind Starbucks in terms of store numbers, it has surpassed UK chain Costa Coffee, which was acquired by Coca-Cola last month for $3.9bn. Despite the market’s promise, Costa has struggled in China, where it has been operating for a decade but still has fewer than 450 outlets.Unlike Starbucks and Costa, whose outlets are social venues, about 60 per cent of Luckin’s stores are beverage “pick-up points” in office buildings, with another 10 to 20 per cent of its stores delivery-only, according to Mr Guo.Mr Guo said Costa’s more traditional model contrasted with the focus on technology at Luckin. “[Costa’s] model is different from us, so a large company acquiring them won’t have a big impact on us,” he said.Luckin has complained that Starbucks’ strong brand in China gives it first choice of commercial locations, but being a Chinese company appears to provide some advantages. Last week Luckin opened an outlet inside the walls of Beijing’s Forbidden City, 11 years after Starbucks was forced to close its branch in the former imperial palace after an online campaign by Chinese nationalists."
42;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2018-09-18T23:23:48Z;Starbucks’ European unit paid 2.8% UK tax last year;Bill reduced partly by tax breaks on share payments to employees;Starbucks’ European business paid an effective UK tax rate of just 2.8 per cent in the year to the end of October 2017 after a payment from another part of the group boosted profits.The coffee chain, which has in the past faced vocal criticism of its tax affairs in Britain, has revealed that its largest European operation paid $5.9m of tax in the UK on profits of $213m, down slightly from $219m in the preceding year.The profit figure was inflated by a $150m dividend from another group entity on which Starbucks had already paid tax.Stripping out the dividend payment, the effective tax rate for the European business — which has 3,000 stores in 40 countries — was 9.4 per cent. The UK corporate tax rate is 19.5 per cent.Starbucks was accused of tax avoidance in 2012 after it emerged the chain had paid just £8.6m of corporation tax in Britain over 14 years. To calm the public backlash it moved its European headquarters to London from Amsterdam, raising its tax payments.But campaigners said the group’s complicated structure and payments between subsidiaries made it difficult to assess whether its approach to paying tax had improved.Its tax bill for 2017 was reduced partly by tax breaks related to employees being paid in shares. A further reduction came from the “tax effect of expenses that are not deductible in determining taxable profit”, according to the company’s accounts for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region.All governments should require public country-by-country reporting for all companies, so it is clearer if they are paying their duesIn its original company filing, the effective tax rates presented by Starbucks were 3.5 per cent and 10.7 per cent respectively. The company has since clarified that these figures were wrong.The accounts also showed that the best-paid director at Starbucks’ European business, which moved its base to the UK from the Netherlands in 2014, received total pay and benefits of $2.9m in the most recent financial year.Separately, the group published figures on its tax bill for its main UK entity, Starbucks Coffee Company (UK) Limited. These showed that the group’s profits before tax more than halved last year to £4.5m, which it blamed on “challenging” conditions on the UK high street and lower consumer confidence.Starbucks UK said its costs had increased because it had invested in higher-quality food and drink, although it also cut costs by closing unprofitable stores, opening more franchise stores and reducing headcount. The total number of employees at the UK business fell about 7 per cent to 5,379 in the year to October 2017.The UK entity paid £3.3m of tax on £4.5m of profits — an effective tax rate of 73 per cent. The tax bill increased by £2.1m because the company chose not to use tax breaks on fixed assets.Martin Brok, president of Starbucks’ Emea business said: “It’s still challenging to operate in the UK, as one of the world’s most competitive coffee markets, but we will continue to invest for long-term growth.”Starbucks has five main entities based in the UK, which have all published their 2017 results.Paul Monaghan, chief executive of the Fair Tax Mark, which lobbies against corporate tax avoidance, said: “It may be that Starbucks’ approach to tax is now more responsible but it’s all but impossible to discern given their corporate complexity, staggered filings at Companies House and absence of true country-by-country reporting.”Rebecca Gowland, Oxfam’s head of inequality, said: “All governments should require public country-by-country reporting for all companies, so it is clearer if they are paying their dues. The UK is well placed to act sooner — it should not delay implementing legislation passed in 2016 that would require large multinationals in Britain to do this.”Starbucks said that the company “pays all its taxes and meets all international tax standards and regulations. Starbucks’ UK headquartered businesses paid £13.7m of corporation tax in the year to October 2017, an effective tax rate of 25.3%.”Brewing knowledge / From Clive Anderson, London, UKKindly state Starbucks’ effective tax rate in future / From Martin Brok, President, Starbucks Europe, Middle East and Africa
43;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2018-09-05T04:00:28Z;Cafés are the real thing for Coca-Cola;The acquisition of Costa Coffee brings Coke back to its main street origins;To our considerable misfortune, the pleasures of the city have been largely reduced to consumerism. We don’t much enjoy our cities because they’re not very enjoyable,” wrote Ray Oldenburg in The Great Good Place, his lament for the lack of US watering holes akin to French cafés and 18th-century English coffee houses.Mr Oldenburg’s paean to these “third places” between home and work for citizens to drink and socialise with each other popped up in a strange context last week. Three decades after his influential book was published, the phrase was cited by Coca-Cola in the investor presentation for its £3.9bn purchase of Costa Coffee from Whitbread.When Coke admits to a problem with consumerism, there is something wrong. That might account for the defensive tone of James Quincey, chief executive, about acquiring a chain of stores rather than another variety of flavoured liquid. “This is a coffee strategy, not a retail strategy,” Mr Quincey kept insisting to analysts.He would be better off owning the shift proudly. Coke started out being served as a flavour of syrup in the soda fountains that Mr Oldenburg approvingly mentions as the third places of US main streets in the 19th and early-20th centuries. Soda was mixed by black-tied “soda jerks” behind marble counters — the baristas of their day.From soda fountains Coke came, and to coffee houses it has returned. They are the real thing, more tangible than a secret recipe for sweet syrup, marketed on television and billboards, distributed by bottling companies and sold by supermarkets. Coke flourished without direct contact with customers for decades but has lost its fizz.Coffee is the new craze among food and drink companies. Nestlé paid $7.2bn in May for the rights to sell Starbucks coffee outside the latter’s cafés. The Swiss group has also bought Blue Bottle, the high-end US coffee chain. JAB Holdings, the European group, owns brands such as Keurig and Stumptown, as well as the Peet’s chain.But coffee is not just another stimulating soft drink. It is mostly served hot and fresh, which means finding a barista to brew it or doing so yourself, perhaps in a Nespresso or Keurig machine. Some coffee is dispensed by vending machines or bottled for sale in shops but a human is usually involved.Coffee is also grounded in community, like draught beer in pubs and Coke from soda fountains before bottles started to dominate in the 1920s. Joseph Addison, the 18th-century English writer, praised coffee houses and clubs for encouraging people to meet “for their own improvement, or for the good of others, or at least to relax themselves from the business of the day.”That is an unfamiliar experience for the modern Coca-Cola, which has kept a wide berth from its consumers, communicating with them mainly by being one of the world’s biggest advertisers. It is a revolution for Coke employees, as Costa’s baristas are becoming, to take orders directly from customers and to mix their favourite drinks according to their individual whims.Coke has become remote even from retailers by disposing of its bottling operations to independents. It has changed its mind several times over the decades about how tightly to control distribution of Coke, but Mr Quincey made a point of retreating to an “asset light” core. He has sold its US bottlers and reduced its staff from 123,000 three years ago to 39,000 this year.It is thus a reverse for Coke to plunge into owning cafés, acquiring 3,800 Costa stores and 20,000 more employees. Mr Quincey made it sound as if having physical assets is the necessary price it had to pay for holding the Costa brand and spreading the coffee drinking habit to Asian countries. He showed more enthusiasm for Costa’s 8,000 vending machines and the prospect of growing sales of branded coffee.He need not be defensive. Coke’s lack of retailing experience means there is a risk of the acquisition going wrong. But in one respect, it is returning to its roots — the company did not own soda fountains but Coke was founded on the experiences of people drinking it socially. Nor will sticking to the 20th-century formula work: like other consumer giants, it has been losing sales.Other companies that once shied from owning physical outlets and mingling with customers have changed course. Apple’s retail stores have turned into one of its most influential channels for brand building and humanising its image. Amazon has not only opened book shops but also bought the Whole Foods supermarket chain and experimented with Amazon Go grocery shops.Many consumers like to experience brands themselves, not just to be told that they are human in ads. Coke can acquire as many healthy, organic, artisanal and authentic new drinks as it wants and sell them in its traditional manner, but the coffee business is indivisible from human contact. That is how brands such as Starbucks rose, and how they learn what customers want next.Coca-Cola outgrew soda fountains in the 20th century and found a convenient and winning formula for selling fizzy drinks to the world. But everything has its era. Mr Quincey should not be bashful about his “third place”.john.gapper@ft.com
44;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2018-08-31T17:37:17Z;Costa needs reheating in China;Starbucks’ mainland expansion plans just one challenge for Coca-Cola’s latest buy;"China has been cited as a leading factor behind Coca-Cola’s £3.9bn purchase of Costa Coffee from Whitbread. The lure of the Chinese coffee market is irresistible; per capita consumption is estimated at just five cups a year compared with 140 in South Korea and 400 in the US. But even with Coca-Cola’s considerable commercial heft, Costa faces a formidable challenge on the mainland. Our quarterly brand survey of 2,000 urban residents highlights the growing gulf between market leader Starbucks and the British chain. This is clearest on a city-tier basis; Costa has managed to build a presence in the country’s richest urban centres, earning a reputation for serving a decent cup among China’s nascent breed of coffee aficionados. Outside of the big cities, however, the company barely registers. In contrast, even in third-tier cities and below, Starbucks garnered 33 per cent of the responses to our survey asking respondents to name their favourite coffee shop or bakery. This reflects the Seattle-based company’s aggressive push in China. The company in May said it plans to increase its store count in China to 6,000, across 230 cities, by the end of 2022. The company already operates more than 3,000 stores, dwarfing the 449 Costa outlets. Whitbread’s most recent goal for Costa in China was to have at least 1,200 stores open by 2022. Starbucks has been phenomenally successful at selling its brand in China, managing to convince the country’s tea-obsessed urbanites to spend well over Rmb30 ($4.40) on a cup of coffee (its success is also marked by the sheer number of domestic knock-offs that make liberal use of its distinctive green, black and white logo).But even Starbucks is under pressure in China. A month after announcing its latest expansion plans, the company shocked the market with news that its sales growth in China has dried up. The company blamed market entrants that provide heavily-discounted deliveries. This was a reference to Luckin Coffee, an eight-month-old homegrown brand whose 525 outlets already dwarf Costa’s presence. Starbucks has since entered into an coffee delivery agreement with e-commerce giant Alibaba. Coca-Cola’s presence in the People’s Republic is almost as old as the Communist party’s opening up and reform policy. The company has extensive distribution networks and longstanding partnerships with state companies, not least with food giant Cofco. Coca-Cola may hope that these resources will give Costa the heft it needs in the Chinese market. With even the dominant player struggling to hold its own against heavily-funded, app-driven upstarts, it will need all the help it can get."
45;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks ups China caffeine fight with Alibaba delivery tie-up;News comes as US chain looks to counter sales slowdown;Starbucks will start coffee deliveries in China next month in a partnership with internet giant Alibaba, as the US company looks to protect its lead in a fast-growing coffee market where it is facing tougher competition and a recent decline in sales.Alibaba’s food delivery platform Ele.me will begin making deliveries from 150 Starbucks outlets in September, expanding to 2,000 stores by the end of the year. Alibaba will also install Starbucks delivery outlets in its chain of Hema grocery stores. Starbucks controls 80 per cent of China’s coffee shop market, according to consultancy Euromonitor, and generated $3.24bn of its revenues from Asia-Pacific last year — or about 15 per cent of its global total.In May it unveiled a bold plan to triple Chinese revenue and nearly double the number outlets in the country to 6,000 over the next five years. But the chain left the market stunned just weeks later when it warned same-store sales growth in China would be flat or negative in the third quarter following years of growth.Chief executive Kevin Johnson blamed the weakness on third-party food delivery services, whose bulk orders had been clogging up its cafés and frustrating patrons who don’t want to wait long for their coffee.Starbucks shares tumbled after the trading update and briefly hit a 22-month low at the end of June as all three major rating agencies downgraded the company and the chief financial officer said he was stepping down.Starbucks’ tie-up with Ele.me comes as it looks to catch up with local upstart Luckin Coffee on the delivery front. The chain, which specialises in deliveries to office workers, has been making waves by undercutting its Seattle rival on price and convenience. It has opened 500 outlets this year and raised $200m in a funding round last month that valued it at $1bn.“As people look at the market opportunity in China as relates to coffee, we expect there to continue to be more competition,” said Mr Johnson. He said the delivery service could start having a significant impact on revenues within a year. Starbucks and Alibaba did not disclose financial details of their partnership. Its delivery platform Ele.me has been spending heavily to subsidise deliveries this year to win market share. But Mr Johnson said: “I don’t look at this as, let’s find someone to subsidise deliveries.”Starbucks is seen as an upmarket brand in China and the deal with Alibaba is a blow to the internet giant’s main rival, Tencent, and the delivery platform it backs, Meituan. Mr Johnson said that Starbucks would continue to partner with Tencent on mobile payments.As a prominent US owned business in China, Starbucks could face pressure from escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. “We are not immune to geopolitics but we can’t control geopolitics,” Mr Johnson added.The US company has more than 3,300 outlets in China and opens new stores at a pace of 600 a year. The chain enters about 20 new Chinese cities annually, often with relatively small populations, according to its China chief Belinda Wong. Of the delivery service, Ms Wong said there could be teething problems, adding: “I’m sure we are not going to get it right the first day but we are definitely going to hear from our customers and really get it right as we go along.”
46;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks earnings creep past market forecasts;;Starbucks generated record revenue in the fiscal third quarter as it reported earnings that came in ahead of market forecasts.The Seattle-based company generated comparable sales growth of 1 per cent, which it guided towards in June, although this about one-third of the rate analysts had forecast, leading to a sharp share price drop at the time.Starbucks’ revenues rose 11 per cent from a year ago to $6.3bn, a record, in the three months ended July 1. Analysts had estimated sales of $6.25bn, according to a Thomson Reuters survey.Earnings rose 23.3 per cent to $852.5m, or 61 cents a share, in the quarter, which was just a penny ahead of market expectations. Adjusted earnings were 62 cents, also one cent higher than analysts expected.Starbucks has been in need of the corporate equivalent of a triple-shot after a rough few months. It disappointed investors in June when it said it expected to open fewer stores in the US in the next fiscal year, would close about 150 stores nationwide, forecast sales growth that fell short of analysts’ targets and flagged concerns about its expansion plans in China.The chain was beset by key departures, with Howard Schultz, executive chairman, and Scott Maw, chief financial officer, announcing they would be stepping down. Starbucks also came under fire in April after a store employee called the police when two black men sat in a shop without buying anything. The following month it closed 8,000 US stores for an afternoon for racial sensitivity training for its staff. Shares were up 0.1 per cent in after-hours trade, but are down 10.4 per cent so far in 2018.
47;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Starbucks/Luckin Coffee: trouble brewing;Chinese rival has tapped into consumers’ love of convenience and delivery;Starbucks has a Venti-sized problem in China.Just one month after the Seattle-based company unveiled a bold plan to triple Chinese revenue and nearly double the number of outlets in the country to 6,000, it was forced to warn that same-store sales growth there would be flat or negative in the third quarter. Now local upstart coffee shop Luckin Coffee has raised $200m in an attempt to compete with it.Starbucks’ chief executive Kevin Johnson blames weakness in Chinese sales on third-party delivery services clogging up cafés and frustrating patrons.His competitor, however, has come up with a superior solution to this problem. Luckin Coffee has undercut its US rival on price and convenience. Tapping into Chinese consumers’ love of convenience and delivery, it has dedicated nearly half of its 525 stores to just preparing coffee for delivery.Starbucks would be wise to do the same. China’s keen taste for coffee is needed to offset tepid sales growth in the US. Plans to shutter 150 US stores next year amid poor revenue growth led to a sharp share price fall at the end of June. Although given that these closures will be in over-caffeinated urban neighbourhoods where the chain is already ubiquitous, the impact will be negligible.Losing Scott Maw, chief financial officer, is more worrying. The 13 per cent drop in Starbucks’s shares since June 19 has left them trading near a three-year low. Shares trade at 20 times forward earnings. Starbucks is almost a quarter cheaper than Dunkin’ Brands.Dunkin’ Brands also has plans for supersized growth in China, as does McDonald’s and the UK’s Costa. The Starbucks stumble in China should teach a cautionary lesson. First-mover advantage does not always last.Starbucks virtually created the mainland coffee shop market over the past two decades and remains the biggest coffee chain with 3,300 outlets.

48;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;First Chinese coffee shop unicorn raises $200m to take on Starbucks;Upstart Luckin Coffee’s funding round adds to war chest as it trains sights on dominant brand;Luckin Coffee has become China’s first coffee shop unicorn, raising $200m in a funding round that values the chain at $1bn as it builds a war chest to try to challenge Starbucks’ dominant position.Founded last year, Luckin claims to have opened more than 500 stores in China in just five months. It serves lattes at prices about 30 per cent lower than Starbucks and provides subsidised deliveries to office workers.The fundraising round highlighted China’s booming venture capital investment scene, which in recent years has created more than 60 unicorns— unlisted companies with valuations of at least $1bn.It also spotlighted the growth of specialist coffee chains in China, which generated sales of Rmb22bn ($3.4bn) last year. That figure is projected to grow to Rmb28bn by 2020, according to consultancy Euromonitor. Investors in the series-A financing round included Chinese funds Centurium Capital and Joy Capital, alongside Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC. The proceeds will be used for “R&D, technology innovation and business development”, said Luckin’s chief executive, Qian Zhiya. Luckin lags behind Starbucks’ 3,300 outlets in China. But the upstart brand has already overtaken Britain’s Costa Coffee, which has just 420 stores in China after a decade in the country. Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a recent report that Luckin is “aggressively investing in customer acquisition and scale with subsidies and advertising, and positions itself as a disrupter — bringing lower prices and greater convenience to the coffee experience. It also has a laser-focus on young office workers.”Starbucks, perceived as an upmarket brand in China, has 80 per cent of the country’s coffee chain market, up from 60 per cent in 2012, and is opening new outlets at a rate of 500 a year. Its strong branding means property developers favour it for their best locations, giving it a formidable advantage in winning customers. But Luckin has the potential to be a serious challenger, according to Jeffrey Towson, a business professor at Peking University. “By offering a similar experience at a lower price point, Luckin could bring a luxury product downmarket. That approach really worked for Xiaomi vs Apple for the iPhone,” he wrote in a recent note.Luckin said in May that it was suing Starbucks for allegedly breaching China’s anti-monopoly law by signing exclusivity agreements with shopping malls that bar other chains from opening in the same development. Lawyers said the lawsuit was unlikely to succeed because such contracts fall outside anti-monopoly provisions.China has become increasingly important for Starbucks’ revenue growth as sales in its home market have slowed.Starbucks said: “We welcome open and healthy competition to propel the industry to grow and innovate together, in order to elevate the quality and service to create real value for the Chinese consumer.” 
49;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Starbucks jolted higher after plastic straw phase-out plan;;It pays to be green.Starbucks shares received a much needed jolt on Monday after the company revealed plans to phase out plastic straws from its 28,000 stores worldwide by 2020 in a move that will eliminate more than 1bn of the drinking devices each year.The stock rose 1.9 per cent in morning trade versus a 0.7 per cent rise for the broader S&P 500.The move will see the Seattle-based coffee purveyor join a growing list of companies and countries that have announced plans to eliminate single-use plastic straws and cutlery in an effort to reduce waste and protect the environment.A strawless plastic lid, which has already been in use for a number of Starbucks drinks including Draft Nitro and Cold Foam beverages in the US and Canada, will now become the standard for all iced drinks, except for the Frappuccino. That latter will be served with a straw made from paper or a compostable plastic.“By nature, the straw isn’t recyclable and the lid is, so we feel this decision is more sustainable and more socially responsible,” Chris Milne, director of packaging sourcing for Starbucks, said in a statement.In June, McDonald’s said it would begin phasing out plastic straws in some European markets, and would roll out paper straws in the UK and Ireland.That followed the announcement of plans by the UK and EU to ban the use of single-use cutlery, plates and straws that, alongside discarded plastic fishing gear, researchers estimate account for 70 per cent of all marine litter.Seattle, where Starbucks is headquartered, implemented a plan to ban plastic straws on July 1.Despite Monday’s bounce, Starbucks shares are still down more than 13 per cent since mid-June, after growth forecasts for China and the US underwhelmed and amid news that its chief financial officer will retire later this year.Photo: Starbucks
50;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;China mall construction peaks amid heavy oversupply;Glut of shopping centres enables retail brands to negotiate lower rents;Chinese retail real-estate construction — for years the world’s largest — has peaked and is expected to decline over the next few years as developers struggle with overcapacity and the rise of ecommerce.Retail supply in 17 large Chinese cities tracked by CBRE, the property consultancy, saw nearly 10m sq m of new shopping space finished last year — about the size of 14,000 football pitches. That will fall by 16 per cent to 7.9m sq m this year.Mall developers such as Wanda and Vanke, who have faced vacancy rates above 20 per cent in some cities, may welcome the news as they are able to push up rents.Rental costs at malls have been stagnant for years but will increase modestly this year as tenancy rises, CBRE forecasts. For instance, cities such as Shenyang in the country’s north-east, and Suzhou, near Shanghai, are expected to see their first rental increases in three years.Chinese retail sales growth is among the world’s fastest, at about 10 per cent year on year, but an increasing proportion of that spending is going to ecommerce. Online shopping accounted for 20 per cent of total retail spending last year, up from 4 per cent in 2010. “Ecommerce has been in head-to-head competition against offline retailers, particularly for products like home appliances, apparel and footwear, which are already seeing ultra-high online penetration,” analysts at DBS Vickers wrote in a recent report. China has a lot of shopping centres coming online at the same time and competing for brandsAs a result, mall operators are changing the mix of their tenants away from retail and more towards “experiential” outlets offering services, restaurants and entertainment.But capacity will grow rapidly even as new construction slows. The number of malls with gross floor area of more than 10,000 sq m in China’s 30 largest cities is expected to increase from about 1,000 to more than 1,400 by 2019, according to property group JLL. Oversupply is shifting the balance of power between operators and their tenants, with retail brands able to negotiate lower rents and other benefits. “China has a lot of shopping centres coming online at the same time and competing for brands, so brands are in a strong position,” said James Hawkey, head of retail in China for JLL.In some cases, brands can sign agreements with developers “barring similar or specific brands from opening in the same development or same floor”, said Sandy Zhong, director of retail services in China for real-estate services company Colliers.Such agreements were highlighted in May when Chinese chain Luckin Coffee said it was suing US brand Starbucks for allegedly breaching China’s anti-monopoly law by making such agreements with malls. Starbucks — which has an 80 per cent share of the Chinese coffee shop market, according to consultancy Euromonitor — declined to comment on the case.Lawyers said the lawsuit was unlikely to succeed because such contracts fell outside anti-monopoly provisions. “Exclusivity agreements are very common in the market,” said An Yiqing, director of Shanghai law firm A & Z. “But there are no regulations covering them.”Additional reporting by Wang Xueqiao
51;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks grinds lower as CFO announces retirement;;Starbucks can’t get a break. Just a week after its shares plunged on growth concerns, the coffee chain’s shares hit a near three-year low on Thursday after it announced its chief financial officer plans to retire later this year.The news that Scott Maw — who has been chief financial officer since 2014 — will retire effective November 30 sent Starbucks shares down 4.4 per cent to $47.62. Earlier in the session they fell to $47.37, the lowest since August 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data.It’s been a tough June for the Seattle-based company. Last week, it said it is planning to close about 150 US stores next year amid sluggish sales growth and also flagged concerns about its ambitious expansion efforts in China, which it has become increasingly reliant on for growth amid slowing momentum in its home market.All three major rating agencies downgraded Starbucks after the trading update last week, citing the possibility it would have to take on more debt to keep its pledge to boost shareholder returns.The changeover in the top ranks could present yet another challenge to Starbucks as it tries to regain the momentum that has made it one of the most recognisable brands in corporate America.Its longtime chief executive Howard Schultz last year handed over the top job to Kevin Johnson after nearly four decades of leading the company, and took another step back earlier this month by leaving his post as executive chairman — possibly to eye a political career.After a middling 3.44 per cent gain in 2017, Starbucks shares have in the past two weeks erased all their gains for 2018 and are currently down 16.7 per cent on the year to date.
52;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks gets slammed on store closures, sales forecast;;Starbucks is in dire need of a pick-me-up. The coffee chain’s shares hit a one-and-a-half year low on Wednesday, a day after it said it plans to close about 150 US stores next year amid sluggish sales growth.Starbucks shares fell as much as 10.2 per cent to $51.58, their lowest since November 2016. If the decline holds, it will be the company’s biggest one-day percentage drop since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters data.It has been a rocky 24 hours for Starbucks, which issued a statement after the closing bell on Tuesday saying that it plans to close 150 stores in fiscal 2019, more than its annual average, as it addresses lukewarm comparable-sales growth in the US.Its plan to focus on shareholders by boosting returns to $25bn for 2020 drew a one-notch downgrade from S&P, with the rating agency citing the potential for the coffee chain to take on more debt even as it struggles to boost sales.Fitch also lowered its rating on Starbucks a notch over what it termed the company’s “aggressive change in financial policy”, according to a note on Wednesday afternoon.Moody’s followed suit and lowered its rating one notch to Baa1 from A3 and said the change to the shareholder return policy “will result in significantly higher debt levels and weaker credit metrics at a time of operating challenges”.Today’s losses have dragged Starbucks shares into the red for 2018 to date, after it gained just 3.44 per cent last year amid growing worries about its ability to keep up its previous breakneck expansion.
53;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;S&P downgrades Starbucks on latest shareholder returns boost;;S&P has lowered its rating on Starbucks, saying that the coffee retailer’s plans to boost shareholder returns to $25bn by 2020 even as it confronts slowing sales growth could prompt it to issue more debt.The rating agency knocked Starbucks’ rating one notch from A- to BBB+ with a stable outlook.The downgrade comes after the company announced on Tuesday evening that it was planning to close more stores than usual in fiscal year 2019 as it addresses lukewarm comparable-store sales growth in the US, its home market. As part of its strategic refocusing, it said it plans to boost the amount of shareholder returns by $5bn to $25bn through fiscal year 2020, including a 20 per cent boost to its regular quarterly dividend.That follows close on the heels of Starbucks’ last increase to its capital return plans last month when it unveiled its commercial partnership with Nestlé.S&P analysts wrote:We think this second increase in its capital return plans represents a rapid shift in financial policy while the company is experiencing a slowdown in comparable sales growth to low-single-digit percentages. We expect the company will issue $3bn in additional debt in the next year, which would push leverage over 2-times on a sustained basis.”Starbucks shares are down more than 6 per cent at the start of trading in New York.
54;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2018-06-19T20:59:51Z;Starbucks shares lose steam on tepid guidance, store growth;;Investors cooled on Starbucks after the coffee chain said that it expects to add fewer stores in the US in the next fiscal year and anticipates sales growth to come in under analysts’ targets for the current quarter.The Washington-based company saw its shares drop more than 3 per cent after-hours following the update on Tuesday evening. They later trimmed the decline to trade down 1.7 per cent.Kevin Johnson, Starbucks president and chief executive, said in a statement:“While certain demand headwinds are transitory, and some of our cost increases are appropriate investments for the future, our recent performance does not reflect the potential of our exceptional brand and is not acceptable. We must move faster to address the more rapidly changing preferences and needs of our customers. Over the past year we have taken several actions to streamline the company, positioning us to increase our innovation agility as an organisation and enhance focus on our core value drivers which serve as the foundation to re-accelerate growth and create long-term shareholder value.”Starbucks said that it expects “lower net new store growth” in the US market for fiscal year 2019, as it tries to “concentrate growth in under penetrated markets”. That translates to the projected closure of about 150 stores in the next fiscal year, a step up from its historical average of up to 50 a year.It also projected comparable store sales growth of 1 per cent for the current quarter ending this month, coming in well below the 2.9 per cent gain in this key metric that analysts surveyed by Factset had expected.The company — which recently shut all its US stores for an afternoon to conduct racial bias training after an incident at one of its Philadelphia stores — said that it would take “decisive steps” to address the underwhelming comparable sales growth. That includes focusing on its two biggest markets, the US and China, expanding and leveraging its partnership with Nestlé and sharpening its focus on shareholder returns.To the last point, it said it was increasing its target for returning cash to shareholders to $25bn through fiscal year 2020, including a 20 per cent boost its regular quarterly dividend.After years of robust expansion, Starbucks has recently confronted investors worries that its momentum may be waning — one reason why it is looking for new growth avenues, particularly in China. Year to date, Starbucks shares are flat after eking out a gain of 3.44 per cent last year.
55;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
56;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Trump, Oprah and the era of pick ‘n’ mix politics;‘Voters seem to like celebrity politicians who transcend prepackaged party lines’;"A few weeks ago I was passing through Dulles airport, outside Washington DC, when I spotted a rack of T-shirts on sale. Each of them carried a gigantic “O” — emblazoned in red, white and blue — and the words: “Speak Your Truth: Oprah 2020.”Welcome to the next round of the American political fight. Until now, Oprah Winfrey has been best known as host of a cable television show and lifestyle guru. But these days she is being whispered about in terms of another role: a possible candidate to challenge Donald Trump in the 2020 election, either on the Democratic ticket or as an independent.To be fair, this is not something Winfrey herself has ever said she intends to do. On the contrary, she has repeatedly played down the idea. But these days the Democrats are under pressure to find somebody — anybody — to unseat Trump.While the names of established politicians — such as Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Tim Kaine or even former vice-president Joe Biden— are being tossed around, it is the non-traditional candidates who are grabbing the most attention. Last week, for example, Howard Schultz, founder of Starbucks, indicated he was considering a bid. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been mentioned as a possible contender, as has the actor George Clooney. And after Winfrey gave a speech this year at the Golden Globes that sounded almost presidential, her name also popped into the frame — and on to those T-shirts.Is this a good thing? Most traditional political observers would say not. Many see the rise of personality politics as a lamentable sign that western democracy is being dumbed down. After all, Trump is the ultimate celebrity politician, who has shown himself to be extraordinarily uninterested in the finer details of policy making. Maybe Schultz or Winfrey would be entirely different but right now it is unclear what policy views they hold.There is another way to frame this development: politics is simply echoing some of the big 20th- and 21st-century shifts in consumer culture. Last year, Naomi Klein, the leftwing commentator, suggested in her book, No Is Not Enough, that Trump’s victory was best understood as an extension of the rise of branding in the 20th-century consumer world. Trump shot to fame by becoming the ultimate brand, winning voter support through name recognition. So it is perhaps no surprise that Democrats are mulling other candidates with brand appeal. Winfrey is one of the few individuals with a personal brand almost as strong as Trump’s. While Schultz is not as well known, Starbucks certainly is (although, as some Democrats lament, it is a distinctly elite brand.)In addition to this, there is a second, less-discussed, consumer trend that may also be playing into the mix: customisation. It is sometimes said that the second half of the 20th century produced the “me” generation, or a time when people started to assume that the world revolved around them, rather than the other way around. Now, however, advances in digital technology have given the “me” generation a new twist: today, we not only presume that we are at the centre of our world, we also want to customise it to our individual tastes.Think about it. Fifty years ago, when people bought music, it came in prepackaged record albums. Today we have personal music playlists. Once, we bought newspapers with preselected news and consumed programmed TV and radio. Now we create personalised news hubs, stream our own choice of TV whenever we want to and download the podcasts that appeal to us. We customise our meals and drinks; just think of all the options Schultz has offered at Starbucks. The same goes for our clothes, identities and online friendship circles.At first glance, this customisation trend — or pick ‘n’ mix culture — may not have much in common with politics. But the key point is that during most of our living memory, politics in the west has been presented to consumers (ie voters) just like a music album, namely in preselected packages known as political parties. In some senses, this pattern still rules around the world: the Democrats and Republicans and the UK’s Conservative and Labour parties, for example, still predominate. But many “consumers” are rebelling and taking their taste for customisation from the consumer world into politics.What tends to incite passions these days, particularly among younger voters, are single issues such as immigration, the environment, equal rights, nationalism or Brexit. What voters really seem to like are celebrity politicians who transcend prepackaged party lines. It is no accident, perhaps, that Emmanuel Macron swept to power in France by creating his own party (En Marche) nor that Trump — and Winfrey and Schultz — cannot be easily pigeonholed. In many cases, personal brands transcend party platforms right now — not least because voters can project whatever they fancy on to them.So after I saw that Oprah 2020 T-shirt, I bought it — for $14.99. No, I do not plan to wear it, let alone champion her; nor do I really expect her to run. But, if nothing else, that T-shirt is a good souvenir of a world in flux — expressed via an eye-catching brand.If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Gillian’s articles are published, just click the button “add to myFT”, which appears at the top of this page beside the author’s name.

57;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2018-06-13T02:22:47Z;Seattle bows to Amazon pressure over ‘head tax’ to help homeless;City repeals charge on big companies that had been aimed at tackling housing crisis;Seattle has backed down in its battle with Amazon as the city council repealed a tax on large employers following pressure from the technology group and other large businesses.The city’s U-turn came less than a month after it unanimously passed a so-called head tax of $275 per employee on local companies with more than $20m in revenues to help tackle its homeless population, the country’s third-largest.Seattle’s economic boom, fuelled in part by Amazon’s success, has made it one of the fastest-growing cities in the US, but has also sent housing costs, and rates of homelessness, soaring.The tax, which caught Amazon off-guard, has crystallised a debate over who should bear responsibility for the impact of technology companies’ rapid growth.“It is clear that the ordinance will lead to a prolonged, expensive political fight . . . that will do nothing to tackle our urgent housing and homelessness crisis,” said Jenny Durkan, Seattle’s mayor, in a statement announcing plans to repeal the law. “We heard you.”The tax drew fierce opposition from Amazon, Starbucks and other big Seattle businesses. Amazon suspended a big construction project in the city, where it employs more than 40,000 people. Even after the city cut the tax from an initial proposal of $500 a head, the compromise left all sides unhappy.The U-turn was ratified at a fractious council meeting on Tuesday, where campaigners repeatedly shouted down council members with chants of “tax Amazon” and “no backroom deals”.Funded by more than $200,000 raised from Amazon, Starbucks and other companies, a coalition has been collecting signatures to put a repeal of the head tax to voters in November’s election.Following its introduction, Amazon said it was “disappointed” at the tax and “remain[ed] very apprehensive about the future created by the council’s hostile approach and rhetoric toward larger businesses, which forces us to question our growth here”.Advocates for the homeless said the $45m the tax was expected to bring in would not do enough to address the problems in a city that faces severe limits in how it can raise revenue, because of a state ban on income tax.Despite the dispute in Seattle, other cities that are home to big tech companies are considering similar measures.In northern California, Mountain View, where Alphabet has headquarters, and Cupertino, home to Apple, are among those considering taxes on big employers. A head tax has also been proposed in San Francisco, home to Twitter, Uber and Salesforce, among others.Amazon’s battle with Seattle is the latest instance of the company flexing its muscles in the face of taxation. It long resisted collecting state sales taxes in the US, although it does now.Last month, Amazon said it would block shoppers in Australia from its overseas websites in response to a law forcing online retailers to collect sales tax on all products shipped into the country from abroad.It also comes as the company is being wooed with tax breaks and utility discounts by other cities and states vying to be chosen as the site of its second US headquarters. Michigan, which offered $4bn in incentives to bring HQ2 to Detroit, did not even make the shortlist of 20 finalists.
58;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2018-06-06T04:15:25Z;Howard Schultz gives up coffee to test presidential waters;Former Starbucks executive discusses political principles as he considers White House run;"There is dipping your toe in the water. And then there is plunging into the deep end, head first, a metaphor that describes the recent strategy of Howard Schultz.On Monday, Mr Schultz, 64, announced he would be leaving his role as executive chairman of Starbucks, the company he spent 35 years transforming into a global brand. A day later, he indicated in interviews that he was considering challenging Donald Trump for US president in 2020.Mr Schultz has long been rumoured to be considering a presidential run. In 2015, the executive appeared on the cover of Time magazine amid rumours he could seek the presidency as soon as 2016. While many Democratic strategists say they still view Mr Schultz’s nomination as a long shot, some in the party, including Democratic donors, said they would be ready to take a closer look at Mr Schultz’s candidacy. “On the good side, I think voters — number one — are going to look for the opposite of the predecessor,” said Kris Balderston, a former aide to Bill and Hillary Clinton and the founder of Balderston Strategic Partnerships.They could opt for a vetted public servant with a record, he said, or swing the other way and embrace a progressive outsider, the ideological inverse to the current president. Mr Schultz might not be the best choice to step into that second role, Mr Balderston said. For one, the former Starbucks head appeared a little too keen. “I think voters love reluctant candidates. Like Oprah,” Mr Balderston said. “It’s like dating. The more you say no, the more you’re attractive.” In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Mr Schultz laid out the initial planks of his platform, focusing on immigration (“I don’t think we’ve got a very human policy”); the president’s tariff policies (“We’re in a trade war that I do not understand”); and the fallacies of Republican tax cuts, which he claimed were lining the pockets of Fortune 500 companies (“Corporate America did not need a tax cut to 21 per cent”).People who know Mr Schultz say his left-leaning political views have deep roots in his childhood in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn, New York, where he grew up in housing projects and his father worked as a truck driver, factory worker and cab driver without health insurance.Mr Schultz received a scholarship to Northern Michigan University. After working in sales for Xerox, he went on to run a 20-person Seattle coffee company that he eventually transformed into Starbucks, which now has more than 28,000 stores in close to 80 countries. During 2016, he closely watched Michael Bloomberg’s own flirtation with the White House — seeing parallels with a fellow Jewish billionaire. His candidacy has been encouraged by the likes of the DreamWorks co-founder David Geffen, and Richard Edelman, head of the public relations company Edelman. His supporters say Mr Schultz will try to leverage his experience, not just in running a multibillion-dollar company, but in using his corporate pulpit to focus public attention on issues such as education, race and veterans.Mr Schultz, who co-wrote a book about veterans, made it a priority for Starbucks to hire former members of the military and refugees. Last week, he closed the company’s US stores for employee seminars on racial bias after police were called on two African-American men who were waiting for a friend at a Philadelphia Starbucks.While a non-traditional candidate such as Mr Schultz may have struggled to win the support of Democratic party members and donors in another election cycle, party strategists said Mrs Clinton’s 2016 loss had created a more level playing field. Party veterans no longer hold the power they had in previous primaries. I guess after Trump anything is possible, but I see this as nothing more than a pipe dream by a billionaire with some money to spendAsked who would back Mr Schultz in the Democratic establishment, Satish Narayanan, a consultant and alumnus of the Clinton and Obama administrations, replied: “Who’s the party? [Before] there was this group — there were these previous administrations and players from decades of Democratic politics and the DNC [Democratic National Committee] etc, but that doesn’t really exist any more today.” Mr Narayanan said Mr Schultz, as a candidate from outside the traditional Democratic political establishment, could have success bridging the gap between the “rabidly anti-Trump wing” of the party and “the moderately anti-Trump wing”.But he warned that some of Mr Schultz’s credentials as a progressive employer could be lost on voters who see the lifestyle projected by Mr Schultz’s company as out of touch with their own reality. “I think it’s definitely seen as an elitist liberal brand,” said Mr Narayanan. “I don’t think people in Kansas are sitting there talking about how Starbucks is to their employees. I think their image is $5 lattes.” Jim Manley, a former aide to Democratic senators Harry Reid and Ted Kennedy, agreed. “I guess after Trump anything is possible, but I see this as nothing more than a pipe dream by a billionaire with some money to spend.” "
59;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2018-06-04T20:35:54Z;Howard Schultz steps down as Starbucks executive chairman;Billionaire says he is considering ‘public service’, sparking talk of White House run;Howard Schultz is stepping down as executive chairman of Starbucks, marking the end of a 36-year run in which he transformed the Seattle company into the world’s largest coffee chain and fuelling speculation that he might run for US president in 2020.In a memo to employees, the billionaire appeared to open the door to a run for public office, after rumours of his presidential ambitions have swirled for some time. “I’ll be thinking about a range of options for myself, from philanthropy to public service, but I’m a long way from knowing what the future holds,” he wrote. The change comes a little over a year after Mr Schultz handed the role of chief executive to Kevin Johnson. During his near-four decades leading the company, Mr Schultz grew Starbucks from 11 stores to more than 28,000 stores in 77 countries. “I set out to build a company that my father, a blue-collar worker and World War II veteran, never had a chance to work for,” Mr Schultz said in the memo. “Together we’ve done that, and so much more, by balancing profitability and social conscience, compassion and rigour, and love and responsibility.”The 2020 presidential race is an open field for the Democrats, with as many as a dozen different candidates rumoured as potential contenders. In light of the success of Donald Trump, a reality-TV star, business celebrities including Oprah Winfrey, Mark Cuban and Mr Schultz have all been mooted as plausible candidates.Mr Schultz, who endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016, has previously demurred about his potential plans in politics, although he told CNN in 2016 that he would “never say never” regarding a presidential run.On Monday, he told the New York Times: “For some time now, I have been deeply concerned about our country — the growing division at home and our standing in the world. One of the things I want to do in my next chapter is to figure out if there is a role I can play in giving back. I’m not exactly sure what that means yet.”Mr Schultz, 64, the son of a truck driver, grew up in public housing in Brooklyn. At Starbucks, he has been outspoken on issues ranging from healthcare and education to racism and rising nationalism, and earlier this decade he tried to cajole fellow businessmen into promising to withhold political donations in protest at gridlock in Congress.He has also repeatedly criticised Mr Trump, including as recently as last week when he told CNN that the president’s rhetoric on race has “given licence to people to feel as if they can emulate and copy the kind of behaviour and language that comes out of this administration”. Mr Schultz stepped down as chief executive of Starbucks in 2000, only to return in 2008 to steer the company through the financial crisis.He will stay on at Starbucks until the end of this month, the company said in a statement, after which he will be given the title of chairman emeritus. He will be replaced as chairman by Myron Ullman, a current board member.Starbucks shares were down about 1 per cent in after-hours trading. Starbucks in April came under fire from activists after a store employee called the police when two black men sat in a shop without buying anything. Mr Schultz said he was “ashamed” by the incident.
60;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2018-06-01T21:00:26Z;Week in review, June 2;Martin Sorrell’s quick return, Canada’s pipeline deal, RBS leadership and Starbucks;A round up of some of the week’s most significant corporate events and news stories.Martin Sorrell’s post-WPP comeback catches adland by surpriseMartin Sorrell launched his comeback this week, returning to the public markets a month after left WPP, the group he built into the world’s biggest marketing services company, writes Ravi Mattu.Sir Martin on Wednesday announced he had made a reverse takeover of Derriston Capital, a cash shell. The company was renamed S4Capital, with the WPP founder injecting £40m of his own money as well as raising a further £11m from a group of investors that includes Jacob Rothschild, chairman of RIT Capital, for the new venture.Sir Martin owns 75 per cent of S4 and will become its executive chairman. The company also has an incentive share scheme that will entitle him to up to 15 per cent of the growth in value of S4 “provided that the company or its shareholders receive a 6 per cent preferred return”.The aim would appear to be building a marketing and communications services group that echoes his approach in building WPP, which he built through decades of canny dealmaking. His backers said they would “in principle” be willing to invest a further £150m to “support S4 Capital’s acquisition plans”, hinting at a reprise of his strategy.The new company would be a “multinational communication services business focused on growth”, Sir Martin said. “There are significant opportunities for development in technology, data and content. I look forward to making this happen.”No one expected Sir Martin to stay away from the sector. But the speed of his return — just weeks after he quit the company following a board investigation into an unspecified allegation of “personal misconduct”, which he denies — surprised some analysts. “Most people thought he would come back. They just didn’t think it would be within six weeks,” said Thomas Singlehurst at Citi.His departure has caused some disquiet among shareholders, who do not know why he left the company.But WPP has received a boost. Roberto Quarta, chairman, was given a reprieve by Institutional Shareholder Services — which advises investors on how to vote at annual meetings — who backed his re-election. Glass Lewis, the second-largest proxy adviser, last month called on shareholders to vote against Mr Quarta over succession planning concerns.Canada to buy controversial Trans Mountain pipelineDesperate times called for desperate measures in Canada this week, as the federal government agreed a deal with Kinder Morgan of the US to pay C$4.5bn for the Trans Mountain oil pipeline, writes Ed Crooks.The government took the highly unusual move in the hope of saving the proposed C$7.4bn expansion of the pipeline, which it sees as a critical project for increasing Canada’s oil exports.Trans Mountain runs from the oil sands region of Alberta to the coast of British Columbia near Vancouver, making it the only export route for Canadian crude that does not run into the US.Kinder Morgan has been working on a plan to expand the pipeline’s capacity from 300,000 barrels a day to 890,000 b/d, but has run into fierce opposition in British Columbia, much of its focused on the prospect of increased tanker traffic carrying the crude to world markets.Facing a series of political and legal obstacles, Kinder Morgan had set a deadline of May 31 for clarifying whether or not the expansion project could go ahead. With that date looming, the Canadian government decided to step in and buy the whole pipeline system to try to keep the expansion project alive.Steve Kean, Kinder Morgan’s chief executive, said the deal “represents the best opportunity to complete TMEP [Trans Mountain Expansion Project] and thereby realise the great economic benefits promised by that project”.Stock market reaction reflected investors’ views that giving up on the expansion was a blow to the growth prospects of Kinder Morgan Canada, the affiliate that will receive about 30 per cent of the proceeds from selling Trans Mountain. Its shares were on Friday down 4 per cent for the week at C$16.01. Shares in the parent Kinder Morgan were up 3 per cent at $16.83.Stevenson resignation fuels rumours over RBS leadershipThe departure of Royal Bank of Scotland’s finance director fuelled speculation about its future leadership this week, and complicated the UK government’s efforts to start cutting its stake in the bailed-out lender, writes Nicholas Megaw.The bank announced Ewen Stevenson’s resignation on Wednesday, just hours before its annual meeting. It later emerged that Mr Stevenson had been approached  to take over as chief financial officer at FTSE 100 rival HSBC.Mr Stevenson was considered one of the main internal candidates to succeed Ross McEwan, RBS’s chief executive, who is rumoured to be considering stepping down next year. Mr McEwan insisted last month that his “job’s not done yet”, but failed to make any commitments to staying at the bank during its AGM this week.The CFO’s exit leaves Alison Rose, head of commercial and private banking, as the favourite to take charge after Mr McEwan to become the first woman to lead a FTSE 100 bank.The unexpected resignation also presented an additional complication for UKGI, the body that manages the government’s 71 per cent stake in RBS, as it prepares to sell shares in the bank for the first time since 2015.Last month’s settlement of a long-running US Department of Justice probe into mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities cleared the path  for the government to start selling down its stake before the summer, with some industry figures expecting a move as early as this week. However, market ructions caused by the political instability in Italy made an imminent sale unattractive, and Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec, said Mr Steven’s departure would add “an additional element of uncertainty” for the Treasury.Starbucks shuts stores to give its staff anti-racial bias trainingAfter the arrest of two black men at a Starbucks café in Philadelphia, the coffee chain shut more than 8,000 of its stores on Tuesday to give its staff anti-racial bias training, writes Lindsay Fortado.The men, Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson, were refused permission to use the toilet as they waited for a friend at the café in the upmarket Rittenhouse Square neighbourhood, and after they occupied a table while they waited, a manager called the police.The episode of the two men being handcuffed while the friend they were meeting arrived was filmed by another customer and quickly went viral online. The men were not charged with any crime.Starbucks responded quickly to the incident, which took place in April, with a statement from its chief executive Kevin Johnson, a settlement with the two men and the promise to close its stores for training. The company also fired the manager who called the police.However, some African-Americans in Philadelphia told the Financial Times that the action Starbucks had taken had failed to reassure them and seemed to them to be solely based on business considerations.Marc Lamont Hill, a media professor at Temple University and the owner of Uncle Bobbie’s Coffee and Books café, said: “What we saw in Starbucks is a ritual that is as consistent and longstanding as America: the erasure, the criminalisation of brown people in public spaces. There are places we just don’t go into.”The Starbucks training came on the same day that Walt Disney’s ABC television network cancelled Roseanne Barr’s recently rebooted sitcom in response to a racist tweet that she had posted on Monday about former Barack Obama aide Valerie Jarrett.While Ms Barr apologised for what she called her “bad taste” remark, ABC described her comments as “abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel her show”.

It’s a temporary solution.”Less than two months before, employees at the Rittenhouse Square Starbucks had denied Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson permission to use the toilet and then called police.Officers arrived around the same time as the friend they were meeting. The episode was videoed by another customer and was quickly circulated in social media, sparking outrage. The men were not charged with any crime.The coffee chain moved quickly to quell the protests, promising to close its stores for an afternoon of anti-bias training. It said its toilets would be open to anyone that wanted to use them. The manager who called the police was fired.Although he appreciated the Starbucks gesture — “at least they are willing to give it attention” — Mr Lewis doubted an afternoon of Starbucks staff training would make much difference to him.“I’ve never patronised them,” he said of the Starbucks at Rittenhouse Square. “I get vibes: I get personally looked at funny a lot, so I just mind my own business.”There’s a type of benefit and financial reward to the type of crisis management they didStarbucks settled with Mr Robinson and Mr Nelson for an undisclosed sum after mediation before a retired federal judge. The agreement included an offer to Mr Robinson and Mr Nelson to complete their undergraduate degrees and to share their recommendations with Eric Holder, the former US attorney-general under President Barack Obama, who is advising the company on the matter.Kevin Johnson, Starbucks chief executive, flew to Philadelphia to meet police and community leaders in the wake of the arrests, and to apologise in person to the two men. The men also settled with the City of Philadelphia for a symbolic $1 each, and a promise from the government to establish a $200,000 fund for young entrepreneurs.On Tuesday afternoon, the Starbucks on 18th and Spruce Streets was closed, with its window blinds drawn and a notice on the door stating that it would reopen on Wednesday after its team had worked on “ideas about how to make Starbucks even more welcoming.”Ed Perez, who was smoking a cigar with his son in Rittenhouse Square, said he was not always treated well at the Starbucks in south Philadelphia where his daughter had worked as assistant manager.“It can be unnerving at times,” said Mr Perez, an accountant at Mitchell & Ness, a Philadelphia-based sports clothing company. “Is it because I’m a man of colour? You don’t know. It’s the climate of the whole country right now. There’s a separation going on.”His son Dominic said that he thought Starbucks acted well in its response.“For them to lose that amount of money shows how much they don’t want to lose their customers,” said the younger Mr Perez. “The fact they’re doing it nationwide means they know there’s a problem. And this is showing us the kind of power we have.”Marc Lamont Hill, a media professor at the city’s Temple University and the owner of Uncle Bobbie’s Coffee & Books in Philadelphia, one of the few black-owned coffee shops in the city, said companies such as Starbucks “don’t have feelings, they have interests”.“There’s a type of benefit and financial reward to the type of crisis management they did,” he said.Mr Hill said that Philadelphia — a city of nearly 1.6m people, 44 per cent of them African-American — is another matter. Its racial history is complicated.One of the first riots in the civil rights era took place in the city in 1964 as tensions reached a head over police brutality. More recently, the jailing of the rapper Meek Mill in Philadelphia for violating his probation has sparked calls for criminal justice reform.The area around the Starbucks where the two African-American men were arrested can be particularly unfriendly to blacks, Mr Hill said.“In Rittenhouse, there are restaurants I don’t feel comfortable in, there are stores I don’t feel comfortable in,” he said.“What we saw in Starbucks is a ritual that is as consistent and longstanding as America: the erasure, the criminalisation of brown people in public spaces. There are places we just don’t go into.”
62;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2018-05-29T21:00:27Z;Increasingly wealthy Chinese go upmarket in consumer spending;Local businesses steal march on multinationals that fail to notice market shift;Chinese consumption has become so large that the country is the most important market for luxury and car companies — and is driving sales for global healthcare, entertainment and apparel brands.For decades the ruling Communist party’s encouragement of saving to fund domestic investment and the accumulation of foreign capital through export surpluses meant even as workers’ incomes rose, they struggled to afford goods that their country exported.By 2008, household consumption had fallen to 36 per cent of China’s total spending from 47 per cent in 2000. This compared with 70 per cent in the US, while disposable incomes averaged just $2,200 per year. As a result, multinationals drawn to China by the prospect of 1.3bn consumers often retreated disappointed.But since 2008, a tighter labour market boosting wages and capital gains from a housing price boom more than doubled average incomes, which reached $5,800 last year. Consumption has been the single biggest driver of growth since 2011, and household spending approaches 40 per cent of GDP.“It’s new households coming into the middle class stage which is driving consumption,” says Daniel Zipser of consultancy McKinsey. “The auto industry very much depends on China. The beauty and sports industries have a high share of their global business coming from China.”Rising affluence has been most visible in the automobile sector. China overtook the US as the world’s largest car market in 2009 and while the pace of growth has slowed, 29m vehicles were sold in China last year compared with 18m in the US.Volkswagen generated 41 per cent of its sales in China, while GM made 39 per cent and Ford 24 per cent in 2016, with profits generally an even higher proportion, according to consultancy Evercore.Chinese consumers became the world’s biggest spenders on luxury brands in 2012, according to consultancy Bain, and now account for around a third of global purchases — mostly by Chinese tourists overseas.But as price differences fall, luxury sales are returning to China with sales there accounting for a rising share of global luxury brands’ income — 27 per cent of sales last year for French group Kering, which owns brands such as Gucci, and 35 per cent for Swiss brand Swatch.Beyond luxury, China is now the world’s leading consumer of smartphones, while its movie and sportswear markets are second only to the US.That has driven sales for multinationals such as cinema group Imax which made a third of global revenues in China last year. China accounted for about 20 per cent of Apple and Adidas’ global sales, while Nike and Starbucks made about 10 per cent of global revenues in the country.China overtook Japan to become the world’s second largest drug market in 2013. Britain’s AstraZeneca made $3bn in China sales last year, about 13 per cent of its global total while the US’ Pfizer made 7 per cent of its revenues in China last year, trailing only the US and Japan.Chinese consumer market growth comes from premiumisationWhile there are headwinds to China’s consumer market such as rising personal debt, the risk of a housing bubble and slowing productivity growth, analysts are bullish on prospects for the next decade. Disposable incomes will expand by nearly 8 per cent a year through to 2020, according to brokerage CLSA, which predicts that the household savings rate will fall to 27 per cent.The number of affluent households with annual income over Rmb136,000 ($22,000) will nearly double from 82m in 2015 to 137mn in 2020, according to research group Gavekal.China’s consumer market is now firmly in a middle-class stage, where growth comes from selling higher-quality products. Volume sales of pork, beer and instant noodles have peaked in recent years. “China has already reached a good consumption level in terms of volume for all the food and beverage categories, so growth comes from premiumisation,” adds Mr Zipser.That should be good news for foreign brands, who sell more premium products. But in practice Chinese consumer brands have been faster to adapt to the upgrading trend than multinationals.In China’s urban fast moving consumer goods market, worth $190bn, Chinese companies’ sales grew more than 8 per cent in 2016 compared to just 1.5 per cent for foreign brands, according to a report from Bain and Kantar Worldpanel.The consumer divisions of multinationals can be hampered because they make key decisions outside China, analysts say. “Chinese brands are squeezing the global brands if [the latter] have not caught up to the upgrading trend,” said Max Lin of asset manager Actis.Some multinationals are changing the way they operate. Kraft Heinz last month launched a premium range of cookies resembling its Oreos but priced “significantly” higher than the real thing as well as domestic brands.To design the product. the company moved people to China and “built a local team based on Chinese knowledge,” says Ze Dias, China managing director at Kraft Heinz. “We like to operate like a smaller business. When it comes to how to win in the market it has to be decisions made by local people that are close to consumer needs”.New regulations will drive emissions cheats off road / From Jesse Norman MP, London, UK
63;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Week in Review, May 12;"Walmart buys into India; Nestlé, Anbang and Rolls-Royce also in the news";A round up of some of the week’s most significant corporate events and news stories.Walmart slides after $16bn deal to buy India’s FlipkartWalmart sealed the world’s biggest ever ecommerce deal this week with the $16bn takeover of Flipkart, the Indian online retailer. The deal sees Walmart take 77 per cent of the shares, buying $14bn worth of stock from other investors and injecting a further $2bn of fresh equity, writes Kiran Stacey in New Delhi.The purchase pits Walmart directly against Amazon, the other major player in the fast-growing Indian ecommerce market. According to Euromonitor, Flipkart and Amazon jointly control 61 per cent of the market, which is worth nearly $30bn today, but is forecast to grow 27.8 per cent a year on average for the next five years.But it is also part of a shift in strategy being overseen by Doug McMillon, Walmart’s chief executive. He told reporters in Delhi on Thursday that he was looking at other deals to pursue, focusing especially on North and Central America, India and China.Some investors and analysts are concerned about the losses that Walmart is likely to rack up as it competes with Amazon to grab share in a market where customers are used to heavy discounting.But Mr McMillon said his company had no choice but to move into higher-growth areas if it wanted to survive. “We know from retail history that if retailers don’t change they go away,” he warned.Walmart’s shares fell steadily during the week. By Friday, they were $82.69, which was 5 per cent lower than where they had been on Monday morning when news began to break about the details of the deal.Nestlé agrees $7.2bn tie-up to sell Starbucks productsNestlé agreed to pay $7.2bn to sell Starbucks products outside the US brand’s café chain as the Swiss group ramped up its US and global coffee expansion plans, writes Ralph Atkins in Zurich.The world’s largest food and drinks group will add Starbucks’ brand to its Nescafé and Nespresso coffee portfolio, it announced last Monday, and will roll out the sale of its products worldwide — especially in Asia.The deal was the latest move by Mark Schneider, who took over last year as chief executive, to boost Nestlé’s sales growth and profits. Mr Schneider has identified coffee as a fast-growth market for the Swiss group. However, it is weak in the US coffee market, where it faces stiff competition from the empire built by JAB Holdings, the investment company of Germany’s billionaire Reimann family that includes Keurig Green Mountain capsules.Starbucks’ “out-of-shop” operations — which include ground coffee, coffee beans and capsules for coffee machines — generate $2bn in annual revenues. About 500 Starbucks employees will move to Nestlé.The Starbucks deal will buttress Nestlé’s efforts to expand its Nespresso upmarket coffee capsule system in the US, following the 2014 introduction of VertuoLine machines producing the long coffees preferred by Americans. The Swiss group has revamped its Nescafé Gold Blend instant-coffee brand, and last September acquired a majority stake in the hipster Blue Bottle café and roastery chain.Starbucks said proceeds from the deal would be used to accelerate share buybacks.China jails Anbang’s Wu for 18 years over financial fraudWu Xiaohui, the former chairman of Anbang Insurance Group and the high-flying businessman who bought the Waldorf Astoria in 2014, has been sentenced to 18 years in prison for financial fraud in China, writes Don Weinland in Hong Kong.A court in Shanghai on Thursday handed down the sentence after Mr Wu pleaded for leniency at his one-day trial in March. Prosecutors accused him of diverting insurance premiums for personal use and making false disclosures to regulators.Anbang began a rapid global expansion in 2012, buying banks, insurance companies and property around the world, including the historic Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York and Strategic Hotels & Resorts. Shortly after the 2016 US presidential election, Mr Wu met Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s adviser and son-in-law, about a New York real estate deal, although it never materialised.The first sign that Mr Wu’s wings had been clipped was Anbang’s failed $14bn bid for Starwood. After gatecrashing an ongoing deal with Marriott and engaging in a fierce bidding war that drove up the price, Anbang walked away from the deal.Mr Wu was unofficially detained in Beijing in July last year. Regulators seized control of Anbang in February, and last month the company received a $10bn bailout from an industry rescue fund.Dong Ximiao, researcher at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China, said of the outcome of the trial: “The message here is that so-called ‘barbaric expansion’ will not be tolerated.”Rolls-Royce to move to King’s Cross without COO KirbyAlmost half a century after Rolls-Royce set up a base in London’s St James’s, the UK’s flagship engineering group is planning to pack its bags for the far trendier — and cheaper — neighbourhood of King’s Cross, writes Peggy Hollinger in London.But Rolls-Royce’s chief operating officer Simon Kirby will not be going with the handful of senior executives and staff who will be making the move.Mr Kirby’s departure just 19 months after being appointed came as a surprise to many who had expected the new COO to make big changes to Rolls-Royce’s operations.In the internal memo announcing Mr Kirby’s departure, Rolls-Royce chief executive Warren East stressed the urgency of the drive to reduce spending. “Please do everything you can to reduce costs now,” Mr East appealed to employees.A pension deal will cut cash outlays by £145m over the next three years.
64;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2018-05-07T18:05:34Z;Starbucks/Nestlé: complex brew;A licensing deal can be harder to interpret;"Walk into a Starbucks and the gap between the price of an iced skinny cinnamon dolce latte and its ingredient costs may leave you perplexed. It is the same with the landmark transaction struck with Nestlé. The companies confirmed rumours of a tie-up in which Nestlé is buying the perpetual right to distribute Starbucks’ packaged coffee around the world. A sum of $7.2bn is changing hands, but it is not as simple as that. The muted response from Starbucks shares on Monday showed as much confusion among investors as its menus can evoke.The at-home coffee market appears to be narrowing to a two-horse race between the JAB empire and Nestlé, whose existing consumer brands include Nespresso and Nescafé. The deal is structured as a licensing agreement; on top of $7.2bn upfront, Starbucks gets recurring revenues from sales and royalties.* The $5bn in immediate after-tax proceeds will help the group return $20bn to investors over three years, something it has been focusing on as its growth slows.But what concerned the market on Monday was Starbucks’ statements that earnings per share would not begin to increase for perhaps three years. The company’s revenue growth would be reduced by two to three percentage points from the sales it was now ceding to Nestlé. Starbucks says looking at the implied valuation multiple shows a juicy purchase price in the high teens.The brighter lens through which the US company views the deal is evident. Starbucks has a strong brand which allows it to receive up-front cash as well as a cash stream from Nestlé. The European food and drinks group has the trickier job of distributing and marketing the product. Starbucks, for a short time, is lighter in earnings. But the quality of those earnings has improved even if the company did not do a great job in explaining how. Customers may not care much what ingredients go into each Starbucks brew. More discerning investors can scrutinise the components of this deal — and still come away perked up.* This article has been amended to note that Starbucks received $7.2bn and recurring revenues from sales and royaltiesLex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

65;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2018-05-07T17:46:00Z;Nestlé’s global coffee ambitions gather steam;Deal widens Swiss group’s lead over JAB and boosts Starbucks’ international plans;"When unveiling a $7.15bn tie-up with the Starbucks coffee chain on Monday, Nestlé demonstrated its strengths — and weaknesses.The world’s largest food and drinks company dominates the global coffee market. Coffee and creamers generate SFr17bn ($17bn) in annual revenues for Nestlé, roughly a fifth of its turnover. Its distribution and expertise made it an attractive partner for Starbucks. But Nestlé has three big problems.Its global position in coffee has come under threat from the caffeine-fuelled ambitions of JAB Holdings, the private investment group that manages the wealth of Germany’s billionaire Reimann family.Second, it is small in the US — the world’s biggest coffee market — where it has a 5 per cent share and where JAB has focused most of the $30bn it has spent since 2012 on building a coffee empire, with acquisitions such as Keurig Green Mountain, Krispy Kreme doughnuts and Peet’s Coffee. JAB also owns, in partnership with Mondelez International, the Jacobs Douwe Egberts coffee business.Third, Nestlé is focused on soluble, or instant, coffee and capsules for coffee machines but is weak in packaged roast and ground coffee.The Starbucks deal helps on all three fronts. It is the boldest deal so far by Mark Schneider since becoming chief executive in January 2017, and is Nestlé’s third-biggest M&A deal ever, according to Andrew Wood, analyst at Bernstein.Mr Schneider had been tipped to push Nestlé into consumer healthcare. Nestlé was mentioned as a possible buyer for German drug company Merck’s consumer healthcare business or US group Pfizer’s consumer unit.Starbucks has made little progress in consumer packaged goods overseas. So clearly, while Nestlé may help US distribution on the margin, the bigger opportunity is overseasBut coffee has become the immediate priority. The Starbucks deal “will allow us to address a historical weakness Nestlé had in North America,” said one Nestlé executive.Under their partnership deal, 500 employees move to Nestlé but no industrial assets. Nestlé will work with Starbucks on new products and making Starbucks capsules for its coffee machines. The US group will retain control over its global brand management and Starbucks’ ready-to-drink coffees are excluded from the deal.However, Nestlé hopes to use its global operations to sell Starbucks products in geographical markets under-served by the US group, including selling soluble Starbucks coffee in developing market economies, where instant coffee remains popular.Celine Pannuti, analyst at JPMorgan, described the agreement as “a landmark deal for Nestlé to enhance its US retail platform in its biggest category, coffee”.Plans to expand its Nespresso capsule business were in place before Mr Schneider took over as chief executive. But last September, Nestlé acquired a majority stake in Blue Bottle, a hipster café and roastery chain, which valued the Californian company at more than $700m.Nestlé last November further expanded its US coffee portfolio by acquiring Chameleon, a Texas-based organic “cold brew” producer, for an undisclosed sum.Monday’s Starbucks deal will help reinforce Nestlé’s global lead over JAB by expanding coffee revenues.David Palmer, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said: “This deal is a modest negative for JAB’s global market share aspirations.”For Starbucks, the sale of the rights to its consumer and foodservice brands — which include Seattle’s Best Coffee and Teavana tea — to Nestlé is aimed at accelerating the brand’s international growth in supermarkets.John Culver, head of international at Starbucks, said: “We have consumer packaged goods products available in 28 countries; Nestlé operates in close to 190 countries — clearly they have a scale that we don’t have.”Starbucks told analysts on Monday that it had been talking to a number of potential partners, including Nestlé, over several months before deciding in favour of a deal with the Swiss multinational.Andrew Charles, analyst at Cowen, said the agreement “helps expand Starbucks’ international reach of the at-home business, while allowing more of management’s attention to be devoted to domestic and China coffee shop operations”.Mondelez used to hold the licence to Starbucks’ packaged coffee business but Starbucks took it in-house in 2011. Since then, although packaged coffee sales have grown, they still account for 10 per cent of the business — the same proportion as five years ago.Pablo Zuanic, analyst at Susquehanna, said: “Starbucks has made little progress in consumer packaged goods overseas. So clearly, while Nestlé may help US distribution on the margin, the bigger opportunity is overseas.”Starbucks said the proceeds from Monday’s deal would be used to accelerate share buybacks and that it expected to have returned $20bn to shareholders in cash by the end of its 2020 fiscal year, up from $15bn previously promised."

Like other big consumer goods groups, Nestlé has lost sales to smaller rivals as a result of changing consumer tastes and slow economic growth.Mr Schneider has identified coffee as a fast-growth market for the Swiss group. However, it is weak in the US coffee market, where it faces stiff competition from the empire built by JAB Holdings, the investment company of Germany’s billionaire Reimann family, which includes Keurig Green Mountain capsules.The deal “opens up another front against JAB”, said Jon Cox, consumer industry analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux in Zurich. “It gives Nestlé a better position in North America, and also in roast and ground [coffee] where they don’t have any position on a global basis . . . The magic will be really using Nestlé’s global distribution and modern retailing to really leverage sales of Starbucks products.”The $7.15bn upfront cash payment was equivalent to 15 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation — in line with other deals in the sector, analysts said. Nestlé’s share price, which has fallen 4 per cent over the past 12 months, was up 1.6 per cent at SFr77.56 at the close of trading in Switzerland.Starbucks’ “out-of-shop” operations — which include ground coffee, coffee beans and capsules for coffee machines for sale beyond its café chain — generate $2bn in annual revenues.Starbucks said the proceeds from Monday’s deal would be used to accelerate share buybacks and that it expected to have returned $20bn to shareholders in cash by the end of its 2020 fiscal year.A Nestlé executive said the Starbucks deal “will allow us to address a historical weakness Nestlé had in North America”.

Nestlé would pay royalties for the Starbucks brand at normal market rates, it said.The deal means Starbucks coffee capsules will in future be available for Nestlé coffee machines. However, Nestlé also hopes to use its global distribution and manufacturing facilities to sell Starbucks products in geographical markets underserved by the US group. That would include selling soluble Starbucks coffee in developing market economies, where instant coffee remains popular.“This transaction is a significant step for our coffee business, Nestlé’s largest high-growth category,” said Mr Schneider. “With Starbucks, Nescafé and Nespresso we bring together three iconic brands in the world of coffee.”Coffee and creamers generate SFr17bn ($17bn) annual revenues for Nestlé, roughly a fifth of its total turnover.Kevin Johnson, president and chief executive of Starbucks, said: “This global coffee alliance will bring the Starbucks experience to the homes of millions more around the world through the reach and reputation of Nestlé.”About 500 Starbucks employees will move to Nestlé.

68;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2018-05-02T20:53:06Z;Starbucks settles with two men arrested at Philadelphia café;Incident prompted Starbucks to plan racial-bias training at US stores;Starbucks has agreed to pay an undisclosed sum to two African-American men who were arrested after a manager of one of its cafés in Philadelphia called the police on them for sitting at a table without ordering any food or drink.The arrest in April, which was captured on video and seen by millions of people online, sent the $80bn coffee chain into crisis mode and called into question its commitment to racial equality.After mediation before a retired federal judge and what Starbucks called “constructive conversations”, the company put out a statement agreed with the two men, Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson. The settlement struck this week “will allow both sides to move forward and continue to talk and explore means of preventing similar occurrences at any Starbucks location,” it said.The agreement included a confidential financial settlement and an offer for Mr Robinson and Mr Nelson to complete their undergraduate degrees through the Starbucks College Achievement Plan, a partnership with Arizona State University, which pays tuition fees for Starbucks staff.In a separate settlement with the City of Philadelphia, the two men received a symbolic $1 each and a pledge from officials to establish a $200,000 programme to support young entrepreneurs.Starbucks has already announced plans to close all of its more than 8,000 US stores on May 29 for an afternoon of anti-bias training.On Wednesday it said Mr Robinson and Mr Nelson would have an opportunity to share recommendations with Eric Holder, a former US attorney-general, “as part of company’s long-term diversity and equity efforts”.Kevin Johnson, Starbucks’ chief executive officer, thanked the two men for “their willingness to reconcile”. Starbucks would take further actions, he said, “to repair and reaffirm our values and vision for the kind of company we want to be.”

But it has been done before.In 1995, when UK conglomerate Whitbread bought CB Costa Brothers Coffee from Sergio and Bruno Costa, tea was the UK’s favourite hot drink. “At home, people drank instant. If you were lucky, you’d get a filter coffee or a shot from a Rombouts machine in a pub or restaurant,” said Bob Tyrrell, who did extensive market research at the time.Costa had just 41 shops then, turning over £55m. Whitbread thought the market might be worth £600m a year, and paid about £20m for Costa. Two decades later it has more than 2,000 outlets, making it the UK market leader by some distance. Total revenue from the country’s 24,000 coffee shops and cafés is estimated by Allegra World Coffee Portal at more than £9bn.This week, Whitbread bowed to pressure from two activist investors and confirmed it would demerge Costa from its other activities — but not before it has set the company up for a big push into China, another country with a long tradition of tea-drinking. Costa aims to have total annual sales of £2.5bn by 2020, with a third of them coming from overseas.Drinking good coffee became a preoccupation of the connoisseur British consumer of the late 1990s. “It wasn’t so much keeping up with the Joneses as keeping away from them. People wanted to consume things they could talk about,” said Mr Tyrrell.Other factors were at work, too: disposable incomes were growing, low-cost airlines meant more people were experiencing “proper” coffee in mainland Europe and workers were starting to abandon breakfast in favour of food on the go.Dominic Paul, managing director of Costa, said the tipping point came around 2004. “We had the size and scale we needed to expand more quickly and consumer habits were changing, too. People were no longer going for a pint at lunchtime — they were having a coffee instead.”The implication of this shift was not lost on a company with a long heritage in brewing, while the advent of wireless internet helped turn coffee shops into what Howard Schultz, chairman of Starbucks, called the “third place” between home and work.Coffee consumption shot up. The average Briton now grinds through the equivalent of 3.3kg of beans a year, according to the International Coffee Organisation. That is still behind countries such as the US and Italy, but well ahead of the 0.83kg a year that the average Chinese consumes.Despite the ubiquity of the shops, returns have been excellent. Operating profits at Costa have risen from £9m in 2006, the first year they were reported separately, to £158m in the year to March 2018. Return on capital at the chain was 46 per cent. Even more lucrative are the Costa Express automated vending machines popping up in garages and convenience stores.But momentum in the UK stores has started to stall. Sales in fiscal 2018 grew 5.2 per cent, well below the annual 9.7 per cent rate forecast by Allegra for all UK coffee shops over the next five years.Richard Clarke, analyst at Bernstein, said Costa is relatively overexposed to locations where footfall is growing slowly or falling. Three-fifths of Costa’s UK stores are in shopping centres or out-of-town retail parks.Mr Paul acknowledges the need to rebalance. “There has been a . . . shift in consumer behaviour away from the High Street and we have not been immune to that,” he said. “More of our future growth is going to come from drive-through and travel locations.”Sachem Head, one of the hedge funds that pushed hard for Costa to be demerged, said there is room for other operational improvements at Costa. Scott Ferguson, managing partner, told a conference in New York this week that being a standalone company will better align management incentives.Others agree; Ed Meier, a fund manager at Old Mutual who owns the shares, said he hoped the spin-off would “inject greater agility and innovation” into both Costa and the Premier Inn hotel chain, which will remain part of Whitbread.Once it is separately listed, Costa will be one of only two large quoted coffee chains in the world — the other being Starbucks. The Seattle-based group is a distant second to Costa in the UK but in China it is well ahead, with more than 600 stores in Shanghai alone, against 449 Costas nationwide. Starbucks does not detail revenues and profits from China separately, but the Asia-Pacific region now accounts for almost 15 per cent of sales.Mr Paul is unperturbed by the greater scale of his US rival. “The scale of China is breathtaking . . . there is more than enough growth to go around.” Costa bought out its joint venture partner last year, and aims to triple its store numbers there to 1,200 by 2022.“Over the past 15 years you’ve seen the UK become a nation of coffee drinkers. You only need a tiny proportion of that shift to occur in China for it to become a really huge opportunity.”Back in the 1990s, coffee evangelists such as Gerry Ford at Caffè Nero and Bobby Hashemi at Coffee Republic used to make similarly bullish comparisons between the US and the UK. They turned out to be too conservative.Additional reporting by Camilla Hodgson in London"
70;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks sales perk up but outlook uncertain;China expansion pays off but caution remains over fallout from racial bias controversy;Starbucks turned in better than expected sales growth in the first few months of 2018, even as it said it was unclear how its full-year projections might be affected by plans to close more than 8,000 US stores for an afternoon in May to conduct racial bias training after fallout from an incident at one of its Philadelphia cafés.The coffee chain group said on Thursday afternoon that comparable-store sales, a key industry metric, rose 2 per cent globally and in the US during the three months to April 1, and 4 per cent in China, where it has pinned many of its expansion hopes.Revenue rose 14 per cent year-on-year to $6bn, while net earnings attributable to Starbucks came in at $660.1m, or 47 cents a share, up slightly from a year ago. On an adjusted basis, earnings came in at 53 cents a share.Analysts expected earnings of $744m, or 53 cents a share, and sales of $5.93bn, with same-store sales forecast to grow 1.8 per cent from a year ago, according to Factset.US same-store sales have slowed in the past few quarters, from 3 per cent two quarters ago, to 2 per cent last quarter. Analysts had expected Americas same-store sales to come in at 1.8 per cent this time around, versus the 2.33 per cent tipped for the Asia-Pacific region, including China, according to Thomson Reuters.After years of rapid expansion across the US, Starbucks’ slowing growth in its home market has raised some concerns, even as it continues to make a major push into China.Starbucks has also found itself at the centre of a public-relations maelstrom earlier this month when a manager at one of its stores in Philadelphia called police to arrest two black men who were sitting at a table without ordering, prompting accusations of discrimination. In an attempt to quell the backlash, it announced that it will shutter more than 8,000 US stores for the afternoon of May 29.If there has been any fallout from the incident, it would not have shown up in Thursday’s results, which cover the first three months of 2018. However, investors will be watching Starbucks closely to see if its efforts to address the controversy have been effective.While Starbucks stuck by its previous full-year guidance in the latest report, it cautioned that: “all guidance items exclude the yet to be determined impact of its previously announced plan to close more than 8,000 company-owned stores in the US on May 29, 2018 to conduct racial-bias training for all partners (employees) in the US.”Kevin Johnson, Starbucks chief executive, said in a statement that its results: “represented another quarter of record financial results, highlighted by accelerating momentum across our Americas business — particularly in the US, continued strong performance in China and our strongest comp growth in Japan in five quarters.”After rising 3.4 per cent over 2017, Starbucks shares are up 3.4 per cent so far this year. They fell 3.5 per cent in after-hours trading.
71;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2018-04-20T18:09:39Z;Starbucks: America’s culture wars come to the café;The arrest of two black men in a Philadelphia branch of the chain highlights US companies’ struggle to find the right response to social issues as sensitive as race ;Three years ago, after a spate of police killings of unarmed black people sparked protests in US cities from Ferguson to Oakland, Howard Schultz decided the company he built needed to speak up about race in America. The then Starbucks chief executive invited thousands of staff to share their own experiences in company forums, and encouraged baristas to engage customers in the discussion by writing “Race Together” on their iced caramel macchiatos. “There were some people who said, ‘Howard, this is not a subject we should touch,’” Mr Schultz admitted in a video message to employees. “I reject that completely, because we can’t leave this for someone else.” The initiative earned as much media mockery as praise, but became a symbol of corporate America’s increasingly progressive positioning in a divided country that, not long after, put Donald Trump in the White House and gave conservatives a majority in Congress. Since Mr Schultz’s initiative, multinationals from Apple to 21st Century Fox have spoken out against legislation  to overturn discrimination protections for LGBT people in Indiana or dictated which bathrooms transgender people could use in North Carolina. Chief executives split from Mr Trump after he pulled out of the Paris climate accord and was slow to denounce white supremacist violence last summer. A number of companies have also waded into America’s fractious gun debate , with retailers such as Walmart responding to a Florida school shooting by raising age limits on gun sales and businesses including Delta Air Lines withdrawing deals once offered to members of the National Rifle Association.They have had encouragement from the country’s largest institutional investors, such as Larry Fink of BlackRock, who has told companies he expects them to explain not just their financial performance but how they make “a positive contribution to society”.But even a company that has tried to put itself on the right side of one of the country’s deepest social rifts can suddenly find itself falling into the chasm. On April 12, two 23-year-old entrepreneurs walked into the Starbucks branch near Rittenhouse Square, the heart of a well-to-do Philadelphia neighbourhood, to discuss a property deal with a local businessman. As they waited, one asked to use the toilet. The manager declined, as neither man had ordered food or drink, and soon called the police to say the men were “refusing to make a purchase or leave”. Minutes later, police were handcuffing the young men. Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson are black. The man they were waiting for, Andrew Yaffe, is white and arrived in time to be caught on another white customer’s video of the arrest asking incredulously, “what did they do?” Within hours, the video had been tweeted, reaching millions of online viewers and being picked up by the media. #DeleteStarbucks was trending on social media and Starbucks had a crisis on its hands. “The only thing shocking to me about the racism of @Starbucks employees is how shocked people are by it,” wrote Ijeoma Oluo, author of So You Want To Talk About Race, on Twitter: “@Starbucks is one of the countless places in this world that reminds black people they are not welcome in this country.” A company whose corporate responsibility statement talks about “strengthening communities by welcoming all” had suddenly become a symbol of entrenched racial injustice. By Saturday, Kevin Johnson, who became Starbucks’ chief executive last year with Mr Schultz moving to executive chairman, had issued a statement regretting the “disheartening” incident and its “reprehensible” outcome and pledged further staff training. As the week unfolded, Starbucks parted company with the store manager at the centre of the storm and Mr Johnson flew to Philadelphia to meet police and community leaders and to apologise in person to the two men, who had been released after several hours in custody. He announced on Tuesday that on May 29, as a first step, it would close all of its more than 8,000 stores in the US for an afternoon of anti-bias training. In a CNN interview that night, Mr Johnson appeared drained. Answering one question after a long pause, he said: “It’s been an emotional experience.” Starbucks’ actions — responding quickly, making its chief executive visible, engaging widely and pledging action — were a “textbook case study on how to handle a crisis”, says Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “Can you imagine Facebook closing its service for a day to examine all the content?” Spending power of African-American consumers in 2021, up from $1.2tn now, according to NielsenDrop in points for Starbucks’ “Buzz Score”, a reputational tracker, after the incident in PhiladelphiaEstimated loss to Starbucks of closing all its branches for an afternoonStarbucks has done this before. In 2008, fretting that the company was drifting from its original mission, Mr Schultz closed more than 7,000 stores to train its baristas how to make the perfect shot of espresso. It cost $6m in lost sales, he wrote in his book, Onward, but was a galvanising event. “Ultimately, closing our stores was most powerful in its symbolism,” he noted.Closing for an afternoon in 2018 could cost Starbucks about $12m, estimates Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at Yale School of Management, but “it’s well worth it,” he told CNBC, considering the reputational damage it could limit. Corporate America is all too familiar with reputational crises and all too short of positive case studies in damage limitation. The most commonly cited one — Johnson & Johnson’s painkiller recall after seven people died after taking cyanide-laced Tylenol — happened in 1982. Whether Starbucks can update the textbooks for an era of socially motivated consumer activism is still far from clear. Rashad Robinson, executive director of US racial justice group Color Of Change, told the FT he had been “impressed by the outreach” after Starbucks contacted him within 24 hours of the incident, and Mr Schultz called him on Monday. “I have not seen a corporation respond this way, and they deserve credit where credit is due,” he says, but the pace of staff turnover at Starbucks meant more training would be needed.Others were more sceptical. DeRay Mckesson, the Black Lives Matter activist, asked his 1m Twitter followers: “Do we seriously think that Starbucks is going to pull off thousands of substantive racial bias trainings simultaneously on one day based on a curriculum that hasn’t been developed yet?”The company’s response was, according to one protester’s placard outside the Philadelphia branch, “too little, too latte”. Risha Grant, an Oklahoma-based consultant who runs corporate training on recognising unconscious bias, agreed that Starbucks could probably only “touch the surface” in an afternoon, so follow-up training would be essential. But she praises its response and says the company had a commercial imperative to win back African-Americans shaken by the Philadelphia incident.Two decades ago, Ms Grant was often called in by companies responding to a lawsuit alleging bias. Now, as companies’ staff and customers become increasingly diverse, she is seeing them call before a crisis hits. “What’s happening is that more and more companies are learning that the price of inclusion is much cheaper than the price of exclusion,” she says. Brands are waking up to the power of socially conscious black consumers, Nielsen said in a report in February. African-Americans’ spending power is on track to grow from $1.2tn to $1.5tn by 2021, the analytics group estimates, and their brand loyalty is more contingent than other groups on companies’ reputation for being socially conscious.The economic fallout for Starbucks will become clearer over the next several quarters, but so far investors have appeared untroubled, with its shares barely moving since the arrests. However, YouGov, which polls consumers on whether they have heard positive or negative things about a brand in recent days, reported that Starbucks’ “Buzz score” fell from 13 to -8 between Friday and Tuesday. It is common for some consumers to take offence, particularly when brands are taking a position on divisive issues from climate change to same-sex marriage, Jostein Solheim, chief executive of Ben & Jerry’s, the ice-cream maker, told the FT last year. “There’s a whole lot of people that feel that’s not something a business should do,” he said. Yet brands are working in an era of extreme transparency, he added: “People think about what they’re buying, and especially in the up and coming generation, they’re voting with their purchases.” The pressures on businesses from consumers, staff and politicians of different backgrounds and political persuasions remain conflicting and intense, and even some activists acknowledge that companies’ capacity to cure all of society’s ills is limited. Starbucks has an opportunity “to talk about the larger cultural responsibility [for racism] in this country”, says Color Of Change’s Mr Robinson. But “Starbucks alone cannot fix the problems that happened inside that store. It’s really hard to train away racism”. And then there is the human factor. “Companies don’t have diversity problems. They have people problems, and we have to be held accountable as people,” argues Ms Grant. “Some people are just jerks.”

The men were arrested for trespassing.Starbucks said the training would be provided to nearly 175,000 employees across the US and is aimed at preventing discrimination in its stores. The programme will also be part of the training process for all new hires. The scandal is one of the first big tests for Kevin Johnson, chief executive, who took over from Howard Schultz last year and has looked to maintain the coffee giant’s brand with consumers. This one day is great. But what else are they going to do to make sure it never happens again?Mr Johnson said on Tuesday: “I’ve spent the last few days in Philadelphia with my leadership team listening to the community, learning what we did wrong and the steps we need to take to fix it. While this is not limited to Starbucks, we’re committed to being a part of the solution.”Speaking separately on CNN, Mr Johnson said: “It’s an emotional learning experience and I take it personally . . . I’m going to fix it.”The incident has sparked outrage on social media, inspiring a #boycottstarbucks hashtag on Twitter. Kevin Hart, the black comedian and actor, on Monday called out Mr Johnson for not taking the incident seriously enough in an interview with Good Morning America. “This really makes me sad . . . Starbucks had a platform and a real opportunity [on Good Morning America] to fix that situation correctly by calling it exactly what it was which was racial profiling/discrimination by the on duty manager. YOU FAILED,” he wrote on Twitter. Arness Sanders, a supervisor at Gregorys Coffee in New York and a former Starbucks barista, said he was surprised at the incident in Philadelphia and never would have called the police on a potential customer.“It’s extreme, I wouldn’t have thought that is the best route,” he said, referring back to previous diversity trainings he had at Starbucks. “Values are lost over time. But this one-day [training] should re-establish prior values.”As a black man, Mr Sanders said he hoped the company would stress awareness of unconscious bias more in its training, saying he doubted the police would have been called on anyone except a black man.“This one day is great,” he added. “But what else are they going to do to make sure it never happens again?”Starbucks said that the training programme would “address implicit bias, promote conscious inclusion, prevent discrimination and ensure everyone inside a Starbucks store feels safe and welcome”. Carreen Winters, chief strategy officer at MWWPR, a public affairs agency, said the announcement of the company-wide shutdown should help reinforce Starbucks’ reputation. “Chipotle closed all of its stores for food safety training in the wake of serious health issues. Starbucks is signalling that racism is as important as food safety.”The coffee chain, under Mr Schultz, has for years looked to fight for social justice issues — but has misfired over race and marketing in the past. Starbucks in 2015 attached “Race Together” stickers to customers’ cups in an effort to spur a discussion about race, following the shooting of an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri.The strategy was met with a backlash on social media, with users suggesting faux slogans for the chain such as: “Some of my best friends are black coffee” and “tea shall overcome”.Shares in Starbucks were up 0.7 per cent on Tuesday.Additional reporting by Andrew Edgecliffe-JohnsonThis article has been amended to correct the headline

74;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;What’s the return on investing in a reusable coffee cup?;Discounted drinks mean you can soon recoup the cost of buying your own cup;"Skinny mocha. Flat white. Cortado. Dirty chai latte. Or an extra-shot grande Americano? Choosing the type of coffee you want is hard enough. Now, the focus has switched to the choice of cup you drink it from.It is estimated that 2.5bn takeaway coffee cups are thrown away every year in the UK, and they are practically impossible to recycle. Gulp.More environmentally conscious coffee connoisseurs choose to bring their own reusable cups for baristas to fill — and many chains are encouraging them by offering discounts.But these discounts vary hugely, and there are as many types of cup as there are types of coffee bean. So which is the best buy and what kind of return on investment could coffee lovers potentially obtain?The cost of reusable cups ranges from £1 (for a lowly Starbucks reusable beaker) all the way up to $149 (£108) for the Ember Bluetooth-enabled travel cup, which can keep your choice of beverage at a constant temperature for up to two hours. Only available in the US, it is controlled via a smartphone app and can be customised with a 24 carat gold “halo lid” and a recharging coaster.A solution for a problem that few of us experience, you would have to be seriously wired to think that buying one of these was a good idea. Yet a prolific coffee drinker could break even on their investment if they used it 220 times in Pret A Manger.How is this possible? Anxious to boost their green credentials, most of the big coffee chains offer discounts of up to 50p per hot drink to encourage consumers to bring their own reusable vessels. Some sell their own too.So, as well as being better for the planet, using a reusable cup could also be better for your bank account.The good news is that all the coffee shops I tried were happy to fill any reusable cup I brought along with me. So long as your cup is clean and has a suitable lid, you can use one coffee shop’s branded reusable cup in a rival chain.However, not all of them offer a discount. There is not a bean to be had from chains including Eat, AMT, Delice de France, Caffè Ritazza, Pumpkin Cafe or Camden Food Co.However, Pret and Patisserie Valerie offer the most generous discount of 50p per hot drink to those who bring their own cups (Pret will soon start selling its own). This means a cup of Pret filter coffee — which has been faithfully priced at 99p for a decade now — can be yours for just 49p.Caffè Nero is technically the next best. Its loyalty card (now also available via a contactless tap-and-pay phone app) gives you one point per coffee purchased. For every nine you buy, the tenth coffee is free. But if you take a reusable cup, Nero doubles your points. So if you bought five regular cappuccinos at £2.35, the free drink would effectively save you 47p per coffee, plus you would carry over one loyalty point.Costa, Starbucks and Paul, the French sandwich chain, all offer a discount of 25p. Paul also has a loyalty card (La Carte Noire) with a free coffee and croissant when you sign up, then your tenth coffee free. Ooh la la! Benugo offers a 10 per cent discount. Even Greggs — which sells surprisingly good coffee for the price — will knock 20p off.How many coffees it will take to earn back the value of your investment also depends on the type of cup you choose.The Starbucks basic reusable cup costs £1 — and it looks it. Some of my contacts on social media complained that the cups cracked easily. Better, then, to invest in a cup with a stoppable, leakproof lid that’s robust enough to survive the rigours of commuting and being repeatedly stuffed into a handbag.Collapsible cups like the Pokito (£15) and the Jerrybox (£10) take up less space in your bag. But heavier, non collapsible cups with intricate locking systems such as the Contigo (between £20 and £30 depending on size and colour) are guaranteed leak-free, and will also keep your coffee warm for hours.For the hipster in your life, there’s the KeepCup (bright mix and match colours, cork thermal bands and choice of a glass or plastic cup) ranging from £10 to £25.Cups made from bamboo fibre, such as Ecoffee, are another option at around £12. Patterns include a William Morris range. Who knew that choosing a cup could be so complicated? Yet only 2.5 per cent of Londoners are supping from reusables, according to data from payment platform Yoyo.The cheapo Starbucks cup will pay for itself after four discounted coffees in the chain, or two in rivals Pret and PatVal. But your future investment returns also depend on its lifespan.The dedicated coffee enthusiast could substantially boost their investment returns by playing ‘coffee arbitrage’If you sink £10 into a sturdier reusable cup, it will take 20 coffees to pay back (assuming the 50p discount). If you drink five coffees a week — or 260 cups a year — after you’ve paid for the reusable cup, you could save a cool £120.But you are still spending rather a lot of money on coffee. Based on the full £2.45 price of a Pret regular cappuccino, that’s an outlay of £637 a year (or £507 with the reusable cup and associated discount).The dedicated coffee enthusiast could substantially boost their investment returns by playing “coffee arbitrage”. The price of an espresso is usually cheaper than a white Americano (in Pret, £1.65 vs £1.99). So buy the espresso in your renewable cup, and get the 50p discount. Then replace the thermal lid, walk back to your work kitchenette, and top up with free boiled water and milk there. You may think this is a lot of effort to go to. Yet I am bringing you this tip because colleagues in the FT office are already doing it.For the super thrifty, of course, there is the option of bringing in a good old fashioned mug and a cafetière. This is the Money team’s favoured route. I even get 20 per cent off ground coffee in Waitrose (it’s one of the “picks” on my loyalty card) and of course there’s a free in-store coffee too, which I will sip from my reusable cup as the caffeine jitters propel me across the bridge to the FT office.Claer Barrett is the editor of FT Money; claer.barrett@ft.com; Twitter: @Claerb"
75;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Like great coffee, good ideas take time to percolate;The status quo is comfortable, especially for the people who get to call the shots;Monmouth Coffee opened on Monmouth Street in London in 1978. It serves wonderful coffee and the queues often stretch out of the door. That is what makes what happened next so surprising.What happened next was: nothing. Monmouth had few imitators, either upmarket or downmarket. Starbucks did not arrive in London for another 20 years. A handful of gourmet cafés serving New Zealand-style coffee only began to open in 2005. They’re very good, although I still prefer Monmouth. It’s now possible to get good coffee in several spots in London, but it is hardly ubiquitous. It is even more elusive outside the capital.This is a puzzle. Monmouth may not be a global titan like Starbucks, but it appears to be a highly successful business: the coffee is priced confidently and it is popular. So why has such an obviously good idea been so slow to spread?Even if you don’t much care about London’s coffee scene, this is an important question. William Gibson, science fiction author, observed that the future is already here — it’s just not evenly distributed. In that respect, it is much like good coffee. Economics agrees with Mr Gibson — which is fortunate, since he is little short of a prophet. The data show that just because good ideas emerge does not mean that they spread quickly.Researchers at the OECD have concluded that within most sectors (for example, coal mining or food retail) there is a large and rising gap in productivity between the typical business and the 100 leading companies in the sector. The leading businesses are nearly 15 times more productive per worker, and almost five times more productive even after adjusting for their use of capital such as buildings, computers and machinery.These are not small gaps. If there were some way to help good ideas to spread more quickly, more people would have good coffee and much else besides.Researchers at the OECD have concluded that within most sectors (for example, coal mining or food retail) there is a large and rising gap in productivity between the typical business and the 100 leading companies in the sectorOne natural approach is for a laggard company to seek advice — perhaps from management consultants. A decade ago, economists at Berkeley, Stanford and the World Bank conducted a randomised trial in which the bank paid for some textile factories in Mumbai to receive consulting advice from a global company. These factories tended to have utterly chaotic systems, so help with modern inventory management made a big difference. The factories saw their productivity transformed.More recently, those economists revisited the experiment. How much of the good advice had lasted? Had any of it spread? There was good news and bad news. The good news was that within companies that owned several factories, some of the good ideas first used in a single factory had been adopted across the company. But the bad news was that these proven management processes had not been copied by rival businesses.This is a reminder of how slow good ideas can be to spread, even when they are straightforward to grasp. In his classic textbook, The Diffusion of Innovations, Everett Rogers points out that many inventions have to cross a cultural divide: the person preaching the good idea is often quite different to the person being preached to. Rogers would probably not have been surprised to see that “not invented here” was a barrier to good practice spreading in the Mumbai textile industry.So good advice can work, but even good advice wears off. And we can all be resistant to new ideas. The status quo is comfortable, especially for the people who get to call the shots.An extreme example of resistance to change lies behind the quip that “science advances one funeral at a time”, based on an observation from the physicist Max Planck. A team of economists has studied the evidence from data on academic citations, and found that Planck seems to have been right: the premature death of a star scientist opens up his or her field to productive contributions from outsiders in other domains. People can be so slow to change their minds that we literally have to wait for them to die.There is an analogy in the marketplace: sometimes old businesses have to die before productivity improves, although that can mean desperate hardship for the workers involved.But sometimes bracing competition does not kill companies, but makes them stronger. For example, when iron ore producers in the Great Lakes region found themselves exposed to cheap competition from Brazil in the 1980s, the century-old industry faced a crisis. The response — as tracked by economist James Schmitz Jr — was a dramatic surge in productivity, unleashed by changes in work practices. Other economists have found similar responses to trade shocks elsewhere.And for all the talk of relentless change, there is evidence that US industry is becoming less dynamic: there are fewer shocks, and companies respond less to them. The OECD research, too, suggests that the productivity laggards tend to be further behind in markets that are over-regulated or otherwise shielded from competition.All too often, we don’t pick up good ideas willingly. We grasp for them, in desperation, only when we have no choice.tim.harford@ft.comAllow dogs into the office and good ideas will follow / From Alexander Brunner, Zurich, Switzerland
76;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2018-01-25T21:40:38Z;Starbucks drops as sales miss the mark;;Concerns about Starbucks’ growth resurfaced on Thursday after the US-based coffee-shop chain revealed quarterly earnings that showed less robust growth than Wall Street was anticipating. The company said that net sales for the three-month period ending December 31 came in at $6.1bn, a 6 per cent year-over-year rise but less than the $6.18bn that analysts surveyed by Factset had been expecting. Comparable-store sales, a key industry metric, grew 2 per cent globally, lower than the 3 per cent that Wall Street had been looking for. That represented a 2 per cent increase in the US, but a 6 per cent jump in China, a market that Starbucks has increasingly targeted as it hopes to jolt growth back to the levels it enjoyed in the past. Its earnings were boosted by a gain related to certain special items including a $1.3bn deal that saw it take full ownership of about 1,300 stores in China. Net earnings came in well above forecasts as a result, at $2.25bn, or $1.57 a share. Stripped of those special items, adjusted earnings per share were 65 cents, above the 57 cents that analysts were expecting. Kevin Johnson, Starbucks’ president and chief executive, said in a statement: “Today, Starbucks has two powerful, independent but complementary engines driving our global growth, the US and China. Our work to streamline the company is sharpening our focus on our core operating priorities.”The company said it is still looking for 3-5 per cent comparable-store sales growth globally for 2018, although it expects that to be “near the low end of the range for the year.”Full-year earnings per share are now expected to come in at $3.32-$3.36, or $2.48-$2.53 on an adjusted basis, which Starbucks said has been tweaked to reflect the expected impact of US tax reform. Its previous guidance had been for earnings per share growth to top 40 per cent year-on-year from $1.97 in 2017, thanks to the East China deal boost, and a 12 -13 per cent advance in adjusted earnings to $2.30-$2.33 in 2018.Last year saw Starbucks shares largely tread water, with just a 3.4 per cent gain over 2017. So far this year they have gained 6 per cent, but the lacklustre earnings saw its shares drop 3.2 per cent in after-hours trading on Thursday. 
77;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2018-01-17T07:32:19Z;"Cineworld revenues swell; rights issue launched for Regal purchase";;Cinema chain Cineworld pumped out a near-12 per cent rise in revenues in 2017, thanks in part to an apparent fondness among film fans for coffee with their popcorn.In a trading statement, the company said revenues rose by 11.6 per cent over the year, or 7.9 per cent on a constant currency basis, with particularly rapid growth outside the UK and Ireland. It also confirmed that its deal to buy US chain Regal will involve a £1.7bn rights issue, to wrap up in the coming weeks.Within last year’s sales, ‘retail revenue’ rose 15.6 per cent, or just under 12 per cent without the currency boost. This, the company said, “was positively impacted by the expansion of the group’s retail offerings. The group opened five Starbucks sites and three VIP sites in 2017″.Beauty and the Beast, Star Wars and Dunkirk were the biggest films of the year in the UK. The company says it is “well positioned” for 2018.
78;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2017-12-05T07:01:00Z;Starbucks makes super-sized China bet as it looks beyond US;New 30,000 sq ft ‘super premium’ roastery is bid to maintain upscale reputation;Starbucks is making a super-sized bet on China, where it is opening a premium roastery that will be its largest outlet in the world as part of efforts to maintain its upscale reputation in an increasingly important market.The Seattle-based company has spread to more than 130 cities in China, where it operates about 3,000 stores. It is opening new outlets at a rate faster than one a day as it seeks growth in the country following several quarters of underwhelming results in the US, its biggest market.The 30,000 sq ft roastery — approximately half the size of a football pitch — in Shanghai is the first for Starbucks outside the US. The outlet, which will open on Wednesday, allows customers to watch beans being roasted and brewed in Bunsen-burner style tubes and is positioned as “super premium”, the company said.As white-collar Chinese consumers with rising incomes switch to pricier premium goods, Starbucks is betting that thirst will extend to coffee.China could become Starbucks’ biggest market within a decade, executive chairman Howard Schultz told the Financial Times in Shanghai on Tuesday.Starbucks outlets in China have been seen as an upmarket destination for business meetings or dates, and so are able to charge more for a coffee than in the US. But other US brands such as McDonald’s and KFC that expanded rapidly in China have struggled in recent years as consumers in large cities began to desert them in favour of higher-end options.Starbucks has 600 stores in Shanghai — more than in New York or London — but faces competition from an increasing number of artisanal outlets. Li Chaoxiang, 23, who works in an investment bank, said: “Starbucks is not a premium brand any more, as when it first came. Now in Shanghai you can see Starbucks anywhere.”Mr Schultz said US fast-food chains had suffered as “the ubiquity of those companies worked against them”, adding: “The roastery represents the ability to take the customer up.”Starbucks dominates China’s $3.8bn specialist coffee shop sector with a 55 per cent market share last year, according to consultancy Euromonitor, well ahead of its closest rival McDonald’s, which had a 7 per cent share. Sales at such stores have nearly tripled in value since 2012 as more Chinese people drink coffee.The Asia-Pacific region, including China, accounted for almost 15 per cent of Starbucks’ revenue for the fiscal year ended in October, up from 5.5 per cent five years earlier. Same-store sales grew 8 per cent in China in the most recent quarter, compared with 2 per cent globally.“This is an inflection point for the company where China will become a much more important component of the financial results of Starbucks,” Mr Schultz said, adding there would be “less dependence on the US business” in the future.Jeffrey Towson, a business professor at Peking University, said Starbucks had “positioned themselves as affordable luxury” adding: “The amazing thing is, they really don’t have any major competitor in China at the moment.”Starbucks opens a store about every 15 hours in China, including in a growing number of smaller cities, Mr Schultz said. “We’re seeing fantastic returns in those cities which are consistent with the early days of Shanghai and Beijing,” he added.“One thing we didn’t count on is how busy the stores would be in the afternoon and evening, which is different from the US where we are busiest in the morning,” he noted. He added that same-store sales in China had been boosted by increased custom in the morning “in the last year or two”.To some extent Starbucks, which is targeting 5,000 outlets in China by 2021, is following a trail blazed by the fast-food chains into smaller Chinese cities, where incomes are rising faster than China’s largest cities.“Starbucks stands for American lifestyle,” said Terence Tsai, a professor at the China Europe International Business School. “It’s allied with status. People in lower-tier cities would aspire to this kind of leisure lifestyle. Lower tier cities are ready for this kind of thing.”But Starbucks was unlikely to be able to spread itself as widely as brands such as KFC, analysts said, especially in western regions of China, which are poorer with sparser populations. “The urbanisation rate is a problem, for a Starbucks it’s a particular problem because they need high-visibility and high-traffic locations,” said Mr Towson.While Starbucks has been under fire for its tax arrangements in Europe, Mr Schultz, who stepped down as chief executive this year, has been an outspoken critic of US president Donald Trump and the recent tax reform bill passed by the US Senate.“I have a policy of not speaking about American politics on foreign soil,” he said. “I’ll just say this: I would like to see a tax policy that is more compassionate and serves all people not just corporate America.”Additional reporting by Wang Xueqiao
79;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2017-11-03T16:41:14Z;Starbucks hit with downgrades from S&P, Fitch;;Starbucks was downgraded by both S&P Global Ratings and Fitch on Friday after the coffee chain unveiled plans to return about $15bn to shareholders over the next years and said it would fund the payments with debt and operating cash flows.S&P, which downgraded the company’s corporate credit rating by one notch to “A-” with a stable outlook, said it expected Starbucks to issue between $3bn to $4bn in debt over the next year. It said:The downgrade reflects the somewhat more aggressive leverage that we expect Starbucks to maintain in light of its announced intention to return about $15 billion to shareholders over the next three years. The payouts will be partly debt financed, which we expect will result in adjusted debt to EBITDA increasing to 1.8x-1.9x from about 1.3x.S&P expects Starbucks to see modest improvement in its operating performance driven by a low-single digit increase in its comparable sales, a measure of sales in stores open at least 12 months, new restaurants and its cost cutting plans, which motivated the “stable” outlook.Meanwhile, Fitch, which also cut the company’s long- and short-term issuer default ratings (IDRs) to ‘A-’ from ‘A’ and kept its outlook at “stable” said it expects the company’s total debt could increase by $5bn to $6bn. At the end of its fiscal year, October 1, Starbucks had a debt load of $3.9bn.The company announced its plans for the share buyback late on Thursday, when it trimmed its profit forecast and posted disappointing quarterly sales.Starbucks shares were up 3 per cent at $56.51 in midday trading on Friday.Image via EPA
80;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks to sell Tazo tea assets to Unilever for $384m;;Coffee shop chain Starbucks said on Thursday it will sell its Tazo tea brand to Unilever for $384m to focus on its Teavana line, amid disappointing quarterly results that drove its shares lower in after-hours trading.Consumer giant Unilever will purchase Tazo and related assets, including intellectual property, recipes and inventory, the companies announced. Starbucks said that it would focus on “a single tea brand strategy” with its Teavana line — despite announcing earlier this year that it would close all 379 of its Teavana stores following persistent underperformance at the primarily mall-based, tea-focused shops.Unilever’s North America president Kees Kruyhtoff said that Tazo’s “strong appeal to millennials” made it a “perfect strategic fit” for its US portfolio, which includes brands like Seventh Generation household products, Dollar Shave Club razor delivery service and Sir Kensington’s condiments.The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory approval, the companies said.Starbucks also reported earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter of 2017 on Thursday, which left investors underwhelmed as it delivered worse-than-expected sales figures.For the three months ending October 1, net revenue of $5.7bn was flat compared with the same period a year earlier, and came up just short of the $5.8bn that analysts surveyed by Factset had expected.Net income attributable to Starbucks fell 1.6 per cent year-over-year to $788.5m, missing expectations for income of $794m, while earnings per diluted share remained flat at 54 cents, in line with analysts’ forecasts.Comparable sales growth, a key industry metric, came in at 2 per cent, falling shy of the 3.3 per cent gain Wall Street was looking for. The company attributed the performance in part to Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. Stripping out the impact of the storms, comparable sales would have been up 3 per cent, Starbucks added.Scott Maw, Starbucks chief financial officer, said in a statement:Starbucks delivered solid top and bottom line growth – and our strongest quarterly traffic number in the U.S. since mid-2016 – despite a difficult operating environment in both the quarter and year.Starbucks shares have lost some of their zing as investors worry about whether the company can keep up the momentum that helped it become ubiquitous in many countries around the world. Year-to-date, shares are down almost 1 per cent. After Thursday’s earnings, shares dropped nearly 6 per cent in after-hours trading.Image via EPA
81;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2017-10-24T12:21:34Z;McDonald’s same-store sales growth tops estimates as turnaround continues;;McDonald’s global same-store sales climbed 6 per cent in the three months to the end of September, eclipsing analyst forecasts and reaffirming that the world’s largest burger chain’s turnround is on track.The organic sales figure exceeded consensus forecasts for a 4.7 per cent rise. Last quarter, the company reported global same-store sales jumped 6.6 per cent — its best rise in 5 years.Shares were down about 0.5 per cent in premarket trading. McDonald’s shares have grown more than a third this year as a comeback appears to be picking up.Total sales in the third quarter fell 10 per cent to $5.75bn, although this was in line with consensus forecasts, due to a refranchising effort in China that was expected to weigh on revenues in the quarter.Net income jumped to $1.88bn, or $2.32 a share, from $1.28bn or $1.50 a share a year ago. Analysts had predicted $1.77 a share. Net income was padded by the sale of about $850m of Mcdonald’s businesses in China and Hong Kong as the company shifts to a franchise model. Excluding that impact, diluted earnings were $1.76 a share.In the US comparable sales climbed 4.1 per cent. Analysts were looking for a 3.6 per cent rise.McDonald’s under the lead of Steve Easterbrook, has looked to adapt to shifting customer appetites, introducing healthier menu options and customised burgers. The company this summer also said it would overhaul its coffee offerings with espresso-based drinks, which was viewed as a move to lure millennials away from Starbucks.Mr Easterbrook on Tuesday said the results “demonstrate broad-based momentum throughout our business”.
82;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2017-10-24T07:17:10Z;"Opening Quote: ‘Peak coffee’?; Headroom for Carillion; SJP lures in assets";;"Is Whitbread, owner of Costa Coffee and Premier Inns, worth more than the sum of its parts? Analysts’ views seem to depend on their most likely caffeine delivery method.According to the Americano-chugging Americanos at Citi, the answer is no. In fact, they don’t seem to think a £2.20 Costa Americano is worth the sum of its parts. Last month, they “debunked the coffee growth myth”, warned that expansion would grind to a halt for Costa, Caffe Nero and Starbucks, and double downgraded Whitbread from “buy” to “sell”. They may have a point: £2.20 for “espresso, lengthened with hot water… straight up or add a splash of milk”, is a lot to ask for something that is 70 per cent “lengthening”.But ask the European frothy latte quaffers at Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank, and the answer is yes. Split Costa off from Premier Inns, Deutsche says, and assume an enterprise value of 14 times earnings like Starbucks – rather than 8.5 times, as at present – and you add at least £1bn to the market capitalisation. This lengthening – alongside measures to extract more value from Premier Inn’s hotels – is worth asking for, they suggest.Unfortunately, Whitbread’s half-year results have just shown less enthusiasm for asking for Americanos or lattes. Costa’s like-for-like sales in the six months slowed further: to just 0.6 per cent.This was slower than even Deutsche’s own forecast of 0.8 per cent – and represented yet another fall. In the first quarter it had been 1.1 per cent; in the the last full year 2 per cent; in the year before 2.9 per cent; and the year before that 6 per cent. Even a price rise in Costa UK stores was not enough to lift like-for-like revenues – and evidently for some customers proved too much. Costa’s underlying operating profit growth was therefore flat at £65m.Still, the chain increased market share as its store estate grew by 5 per cent, its drive-thru stores by 62 per cent, and it installed 25 per cent more Costa Express coffee machines in other outlets.It doesn’t believe Citi’s “peak coffee” thesis, either: it quotes Allegra, a “leading coffee industry body in the UK”, which has forecast coffee outlets will grow in the UK by 5-6 per cent a year over the next few years. China continues to offer potential, too, and Whitbread has just bought out its joint venture partner to speed it growth to 700 shops.And while currency related inflation may have put off Costa coffee drinkers, a weaker pound at least drew tourists to Whitbread’s Premier Inns.This morning, the company said it opened 2,000 new Premier Inn rooms in the UK in the first half and developed digital capabilities central to help bookings. Revenue per available room grew 1.8 per cent to £53.46 and total hotel and restaurant revenue grew at a slightly slowing 6.4 per cent.Premier Inn now expects to continue to win UK hotel market share, increasing its position from approximately 9 per cent in 2016 to more than 12 per cent beyond 2020.It has also completed of the exit of non-core international operations, including hotels in India, Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia. Credit Suisse had proposed a sale and leaseback of all its property, which at £5.4bn is equivalent to nearly two-thirds of Whitbread enterprise value.Overall, then, Whitbread raised half year group revenues by 7.4 per cent to £1.67bn, and underlying pre-tax profit by 6.7 per cent to £328m – thanks to “disciplined cost management”.Carillion, by contrast, has been valued at a lot less than the sum of its parts since contracts writedowns and a profit warning sent its shares tumbling.Today, it reduced its number of parts further, in a bid to raise funds: it said it had agreed to offload some healthcare projects to rival Serco for £50m.Carillion is targeting more sales by the end of next year, it a bid to raise £300m.Carillion also said that £140m in credit facilities, agreed in principle in September, “is fully available to draw down now”. Taken together with some pensions deferrals, this gives extra “headroom” of up to £190m for 2018.CEO Keith Cochrane said:Today we are announcing progress on a number of fronts and whilst our customers and creditors continue to be supportive, much remains to be done. We remain focused on executing our disposals and cost savings programmes while continuing our discussions with our lenders and other stakeholders to explore further ways of strengthening Carillion’s balance sheet.But for wealth manager St James’s Place, the sums just get bigger. This morning, it announced a 42 per cent increase in net fund inflows, year-on-year, as investors sent another £2.4bn its way in the three months to September 30.Group funds under management grew 20 per cent from the same time last year to stand at £85.7bn at September 30. Assets have increased by 14 per cent since the start of the year.Chief executive David Bellamy, who will step down at the end of the year, said the numbers reflected “sustained growth in new investments and continued high retention of clients and their investments”.Today’s Lombard column assesses London’s newest technology float: Arqiva.It’s the biggest flotation in London this year!

83;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Amazon, Microsoft and Starbucks act to support ‘Dreamers’;Companies back lawsuit challenging Trump move to end scheme for undocumented children;Amazon, Microsoft and Starbucks have filed sworn statements supporting a lawsuit that challenges President Donald Trump’s decision to end the programme that protects undocumented migrants brought to the US as children.The companies, all based in Washington state, are supporting the attorneys-general from 15 traditionally Democratic states and the District of Columbia who have filed a lawsuit aiming to stop the administration from scrapping the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals programme. Several of the Dreamers— migrants brought into the country when they were under 16 — work for these companies, the complaint, filed in New York, said. “Many companies in Washington are dependent on Daca grantees to operate and grow their businesses. Daca recipients work for our state’s largest companies as software engineers, finance professionals, and retail and sales associates, including for Amazon, Microsoft and Starbucks,” the complaint reads. Mr Trump’s decision announced on Tuesday is a victory for immigration hardliners. But even after announcing his plans to end the programme, he appeared to leave the door open to reform, tweeting: “Congress now has 6 months to legalise Daca (something the Obama Administration was unable to do). If they can’t, I will revisit this issue!”Amazon said it knew of nine employees who had been protected by Daca, a programme brought in by former President Barack Obama. The declaration said that if these employees lose their status and are deported, Amazon will “suffer injury”. Brad Smith, president and chief legal officer of Microsoft, said on Tuesday that the software maker had 39 employees who were Dreamers. He called on Congress for “urgent Daca legislation”, saying that scrapping the programme could be a “big step back” for the entire country. Mr Trump’s decision to scrap the Daca programme has enraged business leaders. More than 300 leaders from chief executives to venture capitalists warned last week that the 800,000 Dreamers are “vital to the future of our companies and our economy”. The decision has become the latest battle between Mr Trump and corporate America, following the mass resignations from his advisory councils because of his response to the recent white nationalist violence in Charlottesville. The technology industry has been particularly vocal in support of immigration reform, with Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook chief executive and founder, leading a Facebook Live interview from his home with several Dreamers on Wednesday. He said ending DACA was “one of the most troubling things I’ve seen in a long time”. Almost 100 tech companies including Tesla and Airbnb signed an amicus brief in February in support of a lawsuit against the so-called travel ban that restricted travel to the US from seven predominantly Muslim countries.

84;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2017-08-28T13:01:55Z;New Fitbit smartwatch and headphones take aim at Apple;Partnership with Adidas marks effort to regain leadership of wearable tech market;Fitbit is teaming up with Adidas as it takes on Apple with its first fully-fledged smartwatch, Ionic, and new wireless headphones. Ionic is the first of what Fitbit chief executive James Park said would be a series of smartwatches, as it looks to regain its position at the top of the wearable technology market, a position that analysts say it has lost to Apple Watch in recent months. The $300 device — which boasts four-day battery life, new wireless music and payment features, and improved GPS and heart-rate tracking — will go on sale in October. Adidas, the German sportswear group, will sell a special edition of Ionic starting early next year, boosting Fitbit’s profile in Europe and Asia. In Fitbit, Adidas has a new ally against Nike, which first partnered with Apple on a customised version of its Watch last year. Adidas lags behind Nike in the US sportswear market but has been gaining share in recent months. Fitbit is banking on Ionic to reverse its declining sales, as simpler fitness trackers reach saturation point in many developed markets. The San Francisco-based company’s revenues this year are expected to fall by as much as a quarter compared with 2016. Ionic’s launch is “definitely a big event in the company’s history”, Mr Park said in an interview. “We’ve rarely entered a new category with this much effort and push behind it.” While the majority of Fitbit’s revenues in the fourth quarter will still come from its earlier products, Mr Park added: “Our entry into smartwatches — and Ionic is not the only product in our smartwatch road map — allows us to re-establish a growth profile for Fitbit looking forward.” [The Ionic’s] upgraded sensor can detect blood oxygen levels as well as heart rate and steps, meaning it could eventually help diagnose medical conditions such as sleep apnoeaThe unveiling of Ionic, alongside new Flyer wireless headphones and updated Aria scales, comes ahead of the anticipated new version of the Apple Watch, which is expected to include a cellular wireless connection when it makes its debut next month. Ionic, which unlike an Apple Watch works with both iOS and Android smartphones, features a slimline design that Fitbit says was inspired by the space age. Its upgraded sensor can detect blood oxygen levels as well as heart rate and steps, meaning it could eventually help diagnose medical conditions such as sleep apnoea. A colour touchscreen will also offer guided workout sessions, powered by a revamped Fitbit Coach app, and customisable watch faces. Analysts at Gartner estimate that 41.5m smartwatches will be sold globally this year, up 19 per cent from 2016, generating $9.7bn in revenues. The consultancy predicts that smartwatches will be the second best-selling kind of wearable device by 2019, after Bluetooth headsets. Fitbit’s $130 Flyer wireless headphones, which pair automatically with Ionic watches, are designed to be workout friendly with a secure and sweat-proof design. While Flyer headphones, at $130, are cheaper than Apple’s $160 AirPods, the Ionic is at least $30 more expensive than the cheapest available Apple Watch. Gartner estimates the average selling price of a smartwatch is $223. Mr Park believes Ionic can command a premium price because of its four-day battery life (Apple Watch lasts just a day or two), improved GPS reception thanks to “nanomoulding technology” that he says is unique in wearables, and the ability to stream music from Pandora, the internet radio company. Thanks to the acquisitions of Coin and Pebble last year, Fitbit’s watch will also support third-party apps, such as Starbucks and Strava, as well as contactless payments with Visa, MasterCard and American Express cards. Although multi-day battery life means Ionic can track sleep, continuous use of both music and GPS will consume all the device’s power reserves in around 10 hours. Like the Apple Watch, Ionic’s screen remains dark until wearers raise their arm or push a button, in order to lengthen battery life. Customers can order an Ionic starting on August 28, with the first shipments arriving in late September. The device will go on general sale in October.
85;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2017-08-22T04:02:32Z;Companies scramble to combat ‘fake news’;From Starbucks to Costco, brands have come under attack from hoaxers;It is not just politicians who have cause to complain about fake news.Starbucks fell victim to fakery this month when tweets advertising “Dreamer Day”, in which the coffee chain would supposedly give out free frappuccinos to undocumented migrants in the US, spread at lightning speed online.Advertisements including the company’s logo, signature font and pictures of its drinks were circulated with the hashtag “#borderfreecoffee”. But it was dreamt up by a hoaxer.“How about we meme ‘Undocumented Immigrant Day’ at Starbucks into existence?” one user of the messaging board 4Chan had asked on August 2. “Could cripple their business a bit.”Starbucks raced to deny the event, replying to individuals on Twitter that it was “completely false” and that people had been “completely misinformed”.Yet the rapid spread of the fake news showed again the power of social platforms to damage reputations, and illustrated how companies are having to be more vigilant and creative in responding.Snopes, the factchecker, compiles a top 50 of “hot” fake news stories, and in a recent week 12 were about companies.They included false reports of Ulta, a beauty chain, closing after a buyout, an Xbox console killing a teenager and Costco, the warehouse chain, no longer selling memberships.The 4Chan user who faked the Starbucks news was politically motivated: he wrote that he was searching for a “liberal place” and said that if illegal immigrants gathered there, he would call the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Other companies have also been targeted by suspected Trump supporters, such as with the false story that Indra Nooyi, Pepsi chief executive, told the president’s supporters to “take their business elsewhere”.Much fake news is not motivated by politics, however, but by the hope of generating advertising revenue — or just attention-seeking.A few years ago, you would never imagine this was something you had to deal with. Now millions of people know about the incident because maybe someone had a bad day working in McDonald’s in KansasBrooke Binkowski, managing editor of Snopes, says: “It hurts businesses financially and it also makes things toxic for them by destroying trust and creating an atmosphere in which people don’t know who they can trust. It is the same tactics that were levelled on us as a country, really.”Companies have long had to deal with news stories that claim a “particular brand of soda causes cancer”, says Mandy Jenkins, head of news at Storyful, a social news site.But now the problems of a disgruntled customer or employee can become twisted as they are broadcast to the world.“A few years ago, you would never imagine this was something you had to deal with,” she says.“Maybe you would get a letter from a person. Now, millions of people know about the incident because maybe someone had a bad day working in McDonald’s in Kansas.”The major internet companies have introduced measures to try to slow the spread of misinformation this year. Facebook and Google have tried to cut fake news sites off from their advertising platforms, so they cannot make money.Facebook has partnered with fact-checkers such as Snopes so that users can flag any news they suspect is fake.If it is declared false by the fact-checkers, it is tagged as “disputed” and its ranking in the news feed is lowered. Twitter has systems for reporting accounts that attempt to impersonate a brand.But the platforms have not created special avenues for companies to report fake news before it potentially affects a share price or sales.PR and crisis management teams are relying on other services: Storyful now has an arm that provides business intelligence on what is being said on social media, and PR firm Weber Shandwick is marketing crisis simulation software called Firebell to prepare companies for being caught in a social media firestorm, whether it is a fake story or a presidential tweet.Leslie Gaines-Ross, Weber Shandwick’s chief reputation strategist, says companies are now realising how vigilant they must be, recruiting every employee to be their eyes and ears on social media.Monsanto has been dealing with rumours about its genetically modified crops for years. It learnt it needed to switch its focus from engaging with farmers and investors to looking at the broader internet.Vance Crowe, Monsanto’s director of millennial engagement, says he tries to stop rumours at their origin, spending time “hanging out” online with different “tribes”.“The agricultural tribe is really heavily on Twitter, they are sitting in combines and planters and listening to podcasts. Sceptics spend a lot of time on sites like Reddit and have their own YouTube channels,” he said.He does not combat the reports directly but tries to connect with “the underlying values of this tribe”.What is shared on social media is an expression of group loyalty, he said. “If you shoot at it, people don’t view that as you shooting at their idea, they view that as you shooting at their friend,” he said.Monsanto’s tactics were tested when a fake news story on WorldTruth.TV claimed that its pesticides were responsible for the microcephaly cases in Brazil, not the Zika virus.Mr Crowe said Monsanto encouraged its employees to use social media and, declaring they worked for Monsanto, represent their case to friends and contacts.The company believes that their message was distributed as effectively, if not more so, as anything that came from the company directly and it became a “point of pride” for employees, Mr Crowe said — a small win in the battle against fake news.In the days after the US election Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder and chief executive, shrugged off the influence that fake news spread on his platform could have had on Donald Trump’s victory, writes Hannah Kuchler.“It think it is a pretty crazy idea. Voters make decisions based on their lived experience,” he told the Techonomy conference.But Facebook and other large internet companies quickly changed their tune, worried that the machines they have built for the instant distribution of information work just as well, if not better, for misinformation.Google and Facebook both moved quickly to remove known fake news sites from their advertising networks, cutting off the source of income which motivated some purveyors of fake news.Inside Facebook, the company rushed to put resources into tackling the problem. Five weeks after the election it was setting up a partnership with fact-checking organisations to try to address the “worst of the worst” hoaxes spread by spammers.A month later, Facebook launched a “Journalism Project”, designed to create a “healthy news eco-system”.Accepting that not all good journalism can be funded by advertising alone, it said it would work with news publishers to help them reach new subscribers.It also made local news, which has suffered as the media industry has been disrupted by the internet, a priority.In public proclamations, Mr Zuckerberg became thoughtful about Facebook’s responsibilities to its “community”.But fighting fake news was also a business decision, said Natasha Lamb, director of equity research and shareholder engagement at Arjuna, an impact investing fund, who confronted Mr Zuckerberg about the risks of fake news at its annual shareholder meeting.She argued that fake news could impact Facebook’s reputation, with people getting “Facebook fatigue” and leaving the platform.
86;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2017-08-02T21:00:39Z;Square posts upbeat results as large sellers boost revenues;;Square shares marched higher in extended trading after the US mobile-payments company posted upbeat second quarter results thanks to large vendors.Shares in the San Francisco-based company jumped as much as 7 per cent after the close before trimming their gains to trade 1 per cent higher. The moves came after the company said it narrowed its losses to $16m or 4 cents a share in the three months ended June 30, compared with a loss of $27.3m or 8 cents a share in the year ago period.Net revenue rose nearly 26 per cent to $551.5m. Adjusted revenue – which strips out the loss of Starbucks as a client after the coffee chain transitioned off its infrastructure during the fourth quarter of last year – climbed to $240m, topping analysts’ estimates for $229.5m.However, the company led by Twitter’s Jack Dorsey said gross payment volume from large sellers, those that generate more than $125,000 a year in gross payments, increased 45 per cent from a year ago.Following the strength in the second quarter, the company boosted its outlook for adjusted full-year earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation to a range of $120m to $128m, from its previous guidance for $110m to $120m.It also expects adjusted earnings in the range of 21 to 23 cents a share, compared to its prior outlook for 16 to 20 cents.Square shares are up nearly 100 per cent so far this year. Investor sentiment has improved as the company has become a one-stop shop as it provides hardware, software and payment services to businesses.

The move would affect approximately 3,300 jobs, it said.The announcement came as Starbucks came in shy of analysts’ targets for comparable-store sales growth, a key industry metric, for the quarter ending July 2.Global comparable sales increased just 4 per cent versus the 4.8 per cent expected by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Comparable sales growth in the Americas, Starbucks’ biggest market, rose 5 per cent.It underscored concerns about Starbucks’ sales growth, even as it looks to inject some momentum by expanding its global footprint beyond its home country.On Thursday, Starbucks announced that it had paid $1.3bn to buy out the remaining 50 per cent that it did not own of its East China venture — its largest single acquisition — which will give it full ownership of 1,300 stores in its fastest-growing market outside of the US.“Starbucks leveraged food and beverage innovation, an elevated in-store experience and personalised digital connections to our customers to deliver another quarter of record financial and operating performance, despite the softness impacting our principal sectors overall,” said Kevin Johnson, who replaced Starbucks co-founder Howard Schultz as chief executive in December.Philip Morris International, which sells the brands outside the US, fell 7.5 per cent before bouncing back to end the day 0.3 per cent up at $118.51 in New York.The FDA announced a regulatory plan to stub out tobacco related disease, including lowering the amount of nicotine in cigarettes to non-addictive levels.“Although the announcement’s timing was unexpected this morning, we’ve long believed the FDA taking a more comprehensive approach toward nicotine was a natural next step,” said Bonnie Herzog at Wells Fargo Securities.“Overall, while viewed as a ‘negative’ for cigarette manufacturers, we believe this could prove to be an opportunity over the long term for reduced-risk products.”The S&P 500 ended the day down 0.1 per cent at 2,472, the Dow Jones Industrial Average nudged up 0.2 per cent to 21,830 while the Nasdaq Composite moved 0.1 per cent lower to 6,374.
88;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2017-07-28T20:27:46Z;Earnings bonanza yields mixed results for US stocks;;A jam-packed week for corporate earnings has split the fortunes of major US equities indices, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average capping a string of record closes to end with a weekly gain, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended in negative territory.The Dow picked up 0.15 per cent on Friday to 21,830.31, the third day in a row that it has marked a record closing high. The gains also pushed the index back into positive territory for the week, putting it up 1.16 per cent on the back of strong earnings from corporate stalwarts like aerospace company Boeing and a return to profitability for oil giant Chevron.Substantial drops in shares of tobacco company Altria, e-retailer Amazon and coffee chain Starbucks pushed the S&P 500 to an 0.13 per cent decline on Friday to 2,472.1. The healthcare sector led the benchmark index with an 0.5 per cent increase, while consumer staples were the biggest loser thanks to Altria’s 9 per cent fall after the FDA said it was considering limits on the level of addictive nicotine in cigarettes.Despite setting a fresh closing high on Wednesday, the S&P 500 has fallen over the latter half of the week to push it just barely into the red for the past five days, at an 0.02 per cent decline, to snap its three-week winning streak.The Nasdaq went from setting a fresh closing high on Wednesday to falling over the latter half of the week thanks to a sharp sell-off for tech stocks on Thursday. The tech-heavy index extended the slump on Friday, closing down 0.12 per cent at 6,374.67. That left it with an 0.2 per cent decline for the week, its first down week in four.The dollar index, measuring the buck against a basket of its peers, slid nearly 0.6 per cent over the past five trading days, with the bulk of the sell-off coming on Friday following the release of data showing underwhelming wage growth in the US. It’s the third weekly loss in a row for the index, which is struggling for a toehold amid the political chaos that has characterised the summer thus far.
89;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2017-07-28T14:02:00Z;Earnings laggards push US stocks lower at the open;;US stocks started on the back foot on Friday, with recent earnings disappointments from the likes of Amazon, Exxon Mobil and Starbucks helping to dampen momentum at the end of a busy week.The S&P 500 was 0.2 per cent lower at 2,470, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq narrowed earlier losses to trade down 0.24 per cent at 6,366. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.1 per cent to 21,773.Some of the biggest losers included e-commerce giant Amazon, which fell 3.5 per cent after it reported Thursday evening that its profits had fallen to a seven-quarter low and predicted a loss of as much as $400m for the third quarter. Energy giant Exxon was down almost 3 per cent after earnings early Friday failed to clear the high bar set by Wall Street, and coffee chain Starbucks dropped 7.5 per cent after quarterly same-store sales growth missed analysts’ estimates and it announced the closure of all of its tea-focused Teavana stores.The stock slump comes a day after a sudden tech sell-off knocked the S&P 500 and Nasdaq off of fresh highs while largely sparing the Dow, which had set a new record closing high on Thursday.The US dollar index, measuring the greenback against a basket of other currencies, gave up some of its losses from earlier after data showed that the rate of US growth had accelerated less than expected in the second quarter, narrowing its previous 0.5 per cent drop to 0.34 per cent to 93.54. while yields on the 10-year US Treasury note ticked slightly downwards to put it at 2.30 per cent.
90;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks to close Teavana stores, citing poor performance;;Starbucks said Thursday it will close all of its Teavana stores, citing persistent underperformance at the primarily mall-based, tea-focused shops.The company said that it plans to close all 379 stores over the coming year, the majority happening by spring 2018. The move will affect approximately 3,300 jobs, it said.The announcement came as Starbucks came in shy of analysts’ targets for comparable-store sales growth, a key industry metric, for the quarter ending July 2. Global comp sales increased just 4 per cent, versus the 4.8 per cent expected by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Comp sales growth in the Americas, Starbucks’ biggest market, rose 5 per cent, boosted by a 5 per cent rise in the average ticket.The underwhelming figure underscores concerns about Starbucks’ sales growth, even as it looks to inject some momentum by expanding its global footprint beyond its home country.On Thursday, Starbucks announced that it had paid $1.3bn to buy out the remaining 50 per cent it did not own of its East China venture — its largest-ever single acquisition — which will give it full ownership of 1,300 stores in its fastest-growing market outside of the US.Earnings per share for the quarter were 47 cents, a 7.8 per cent decline versus the same period a year earlier. Adjusted for special items, earnings per share clocked in at 55 cents. Revenue came in at $5.7bn, while net earnings attributable to Starbucks fell 8.3 per cent year-over-year to $691.6.Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected earnings of 55 cents per share on sales of $5.75bn, and net income of $801.6m.The Seattle, Washington-based chain has also been aiming to boost mobile orders. During the quarter, mobile payment increased to 30 per cent of all transactions in US company-operated stores, it said.After gaining more than 2.5 per cent in Thursday trading following the China acquisition, Starbucks shares were flat in after-hours trading.Kevin Johnson, who replaced Starbucks co-founder Howard Schultz as chief executive in December, said in a statement:“Starbucks leveraged food and beverage innovation, an elevated in-store experience and personalized digital connections to our customers to deliver another quarter of record financial and operating performance, despite the softness impacting our principal sectors overall. Continued focus on execution against our strategic priorities enabled us to gain share and positions us well for the future.”
91;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2017-07-27T15:18:06Z;Starbucks takes control of East China joint venture in $1.3bn deal;;Starbucks is ramping up its focus on its fastest-growing market outside of the US with a $1.3bn deal that will see it take full ownership in about 1,300 stores in China, the largest ever single acquisition in the coffee chain’s history.Starbucks announced the deal on Thursday, ahead of quarterly earnings scheduled for later in the day. The Seattle, Washington-based company said it would buy the remaining 50 per cent share of its East China business from long-time partners Uni-President Enterprises Corporation and President Chain Store Corporation. That will give Starbucks full ownership of 1,300 stores in the Shanghai and Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces.Meanwhile, those partner companies will buy Starbucks’ 50 per cent stake in its Taiwan joint venture. The $175m price tag will give those companies full control over Starbucks operations in Taiwan, where there are more than 400 outposts.Starbucks chief executive Kevin Johnson said:“Unifying the Starbucks business under a full company-operated structure in China reinforces our commitment to the market and is a firm demonstration of our confidence in the current local leadership team as we aim to grow from 2,800 to more than 5,000 stores by 2021. Similar to our decision in 2011 to fully license our Hong Kong and Macau market operations, we are pleased to transition our business in the Taiwan market to our long-time partners Uni-President Enterprises Corporation and President Chain Store Corporation, both highly recognized local operators, as we continue to grow in Taiwan. This is a critical next-step as we advance our multifaceted China growth strategy for long-term profitable growth in Asia.”China is Starbucks’ fastest-growing market outside of the US by store count, with nearly 600 stores in Shanghai alone — the largest number of stores in any city with a Starbucks presence, the company said.The deals are expected to close in early 2018 subject to regulatory approval.Starbucks has been struggling in recent quarters to buck slowing sales growth, particularly in its home country, even as it expands its footprint globally. Its shares were up 1.3 per cent Thursday morning, even as its shares have remain mired over the past 12 months with just an 0.26 per cent increase.
92;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2017-07-16T09:49:47Z;How I lost my 25-year battle against corporate claptrap;The exponential rise of guff in business shows no sign of abating;"For nearly a quarter of a century, I have been writing columns telling business people to stop talking rot. For the same amount of time they have been taking no notice.The first example I can find comes from 1994 when I wrote an article mocking ugly business jargon, arguing that language had got so stupid that the pendulum must soon swing back and plain talking about business would shortly reassert itself. The words I objected to back then? Global, downsize, marketplace and worst of all, the mathematically nonsensical “110 per cent committed”.What an innocent age that was.Fast forward to July 2017, and an entrepreneur sits down to write a blog post about his company. “We are focused 1,000,000% on positive, move forward, actionable efforts to help facilitate change.” When someone sent me this bilge last week, I read it and shrugged.Over the past two decades, two things have happened. Business bullshit has got a million per cent more bullshitty, and I’ve stopped predicting a correction in the marketplace. I’m 110 per cent sure there won’t be one.Not only has production risen in aggregate, the worst individual offenders have gone on surpassing themselves, oblivious to my attempts to shame them into stopping.Howard Schultz is a champion in the bullshit space. The Starbucks executive chairman has provided me with more material for columns than any other executive alive or dead. Yet he is still at it, and still out-doing himself. Earlier this year, he announced that the new Starbucks Roasteries were “delivering an immersive, ultra-premium, coffee-forward experience”.In this ultra-premium, jargon-forward twaddle, the only acceptable word is “an”. Mr Schultz has brewed up a blend of old and new jargon, the fashionable and the workaday, adding a special topping of his own. “Delivering” and “experience” are grim but not new. “Ultra-premium” is needless word inflation. “Immersive” is fashionable, though ill-advised if you are talking about scalding liquids. The innovation is “coffee-forward”. Sounds fantastic, but what is it?Guff-talkers will never change. Or rather, there is nothing candidly in my sightline that would suggest that good sense will resume going forwardQuite possibly Mr Schultz does not read the Financial Times and the people close to him who do read it desist from forwarding to him articles that mock how he speaks. But even if he had seen the columns, I doubt they would have made a jot of difference.The business world is divided into two kinds of people. There are those who talk tosh (the majority) and those who do not. The defining characteristic of dedicated tosh-talkers like Mr Schultz is they simply do not see a problem with it.And why should they? While I have spent decades getting steamed up about mere words he has been making a difference to the way half the world lives and drinks. It is largely thanks to him that we all wander around the streets carrying cardboard buckets of pale brown stuff that we slurp through plastic lids. Not only has Mr Schultz made this difference, he has made some money, too. About $3.1bn, in fact.Talking rot has not only done him no harm, I fear it may have helped him. The new “roasteries” have an exceptionally vulgar Willy Wonka-style decor with beans whizzing around in see-through pipes. When the style is all hype, the language needs to match.Over the years, Mr Schultz has consistently proved just how bad language serves business people well. So when an analyst asks if you are going to acquire anything, you can either say no, which is a bit too bald and clear, or you can say 34 words instead, as he did a few years ago: “I would say that we have enough to digest in the near-term, and there’s nothing candidly in our sightline that would suggest that we’re involved in engaging anything that we’re going to acquire.”Bingo. The audience will be so bored, you will never get called to account.FT.com will be compiling some of readers’ favourite Lucy Kellaway columns in the next week. Please nominate one, or several, in the comments section belowEven more impressively, he has shown the way in the upping of the emotional ante. Money can’t buy you love, but love can compensate for not much money. Thus, he recently sent an email to the 100,000 or so US staff, most of whom he has never met and many of whom earn about $10 an hour, with the sign-off “know that I send you my love and respect”.Guff-talkers will never change. Or rather, there is nothing candidly in my sightline that would suggest that good sense will resume going forward.But this doesn’t make my past few decades spent campaigning an unmitigated failure. The few people who don’t talk rot get vast pleasure in mocking those who do. These brave and simple few have been sending me examples over the years, some of which are reprinted below. I don’t love FT readers, but I do respect and thank all those who have furnished me with such riches.Over the past month, I have been rummaging through the collection of business bullshit that I have built up over the past couple of decades with a view to republishing some of the finest exhibits. But as I studied the archive it occurred to me that all languages have their own rules — and guff is no exception. Here, I reveal the top eight rules, along with some splendid examples of how to follow them.If the first principle of journalism is to simplify then exaggerate, so the first rule of guff is complicate then obfuscate.An HR manager running an off-site meeting showed how it was done last year by warning attendees to “be cognizant of the optics of your personal brand”. In other words: tuck your shirts in.Management consultants have been world class at touting for business this way, inventing problems and then offering to solve them.A decade ago, Accenture demonstrated how to turn the banal into the portentous: “With the rise of the multi-polar world, the task of finding and managing talent has become more complex, turbulent and contradictory.” Never mind that the world has only two poles, and that finding good people is no harder than ever, Accenture added value by subtracting sense.The interesting thing about obfuscating/complicating is that it can be done with only a couple of words.The best ever title of a research paper: Robustifying Learnability — a 2005 report from the Federal Reserve.In guff, all negatives are spun, so no one need take full blame for anything. Uber has done pioneering work in the past few months by producing language so ugly and boring that the audience can only respond by switching off.The company has variously admitted to having “underinvested in the driver experience” and being “in a reputational deficit”, in the hope that no one will notice it has screwed its drivers and its name is mud.Rule 2 is handy when companies sack people. The latest euphemism comes from an investment management company that recently described sackings as going “into the gym . . . inducing cell renewal and thus making the company fit for profitable growth”.Though horrible, this is nothing on how EY got rid of a number of partners by sending a message around saying “we look forward to strengthening our alumni network”.Not all companies get it right. In 2013, HSBC announced it would be “ demising” the roles of 942 relationship managers, forgetting that the whole point of a euphemism is that you take something horrid and make it sound better.HSBC took something bad (sacking people) and made it sound considerably worse, as if it was not only depriving people of their livelihoods but actually killing them.One of the charms of guff is its syntactic flexibility — all nouns can be verbs and vice versa. Oscar Munoz made great use of this rule when he talked of “ deplaning” a man who was manhandled roughly off one of his United aircraft in April.Other great examples of nerbing and vouning fill the archive: to cold towel; a global touch-base; to effort; to front-burnerize; to town hall; to potentiate; to future; to value add; to bonus well.But my favourite came from a manager who, in trying to draft a memo, said: “There must be a better way to language it.” He’s right. There must.It all started in 2003 when the late Jimmy Lee sent an email to everyone in his corporate finance department at JPMorgan, saying: “Call a client and tell them you love them. They won’t forget that you made this call.”In the years since then, Irene Rosenfeld of Kraft has described herself as the “CEO of Joy”, while John Cahill, global CEO of McCann Health, has said: “Doubling down on our humanness will be the magic in how we drive better outcomes.”When it comes to ratcheting up the emotion, millennials are particularly gifted. A twenty-something Estée Lauder employee was recently quoted in the Financial Times: “Senior leadership was ecstatic about the level of ideation that came from this session.” This, I fear, bodes ill for us all. Passion, it would seem, is no longer enough. Ecstasy is the next frontier.Over the years, Toyota has renamed the car a “sustainable mobility solution”; Amazon has called the book a “reading container”; Speedo has rebranded the swimming cap a “hair management system” and a Nestlé bottle of water has been described as an “affordable, portable lifestyle beverage”. This rule is the most baffling of the lot as there is no reason for it.Make up your own by stitching together two or more existing ones.The greatest ever example of this was Eversheds, a frumpy law firm, which in 2007, tried to appeal to young recruits by looking for “knowlivators, innovateers, performibutors, proactilopers, prioricators and winnomats” — the last being a particularly unwinning combination of winners and diplomats.Rick Hamada, CEO of Avnet, is a master at this: “Drilling down one more click on services, we actually think of multiple swim lanes of opportunity around business.” However, he is not quite as good as the following management consultant: “You have to appreciate that the milestones we have set in these swim lanes provide a road map for this flow chart. When we get to toll gates, we’ll assess where you sit in the waterfall . . . ”The most lethal new language is not a mass of robustifying learnability. It is simpler but no less confusing.You use short, well-known words, but the catch is you use them to mean something different. The word of the moment is “play”.Strategy consultants pose the questions to gormless clients: Where to play? How to win? And fashionable business people refer to working activities as playbooks and playlists. On the lips of guff speakers, play does not mean play. It means work.The most gifted guff giants don’t use all the rules, but pick the ones that suit them best. My following three eternal favourites are great in different ways, but all deserve prizes: I am medalling (nerb) all of them.Bronze goes to Rob Stone, co-CEO of advertising agency Cornerstone, for heroically mixing cliché, metaphor and hot air to say nothing: “As brands build out a world footprint, they look for the no-holds-barred global POV that’s always been part of our wheelhouse.”Silver belongs to Angela Ahrendts who, in a Burberry annual report, wrote the most mysterious sentence ever composed in the English language: “In the wholesale channel, Burberry exited doors not aligned with brand status and invested in presentation through both enhanced assortments and dedicated, customised real estate in key doors.”I have showed it to many business experts over the years, but no one has ever been able to say what it means or explain why a raincoat maker could be talking so intently about doors.The runaway winner and deserved gold medallist is John Chambers who, while CEO of Cisco, fired off an email to underlings beginning “Team”, and ending: “We’ll wake the world up and move the planet a little closer to the future.”He has used plain words and simple syntax to produce the most terrifying piece of bullshit ever.In the four years since he said that the planet seems to have been reaching the future quite happily on its own, without the assistance of Mr Chambers or anyone else at Cisco.lucy.kellaway@ft.com

93;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Wedbush dims view on Starbucks with cut to ‘neutral’;;Starbucks was cut on Wednesday to “neutral” by analysts at Wedbush, who reckon the coffee chain’s recent outperformance has nearly run its course.Like-for-like sales in the Americas, Starbucks’s biggest market, are set for a “modest acceleration” to about 5 per cent in the current fiscal quarter, a tad weaker than the Wall Street forecast of 5.3 per cent, said Nick Setyan, a Wedbush analyst.While that would represent a rise from the 3 per cent rate logged in the previous two quarters, the pick-up has largely been priced into the shares, Mr Setyan said. Starbucks has ripped higher since March 14 by 12.3 per cent, hitting fresh record highs along the way and far outpacing the S&P 500′s 3.2 per cent rise.Mr Setyan said he expects the shares to rise to $65 over the next 12 months, from Tuesday’s closing level of $60.92. He reduced his outlook from “outperform”.That makes Wedbush just the sixth investment bank to have a “neutral” rating on Starbucks, compared with 28 “overweight” ratings, and no “sell” ratings, according to Bloomberg data.Starbucks shares slipped 0.85 per cent in pre-market action.
94;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2017-04-28T20:54:20Z;Starbucks shares slide as sales metric disappoints;Coffee chain underperforms the wider stock market as sales growth misses expectations;Starbucks saw its shares slide on Friday after a key sales metric at the coffee chain grew at a slower pace than Wall Street analysts had forecast.Shares in the Seattle-based company fell 2 per cent to $60.06 on Friday after the company said that like-for-like sales, a key industry metric, had risen 3 per cent in the second quarter. That was shy of analysts’ estimates of a 3.6 per cent rise.Meanwhile, revenues rose 6 per cent to a record $5.3bn, but missed Wall Street estimates of $5.4bn. Starbucks said that profits had risen to $652.8m, or 45 cents a share, compared with $575.1m, or 39 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Adjusting for one-time items, the company reported earnings of 45 cents a share in line with estimates.The results come after Starbucks’ shares took a hit last year as the company struggled to maintain sales momentum and after its long-time chief executive Howard Schultz announced that he would he stepping down, though he still retained his title as executive chairman.The coffee chain has also been unable to escape broader retail distress, reporting declining performance in 350 mall-based Teavana stores, the tea company acquired by Starbucks in 2012.Industry tracker NPD projects that US restaurant industry traffic is likely to remain stalled this year, much like 2016.To help shore up sales, Starbucks has been turning to its membership programme and the latest quarterly results show that active US membership in Starbucks Rewards rose 11 per cent from a year ago to 13.3m members, and the programme accounted for 36 per cent of US company-operated sales.Starbucks drew both praise and some criticism from customers in January when Mr Schultz pledged to hire 10,000 refugees from around the world over five years after Donald Trump, US president, signed an executive order imposing a travel ban on predominantly Muslim countries.According to Bonnie Herzog, a managing director in equity research at Wells Fargo Securities, the company, “is increasing its planned spend on value creating investments (a good thing in our view), and is negatively impacted in one of the worst retail environments in recent history by poor results of 350 stores (out of 26K globally) — all in all, nothing to be overly concerned about in our view”.Elsewhere on Friday, Goodyear Tire & Rubber reported earnings of 65 cents a share, beating Wall Street’s estimate but falling short of results for the same period for last year of 68 cents per share.The company’s stock price rose 2.2 per cent to $36.23, continuing its strong performance this year that has seen it climb almost 18 per cent.The broader S&P 500 index dipped 0.2 per cent to 2,384.20, rounding out a mixed week following investor disappointment of the Trump administration’s proposed tax reforms. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 20,940.51 and the Nasdaq Composite was flat at 6,047.61.

In the domestic market, Starbucks has been turning to its membership programme to help shore up sales.Indeed, the latest quarterly results show that active US membership in Starbucks Rewards rose 11 per cent from a year ago to 13.3m members and the programme accounted for 36 per cent of US company-operated sales.But the coffee-chain continues to face stiff competition from Dunkin Donuts and McDonald’s at the low end and premium coffee-roasters like La Colombe, Stumptown and Blue Bottle.Starbucks was also upbraided by some customers in January after its Mr Schultz pledged to hire 10,000 refugees around the world over five years after US president Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing a travel ban on predominantly Muslim countries.
96;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2017-04-25T16:24:53Z;Whitbread: flat white;Slowing sales at Costa dampen talk of a spin-off;For a country so beholden to social snobbery, the UK is surprisingly egalitarian about its coffee. In each of the past seven years, value brand Costa has been voted the nation’s favourite. Its success has led investors to implore owner Whitbread to spin the chain off. This year, they may be glad it demurred.Consumers have started to listen to those personal finance types who chastise them about spending £2 on a daily latte (over £700 a year, they gasp). Rising inflation and flat wages are pressing on disposable incomes. Whitbread said on Tuesday that same-store sales at Costa fell 0.8 per cent in the 13 weeks to 2 March.That dip helped take the shine off full-year results that showed sales across Whitbread up 8.2 per cent and adjusted earnings up 5 per cent. Investors already knew retail sales on British high streets were on a downward trend. They were waiting to see if a price rise in Costa stores would even things out. Turns out it did not.The case for separating Costa Coffee from stablemate Premier Inn & Restaurants has not disappeared altogether. Chief executive Alison Brittain has acknowledged in the past that the topic has been discussed. And there is reason to think that the market values the two brands at less than the sum of their parts.Whitbread shares trade at 16 times earnings — below European hospitality peers. If Costa and Premier Inn & Restaurants were prised apart and compared to their respective sectors, their shares might well be valued differently. Starbucks, for example, trades at 28 times earnings. Hotel group Accor is at around 22 times. Apply those multiples to Costa and Premier Inn earnings and their respective shares might be worth 16 and £38. The theoretical combined price of over £54 a share compares to Whitbread’s current price of £40.The two sides of the business share relatively few synergies. But Premier Inns is still growing and has a careful plan to forge into Germany.

97;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2017-04-21T04:01:28Z;A crowded global jobs market is braced for 1bn more workers;Anti-poverty targets will be missed unless future generations can find work;For those working in development, the figures look daunting. About 40m jobs a year must be created until 2030 to keep pace with the growth of the world’s working-age population, according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO).The World Bank also warns of a large jobs shortfall. “Between 600m and 1bn people are entering the labour market between now and 2030, and the pace of job creation isn’t nearly as fast,” says Mattias Lundberg, senior employment economist and director of the bank’s youth employment global partnership.In 2015, 193 countries signed up to the United Nations’ sustainable development goals (SDGs), including goal eight, which promises to “promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all”. The stakes could hardly be higher. Economic growth underpins many of the 17 SDGs, from eliminating hunger to improving healthcare and access to education.“The overall goal of ending poverty by 2030 will not happen unless young people are earning their way into a livelihood,” says William Reese, president and chief executive of the Baltimore-based International Youth Foundation.A large proportion of the world’s unemployed are young and the situation is often worse for women. In northern Africa, for example, 30 per cent of the total youth population is out of work, while among young women the rate is 45 per cent, according to the ILO.Development experts are questioning the extent to which goal eight can alone be the catalyst for change. Mr Lundberg says it is difficult “to attribute any observed changes” to the SDGs. But others say goal eight provides an important framework for governments. “There will be a process,” says Felix Dodds, a fellow at the University of North Carolina’s Global Research Institute and co-author of Negotiating the Sustainable Development Goals. “[States] will know if they’re moving in the right direction.”Goal eight may seem utopian in its reach, but Jasmine Nahhas di Florio, senior vice-president for strategy and partnerships at Education for Employment (EFE), says its scope will help non-profit organisations to work with governments and large development agencies.EFE, a US-based social enterprise, aims to create tens of thousands of jobs for young people in the Middle East and north Africa. “The only way we can do that is by co-ordinating with government and multilateral agencies,” says Ms di Florio. “Goal eight is now on their agenda and when we can align with national policies we are more effective.”William Savedoff, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Center for Global Development, agrees: “These goals become tools and governments use them to mobilise support and focus attention.” Mr Savedoff argues that there can be no expansion in the number of jobs without economic growth. “So the best programmes are those that set the context for economic growth,” he says.However, previous attempts to create work have not always been successful. The UK charity Peace Child International has highlighted some of the potential pitfalls in its Youth Job Creation policy primer, prepared for the Parliamentary Network on the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.Jobs created through wage subsidies, for example, may disappear when those subsidies end. Efforts can also backfire if employers shed existing workers and hire subsidised ones.Job guarantees, a policy tool wherein the state promises to hire unemployed workers, are expensive for governments and do not address the structural causes of unemployment.Even seemingly promising schemes can go awry if they are not well targeted. In a recent review of UK apprenticeships, for example, a parliamentary select committee found such efforts lacked focus and would not fill skills gaps “unless they concentrate on sectors and regions where training is most needed”.Some argue that governments must look beyond technical training for young people and focus on fostering skills such as effective communication and teamwork. Mr Lundberg of the World Bank says that technical and vocational training can often be “very much 19th century, and we are no longer in a 19th century labour market”.Persistent mismatches of supply and demand also mean young people are unable to find jobs while companies are unable to fill posts. Instead, some suggest changing expectations of both bosses and potential workers.Ms di Florio cites the hospitality industry’s difficulties in hiring young people, as hoteliers want English-speaking graduates while the entry-level jobs on offer do not always appeal to them.“A young person who fits that profile is not going to want that job and the person who wants that job isn’t going to have that profile,” she says. But demonstrating to graduates that an entry-level job can lead to a career in management might attract them, she says.Another approach is to start with the employers. The Rockefeller Foundation, when researching ways to tackle youth unemployment, assessed labour demand rather than supply and the processes that companies used to hire employees. It found CVs and other traditional recruitment techniques did not always identify applicants’ potential, particularly for entry-level jobs.The foundation applied the results of its research to its work with companies such as Starbucks, Walmart and JPMorgan Chase on the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative, a coalition of US employers focused on youth job creation. The foundation uses what it calls “impact hiring”, which includes using data and analytics to assess workers’ potential and recruit from diverse talent pools.But even as governments strive to work towards SDG eight, another challenge is looming — the prospect of technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics wiping out millions of jobs.Governments have begun looking to the future as they think about job creation. For example, one of the areas being examined by Policy Horizons Canada, a government research service, is how evolution in the digital economy might change the nature of work over the next 10 to 15 years.Mr Dodds of UNC sees this type of analysis as critical. However, it is still the exception rather than the rule, he says: “Governments aren’t thinking enough about the future. This will be on our doorstep extremely quickly.”
98;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2017-03-22T18:09:18Z;Howard Schultz for US president?;The Starbucks founder’s farewell message as boss sounds a lot like a stump speech;"Starbucks’ annual meeting, during which founder Howard Schultz will give his last speech as chief executive, is being positioned as a celebration of the company’s quarter century of growth and a handover of leadership to incoming chief executive Kevin Johnson.The real story is whether Mr Schultz is positioning himself as a business-friendly Democratic presidential candidate for 2020.While Mr Schultz says he “has no plans” to run for office, he believes that in his post-Starbucks’ future he has “a role to play to elevate the national conversation, both in the US and around the world”, on issues like economic bifurcation, racial tension, populism and the role of the private sector in fostering more sustainable and inclusive growth.“We’re living in a fragile world,” says Mr Schultz. “There’s a need for more passionate government.”Certainly, his Wednesday address sounded more like a stump speech than a message to investors; it was filled with references not to gluten-free baked goods but “rising nationalism”, the need for “shared values” and a call to build “a great and enduring America”. Messrs Schultz and Johnson highlighted the company’s hiring of at-risk groups like socio-economically disadvantaged youth, veterans, military spouses and refugees, as well as the corporate commitments to areas such as healthcare and education.It was a patriotic distraction from the fact that the company’s share price is down from last year’s annual meeting, as investors worry about whether Mr Johnson can fill the Venti shoes of the company’s founder. The last time Mr Schultz left, in 2000, it faltered during a too-rapid expansion and he had to return eight years later to fix things.But it also highlights two key points. First, Mr Schultz has been contemplating a post-private sector future in politics for years. When Michael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York, was considering a presidential run, the two discussed the political opportunities and challenges for a businessman president. During the 2013 government shutdown, Mr Schultz began to worry about the effect of partisan politics on the economy, even speaking to President Barack Obama about Starbucks’ sales, which dropped significantly following that event.Mr Schultz believes that economic and political bifurcation in America has led to a more “fragile” consumer, one ready to zip up their wallet at the first sign of uncertainty. Economic research shows that consumer behaviour tends to become ingrained during seismic events, which explains the frugality of those who grew up during the Depression or the economic optimism of baby boomers.Mr Schultz believes millennial consumers may be more skittish for life, which is one reason he has focused so much in his own business on safety nets like healthcare benefits, education and targeted hiring. He will freely admit, in a nation of latte makers and latte buyers, that his business depends on there being more of the latter.That outlook, which to some extent mirrors the Lawrence Summers’ “secular stagnation” view of the economy, presents an interesting political opportunity for Mr Schultz. In many ways, he is very much a Clinton-style liberal: both pro-business and globalist. The company does its share of tax optimisation and has returned $10bn to shareholders through share buybacks and dividend payments. Mr Schultz regularly meets government officials in China, where the company is opening a store a day, as well as European technocrats such as Mario Monti, the former Italian prime minister.But he’s also a child from the east New York social-housing projects, with a common touch that is much more Bill than Hillary Clinton. His diverse fan base includes everyone from far-rightwing tax reform advocate Grover Norquist, who lauds the efforts of firms like Starbucks to offer free online education as a new kind of “business federalism”, to standard issue West Coast liberals such as entertainment mogul David Geffen. And he’s a billionaire with 90mn customers coming into his stores each week. Not a bad platform for (another) businessman president.rana.foroohar@ft.com"
99;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2017-03-17T05:00:48Z;Burgers and microchips on the menu for US fast-food chains;Introducing robots to an industry that employs 11m people is proving far from simple;"At Zume Pizza in Mountain View, California, Pepe squirts tomato sauce on to a pizza base before his colleague Marta spreads it; Noel has 22 seconds to correct any imperfections and add cheese and other toppings, after which Bruno takes the pizza from the line and places it in the oven.But on this production line, only Noel is human. The others — anthropomorphised by name only — are machines conducting tasks usually performed by people. “It’s about reallocating people’s time to do the more creative stuff,” says Julia Collins, co-founder of the start-up. Zume’s 75 human employees are paid an average $18 an hour and are offered coding classes, as the business uses a range of technology including artificial intelligence to predict delivery routes. After about a year in business, Ms Collins expects Zume to turn a gross profit in April. Yet automating the $783bn a year US food service industry is not as simple as replacing people with machines. “It’s a balance of humans and robots. It’s not about being fully automated as food won’t allow that,” says Ms Collins.Plenty of automation has already occurred at restaurant chains, while Royal Caribbean Cruises has even started employing a robot bartender — principally for novelty value. But most advances have focused on ordering and payments, where pizza companies such as Domino’s Pizza and café chains like Panera and Starbucks have taken the lead. Food preparation, by contrast, has proved harder to automate fully, particularly in an era where customisation is king and consumers are choosing quality over price. Older and larger companies must also convince investors that taking a gamble on new technology is going to be worth it, and so have sometimes lagged behind younger, more nimble rivals.Job figures and the success of the Fight for $15 campaign to raise minimum wages supports this more nuanced reality. Employment in food service, which includes catering, and drinking establishments increased 21 per cent to more than 11m in the decade to November, government statistics show. The National Restaurant Association expects another 1.7m restaurant jobs alone to be created by 2026.The NRA warned last month that the industry — the biggest employer of immigrants in the US — would rely increasingly on foreign labour to expand given the tightening job market, potentially a problem if the Trump administration makes good on its promise to restrict immigration.Blaine Hurst, president of Panera says that while automation “does drive some labour efficiencies”, the company has increased staffing in its kitchens and restaurants “because of the higher volumes and demand” resulting from the digitisation of ordering and payments. “I’ve been in tech for 45 years, so I’ve seen the evolution . . . the final step of prepping food and making sure the food is done well is going to require humans for some time to come.” Digital orders account for nearly a quarter of the total at Panera, the most in the industry after pizza groups such as Domino’s, which stands at about 50 per cent. Mr Hurst notes that about 60 per cent of mistakes in ordering are made by cashiers, so automating this function has eliminated errors.Online ordering and payments also allow companies to collect data, enabling them offer more personalised experiences and products, while apps let customers track their orders and delivery.Domino’s has placed intense focus on digitising the ordering and payment process, which customers can access via smartwatches, televisions, Ford cars and its “zero-click” app, which automatically places a saved order when it is opened.As it dabbles in delivery experiments, and automates inventory collection and other kitchen-related tasks, Domino’s is “constantly” recruiting software and data engineers and statisticians, says chief information officer Kevin Vasconi. But, he adds that the pizza’s taste is more important. “Great tech does not sell mediocre products”.Like Mr Hurst, he says that voice is the next frontier for ordering and payments. While there are limitations, often associated with accents, dialects and phrasing, Domino’s says it is “heavily investing” in voice technology, while Starbucks this year added voice capability to its ordering app.“As early as five years [from now], most of us will talk to our computers rather than use touch devices. It’s how humans have communicated for thousands and thousands of years,” says Mr Vasconi.But some brands have taken a more cautious approach to automation. McDonald’s, the world’s largest fast-food chain by sales, will this year finally launch a mobile order and pay app. It says it is learning from rivals’ hiccups, such as long queues at Starbucks’ pick-up counters.Analysts point out that for some large and older chains, there can be technological obstacles to adopting new technology.“Some restaurants have multiple legacy point of sale systems within the same fleet of stores. Given the lack of standardisation and age of these systems, the investment to upgrade can be significant and take time,” says Dylan Bolden, a senior partner at BCG. “To make matters more challenging, because many restaurants are franchised, they can’t make upgrade decisions alone and need to convince their franchisees of the business case.”Consumers are another reason why robots are not being rolled out faster. Mehdi Miremadi, a partner at McKinsey, argues that automation in the kitchen is potentially being slowed by the trend towards personalising orders and opting for quality ingredients, so any robot able to handle such complexity may take longer to develop.“For a long time, the fast food industry competed over being cheaper, cheaper, cheaper. If that trend had continued, I’d hypothesise that benefits automation in the coming decades,” he says. But because pricing is becoming less important “consumer priorities will have a significant impact on the adoption of automation”.For older and larger companies with a sharper eye on margins, the costs associated with developing and using sophisticated robots may need to come down before they are more widely used.Take Royal Caribbean’s robotic bartender. It can handle up to 30 different ingredients, and produces a drink a minute per arm or 120 cocktails an hour. The company introduced the popular feature in 2014 but has no plans to integrate it into its main bar areas or replace human bartenders.Taste is one reason why. In blind tests, 90 per cent of the time, human mixologists are voted as creating the tastiest drinks, says Karl Brenner, RCL’s director of guest beverage operations.“To be honest it’s all about novelty and nothing to do with going further down the lane with robotic arms,” says Mr Brenner, who adds that the company plans to roll out robotic waiters “to have a little bit of fun”.While customers are increasingly tied to mobile devices and many love the novelty of robots, most still want the human touch.This is apparent at Café X, a robotic coffee kiosk in San Francisco established by Henry Hu. He aims to remove the repetitive tasks of coffee making by using a robotic arm to move each cup from a stack to the coffee machine and then to the customer, making an equally tasty brew as a trained barista but in less timeOn a recent visit to the kiosk, Ryan Sepanski says the espresso he ordered is just as good as the handmade equivalent at Peet’s, the local chain whose beans Café X uses and is coincidentally his former employer. While he says the machine delivered the espresso quickly and with the “perfect amount of sugar”, he sees the elaborate set-up as little more than a “cute gimmick” that could not replace a human coffee maker for “maybe 100 years”.“All the robot is doing is grabbing the cup and bringing it to you,” Mr Sepanski says. “The baristas are pretty safe.” Additional reporting by Tim Bradshaw in San FranciscoThe race is on to automate food delivery — spurred by growing demand for door-to-door service. But driverless cars or bicycles will not necessarily be the de facto solution. Instead, two members of the founding team of Skype — Ahti Heinla and Janus Friis — are betting that their autonomous delivery machine could be the device of choice for restaurants across the globe. The vehicle, which looks like an office printer on wheels, travels on pavements using GPS tracking, computer vision and object detection technology, within a 3 mile radius of its base, and can carry up to 10kg of groceries or hot meals for a cost of £1.Starship Technologies’ vehicles have been tested in 59 cities including London, where it has its headquarters, partnering with JustEat, while Virginia last month became the first US state to allow automated delivery devices on pavements.While the jury is still out on these “ground drones”, Panera’s president Blaine Hurst is not convinced that aerial drones, which both Amazon and Walmart are testing, will be the answer to autonomous delivery.“Drones don’t like to fly in stormy weather and my best delivery sales are in stormy weather,” Mr Hurst says. “We call it raining pennies from heaven.”Domino’s chief information officer Kevin Vasconi says he is “very bullish” on the use of driverless cars in his industry but sees the company striking partnerships with autonomous companies while developing technology to augment the delivery process in-house.“I can’t imagine a world where we’d be building our own Domino’s vehicle. At the same time . . . how to dispatch, route, load and unload are probably things to potentially work on,” he says."
100;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2017-02-28T17:24:43Z;Starbucks’s shot at selling espresso to the Italians;Seattle coffee chain seeks taste of ‘la dolce vita’ with upmarket push in Milan;Starbucks has unveiled the site of the Seattle group’s first coffee bar in Italy in a daring attempt to sell espresso back to the Italians and tap into Italy’s dolce vita to boost the brand’s premium offering back home in the US.The world’s largest coffee chain will open its first premium “Roastery” outlet outside the US and China in Italy’s business capital, which has sparked lively local debate about whether the arrival threatens the traditional “mom and pop” coffee bars. At 25,500 square feet, the Starbucks Roastery, in size at least, has no local equivalent.Before an audience of top Italian entrepreneurs from the fashion and food industries, Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz, who attributes his original idea for the chain to a visit to Milan and Verona in 1983, said it was the “culmination of a great dream”.“There has always been a missing link to the success we have had and the growth and development we have had because we have not entered Italy,” he said, beneath frescoes at Milan’s City Hall flanked by mayor Giuseppe Sala.The site will be the former headquarters of Italy’s national post office in the city, a sprawling Liberty-style building minutes’ walk from the city centre Piazza del Duomo.The Roastery is Starbucks’ premium offering, designed to cater to well-heeled consumers that are driving sales of niche, artisan goods. It serves small batch “Reserve” coffees in a variety of brewing methods.Starbucks plans to open 20 Roasteries in coming years around the world. The company says that customers spend about four times the amount per visit in the premium coffee and food outlets, which offer higher margins than its original stores. It also plans to open 1,000 premium “Reserve” stores.The unveiling of Starbucks’ first Italian location comes as the company continues its expansion overseas. Mr Schultz will step aside as chief executive in April to focus on the expansion of Starbucks’ premium brand of stores.Starbucks will sell local Milan produce from the Princi bakery, including brioches, croissants, cookies and bread in all its Roasteries worldwide.Rocco Princi, a well-known Milan baker, who has created a chain of stores selling freshly baked goods and coffee, said he had been asked by investors from “China, India, America” to buy his brand and had refused. But he was convinced by Mr Schultz’s Roastery concept after being flown out to Seattle to see it.As well as Princi food, the Roasteries will also offer early evening “mixology” of cocktails, a nod to Milan’s local after-work aperitivo culture.Starbucks’ arrival in Italy has been mooted for more than five years. Mr Schultz said the Milan Roastery was planned as the first of many stores in the country, with property already earmarked for more stores in Milan.Brunello Cucinelli, billionaire founder behind the eponymous luxury brand, told the FT he did not believe the Roastery would have “any impact on the traditional Italian coffee bars where you stand up at the bar and have your brioche and cappuccino in the morning”.“It is a different thing culturally. It is about American coffee and socialising for hours in a Starbucks,” he said.Mr Schultz has faced a backlash and calls for a boycott from Donald Trump supporters in the US over a pledge to hire 10,000 immigrants to work in his stores. Decrying a “hate and bigotry”, Mr Schultz denounced “a void of leadership” in the US and other countries.Asked if there had been any impact on sales, Mr Schultz replied: “No, not at all.”Starbucks’ expansion is part of a broader trend of internationalisation of high quality Italian food and drink.Campari, another Milan-based brand, on Tuesday reported a 16 per cent jump in sales for its orange Aperol aperitif and a 10 per cent jump for its namesake red aperitif thanks in large part to thirsty US consumers.Eataly, the upmarket delicatessen chain which has its biggest store in New York’s Fifth Avenue, is due to list in Milan in the next 18 months. Grom, a high-end gelateria, was bought by Unilever in 2015. Prada, the Italian fashion house, two years ago bought an haute Milan coffee store Pasticceria Marchesi, and is now looking to expand it into markets in Asia and the Middle East.
101;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2017-02-25T05:08:38Z;Irrepressible Magic Johnson will bounce back at the Lakers;The basketball star turned businessman is a great American success story;"When Earvin “Magic” Johnson, the basketball star-turned-entrepreneur, struck a franchise deal with Starbucks to open coffee shops serving urban, black customers, he requested a couple of changes to the otherwise strict Starbucks formula.First, no scones. His customers, he informed Starbucks’ managers, did not care for scones. They would prefer sweet potato pie and “Sock It To Me” cake, heavy on brown sugar and cinnamon. Second, the music. Less light rock, please, more R&B and Michael Jackson.Starbucks, which rarely allows tinkering with its model, agreed. And in 2010, after a 12-year partnership, reportedly paid Mr Johnson $75m for his 105 stores.This week, Mr Johnson was appointed president of the team he once starred for, the Los Angeles Lakers. Were the Lakers any old $3bn business, and Mr Johnson any old executive, this would be of limited interest. But the Lakers and Mr Johnson flush the cheeks of sports fans like few others. They epitomise America’s swaggering sports-entertainment complex. And Mr Johnson in particular, symbolises unorthodox greatness.It is rare for a great athlete’s star to burn strongly decades after their sporting career winds down. Some thrive as managers or television presenters. Others suffer bad investments, bad marriages and psychological breakdown once the applause fades and the trophies gather dust. George Best drinking himself to death in the Phene Arms in Chelsea; Pete Rose, banished from baseball for gambling, signing endless baseballs for money; OJ Simpson languishing in jail.Mr Johnson has remained the beaming, irrepressible life force of his first emergence as a national college basketball star in 1979. What distinguished him then were his physical gifts. In basketball at the time, the tallest men lurked beneath the basket, while the short ones dribbled and passed. Mr Johnson was both tall and silky with the ball — he could do everything.When the Lakers drafted him and he moved to Los Angeles, he also turned out to be a natural star. His rivalry with the Boston Celtics’ Larry Bird revived a moribund sport and paved the way for Michael Jordan and the stars who followed him. With Mr Johnson starring, a league which was unloved and unwatched became a commercial juggernaut.But nothing in his basketball career matched the drama of his retirement. In November 1991, still at the peak of his powers, he learnt he had contracted the HIV virus. He had made no secret of his prodigious sex life. But most Americans still considered HIV and Aids to be limited to gay, white men. Mr Johnson’s diagnosis changed all that. During the following month, requests for HIV tests in New York alone rose by 60 per cent.At the press conference where he announced he was leaving basketball, Mr Johnson said “I’m going to live” — reporters in the room thought he was deluded. Even his friends assumed he would develop Aids and waste away before their eyes. “It has happened, but I’m going to deal with it,” he said. “And my life will go on . . . Life is going to go on for me. I’m going to be a happy man.”He sought out the best medication, which has improved over time, and took care of himself physically. To everyone else’s amazement, he grew stronger, richer, more powerful and influential. He became an evangelist for safe sex and campaigned for more federal support for HIV/Aids research and treatment. And as he had promised early in his career, he went into business.He built cinemas in black communities and encouraged national retail chains to build stores in urban, minority areas. He invested in start-ups and real estate, served on the board of the payments company, Square, and took a stake in a life insurance company.In 2012, he was the public face of a group of investors who paid $2bn for the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team. And a year later, he performed in the video for Pharrell Williams’ song “Happy”. Few investors are capable of turning a trick like that.Mr Johnson’s life, like all the best American success stories, is a restless search for meaning. He has reduced his medical condition to a low thrum, but as an Olympian made mortal, he commands as much empathy as he does admiration.But the Lakers, a team so used to success, is now swamped by failure. Its owners, the Buss family, are feuding. The players keep losing. Bill Plaschke, the Los Angeles Times’ great sports columnist, expressed his doubts about Mr Johnson’s focus: “Everybody loves Magic Johnson, but one minute he wants to buy an NFL team and the next he’s buying and selling a minor-league baseball team, and now that he wants to focus on the Lakers, how long will that last?”But there has always been an assumption that Mr Johnson is about to be undone. That real life is going wipe that electric smile off his face. That rivals would crush him. That illness would destroy him. That business would expose him. We’re still waiting.The writer, a managing director at Banco Santander, is author of ‘What They Teach You at Harvard Business School’"
102;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2017-02-14T23:03:14Z;Thirst for coffee in lower-tier China cities propels Starbucks push;Latest FTCR survey finds small city demand driving aggressive expansion plans;"China’s second- and third-tier cities are thirsting for coffee, an FT Confidential Research survey has found, and the big global chains, led by Starbucks, are rushing to meet this demand.A survey of 1,000 consumers across this predominantly tea-drinking market has found reasonably robust coffee consumption rates in smaller cities; a comparison with more developed Chinese urban areas highlights the potential for growth.FTCR found 39.9 per cent of respondents in second-tier cities, such as Chengdu, and 31.2 per cent of those in third-tier cities drink coffee frequently — defined as at least once a week (see chart). In first-tier cities, 62.6 per cent said they were frequent coffee drinkers. Although Chinese coffee consumption has almost doubled since 2012, per capita consumption is still just 83g a year, compared with 2.3kg in South Korea.Our survey also found consumers in lower-tier cities only visited coffee shops 2.5 times a year on average, compared with 18 times in first-tier cities. We believe the 43.5 per cent of respondents in first-tier cities who said they buy their coffee “to go” reflects the more rapid pace of life for white-collar workers in these cities. Just 27.9 per cent buy takeaways in third-tier cities, according to our survey.Smaller Chinese cities like Chengdu, at the foot of the Tibetan plateau in western China, are now the focus of Starbucks’ expansion plans. From 2012 to 2015, the number of Starbucks stores in central and western China tripled to 300 across 23 cities. The company has continued to grow in these regions, looking to tap unmet demand (see map).Other international coffee chains are also expanding in China — Whitbread wants to double its Costa Coffee outlets in China to 700 by 2020 — though none match the scale and ambition of the Seattle-based giant, whose growth plans mirror those of McDonald’s and KFC in the previous decade.Even by the standards of the Chinese market, Starbucks’ ambitions in the country stand out. It plans to open 1.3 new stores each day between now and 2019, when the company intends China to be its biggest market outside the US. By 2021, it wants 5,000 stores open across the country.Starbucks is selling more coffee in China even as the competition stumbles. In its latest quarter, the company reported that same-store sales growth in China was 6 per cent, against just 3 per cent in the US and a 1 per cent drop in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Korea’s Caffe Bene has been closing outlets in China after overexpanding and failing to turn a profit. UBC Coffee, the once-dominant Taiwanese chain, has slashed its store count by half from a peak of 3,000 in 2011.Starbucks’ grip on the Chinese market is evident in FTCR’s latest brand survey, which found 55 per cent of urban coffee drinkers said Starbucks was the coffee shop chain they visited most often, rising to 66.8 per cent in first-tier cities. UBC came a distant second at 25.2 per cent while Costa was in eighth place, chosen by just 3.5 per cent of respondents.To successfully sell $5 coffees to a nation of tea drinkers, where annual disposable incomes are still below $5,000, speaks of Starbucks’ ability to offer affordable luxury in the face of an economic slowdown. This is a market in which instant coffee still dominates, accounting for 96 per cent of sales last year, according to Euromonitor, though growth slowed to just 4 per cent while fresh coffee sales surged 23 per cent (see chart).McDonald’s and KFC have been providing the western fast food dining experience in China for nearly three decades, but a Rmb30 ($4.40) iced caramel frappuccino comes with the soft lighting, light jazz and cushioned armchairs that are hallmarks of the Starbucks experience. Per capita disposable incomes in Chengdu are half those of Beijing and Shanghai, and in smaller cities are a good deal lower. But coffee shops are ubiquitous in first-tier cities along the east coast, prompting the push inland.A Chengdu outlet visited by FTCR on a Friday afternoon was bustling, with around half of the 60 seats taken and staff busy serving a small queue of customers at the counter. A more dimly lit Costa Coffee outlet in the same shopping mall that same afternoon was only around 10 per cent full. There were no customers at all in UBC’s last remaining outlet in the Sichuan capital.The problems faced by McDonald’s and KFC in China in recent years highlight the dangers of failing to respond to the rapidly evolving tastes of Chinese consumers. But the gap in consumption habits between coffee drinkers in first-tier cities and those in smaller Chinese cities makes a case for building more extensive chains, particularly as sales outside China remain so weak."
103;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
104;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2017-02-09T20:37:05Z;Dunkin Brands aims to boost ‘on-the-go’ image to increase 2017 traffic, sales;;Who has time to wait in line for their morning java fix? Dunkin Brands — the operator of the Dunkin’ Donuts stores — says it is trying to distinguish itself from rivals like Starbucks and McDonald’s as the ultimate destination for “on-the-go” beverages and food as its targets modest sales growth this year.The company’s shares were up nearly 5 per cent on Thursday — and poised for their best day in a year — after the company announced quarterly earnings for the three-month period ending December 31 that came in better than expected on most counts. Earnings per share were 64 cents for the quarter, compared to the 61 cents forecast by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, on net income of $56.1m, versus analysts’ predictions of $53m profit. Revenue came in as expected at $215.7m.Same-store sales at its core Dunkin’ Donuts stores were slightly softer than expected, improving 1.9 per cent versus expectations of a 2 per cent rise. Its Baskin-Robbins stores fared less well, with declining traffic pushing same-store sales to a loss of 0.9 per cent, compared with expectations of a 0.7 per cent decline.Dunkin said that it is guiding for low single-digit comparable sales growth for both brands this year, and low-to-mid single-digit revenue growth.At the core of its growth strategy will be to push its “on-the-go” offerings to help position it as the more convenient and affordable option in the competitive market for morning beverages, Dunkin executives said in a call with analysts after the earnings report.“The brand positioning of the beverage-led On-The-Go brand is clear, progressive and forward-leaning,” said David Hoffmann, president of Dunkin’ Donuts US and Canada who joined the company late last year after more than two decades with McDonald’s.For instance, it is hoping to ramp up the number of customers who use its mobile ordering, which has been available for just about six months. The ability to order before arriving at the restaurant and breeze past the line is “a huge unlock,” said chief digital officer Scott Hudler – and something that coffee competitor Starbucks is already taking advantage of.Dunkin is also eyeing a streamlined menu, in order to make food faster, and has begun testing out curbside delivery at some stores in Massachusetts, designed to be a speedier alternative to drive-through windows – a test it plans to expand in 2017 as franchisees clamour for that option.One perk to being the on-the-go choice? Restaurants may gradually require less space, said Dunkin Brands chief executive Nigel Travis, adding, “I think ultimately, we will require less capital investment because we’ll need less space for people to sit inside the store.”
105;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2017-01-31T14:50:26Z;Protest or stay silent? Trump tests US bosses’ promises on values;"Some business leaders attacked the travel ban; many stayed quiet, writes Andrew Hill";Donald Trump’s immigration clampdown is testing big US companies’ public commitment to their declared social values. It is also revealing that having a corporate purpose, far from being a soft option, increasingly obliges chief executives to take hard decisions.The first such decision is simply whether or not to comment. The second is how to frame a reaction that strikes a balance between placating or offending customers, shareholders, staff — and the Twitter-happy president. The third is whether to take further action.Starbucks is a case in point. The most striking initiative outlined in Howard Schultz’s verbose memo to staff on Sunday was his plan to hire 10,000 refugees around the world over the next five years. It prompted Trump supporters to call for a boycott, and some Trump critics to suggest a backlash against the backlash, vowing to buy more coffee from the chain.While plainly critical of Mr Trump’s executive order to ban immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries, the statement was more nuanced than either of the extreme reactions suggests. The hiring effort in the US, Mr Schultz explained, would focus at first on refugees who had “served with US troops as interpreters and support personnel”. That is a reminder that Starbucks has hired 8,000 veterans and military spouses since 2014. Mr Schultz also signed off with a promise that the group would continue to do business across the US, “whether that neighbourhood is in a Red [Republican] or Blue [Democrat] state”.The range of responses to the president’s executive order gives an insight into the dilemma on the boardroom table. In the same activist vein as Starbucks, Lyft, the ride-hailing group, said it would donate $1m to the American Civil Liberties Union, which has challenged the order in court. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s boss and owner of the Washington Post, said the group had flagged its opposition to the policy to “senior administration officials”. Other companies, such as Ford and Goldman Sachs, took a less militant stand, while still making clear that they could not support the policy.Patrick Jenkins and guests discuss Deutsche Bank’s latest legal settlement, Goldman Sachs’ criticism of Donald Trump’s immigration reforms and the proposed creation of a ‘bad bank’ to deal with Europe’s toxic loans. With special guest Andrea Enria, chairman of the European Banking Authority.There is safety in numbers, clearly. Silicon Valley companies, with their interest in preserving a flow of skilled immigrants to the technology sector, led the way in protesting against the policy. But at the same time, plenty of companies have remained silent.Most chief executives have a clear idea of who their staff, shareholders, and customers are — and roughly how they may react to a public statement of principle. Starbucks’ Mr Schultz was scrupulously, even cloyingly, neutral in his first reaction to the US election result in November. This time, he probably calculated that, as a global company, Starbucks could afford to challenge the immigration restrictions. He may even have assumed that US customers would split roughly half and half between those for and against his memo, along the same lines as the election result.The big new risk under the president is that criticising a specific policy may — in the words of one anonymous chief executive referred to by the New York Times — “poke the bear”, provoking a touchy Mr Trump into an aggressive, company-specific response.It should be easier to run that risk if you do not head a publicly quoted company. Customers and staff increasingly expect businesses to link their objectives to a wider social purpose. But the truth is that the election of a businessman emblematic of an old-fashioned corporate culture, who wields a powerful social media weapon, illuminates the path of least resistance: to revert to behaving as though the only “social responsibility of business is to increase profits”, as economist Milton Friedman wrote.Mr Schultz has promised to “accelerate [Starbucks’] commitment to communicating [with staff] more frequently” in “these uncertain times”. The public debate between chief executives and policymakers in the US could be about to become noisier. But it seems just as likely — given the share price rally that the prospect of more business-friendly Trump policies has provoked — that many companies will make a similar calculation to the one made by Starbucks, and decide it suits their self-interest to shut up.andrew.hill@ft.com
106;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2017-01-26T21:36:38Z;Starbucks shares dip as it tweaks annual revenue target;;Coffee giant Starbucks saw its shares cool in after-hours trading on Thursday after it said same-store sales growth had softened during the past quarter amid a challenging environment for restaurant retailers and lowered its revenue outlook for the full year.The company’s shares fell more than 3 per cent in after-hours trading after it said that comparable store sales grew 3 per cent over the three-month period ending December 31, the first quarter of its fiscal 2017. That figure is just short of analysts’ expectations of a 3.7 per cent boost, and undershooting the 5 per cent like-for-like growth posted last quarter. The growth was led by a 6 per cent increase in comparable store sales in China, while its home market in the US rose 3 per cent.Sales for the quarter – which included the critical holiday shopping season – hit $5.7bn, a 7 per cent rise from the same period a year ago and just short of the $5.85bn that analysts forecast, according to Bloomberg.Operating profit for the quarter increased 7 per cent to $1.1bn, a 7 per cent lift from last year, translating into earnings per share of 51 cents – a penny less than predicted.It reaffirmed its expectations that it will add 2,100 net new stores globally during fiscal year 2017, as well as for mid-single digit comparable store sales growth globally. It also stuck with its adjusted earnings per share target of $2.12-$2.14.However, Starbucks scaled back its revenue target, saying it now expects growth for the fiscal year to clock in at 8-10 per cent. The company previously forecast consolidated revenue growth in the double digits.It is the first earnings report from Starbucks since Howard Schultz announced in December that he would relinquish his chief executive title, while staying on as executive chairman and focusing his efforts on the company’s premium roastery and retail store business. Effective April 7, he will be replaced by Kevin Johnson, the company’s president and chief operating officer.Mr Schultz said in a statement:“Starbucks is engaging more deeply – and more frequently – and expanding its base of loyal customers faster and more consistently today than ever before. The trust and confidence our customers have in the Starbucks brand is fueling our flywheel and propelling our business forward in markets and channels all around the world.”

Now one Wall Street analyst thinks it can overtake McDonald’s as the world’s most valuable restaurant chain.The Seattle-based coffee chain’s shares fell 7.5 per cent last year, as investors warily eyed a deceleration in same-store sales from the first half to the second. The announcement last month that long-serving chief executive Howard Schultz would step down — although stay as executive chairman — didn’t help.However, the drop in the stock could make it that much more attractive to investors as it aims to maintain its steady growth in the coming year, according to Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski, who picked Starbucks as his top large-cap US-based restaurant stock pick for this year.Starbucks will expand its worldwide store count by more than 8 per cent for the fiscal year ending in September, according to Mr Kalinowski, and grow worldwide same-store sales by about 5 per cent. As its presence grows, Starbucks could see revenue expand in double-digits, and earnings per share increase 12 per cent, he added.The chain’s tailwinds include “consistent same-store sales, unit growth potential and ongoing innovation”, Mr Kalinowski noted. It also benefits from a lack of direct head-on competition, as a beverage-first chain that also sells food, as opposed to more food-focused chains.The prediction from Mr Kalinowski is a bold one, but the bullishness towards Starbucks on Wall Street is widespread. Of the 33 analysts who cover the stock, 29 recommend buying it, according to Bloomberg. By contrast, 15 of the 35 analysts who track McDonald’s advise investors to buy into a stock that has rallied almost 30 per cent since Steve Easterbrook, chief executive, was appointed in early 2015.One thing that has set Starbucks apart from would-be rivals is its remarkably consistent growth over a long span of time, Mr Kalinowski added. For 26 of the past 28 fiscal years, it has achieved same-store sales growth of at least 5 per cent, and appears on track to extend that streak during the current financial year.Those dynamics have made Starbucks the second-largest US restaurant chain by market cap. Could it eventually claim the number-one spot?“We believe that it is only a matter of time before Starbucks overtakes McDonald’s as the largest market cap restaurant stock, although likely not in 2017,” according to Mr Kalinowski.Starbucks still has some way to go. Its current market cap currently hovers at about $80bn, compared with the $98.7bn market cap of the ubiquitous burger chain.However, if Starbucks can hit its goal of expanding its number of units by more than 8 per cent every year until 2021, it may be the first restaurant chain in decades to take the Golden Arches’ crown.On Tuesday, Starbucks closed 0.3 per cent lower at $55.35. McDonald’s also had a bite taken out of it, down 1.7 per cent at $119.62.The overall markets did better, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both gaining 0.9 per cent to 2,257 and 5,429, respectively. The Dow resumed its climb towards 20,000, closing 0.6 per cent higher at 19,881.

British retailers are experimenting on the platform, which is commonly used by people trying to plan events, craft activities and research potential purchases.Some 55 per cent of users visit to shop or find products, according to Kleiner Perkins partner Mary Meeker’s closely watched Internet Trends report, compared with just 12 per cent on Facebook and Instagram alike, 9 per cent on Twitter and 3 per cent on Snapchat.UK retailer John Lewis launched its “Make It Thoughtful” campaign on Pinterest, encouraging shoppers to add personal touches to presents, such as giving someone a map of favourite walks, in addition to socks, or a notebook full of recipes with a Le Creuset pot.Adele Cooper, UK & Ireland country manager for Pinterest, said John Lewis had extended this campaign into the store, by printing out large paper pins for the shop floor. “This is the first Christmas season that advertising on Pinterest is available in the UK, and we’re seeing our partners engage with consumers in unique ways.”Pinterest, which counts Goldman Sachs, Fidelity and Andreessen Horowitz among its investors, has been trying to expand its advertising offering this year, launching video ads in the US and the UK. It followed social media companies Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat, which have all pushed into video, with marketers seeing it improve engagement.But Pinterest still has only a small share of the digital advertising market, which is dominated by Google and Facebook. It has far fewer visitors than its social rivals, with 150m monthly active users compared with 1.8bn Facebook users, 500m Instagram users and 313m Twitter users logging on each month.Debbie Williamson, an analyst at research firm eMarketer, said Pinterest was gaining traction with marketers but had taken it “very very slow”. “Nobody would say they have gone sprinting out of the gate like we saw Snapchat do this year. They are building out their advertising business quite deliberately,” she said.“Pinterest works well with retailers trying to sell products, so the holidays are a particularly strong time.”
110;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2016-12-02T20:42:34Z;Starbucks: Freshen the cup;A new boss comes as growth has slowed;Howard Schultz of Starbucks is a frothy coffee legend. He even wrote a book about turning round the café chain, entitled How Starbucks Fought For Its Life Without Losing Its Soul.Now Starbucks aims to lose Mr Schultz as chief executive — he will remain chairman — without losing its mojo, as when he previously stepped down.On Friday, Starbucks shares responded by dropping 2.4 per cent. The nervousness is natural. The brisk growth inspired by Mr Schultz has slowed just a touch, putting extra pressure on new boss, Kevin Johnson.Despite a capitalisation just shy of $83bn, Starbucks has remained a phenomenal growth story. Its revenue has grown at an annual, average rate of 13 per cent over the past five years. It will add another 2,000 outlets to its total of 25,000 next year.Sales at shops already open have averaged double digits in recent years. Those figures are dipping now but remain firmly positive. Former high flyers such as Chipotle and Whole Foods can only dream of such turnover.The concern for Starbucks is that its premium valuation — it trades at nearly 30 times forward earnings — will slip without Mr Schultz in charge.Mr Johnson is a credible successor. A board member for the past seven years and its operating chief since last year, he is a long-time technology executive. Starbucks’ mobile phone app has spurred customer traffic.It is also questionable just how removed Mr Schultz will stay from the fray. He remains executive chairman and will focus on Starbucks’ new “high-end concept” (if its ordinary format is too plebeian for you). And he will also stay active on social and political issues.Mr Schultz’s obsessiveness, more than any other factor, is responsible for the Starbucks phenomenon. The challenge for Mr Johnson is to be equally finicky, and to such good effect that Mr Schultz steps back and lets him get on with it.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
111;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2016-12-02T15:21:23Z;Starbucks is right to keep Schultz around to sniff out problems;Outgoing CEO has grown wiser but must curb his instinct to tamper, writes Andrew Hill;Starbucks is eager to make the transfer of the chief executive role from Howard Schultz to chief operating officer Kevin Johnson look as inconsequential as scribbling a different name on to a cardboard coffee cup.The word “continue” appears 10 times in Thursday’s official statement and the message is clear: the contents of this cup is the same reliable, delicious brew you have always bought.The downward jolt in Starbucks’ share price at the news underlines the fear haunting the decision. Investors may assume that Mr Schultz has begun a gradual distancing from the brand that he loves and for which he has been the leading evangelist virtually since the day he joined in 1982.The opposite fear is also in the air: that as executive chairman Mr Schultz will be a dead hand on future development of the group, ready to wield the “executive” part of his title to beat up Mr Johnson if he tries to relocate the coffee beans, or adjust the cut of the baristas’ green aprons.I’m normally a critic of executive chairmanships. For once, though, I’m in favour of the Starbucks approach. Mr Schultz’s position seems less like the coronation of Stuart Rose (whose assumption of the executive chair title at Marks and Spencer in 2008 was a tacit admission of succession planning failures), and more like the role handed to John Chambers, who last year became Cisco’s executive chairman, after 20 years as CEO.Mr Schultz is a man who truly lives the brand. It is said to be as hard to give him bad news about Starbucks as to explain to a child why she sometimes may not get what she wants. But in retaining Mr Schultz’s services, Starbucks is also hanging on to the world’s greatest expert in the pitfalls of pulling back from your creation — and the risks of tampering with it once you have withdrawn.Having stepped down as chief executive in 2000, Mr Schultz felt obliged to return to the job in 2008 after Starbucks lost its way. He penned a memo about the worrying “loss of aroma” in the group’s multiplying outlets. He then fired the CEO, Jim Donald, and led a famous resurgence of the group.Though his enthusiasm is easily mocked, Mr Schultz’s sense of smell remains an asset. This time round, he is also older, and presumably wiser about the dangers of flaring his nostrils too obviously if his successor starts moving the furniture.Three years after appointing a COO in 1994 and delegating some powers, Mr Schultz wrote: “I’ll often pass a room where an interesting discussion is in progress, and I’m sorely tempted to drop in”. After dropping the chief executive title in 2000, Mr Schultz experienced the same sense of nostalgic detachment as chairman: “Walking by closed-door conference rooms, I would peer through the windows, literally feeling like an outsider looking in,” he recalled in 2011.On balance, I think Mr Johnson will benefit from having Mr Schultz within reach. Even so, if I were the new chief executive, I’d keep the blinds on the meeting rooms closed.The writer is FT management editor
112;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2016-12-02T02:04:10Z;Howard Schultz steps aside as Starbucks’ chief;Billionaire hands reins to right-hand man Kevin Johnson but retains chairmanship;Howard Schultz is stepping aside as Starbucks’ chief executive for the second time, as the billionaire who built the company into the world’s largest coffee chain hands the reins to his tech-savvy right-hand man.Mr Schultz will retain his executive chairmanship and focus on the company’s premium roastery and retail store business. However, news of the transition on Thursday unnerved investors who sent the stock down 3.6 per cent to $56.41 in after-hours trading in New York.“While we acknowledge that Schultz is without question one of the strongest and most visionary leaders in the consumer/retail world, we believe the succession planning put in place several years ago assures the recent exceptional performance will likely continue,” said Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Wells Fargo.Since Mr Schultz was reinstated as chief executive in 2008 to guide the company through the financial crisis, he has trebled Starbucks’ margin on earnings before interest and tax to 18.1 per cent. Its shares have surged nearly eightfold.Mr Schultz is close to his successor Kevin Johnson, who has been credited with the success of Starbucks’ mobile payment app. It has helped put the company ahead of rival restaurant chains in adapting to an environment where technology and consumer data have become key to success.“The management team at the time [of the recession] was good, but didn’t have the experience to navigate [it],” Mr Schultz said. “Over a few years we’ve built, attracted and retained a great team. Kevin and I have had a 10-year relationship on the board and two inside the company.”Although in corporate governance terms a non-executive chairman is generally preferred as a way of maintaining independence for the board, in the case of Mr Schultz, “I think the market’s probably willing to overlook the board structure here, given the company’s success over the past decade or so,” said RJ Hottovy, an analyst at Morningstar.Mr Schultz retained the chairmanship in 2000 when he exchanged his chief executive role for the title of chief global strategist. In 2008, he again took on the CEO mantle.Charles Elson, a professor of finance at the University of Delaware and a corporate governance expert, said the move appeared to be a “title swap” as the executive chairman is “still running the show”. His role as chief executive and length of time at the company would make it impossible for him to have independence.Mr Schultz told investors that the company’s global strategy for the years ahead was already in place and that Mr Johnson was “better prepared” to implement it, given his understanding of technology and how to integrate it into the retail business.“I think I have an opportunity with the roastery and reserve brand to . . . really create premiumisation,” Mr Schultz said.Starbucks plans to open more than 20 roasteries by the end of 2019 and 1,000 reserve stores, which the company said have higher margins than typical Starbucks cafés.Under Mr Schultz, Starbucks has opened 25,000 coffee shops in 75 countries. The company is even taking on Italy — seen as the home of coffee culture — by planning to open a café there.Mr Johnson has been a Starbucks board member since 2009 when he was chief executive of tech company Juniper Networks, and joined the coffee chain in 2015 as president. He spent 16 years at Microsoft and served as a member of the National Security Telecommunication Advisory Committee under the administrations of George W Bush and Barack Obama.

However, the signatories have urged him to reconsider.Matt Patsky, chief executive of Trillium Asset Management, the US investment firm, said the business community’s support for policies to address global warming “cannot be reversed and cannot be ignored by the Trump administration”.“That train has left the station and to stand in its way is folly,” he said.[Policies to address global warming] cannot be reversed and cannot be ignored by the Trump administrationMichael Kobori, vice-president of sustainability at Levi Strauss, the clothing company, said that “now more than ever” it was important to back the Paris deal.Such comments underline the concern that Mr Trump’s election has cast over the Marrakesh talks, but also a sense of determination among China, the EU and other nations to press on with plans to curb emissions, no matter what Mr Trump does.John Kerry, outgoing US secretary of state, tried to reassure delegates on Wednesday that millions of Americans were still dedicated to tackling global warming.“No one should doubt the overwhelming majority of the citizens of the US who know climate change is happening and our determination to keep our commitments that were made under Paris,” he said in Marrakesh.“One of the things I’ve learned is that some issues look a little bit different when you are actually in office, compared to when you’re on the campaign trail.”Still, the incoming Trump administration is widely expected to slash many of the climate actions President Barack Obama had promised for the Paris deal, raising questions about whether other countries will be willing or able to fill the gap left by a US withdrawal.It is also unclear how other large companies will respond to the new administration.The list of business groups urging Mr Trump to keep faith with the Paris accord did not include many prominent companies that backed climate change efforts before his election, including Google, Apple, Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks.Organisers of the list, which included Ceres, a non-profit sustainability group, said these companies had been approached but their absence did not suggest opposition because the initiative had been done in a matter of days.The Paris deal, sealed in December by almost every nation, requires countries to come up with a plan to curb climate change and progressively update it so global temperature rises compared with pre-industrial times are kept “well below” 2C, and 1.5C if possible.The World Meteorological Organisation said this week that it was 95 per cent certain that 2016 would be the warmest year since records began in the 19th century.While this year’s warming has come on the back of a powerful El Niño weather event, the WMO also said it had been accompanied by a spate of extreme weather, Arctic ice melting and heatwaves that had rarely been seen before.
115;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2016-11-13T12:09:19Z;Skip the empathy, Mr Schultz, and focus on the coffee;Starbucks boss has no business sending a missive to staff to tell them how to be;"Just over a week ago, in that innocent age when the prospect of a reality TV host moving into the White House was terrifying yet remote, Howard Schultz sat down to write a note to the 100,000 or so Americans who serve coffee in his shops. There was a leadership void in the US, the Starbucks chief noted — a void which he promptly attempted to fill by stepping into it himself.“We’ve lost faith in what we all know has always been true, the promise of America.“But you are the true promise of America. My faith in you has me more optimistic than ever. Today, I’m not talking about our business or the Starbucks brand. I’m talking about you as a person.”There is much to admire in this simple, stirring language, yet otherwise it left me puzzled. Why does he have more faith than ever in his employees as people? What have they done to deserve it? He doesn’t say. Instead, he goes on: “In the face of this epic, unseemly election . . . and the lack of truth and void of leadership, we can still make a difference in the lives of the people we touch and influence every day. Kindness, compassion, empathy, and yes love is what we need.”Maybe it’s because I’m a Londoner but I read this and felt mildly outraged. Mr Schultz is quite right that if everyone were always kind to each other the world would be a better place. But a) that’s not going to happen; b) it’s certainly not going to happen because the head of a coffee company says so, and c) I’m not sure what gives him the platform to talk like this. Mr Schultz was not elected. He has a duty to behave decently to his staff and his customers. He has no duty, indeed no business, to be looking after their spiritual lives or telling them how to behave when they go home.Join the FT in London on November 22 to discuss what it takes to start a businessThe message goes on: “Start today by recognising the power we have to demonstrate understanding, and to strip away the differences that divide us.”I agree that it would be lovely if we could strip away all differences. But one difference that divides Mr Schultz from the people making his skinny cinnamon lattes is that his net worth is $2.9bn while some of them get about $10 an hour. That’s quite a difference. And the free coffee, the tips and other benefits Starbucks staff get don’t really reduce it that much.He winds up: “On this Sunday, wherever you are, whatever you are doing, know that I send you my love and respect.”It isn’t clear to me how he can send his love to about 100,000 people he has mostly never met and doesn’t even know the names of. This is one of the differences between the deity and mortals: God can love everyone, but for a human, loving someone usually means getting to know them first.And yet this idea of empathy in corporate life is gaining a foothold. Later this week the Empathy Global Index is published, ranking companies based on their behaviour on social networks and assorted opinion polls. There is a lot about this that doesn’t quite stack up. Last year Microsoft came top, but then proceeded to axe several thousand jobs — which doesn’t strike me as all that empathetic.Equally, I am doubtful whether you can measure empathy in a single, aggregated number. Empathy is defined as the ability to understand and share other people’s feelings — and so social networking sites are not the obvious place to go in search of it.More fundamentally, empathy is not necessarily good for business — or for us as individuals. There was a great piece in the Harvard Business Review recently pointing out that empathy is dangerous if there is too much of it. For a start, it is exhausting. Jobs that require a lot of empathy — like working in a hospice — leave us shattered and on the verge of breakdown. Second, it is a zero-sum game. If you spend all day being empathetic at work, you have none left when you go home. And finally, too much empathy can lead to bad decisions.I don’t want my employers to feel my pain. They don’t need to love me. They just need to be able to behave decently towards me. Respect and dignity go a long way, and in extremis if, say, a member of my family were to fall ill, I would much rather my bosses skipped empathy and went for sympathy — and gave as much time off as was required.lucy.kellaway@ft.com

Overall, comparable sales of 4 per cent growth were shy of estimates for 4.8 per cent growth.Profit climbed to $801m, or 54 cents a share, compared with $652.5m, or 43 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Sales jumped more than 16 per cent to $5.7bn. Analysts had forecast earnings of 54 cents a share, on sales of $5.7bn. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 56 cents a share topped estimates.“With a strong but largely expected quarter behind it, investors may now fret over the upcoming holiday quarter, continued reinvestment in the business likely now a more permanent part of cost structure,” said John Glass, analyst at JPMorgan.The chain is working to grab share of the elite coffee business, saying last month that it plans to open 1,000 premium Reserve cafés by the end of 2017. It also continues to invest in its digital platforms.The company expects adjusted 2017 earnings in the range of $2.12 to $2.14 a share, just shy of estimates for $2.16. Meanwhile, comparable sales are expected to rise in the mid-single digits.The rally in Starbucks shares accompanied modest gains in US stocks as enthusiasm about a solid jobs report for October was tempered by uncertainties surrounding the outcome of next week’s presidential election. The S&P 500 dipped 0.17 per cent to 2,085.18, extending a streak of consecutive losses to nine. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.24 per cent to 17,888.28. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.24 per cent to 5,046.37.Elsewhere, shares in Weight Watchers International jumped more than 8.8 per cent to $10.88 after the purveyor of diets and weight loss advice lifted the lower end of its full-year earnings outlook and posted third-quarter profits that topped analysts’ forecasts.The New York-based company said profits rose to $34.7m, or 53 cents a share, compared with $21.8m, or 38 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. That topped analysts’ estimates for 50 cents.Revenue rose 2.7 per cent to $280m but were shy of forecasts as the number of subscribers climbed 10 per cent from a year ago. However, the pace of subscriber growth slowed sequentially.The company, which counts media mogul Oprah Winfrey as one of its biggest shareholders, also lifted the lower end of its 2016 earnings outlook by 5 cents to a range of 95 cents to $1.05 a share, ahead of Wall Street’s projections for 94 cents.Meanwhile, NRG Energy was the biggest gainer on the benchmark S&P 500 and headed for its biggest one-day rise since 2008, after the power company lifted its profit outlook for the year. Shares rose 8.88 per cent to $11.03 after the company said it now expects adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in a range of $3.25bn to $3.35bn, up from $3bn to $3.2bn previously.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar

That was aided by a 4 per cent jump in US same-store sales growth. Meanwhile, same-store sales in China and Asia Pacific rose just 1 per cent, below forecasts for 5.4 per cent growth.That in turn helped the Seattle-based company log a rise in profits to $801m or 54 cents a share, compared with $652.5m or 43 cents a share in the year ago period.

Analysts had forecast earnings of 54 cents a share, on sales of $5.7bn.Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of 56 cents a share, topped estimates.Starbucks announced aggressive growth plans for China, stating in January that it planned to open at least 500 new stores on the mainland this year.The chain is also working to grab share of the elite coffee business, saying last month that it plans to open 1,000 premium Reserve cafes by the end of 2017.Starbucks expects adjusted 2017 earnings in the range of $2.12 to $2.14 a share, was just shy of estimates for $2.16.The company’s shares, which have declined nearly 14 per cent so far this year, rose 3.5 per cent in extended trading.
118;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2016-08-30T04:44:01Z;Apple’s EU tax dispute explained;The consequences of the commission’s complaint and the wider implications of its ruling;Ireland will on Tuesday be ordered to claw back billions of euros from Apple, triggering one of the world’s biggest tax disputes and a political showdown between Europe and the US.Based on an obscure 1991 Irish tax ruling issued for Apple, then a struggling computer maker, the Brussels competition decision has the potential to transform how corporate tax avoidance is policed in Europe.The order to recoup back-taxes is expected to potentially be big enough to ricochet into the US election campaign, overshadow Apple’s latest product launch next week, and set in train a landmark legal battle.Ireland and Apple strongly deny any wrongdoing and see the decision as an egregious example of over-reach by the EU’s executive arm that will not stand up to scrutiny in court.At the heart of the matter are tax arrangements that helped Apple pay an ultra-low rate of just 4 per cent on nearly $200bn of foreign profits it has earned over the past 10 years.Apple’s lightly-taxed foreign cash mountain is the biggest of any US multinational.The $187bn it held outside the US in 2015 accounts for a big share of the $1.2tn that US multinationals have parked offshore, in the hope that US tax reform will eventually cut the cost of repatriating the profits.So far, Apple’s foreign profits have been lightly taxed.About 90 per cent of Apple’s foreign profits are earned by Irish subsidiaries, which are highly profitable because they hold rights to Apple’s intellectual property.But these Irish entities paid little tax because they were not tax resident anywhere — a structure that exploited differences between the US and Irish definitions of residence.The European Commission is targeting the arrangement on the grounds that it gave Apple an undue tax advantage that distorted competition. It alleges this amounted to illegal state aid, a breach of the EU’s unique restrictions on state support to companies.While it builds on similar commission tax decisions recently served against deals for Starbucks in the Netherlands and Fiat in Luxembourg, the Apple case is by far the biggest and most significant.EU investigators have examined how Apple paid a tax rate of less than 1 per cent on European sales in some years. But the company insists it pays every cent of tax owed in every jurisdiction.Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, told the Washington Post in the past month that the tax structure deployed in Ireland was applicable to all companies and that it was not unique to Apple. In other words, Apple gained no special treatment in Ireland and therefore enjoyed no selective state aid.With some passion, he personally pressed the company’s case with Margrethe Vestager, EU competition commissioner, in January. He also says the company is the biggest taxpayer in the US. “And so we’re not a tax dodger. We pay our share and then some.”Ireland’s position is that any arrangement which gave tax advantages to Apple that were not available to other companies would have been illegal in Irish law. The country’s corporate tax regime has proved controversial with France and Germany.Still, the Dublin authorities have taken a succession of steps in recent years to unwind the most contentious elements of the regime. Such moves include the elimination of the “stateless” tax structure deployed by Apple to minimise its tax rate in Ireland. Like Apple, Ireland is set to appeal the ruling in the European courts.This is more than a struggle between Brussels, Apple and Ireland. At the root of political concern in Washington is anxiety that profits are held abroad by US companies. In theory at least, forcing Apple to pay back taxes to Ireland would reduce the pool of money that might ultimately be taxed in the US.Last week the US Treasury accused the commission of behaving like a “supranational tax authority” that threatened international tax reform agreements through the inquiries. This was on top of a direct plea from Jack Lew, Treasury secretary, to Jean-Claude Juncker, commission president, to reconsider the investigation. Earlier this year the Senate finance committee urged Mr Lew to consider a double tax rate on European companies if Apple was ordered to pay back taxes to Dublin.Appeals against the ruling will take years to resolve. But ultimately if the commission prevails in court, the decision will reset the balance of power on tax policy in Europe.While governments will still be able to set their own tax rates, the commission will have established itself as a watchful referee of how national rules are implemented.And the example of Apple — and its multibillion-euro bill in back taxes — will be a warning to big global companies to put their affairs in order, at least in Europe.Success on appeal for Apple and Ireland might relieve some of that pressure, and give national governments more leeway.But until then it threatens to upset US-EU relations, potentially further hampering already difficult talks on a trade deal. And for the moment, the commission’s ruling will stand as a severe blow to exotic avoidance strategies.
119;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2016-08-24T18:47:59Z;US in last-ditch effort to quash Brussels tax demand on Apple;Sharp escalation of transatlantic feud over bill for billions of euros;The US has launched a stinging attack on the European Commission in a last-ditch bid to dissuade Brussels from hitting Apple with a demand for billions of euros in underpaid taxes.In a sharp escalation of the transatlantic feud, the US Treasury department issued a rare warning on Wednesday that Brussels was becoming a “supranational tax authority” that threatened international agreements on tax reform.The criticism comes as the European Commission is finalising a probe into an alleged sweetheart tax deal that Ireland granted to Apple, the biggest single case in a crackdown on corporate tax avoidance across the EU. After prolonged delays, a definitive ruling is expected next month. The Obama administration is stepping up its assault on the probe having failed to deter Brussels earlier this year by arguing publicly that it was setting unfair and “disturbing” precedents and singling out US companies. The Apple probe, which began in mid-2013, centres on “transfer pricing”, a practice by which companies move profits to low-tax jurisdictions through internal transactions. The commission has accused the Irish authorities of “reverse engineering” tax opinions to help Apple minimise its tax bill. The company has faced criticism in the US Senate for paying a 2 per cent corporate tax rate in Ireland, far lower than the headline 12.5 per cent rate.In a white paper commissioned by Treasury secretary Jack Lew, the US touched on sensitivities over Brussels’ accountability by suggesting that the novel legal approach of the directorate leading the probe amounted to a power grab. “This shift in approach appears to expand the role of the [competition directorate] beyond enforcement of competition and state aid law . . . into that of a supranational tax authority that reviews member state” decisions on corporate tax, it said. The Obama administration has said little about potential retaliation, but the white paper said “the US Treasury department continues to consider potential responses should the commission continue its present course”.A commission spokeswoman said there was no bias against US groups in the tax clampdown and added that EU law applied indiscriminately to all companies operating in Europe. “The commission has been in contact with US authorities on this matter on several occasions already and remains available to offer all necessary further clarifications,” she said.Earlier this year the Senate finance committee urged Mr Lew to consider imposing a double tax rate on European companies if the commission directed Apple to pay back-taxes in Ireland. Margrethe Vestager, EU competition commissioner, has already directed the Netherlands to recover €20m to €30m in back taxes from Starbucks. Luxembourg must recover a similar amount from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and investigations continue into the retailer Amazon. But the Apple case is much larger, as the underpaid tax could run to billions of euros if the commission rules against Ireland. JPMorgan, investment banker to Apple, has said the company could be on the hook for $19bn in a worst-case scenario. This shift in approach appears to expand the role of the [competition directorate] beyond enforcement of competition and state aid law . . . into that of a supranational tax authorityThe Treasury department said the “commission’s pursuit of retroactive recoveries is not only in tension with the G20’s efforts to emphasise tax certainty, but also sets an undesirable precedent that could lead to other tax authorities . . . [seeking] large and punitive retroactive recoveries from both US and EU companies”.The Irish authorities and Apple are bracing for an adverse ruling, which they would challenge in the European courts. Each has denied that tax rulings issued by Dublin conferred a selective advantage to Apple.Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, has insisted that the company complied fully with tax law and did not do anything wrong. This month he told the Washington Post that if Apple did not get a “fair hearing” in Brussels “then we would obviously appeal it”.The OECD club of rich countries has developed its own guidelines on aggressive transfer-pricing arrangements. The Treasury said the commission’s approach conflicts with these.“In contrast to the OECD [guidelines], no country will have played a role in developing the commission’s guidance, which also would not be incorporated into bilateral tax treaties between the United States and [EU] member states,” the Treasury paper said. It notes that the tax authorities in the US and EU member states have “entire departments whose sole responsibility is to examine transfer pricing issues”, while pointedly referring to the commission as a “non-tax agency”. By taking the side of US companies on the issue, Mr Lew has drawn criticism from anti-avoidance campaigners who say he should be standing up to businesses trying to escape US taxes. Treasury says it is doing a lot of other work to crack down on avoidance.The US’s earlier lobbying efforts included trips to Brussels by Robert Stack, the Treasury official in charge of international tax policy, and a public letter in February from Mr Lew to Jean-Claude Juncker, the commission president.Additional reporting by Tim Bradshaw in San FranciscoUS is levying a new global tax—and it is huge / From Keith CraigJoined-up thinking urged / From Geoff KeyShow some respect — and reciprocal commitment / From James Anderson
120;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2016-07-26T17:00:55Z;McDonald’s new US menu buzz falls flat;Fast-food shares fall as second-quarter sales fall short and industry demand fades;McDonald’s US sales growth slowed in the second quarter, underscoring a fast food industry-wide weakening of demand and raising questions over the longevity of the company’s turnround in its most important market.The chain posted a 1.8 per cent increase in comparable sales at home during the three months to June, despite a weak annual comparison. The rise is slower than the 5.4 per cent rise in the first quarter and missed consensus estimates from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg for a 3.2 per cent increase.The result cements what has been a tough quarter for casual dining and coffee outlets in the world’s largest economy, with companies including Yum Brands, which owns KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, as well as Starbucks and Dunkin ’ Brands all complaining of weak consumer confidence.It also raises questions about whether the promotional buzz over McDonald’s new menu items, the cornerstone of its turnround, is beginning to wane, while competition to lure customers via discounts has intensified.“Broader spending growth is not translating to same-store sales,” warned Jefferies analyst Andy Barish in an industry report on Monday. He added that “the fierce promotional environment and competition from grocery and convenience stores are making it tougher”.McDonald’s total sales for the quarter dropped 4 per cent to $6.27bn as the company sold a portfolio of company-owned stores to franchisees. The sale, which reduces operating costs, helped increase profit margins in its home market, boosting North American operating profits 10 per cent.Earnings fell 1 per cent to $1.25 a share, hit by $230m in one-off charges partly related to its refranchising plan, and the impact of the strong dollar on its overseas profits. Excluding these costs, earnings increased 13 per cent, the company said. Global comparable sales rose 3.1 per cent.Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s chief executive, said: “I am confident in our system’s ability to stay the course and execute our turnround plan to achieve our goals.”We don’t expect Brexit to have a significant impact on our near-term commodity prices in the UKThe company, which derives 10 per cent of profits from Britain, said the impact from the UK vote to leave the EU was mainly from currency fluctuations.The volatility of sterling since the Brexit vote has prompted McDonald’s to increase the amount it expects foreign exchange movements to hit full-year earnings per share to between 9-11 cents, from 5-7 cents before.The broader implications were limited, however. “We don’t expect Brexit to have a significant impact on our near-term commodity prices in the UK,” chief financial officer Kevin Ozan said. “While the long-term impact of Brexit is uncertain, in the near term, the most significant impact on our business will be currency translation.”McDonald’s efforts to reduce the number of its store-owned restaurants could help it circumvent another pressure that the industry is facing: higher wages.It has been the focus of the “Fight for $15” campaign for higher hourly wages across America. McDonald’s has raised wages at its own stores, but as it sells off stores, the onus to raise wages will fall on to the franchisees. It said it did not have plans for a further one-time increase at the moment.Jefferies’ Mr Barish said that across the industry restaurants were facing wage inflation in the mid single-digits on a gross basis.McDonald’s shares were down more than 3 per cent to $123.33 in early New York trading.
121;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2016-07-26T12:26:58Z;McDonald’s drops as sales growth falls short;;Not lovin’ it so much.McDonald’s US sales growth slowed in the second quarter, underscoring an industry-wide weakening of demand at home, and pushing the world’s largest fast-food chain’s shares down 3.4 per cent in pre-market trading.The company reported 1.8 per cent increase in sales at home during the three months to June, far slower than the 5.4 per cent increase in the first quarter and missing consensus estimates from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg for a 3.2 per cent increase, reports Lindsay Whipp.Earlier rivals including Yum Brands, which owns KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, as well as Dunkin Brands and Starbucks reported softer sales blaming weaker consumer confidence.The company said that the increase was helped by its All-Day Breakfast and McPick offer of two items for $5, “despite softening industry growth during the quarter”. In the year-earlier period, US sales fell 2 per cent.Total revenue fell 4 per cent to $6.27bn while earnings fell 1 per cent to $1.25 a share.The company said earlier this month that it would incur a one-off pre-tax charge of $235m, or 20 cents a share (post tax) related to the company’s refranchising plan, general administrative charges and its relocation to central Chicago from the suburbs. It added it expect to incur further charges in forthcoming quarters.Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s chief executive, has been leading a turnround at the company in an attempt to revive domestic sales. The subdued sales in this most recent quarter will raise questions over how sticky the company’s revival at home is if broader consumer demand across the industry is beginning to ease.
122;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Fast-food chains feel bite of faltering US consumer sentiment;Restaurants from Starbucks to KFC wrestle with America’s waning appetite for eating out;Howard Schultz, Starbucks’ chairman and chief executive, did not hold back this week when he said that political and social unrest were partly to blame for his company’s third-quarter earnings miss.He said that there was a “profound weakening in consumer confidence” in the quarter — US comparable sales growth slowed to 4 per cent from 8 per cent last year. Specifically in its home market, uncertainty surrounding the presidential election, civil unrest and heightened racial tensions, as well as worries about terrorism, had raised anxiety he said.“No one should misinterpret or in any way look at the challenges that we and many, many other companies are facing as something that has been done before. This is quite unusual. It’s unsettling,” he added.Mr Schultz, who has been expanding Starbucks’ food offerings, said that the timing of the relaunch of its loyalty programme had also contributed to the earnings miss. But other companies in the sector have also blamed weakening consumer sentiment on slower sales growth, though none have been as specific as Mr Schultz.Dunkin’ Brands, which alongside the doughnut chain also owns Baskin Robbins, on Thursday unveiled weaker than expected earnings and said that consumers had gone into a “bit of a funk” during the quarter. Yum Brands, owner of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, said this month that the US was in “a malaise” and that its sales for the quarter had been soft.Greg Creed, Yum chief executive, added that in a June survey by GenForward of 18- to 30-year-olds three-quarters of them said they believed the US was in decline, a finding he described as “not particularly good news from what people are thinking”.This weak sentiment is reflected in figures from the industry association’s monthly restaurant performance index, which measures a combination of current trends and expectations over the next six months. In May, the index fell 0.9 per cent to 100.6, which at more than 100 still pointed to an expansion but at a slower pace, a trend that has been evident for a number of months.The National Restaurant Association said that the dip was due to a net decline in comparative stores sales for the first time in five months, with expectations for future business conditions reaching their lowest in three and a half years. Retail sales at specialist coffee shops are estimated to rise 4.4 per cent this year, the slowest pace since 2013, according to Euromonitor.Brett Levy, an analyst Deutsche Bank, said that slower jobs growth appeared to be weighing on restaurant sales, which he said had an 80 per cent correlation with comparable revenue growth at restaurants.But broader consumer confidence data are not all gloomy. Figures from the Conference Board, a think-tank, showed a slight improvement in June from May. And while the University of Michigan’s June consumer sentiment index showed that wealthier participants were citing worries about losses from equity investments in the wake of the UK vote to leave the EU, its author expected a rebound in July and August.This suggests there are industry- and company-specific issues at stake for casual dining.Deutsche Bank’s Mr Levy said in a report that the recent dip in sales was “the result of a combination of a springtime traffic slowdown, mixed weather conditions and the ongoing intense promotional cadence . . . leaving few unscathed”.Those promotions include a recently ended offer of two items for $5 at McDonald’s, which its website says will return, while Wendys, the burger chain, has a four for $4 deal and Pizza Hut a $5 value meal.As Starbucks increasingly moves into food it opens itself up to such challenges, while the continuing popularity of independent coffee shops is pushing the company to expand its own high-end roasteries.Competition is not limited to eating out. Supermarkets from Walmart to Kroger have, alongside Wholefoods, been expanding their deli counter ranges and offering in-store freshly cooked pizzas and other meals for customers to eat-in or take home. The more sophisticated supermarket offerings get the bigger threat they pose to cafés and fast-food chains.In the near term, it is eating in that may be causing what analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets have estimated is a 3-5 per cent decline in consumer traffic to casual dining restaurants in recent weeks.Chris O’Cull said: “Several disruptions, ie watching primary debates, watching news coverage of recent events, political conventions, presidential debates, etc have resulted, or may result in, more people staying home and ordering pizza.”

Gold is down $5 at $1,326 an ounce.Also weighing on sentiment on Friday is a sense that the market may have been overestimating the proximity and extent of additional support from central banks.The euro is up 0.1 per cent to $1.1032 after the European Central Bank on Thursday stood pat on policy and gave little indication it was preparing further easing measures to boost the economy, preferring to wait a while to see the extent of any Brexit fallout.Still, some analysts think the ECB could make a move in the autumn.“We think the most likely option for the ECB is to extend quantitative easing beyond March 2017, possibly by 6-9 months. We do not rule out further deposit rate cuts either, although we think these are less likely,” analysts at Barclays said.“Should the negative shock from Brexit be eventually larger than we expect, the ECB may be forced to ease policy further in 2017.”Japan’s Nikkei 225 lost 1.1 per cent and the yen, which at one point on Thursday weakened to ¥107 per dollar, is now ¥105.89 after traders digested comments from Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda that suggested he was not enamoured with the strategy of “helicopter money” as a means of stimulus.The release of Japanese economic data further depressed sentiment on the stock market. July’s Nikkei-Markit “flash” purchasing managers’ index for the manufacturing sector came in at 49, below the 50-mark that separates contraction from expansion and indicating the sector is on track to shrink for a fifth consecutive month.“The beginning of the third quarter signalled worsening operating conditions in the Japanese manufacturing sector,” said Amy Brownbill, economist at Markit, the financial data company.“International demand fell at the sharpest rate in more than three-and-a-half years, with many [survey] panellists blaming the appreciation of the yen leading to a reduction in global competitiveness.”Elsewhere in the region, the Hang Seng fell 0.4 per cent, the Shanghai Composite slipped 0.9 per cent and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 eased 0.3 per cent.An outperformer was New Zealand’s S&P/NZX 50, which rose 0.2 per cent to another record high, in part bolstered by expectations of looming interest rate cuts.
124;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2016-06-28T23:01:26Z;Starbucks’ European unit pays $15m UK tax;Payment follows outcry over US coffee chain’s alleged avoidance;Starbucks has revealed that the London headquarters it set up after a public outcry over alleged tax avoidance paid $15m in UK corporation tax in the 15 months to September.Its European headquarters, which was moved from Amsterdam to London in 2014, employed 71 people in that period and received $185m of royalty and license payments from coffee shops and franchisees across Europe, its accounts show.These royalty payments were for the use of Starbucks’ trademark, know-how and other intellectual property that was valued at $1.6bn in the accounts. Starbucks transferred the IP to its new London headquarters from Alki, a UK partnership that was not liable for tax in the Netherlands or the UK.Starbucks Emea — as the headquarters business is known — announced pre-tax profits of $682m on turnover of $185m. But those profits were inflated by $631m of dividend income that was taxed elsewhere in the group, and interest payments of $27m — leaving a $15m UK tax bill.Employment at Starbucks’ Amsterdam site, which continues to roast and distribute coffee for all of Europe, was stable and totalled 260 people in the period.Separately, Starbucks UK — the operating company that runs its British coffee shops — had revealed in December it was making higher tax payments.Having renegotiated leases on expensive shop sites and posted its largest ever profit, Starbucks UK paid £8.1m in corporation tax in the 12 months to September 2015 — almost as much as its total contribution between 1998 and 2012.News of the $15m UK tax payment by its European headquarters comes as Starbucks seeks to repair the reputational damage it incurred in 2012, when its executives — along with counterparts from Google and Amazon — were involved in heated exchanges with MPs at parliamentary hearings.Following the controversy — in which it was accused of shifting profits out of Britain through the payment of royalties — the company made a voluntary corporation tax contribution of £20m.$631mStarbucks Emea dividend income taxed elsewhere in the groupBut the company is still embroiled in a big tax controversy after being forced by Brussels to pay about €25.5m — including €2.5m of interest — to the Dutch government following allegations of a “sweetheart” deal. It intends to appeal against the decision, which was published in full by the European Commission this week.Next month, Starbucks is set to pay the last instalment of the tax it allegedly underpaid in the seven years to 2014. However, it did not make a provision for the payment in its accounts because it expects the decision to be overturned. It believes there are errors of both fact and law in the commission’s decision.“Starbucks shares the concerns expressed by the Netherlands government that there are significant errors in the decision, and we plan to appeal since we followed the Dutch and OECD rules available to anyone,” the company said.It added the €25.5m demand was not material, citing its global tax payments of $3.8bn over the seven years in question.It said: “Starbucks complies with all OECD rules, guidelines and laws, and supports its tax reform process. Starbucks has paid an average global effective tax rate of roughly 33 per cent, well above the 18.5 per cent average rate paid by other large US companies.”
125;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2016-06-20T23:15:05Z;Local chains take on coffee giants;Southeast Asia’s caffeine hit could be bad news for larger groups;Not long after Starbucks made its first foray into Ho Chi Minh City in 2013, a local coffee chain called Phuc Long presented a direct challenge to the international brand.Starbucks set up shop on a main intersection of Ly Tu Trong street in the city’s District 1. Phuc Long’s store opened a few paces away. Its logo was similarly green and white, its interiors were comparably pristine and modern and it offered its customers a considerable discount on the price of a Starbucks cappuccino. Since then, the Vietnamese chain has sought to attract other would-be Starbucks’ clients, opening in large office buildings and shopping centres across the city.The incumbent does not seem worried. “While the food and beverage space has become very competitive in Vietnam, Starbucks has a total of 20 stores across Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi that are doing well,” says Alain Cany, country chairman for Hong Kong-based Jardine Matheson. “We plan to have 30 nationwide by the end of the year.” The Starbucks franchise in Vietnam belongs to Maxim’s Group, Hong Kong’s largest food and beverage group, founded by local businessman James Wu, in which Jardine Matheson now owns a 50 per cent stake.Despite competition from local chains, Starbucks is perceived as a premium brand among Vietnam’s upper-middle classes. While Ho Chi Minh’s café scene is already one of Asia’s most diverse, with an abundance of independent cafés and domestic chains serving sophisticated varieties of fresh roasted coffees, there is potential for more growth.A quarterly survey by FT Confidential Research of 1,000 consumers in each of the five biggest economies in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (excluding Singapore) in 2015 found that Vietnam was the only country where Starbucks was not ranked as the most frequently visited chain thanks to prevalence of homegrown favourites Trung Nguyên and Highlands Coffee. FTCR gauges popular sentiment towards macroeconomic and political trends.While the regional dominance of Starbucks and other international coffee chains has been well established, a surge in the establishment of independent cafés across Southeast Asia’s capital cities presents a long-term challenge to the bigger and better-known brands.Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital, is a notable example, where per capita coffee consumption is growing at about 5 per cent annually, although this remains below many countries in Asean and East Asia according to the London-based International Coffee Organization.Indonesian chains such as Coffee Toffee, Ngopi Doeloe and Anomali Coffee are multiplying, and the independent café and organic coffee concept has also developed strong roots. Similar trends are being seen in Kuala Lumpur, Manila, and Bangkok, according to FT Confidential surveys.Independent chains are also successfully expanding in Asean’s frontier markets, including Dao Coffee Shop in Laos, Brown Coffee in Cambodia, and Coffee Circles and Espressonite in Yangon, Myanmar.While the size of the urban middle classes in these countries remains comparatively small, Starbucks, Costa Coffee, and The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf have all made recent initial forays into Phnom Penh, while regional chains such as Thailand’s Black Canyon are expanding in both Cambodia and Myanmar.Indonesia and Vietnam hold the greatest long-term potential for growth for many consumer industries targeting Southeast Asia thanks to favourable demographics and high per-capita consumption levels.But the Philippines is still the region’s most dynamic growth market for the fast-food sector, partly because of the established dominance of local chains owned by Jollibee Foods and smaller groups like Max’s Restaurant. No other states in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations have homegrown fast-food chains of similar scale.Fast-food culture has taken hold in the Philippines because of rapid urbanisation, cultural affinities with the US and the rise in many cities of outsourcing industries where staff work all night.But there are indications that the scope for domestic growth for Jollibee has begun to plateau. FT Confidential Research, an analysis company in the FT group, conducted surveys of 1,000 consumers between 2013-15 that found the preference for Jollibee had declined slightly, albeit from a high base.There are signs of growing competition, too, from the likes of McDonald’s, whose franchise holder, Golden Arches Development, is planning 30-40 new restaurants this year, bringing the nationwide total to more than 500. McDonald’s has been successful in tapping parts of the sector at Jollibee’s expense, notably the breakfast market.Also there is new competition, according to Felipe Salvosa, Philippines researcher at FT Confidential. First, the push by domestic food and beverage groups such as Bistro Group, which is launching casual dining outlets across Manila, including local franchises for American chains TGI Fridays and, potentially, Texas Roadhouse and Denny’s. Then there is the growing popularity of restaurants such as Vikings Luxury Buffet, an increasingly ubiquitous feature of Filipino shopping centres that offer package deals on food and alcohol. Convenience chains such as FamilyMart, Lawson, Ministop and 7-Eleven have also expanded into cooked food. These chains now compete directly for the custom of the growing ranks of night-owl workers.In response, Jollibee has sought to expand overseas, targeting the Filipino diaspora. It has paid $100m for a 40 per cent stake in US-based Smashburger. Jollibee has established footholds in the US, China, and other parts of Asia and the Middle East.The chart on this page has been amended. An earlier version showed Seatlle’s Best as the second ranked coffee chain in Malaysia.
126;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2016-06-02T21:42:49Z;Beer giant AB Inbev makes push into tea;;Anheuser-Busch InBev, the 800lb gorilla of the beer brewing industry, is making a push into the tea business.The brewer behind Budweiser and Stella Artois said on Thursday that it was teaming up with Starbucks to produce, distribute and market a ready to drink bottled version of the coffee company’s Teavana tea.“Starbucks will contribute Teavana’s tea expertise, industry-leading retail activation, and consumer engagement capabilities, and Anheuser-Busch will lead production, bottling and distribution to retailers nationwide in partnership with its long-standing and well-established network of wholesalers,” the companies said.For Starbucks, the partnership is the latest move by the Seattle-based chain to diversify its business and expand its presence in grocery aisles. Analysts at Stifel reckon in a recent note that Starbucks already has a 76 per cent of the US ready to drink coffee market through its range of energy, coffee, Frappuccino and Tazo tea drinks.For AB Inbev, the world’s biggest brewer, the team up is also a way for it to diversify away from the beer business where growth has been stagnating.The duo expects to launch the product in the first half of 2017.

There’s an app for that;Technology trialled in England could connect citizens with infrastructure companies;Your bicycle plunges into a pothole and breaks a wheel. The park bins are overflowing after a hot summer’s day. Road signs block the entrance to your street all weekend but no labourers are to be seen.Now there is an app for that.A new technology called Changify will allow anyone to take a photo and post a message straight to the private-sector contractor responsible, bypassing the local authority’s complaints service. Created by a start-up called Design4SocialChange, the app is one of a host of new digital services that are beginning to transform the way infrastructure is managed worldwide.It has been successfully trialled in Plymouth, southern England, where contractors including Serco, Amey (owned by Ferrovial), Atkins and Cisco have signed up. Authorities in Berlin, Barcelona, Hamburg and Singapore are also in talks to buy the licence while Uber, the taxi service, has been approached to buy it so its drivers can rate roads in much the same way that passengers rate drivers.The technology has been designed by Priya Prakash, a former Nokia smartphone designer, who is aiming to tap into the £400bn a year market for smart urban systems. Such systems use technology to help better manage cities, such as cameras that detect when people are smoking in prohibited zones or park sprinklers that can assess the dryness of the ground.“We are getting people to solve urban challenges by sharing their data to help prioritise what needs to be improved in the city infrastructure in real time,” says Ms Prakash. “You’re already running down the road or walking, but you can use the data to change your neighbourhood.”The appeal for contractors is that they are quick to be made aware of what projects to prioritise, while responding to problems should help them win further contracts with local authorities.We are getting people to solve urban challenges by sharing their data . . . You’re already running down the road or walking, but you can use the data to change your neighbourhoodMs Prakash previously worked on an early version of the BBC’s on-demand service iPlayer, where she became interested in the idea of how people could be encouraged to be “citizen journalists” reporting on events that they see in real time.“I want people to have agency over the data and vote in real time over how cities are run,” she says. “It’s closing the loop between the community, and the service providers.”Mobile operating technologies such as this will become the norm over the next 20 years for city authorities, she adds.Iñigo Jodra, cities director at Ferrovial Services Centre of Excellence for Cities, said Changify “anticipates how urban services will be designed in the future”, with “citizen empowerment at the heart of how they operate”.If you live on this road, you have an emotional connection. You actually have a relationship with your own pavement, and if you can fix that, you rockPrevious attempts to manage infrastructure using smart technologies have occasionally sparked resentment because they failed to involve those affected. In the state of Illinois, in the US, for example, a group of activists called the Naperville Smart Meter Awareness group sued local officials over smart meters installed in homes and businesses that monitored power usage and were capable of communicating with smart appliances. Opponents said the meters were intrusive and had health issues because of what they called “dirty electricity”.Changify encourages contractors to provide information on the cost, length, progress of and problems with a project, while consumers are encouraged to endorse or criticise proposals.“It is not about fixing every issue but about getting locals to tell contractors which issues are most important. It’s creating priorities,” says Ms Prakash. “If you live on this road, you have an emotional connection. You actually have a relationship with your own pavement, and if you can fix that, you rock, you’ve done something great. It might not be climate change but it’s a step in the right direction.”

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
129;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2016-05-01T10:44:06Z;Pub groups wake up and smell the coffee;The line between bars and coffee shops is increasingly blurred;A man walks into a bar and asks for a latte macchiato.That might have been a joke in the past. But, faced with high rents, falling alcohol consumption and competition from supermarkets, pub groups and breweries are increasingly relying on alternative revenue streams — such as quality coffee — to entice customers through their doors.Fuller’s, the independent brewery, opened its first standalone coffee shop in 2014 and now sells almost 2m hot drinks a year. Wetherspoons, the pub chain, began serving filter coffee with free refills for 99p last year, and says it now sells more than 1m cups every week.“We are clearly seeing that the purpose of visiting a Fuller’s pub is as likely to be for food or a coffee as it is for an alcoholic drink,” says chief executive Simon Emeny. “The smoking ban was the catalyst for pubs to broaden their potential market, and we now take coffee incredibly seriously. Sales are growing by double digits every year.”The trend is also working in reverse, as UK mass market and independent coffee shop chains fire back by introducing alcoholic drinks.“Coffee shops and pubs are moving into each other’s territory because they’re both under pressure,” says Jeffrey Young, chief executive of research group Allegra. “Coffee shops are doing it because growth is slowing, and pubs are doing it to survive.”One factor, according to people in the industry, is that “hipster” consumers are making the same demands — for organic ingredients and local sourcing — whatever they are drinking.Nick Tolley, founder of independent London-based coffee house Taylor St. Baristas, says one motivation behind the move into alcohol is “to make use of dead rent, to exploit a different part of the day and to get more bang for your buck”.But he adds: “The other is that it’s a tangential alignment of values — we’re not selling Kronenbourg or Stella, the wines and beers we’re stocking are from small wineries and breweries, and they’re organic and green, much like our coffee.”BrewDog, the Scottish craft brewer that this month bought a 33 per cent stake in Edinburgh-based upmarket coffee chain Third Wave, says “the people who appreciate craft beer often also have a taste for speciality coffee”.Big coffee chains Starbucks and Pret-a-Manger are also embracing the trend for craft beer, introducing it alongside wine in certain stores to accompany hot evening meals.Starbucks, which already sells alcohol in 300 US stores, says a successful trial in Stansted airport led it to introduce menus “for the late afternoon and evening” in three other franchises at airports and train stations in the UK.It says it intends to expand the scheme as it looks to respond to changing consumer habits.Analysts say that particularly for the bigger coffee sellers, the move into alcohol is motivated by a slowdown in the growth of coffee sales.“There’s been so much growth in coffee that for ages the big players didn’t need to do much else — they were struggling to deal with the demand for coffee as it was, and were focused on keeping a clear brand identity,” says Mr Young at Allegra. “But now, with growth slowing, and under increasing pressure from small independents, they’ve had to act.”Data from Euromonitor show that growth in coffee sales is slowing: between 2010 and 2014, total sales at UK coffee shops grew by an average of 12.5 per cent year on year. In 2014-2015, that dropped to just 2.2 per cent.Costa Coffee, the coffee chain owned by Whitbread, is one of the groups struggling in the face of increased competition from independent coffee houses selling artisanal brews. The company, which has more than 2,000 branches, has lost almost a third of its value over the past year. Last month, Alison Brittain, chief executive, said a decline in high street footfall was hurting coffee sales.Stonegate, one of the UK’s largest pub companies, says it has attempted a format that blends the atmosphere of a pub with that of a coffee shop to appeal to more demanding student customers.“Students don’t just want cheap beer and lots of volume now — they want something more sophisticated,” says Simon Longbottom, chief executive
130;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2016-04-29T17:35:23Z;Too many boardrooms display a ‘conspiracy against the public’;A gulf has opened up between owners and other stakeholders, writes Philip Augar;"On a cool May morning in 2006 a group of garishly dressed people preceded by a small camel paraded across London’s Clapham Common. They carried placards bearing a quotation from Matthew 19:24: “Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”These were members of the GMB trade union making their way to Holy Trinity Church, where a leading private equity boss worshipped. They were protesting the methods used by private equity and their small procession was part of an imaginative campaign that attracted attention but achieved little reform in the rip-roaring days of 2006.The financial crisis that erupted two years later might have prompted a rethink. Evidently not. This week’s collapse of the retailer BHS suggests that the methods identified by the GMB 10 years ago — tax-efficient dividend-stripping leaving employees and pensioners vulnerable — persisted. That they did so is symptomatic of a largely unreconstructed model of capitalism.BHS is not even the most egregious example of the disequilibrium between business owners and managers, and other stakeholders. Indeed, current events suggest that 21st capitalism still has an under-developed sense of responsibility to the world it serves. Examples can be found in many areas, but the focus here is where the chain between irresponsible behaviour and money is the shortest, namely tax avoidance, customer deception and excessive pay.Tax issues include corporations operating in high-tax countries and booking profits in low-tax regimes, and avoidance on a breathtaking scale as revealed by the Panama Papers. A whole industry exists to advise wealthy individuals and businesses how to minimise their tax bills, overwhelming the resources of the authorities and lobbying governments to keep legislation loose.The line between legitimate advertising and customer deception has been crossed often. In many industries, such as banking, customers have become regarded as a means to an end. Traditional values of service as a decent act, as the right thing to do, have been lost amid fraudulent emissions tests and the sale of expensive, unnecessary insurance policies.Current events suggest that 21st capitalism still has an under-developed sense of responsibility to the world it servesExecutive pay has detached itself from the value created by the recipient and the earnings of ordinary people. Certain chief executives brazenly expect increased reward irrespective of performance, while paying employees the minimum wage on flimsy contracts.Some progress has been made. Amazon, which at one time paid only £12m of UK tax on over £5bn sales to British shoppers, now books its sales in the country of the buyer’s address and pays tax accordingly. Starbucks paid nearly as much corporation tax in 2015 as it did in its first 14 years in the UK. Banks such as Barclays have wound up aggressive tax avoidance units; the big accounting firms have toned down their tax advice.The word “transparency” now appears in most annual reports. Finance and energy companies supply their customers with explanations of tariffs and charges. Following pressure from health advocates, Mars Food plans to tell customers to eat some of its products only once a week to maintain a balanced diet. Heavy sanctions, such as fines for banks that mis-sold payment protection insurance, have forced managements to treat customers more fairly.Board remuneration committees have become more forensic in assessing executive pay. Deferred payments and bonus clawbacks are becoming standard features, while dissident shareholders in the US and UK have voted against executive pay packages. The head of the Co-op group has asked for a 60 per cent cut to his total pay package to reflect the fact that his job had become simpler.Superficial changes or a reflection of a deep-seated change in business culture? The weight of evidence suggests that for all the progress, responsible capitalism is not yet stitched into the corporate fabric and nor will it be until the business paradigm changes.Business people, as Adam Smith observed in 1776 in The Wealth of Nations, have a tendency towards “a conspiracy against the public” but the age of irresponsible capitalism really began with the shareholder value movement 200 years later. The ideas of the American academic Alfred Rappaport were seized by consultants and investment bankers, and brutalised into the notion that everything was justified in the interests of shareholders.At the same time, fund management moved from the long-term business of serving the needs of pensioners and savers into a results-driven game of quarterly performance. Institutions egged on companies to deliver short-term results. The response was ruthless cost-cutting, financial engineering and aggressive acquisitions. Regulators and governments encouraged the rising tide of economic liberalisation and backed off in the belief that business worked best if it was left to its own devices.The result was the spate of irresponsible behaviour we have been witnessing, but despite the modest progress described above, no new paradigm has replaced shareholder value.Enlightened managements now speak of shareholder value being a consequence of good business, not a prior objective, but the interests of other stakeholders have little traction. Until that changes, there are no grounds to believe that it will be possible to reverse a deeply entrenched culture in which selfishness is endemic.Meanwhile, over on Clapham Common, the camel is 10 years older, the rich are richer still and the eye of the needle remains exactly the same size.The writer, author of several books about banking and business, is currently working on a book about Barclays"
131;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2016-04-22T07:33:41Z;Sliding yen dominates markets;;Markets action is dominated by a sharp drop in the yen on reports the Bank of Japan is considering negative interest rate loans, helping the Tokyo stock market outperform the region.Meanwhile, another bounce for oil prices is underpinning broader market sentiment, writes Jamie Chisholm.The pan-European Stoxx 600 is opening down 0.3 per cent after the FTSE Asia Pacific index fell 0.5 per cent. US index futures suggest the S&P 500 will hold steady at around the close of 2,091.5.The Wall Street barometer sits only 40 points below last May’s record, having rallied nearly 15 per cent from February’s trough, partly on hopes that the first quarter company earnings season may prove better than analysts’ forecasts.Unfortunately, the latest batch of results released after the closing bell on Thursday, including numbers Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Starbucks, have not been well-received, weighing on S&P 500 futures overnight.However, the recent stock market rebound also occurred as central banks’ ultra-loose policies ensured bond yields were suppressed, making stocks relatively more attractive, and as a rally in oil prices reduced fears about stress in the energy sector.And both of those factors may be providing support to investors’ risk appetite on Friday.The price of Brent crude is up 1.4 per cent to $45.16 a barrel, less than a buck shy of a five-month high. In January, Brent hit a 12-year low of $27.10, but has risen on hopes that falling US production growth and steadier output from other large pumpers may help crimp a global supply glut.Meanwhile, Friday sees further evidence of how important investors perceive central bank policy to be in setting the market tone. The yen is 0.9 per cent weaker at ¥110.40 per dollar after Bloomberg reported the BoJ was considering helping financial institutions to lend by offering negative borrowing costs on some loans.The BoJ is due to give its latest policy update next week, and it will be pleased to see that the dollar has strengthened from its 17-month low of ¥107.61 hit on April 11.The exporter-sensitive Nikkei 225 stock average, which tends to sport a fairly tight correlation to the dollar/yen exchange rate, rose a further 1.2 per cent, a fourth consecutive gain that took it to an 11-week high.A closely watched survey by Nikkei-Markit showed that activity in Japan’s manufacturing sector fell this month to its lowest level since January 2013. An earthquake last week and aftershocks on the southern island of Kyushu have disrupted supply chains, while the recent resilience of the yen is also keeping pressure on manufacturers.Other Asian bourses were more concerned by Wall Street’s overnight pullback and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dipped 0.8 per cent while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 eased 0.7 per cent, with resources groups wary that a recent rally in some important commodities may not last.The price of Iron ore, the steelmaking ingredient, this week surged to its highest in 15 months, approaching $70 a tonne. However, Australian miners were lower on Friday as investors reflected upon comments in the previous session from BHP Billiton’s head of Australian operations that the recent rally in the iron ore price may have run its course.Back in currencies, the euro is up just 6 pips at $1.1292, much steadier after the volatility of the previous session which came as traders digested the European Central Bank’s decision to keep its ultra-loose monetary policy unchanged. It had cut interest rates further into negative territory and boosted the size of its quantitative easing programme in March.The yield on German 10-year Bunds are barely changed at 0.23 per cent and equivalent maturity US Treasuries are up 1 basis point at 1.88 per centGold, which also had a whipsaw session on Thursday as it tracked moves in the dollar, is down $4 at $1,244 an ounce.

Meanwhile, same-store sales in China and Asia Pacific rose 3 per cent, missing forecasts for 4.6 per cent growth.The news came alongside profits that climbed to $575.1m or 39 cents a share, compared with $494.9m or 33 cents a share in the year ago period. Sales rose 9 per cent to $4.99bn. Analysts on Wall Street had forecast earnings of 38 cents a share, on sales of $5bn.Despite concerns about an economic slowdown in China, Starbucks made an aggressive push into the Asian country, stating in January that it plans to open at least 500 more stores in mainland China this year. The company has also diversified away from just coffee with Teavana and La Boulange bakery.Starbucks has credited its overall sales growth in part to its loyalty programme. Membership in the programme increased 16 per cent in the second quarter from a year ago, and 8 per cent sequentially. But analysts have warned that recently-announced changes to its popular customer loyalty programme could be a drag on traffic trends in coming quarters.Starbucks shares have advanced nearly 48 per cent since the beginning of last year.
133;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2016-04-19T08:27:36Z;Brussels Briefing: Vestager vs Google 2.0;;"This is Tuesday’s edition of our daily Brussels Briefing. To receive it every morning in your email in-box, sign up here.The list of big American tech companies being investigated by Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition chief, for either antitrust violations or sweetheart tax deals already reads like a “who’s who” of Silicon Valley: Google, Amazon, Apple. Her proclivity for going after US companies, particularly in her tax investigations (American non-tech groups like McDonald’s and Starbucks have also been targeted), has already raised eyebrows in Washington, where Treasury officials and members of Congress have accused her of an anti-American bias.Ms Vestager has denied singling out US firms, and if she is at all chastened by the American criticism, she’s not showing it: as early as tomorrow, she is expected to roll out a second antitrust case against Google, this time accusing the California company of abusing its dominant position in smartphone operating systems to foist its suite of apps on unsuspecting consumers.In a speech yesterday, the former Danish economy minister compared Google’s practices to the mother of all EU-US tech antitrust cases, the 1990s-era battle with Microsoft. The comparison is apt for two reasons. First is for the reason Ms Vestager intended: during the time when computing was dominated by PCs, desktops running Microsoft’s ubiquitous Windows operating systems would come “bundled” with a wide range of other Microsoft software, most importantly its Explorer internet browser. Such bundling gradually destroyed browser inventor (and onetime market leader) Netscape, since nobody needed its Navigator browser if your PC came with Explorer.In essence, Microsoft became a victim of its own success: in antitrust law, things that would normally be seen as mere aggressive business practices – like giving away free software when you buy an operating system – become market abuses when your company achieves a dominant position and can essentially shut out competitors.In mobile phones, Google has similarly become a victim of its own success. Once dominated by Apple’s iPhone, the market has drastically swung towards handsets running Google’s Android system. Gartner, the technology research group, says more than 80 per cent of all smartphones shipped globally last year ran Android; Apple’s iOS accounted for only about 13 per cent.But this dramatic change is illustrative of why Ms Vestager’s comparison to Microsoft is valid for a second, less charitable reason: in a rapidly changing technological world, today’s dominator is yesterday’s obsolescent. A decade ago, regulators believed desktops running Windows would control computing forever; now, web-based software and the rise of mobile devices have left Microsoft scrambling to play catch up. Much more recently, iPhones and iPads seemed to have a lock on mobile computing; now, Android is ascendant.Can antitrust regulators really foster competition in an industry where creative destruction is already the rule? Ms Vestager appears about to give it another try.What we’re readingAfter four months of partisan bickering, it now finally seems like the Spanish political system is bowing to the inevitable and is heading to new elections. The last, best hope for forming a coalition government between the second, third and fourth place finishers in December’s inconclusive poll was blown apart yesterday when the third-pace party, far-left Podemos, announced 88 per cent of its party members had voted against the deal. Chances of Podemos agreeing to the coalition agreement reached by between the Socialists and anti-establishment Ciudadanos party were already slim ahead of last-gasp talks headed by King Felipe, which begin on Monday. The Spanish daily El País reports that the Socialists, the second largest party and the one which still has the king’s mandate, have not given up just yet. But as El Mundo notes, the Socialists have no plans to seek a grand coalition with the centre-right Popular party, the largest group, or renounce its deal with Ciudadanos to form a pan-leftist coalition. So any eleventh-hour surprise seems unlikely.Meanwhile, the other government-less EU country, Ireland, is no closer to building a coalition, either. Talks between incumbent Fine Gael and opposition Fianna Fáil resumed yesterday on the possibility of forming a grand coalition, but the Irish Times reports that there is little hope a deal will be struck by tomorrow, when another parliamentary effort to elect a prime minister is scheduled. Indeed, no vote may be held at all this week. The Irish Independent reports that Fine Gael’s talks with independent MPs, who are so numerous in the new parliament that they could help form a coalition government, are going no better.The UK Treasury published its 200-page treatise on what might happen if Britain left the EU after its June 23 referendum on membership, and the forecasts were not pretty. It compared staying in a “reformed” EU to three alternate scenarios, and found all lacking: the UK economy would be 4 per cent smaller if it adopted a Norway-style membership of the common market, but not the EU; 6 per cent smaller with a free-trade deal; and 9.5 per cent smaller under normal World Trade Organisation arrangements. The FT’s chief economics guru Chris Giles found the study to have its strengths and weaknesses, but overall may have underplayed the Brexit risks by underestimating the “shock” of leaving. The Daily Telegraph reports that eurosceptics accused George Osborne, the UK finance minister, of being “unpatriotic” for “talking the country down”.Amidst fears that their tough new anti-migrant deal with Turkey will shift the flow of refugees coming to Europe back to North Africa, EU foreign ministers last night moved towards expanding their naval mission off the coast of Libya. The decision came amidst reports of another refugee tragedy at sea: the BBC said survivors tell a tale of 500 dead after a wooden boat carrying migrants capsized after leaving Libya. Some EU capitals, particularly Rome, have been urging a Turkey-style refugee return deal between the EU and North African countries, and as the Wall Street Journal notes in its account of the foreign ministers’ meeting, the EU is desperate to shore up the nascent internationally-recognised Libyan government so Brussels will have someone to work with on asylum issues.Helmut Kohl, the ailing former German chancellor, is making a rare outing into the political fray today by hosting Viktor Orban, the Hungarian prime minister who has emerged as the EU’s leading voice against Middle East migration, at his home in the southwest town of Ludwigshafen. Die Welt reports that Mr Orban’s team discreetly approached 86-year-old, who was Angela Merkel’s predecessor as head of Germany’s Christian Democrats and her onetime patron, about a quiet meeting – but that Mr Kohl decided to publicise the gathering more widely. The meeting comes just two days after Mr Kohl penned an op-ed in the Berlin daily Der Tagesspiegel saying that he largely agreed with Mr Orban’s views, adding: “Europe cannot be the home to millions of refugees.”"

It also posted a steep drop in quarterly earnings and revenues. However, profits were better than analysts expected.New York-based Alcoa also dimmed its sales outlook for its engineered products unit for this year to $6bn-$6.2bn, from a previous estimate of $7bn.The news came as the company worked to split the division from its upstream operations. Its shares declined 2.7 per cent to $9.47.Marathon Oil, an oil exploration and production company, rallied after announcing plans to sell $950m in assets as it looked to shore up its balance sheet amid the sustained period of low crude prices.As part of the plans, Marathon will divest all of its Wyoming upstream and midstream assets for $870m.The shares shot higher by 12.4 per cent to $13.12. However, they are still down 54.6 per cent over the past 12 months.At the close of trade, the S&P 500 had risen 1 per cent to 2,062, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9 per cent to 17,721, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.8 per cent to 4,872.The S&P 500 energy sector posted the biggest advance by a wide margin, rallying 2.8 per cent.The gain came as US crude prices rose 4.5 per cent to $42.17 a barrel, extending a recent advance. Financials and materials also performed well.

The drop is the stock’s biggest one day fall in more than 2 months.
136;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Why one size doesn’t fit all;‘The most notorious example of this “compromise effect” is our tendency to plump for the second-cheapest bottle on the wine list’;"Most Tuesday afternoons, in the lazy late hour between the end of school and the start of Brownies, you can find me ensconced in the café of the local Marks and Spencer, sipping a hot chocolate with the younger Miss Harford.Recently, the café has taken the unusual step of radically simplifying the drinks menu. All the standards are there, of course: tea, cappuccino, hot chocolate. But the size options have been covered over with masking tape. Gone are the “small” and the “large”. Now you can have any size of hot beverage you like, as long as it’s medium.I did ponder registering a note of protest, since a medium hot chocolate contains more sugar than any Brownie can handle. (For reasons that escape me, hot chocolate dodged George Osborne’s much-vaunted new tax on sugary drinks.) But when I perused the comments book, I realised that my own complaint would barely register amid pages of objections from the café’s octogenarian customers.Perhaps M&S hopes to save money by rationalising the crockery. Or perhaps they simply guess that simplicity is attractive. A few years ago, Debenhams, another British household name with a frumpy image, tried the slogan “Say goodbye to coffee confusion”. Debenhams rebranded cappuccino as “frothy coffee” and caffè latte as “really, really milky coffee”, winning headlines for the most patronising publicity stunt in living memory.But simplicity can sell. A famous study by psychologists Sheena Iyengar and Mark Lepper offered samples of speciality jam to customers of a high-end supermarket. (Loyal readers may recall the column I wrote about this in November 2009.) Offered a choice of six types of jam, a third of customers went on to make a purchase. Offered a choice of 24, almost nobody did. Iyengar and Lepper concluded that choice can overwhelm and discourage us.Yet it is unclear how widespread this “choice demotivates” effect is. The original Iyengar-Lepper results, like many in psychology, seem to be fragile. Several follow-up studies have failed to find evidence for the effect. (There is no shame in this; that’s science at work.)Many successful businesses, from supermarkets to Starbucks, offer a vast range without scaring away their customers. A first-time visitor to Starbucks might be confused, but regulars work it out. And clever design can prevent choice seeming overwhelming. Starbucks offers about 100,000 drink combinations — millions, once the syrups are taken into account — but the menu seems much simpler than that.What surprised me about M&S’s decision to serve only one size of drink was that it was giving up three advantages. The first is the simplest: offering more choice lets people get closer to exactly what they desire. I want a small drink for a small child — why not sell it to me?The second advantage is subtler: a company can offer drinks with different margins, in the hope that they can present a bargain to price-sensitive customers, while hoovering up more from customers who are more carefree with their cash. Much of the input cost of a pricey large hot chocolate — staff time, rent, space in the dishwasher — is the same for the cheaper small hot chocolate. By offering more profitable larger drinks alongside the small ones, a café can attract bargain-hunters while still profiting from lavish spenders.There’s a third advantage to offering a wide number of choices: the extreme choices frame the central ones and can influence what customers buy. The late Amos Tversky, an influential psychologist, once pointed to a Williams-Sonoma bread maker that went on sale for $279 and was a flop. When another bread maker hit the shelves, priced at $429, sales of the original model surged. Why? Well, customers weren’t sure that they wanted to buy a bread maker, nor what price might be reasonable, until they had a choice of two. Suddenly the choice became clear: if they did want to buy a bread maker, they wanted the cheaper one.The pattern behind this behaviour was demonstrated more rigorously in research by Tversky and Itamar Simonson: you can boost demand for a £400 camera by placing it next to a £4,000 camera, or a £200 handbag next to a £1,000 handbag. Offer three options and people choose the middle one. Offer several and people avoid the extremes. The most notorious example of this “compromise effect” is our tendency to plump for the second-cheapest bottle on the wine list.Starbucks seems to understand the compromise effect very well. Its menu includes the colossal “trente” — that’s 30 US ounces, more than one-and-a-half British pints or nearly a litre. It omits the far more practical 8oz “short” cappuccino. The effect is to change our sense of what the compromise choice is. A16oz “grande”, three times the size of a classic Italian cappuccino, no longer seems like a milky behemoth but a happy medium.The curious thing is that the short cappuccino is available on request. Starbucks want to be able to offer a drink that is something close to a properly sized cappuccino, but they don’t want that option cluttering up their menu and pulling customers towards smaller, less profitable products.M&S tells me that medium is the most popular size of drink. Of course it is. They’re experimenting with the simplification in a few locations to see how it works out. Good for them; you never know until you try. But the complaints book suggests the experiment may be short-lived.Tim Harford is the author of ‘The Undercover Economist Strikes Back’. Twitter @TimHarfordIllustration by Harry Haysom"
137;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2016-03-31T04:51:45Z;Living wage: Seattle’s wage rise could sting in recession;As UK introduces minimum wage rises on Friday, Seattle experiment is still untested;"In downtown Seattle on a Wednesday morning, diners at Miller’s Guild, an upscale eatery, are quietly choosing between breakfast dishes like smoked salmon torta and bavette with eggs.But in a few months another item will start showing up on diners’ bills: a mandatory service charge of 18 per cent, which the restaurant is using to help offset an increased minimum wage.Seattle, a city of 650,000 that is home to Amazon and Starbucks, has become a testing ground for one of the world’s most ambitious minimum wage hikes, and an example to the UK, which introduces its own minimum wage experiment on Friday.Seattle’s plan, passed in 2014, will raise the minimum hourly wage by 50 per cent in just two years, with the minimum wage reaching $15 per hour next year for large businesses.A growing number of US cities and states are following suit. California Governor Jerry Brown announced on Monday that state legislators and labour leaders had agreed on a $15 minimum wage bill — the first of its kind in the US — which will be voted on by the state assembly. Cities including San Francisco and Portland are phasing in $15 hourly wages.Seattle is still seen as a special test case. “You can think of this as kind of the ideal conditions in which to raise the minimum wage,” said Jacob Vigdor, a policy professor at the University of Washington. “Seattle has a booming labour market, and a booming real estate market. There is a lot of wealth in Seattle.”When the first wage hike took effect last April, unemployment stood at a seven-year low, at 3.7 per cent, in King County, which includes Seattle.Unemployment has ticked up since then, reaching 5.2 per cent in January, but economists caution against reading too much into the numbers because they are not seasonally adjusted.Mr Vigdor is leading a research team commissioned by the city of Seattle that is studying the wage increase, and said it could be “another couple of years” before the impacts are fully understood.At restaurants like Miller’s Guild the impact is much more immediate. “That hit is huge to the bottom line,” said Jason Wilson, the owner and executive chef at Miller’s Guild. The change will mean a 50 per cent hourly raise for servers, who also make tips.Mr Wilson’s answer is the mandatory service charge, which will replace tips and be distributed between wait staff and kitchen staff.In the kitchen, the staff are already paid more than the minimum wage because of the tight labour market (although they do not make tips).Even a dishwasher makes $14 per hour — and Mr Wilson said these jobs are hard to fill. “We see it as a big gap in the labour pool right now,” he said, adding that the construction boom in downtown Seattle has made it harder to fill entry-level kitchen jobs.Many other restaurants are simply raising prices to deal with the shift. A recent survey found that this was the most common response — for businesses whose clientele can afford it.Not all businesses have that option. Miller’s Guild sits in Seattle’s bustling business district, just a stone’s throw from the Amazon campus, and Mr Wilson is optimistic that its mandatory service charge will not scare customers away. But the southern half of the city is poorer than the northern half; and business owners are more likely to reduce worker hours in response to the wage increase.“It is a different story in the south side of town,” said Mr Vigdor. “Businesses there report that they are less confident they will be able to pass costs along to customers.”One other question facing Seattle is what happens when the boom times end. “When there is this next recession, do we see a greater degree of unravelling in Seattle versus elsewhere?” Mr Vigdor said. The minimum wage may have one impact when the economy is booming, and a different one when it is not."
138;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2016-03-16T15:10:22Z;The Budget’s sugar tax is half-baked;It seems strange to take the view that only soft drinks pose a risk, writes Tim Harford;I’m all in favour of a sugar tax, as I wrote in the FT Magazine on Saturday. It’s a shame, then, that — despite the headlines to the contrary — George Osborne hasn’t introduced one.His proposal instead is to tax the manufacturers and importers of a particular variety of sugary drink. I am no dentist or dietitian, but it seems strange to take the view that sugar in general poses no risk to the nation’s teeth or waistline, unless it comes in a soft drink.Coke and Pepsi are a problem, apparently. But it seems that sugar lumps in tea or coffee are not. Neither are cartons of chocolate milk. Nor syrupy concoctions from Starbucks and Costa. Nor soft drinks produced by boutique producers. Mars bars are fine. So are cakes. So are Coco Pops and Frosties, and for that matter the remarkable quantities of sugar that infuse cereals such as Bran Flakes, or are buried in the recipes of many ready meals. All these forms of sugar will continue to reach our taste buds free of a sugar tax.Mr Osborne’s proposal will work, after a fashion. There is abundant evidence that people adjust their behaviour in response to financial incentives, whether through the window tax-avoiding architecture of 18th-century Britain or the inheritance tax-avoiding feat of Australians in postponing the date of their deaths to a more tax-efficient time.Chancellor George Osborne delivers his eighth Budget at a time of huge political turbulence for the Conservative partySo yes, as Mr Osborne expects, large companies will try to put less sugar in their soft drinks, or raise the prices of those drinks, or both. Sugar consumption from those sources will fall. But they may well rise elsewhere. For many people, a chocolate bar and a fizzy drink are substitutes. If the fizzy drink gets more expensive, the chocolate bar is a tasty alternative for the sweet-toothed consumer. It has more fat in it, too.It’s clear enough why the chancellor has opted for this approach. He wants to blame large companies, not voters, and hide the fact that ultimately consumers will pay the tax. A broad-based tax on sugar itself would have been simpler, braver and far more effective. But Mr Osborne wanted his Budget to leave voters with a sweeter taste in the mouth.tim.harford@ft.com
139;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Lavazza targets €2bn sales within 5 years;‘You either sell up or you grow. There is no alternative,’ says CEO Antonio Barravalle;Lavazza, Italy’s best-selling coffee brand, has a warning for Starbucks as the coffee and frappuccino giant enters the Italian market for the first time: you have much to learn.Howard Schulz, Starbucks’ chief executive, last month confirmed the Seattle-based company will open its first coffee shop in Italy early next year, in Milan. The step marks the latest skirmish in the fast consolidating $80bn global coffee industry, pitting the US chain against Italy’s family-owned purveyors of small cups of rich espresso and frothy cappuccino.“I don’t want to be arrogant in what I say, but it is evident they are coming to a culture of coffee — and I am talking about coffee, not strawberry frappuccino,” says Antonio Baravalle, a former Fiat executive and protégé of its chief Sergio Marchionne, who has been CEO of family-owned Lavazza since 2011.“It see it as a positive thing. They are going to have to work to raise the quality of their coffee [to sell it to Italians] and then they can export that back to the world, which will open the way for us.”Rapid consolidation is transforming the global coffee industry from its roast and ground leaders, like Lavazza, the world’s sixth-largest roaster by sales, to retailers, such as Starbucks, which operates in 70 countries.Mondelez International of the US and Netherlands-based DE Master Blenders 1753 agreed a merger more than year ago, posing a threat to market leader Nestlé and triggering a rush among rival companies to reconsider their strategies.Illycaffè, Lavazza’s much smaller Italian rival, in August last year sold a €70m bond to Pricoa Capital with the option to increase it to €140m, and has since started to roll out its own-branded coffee bars. Massimo Zanetti, which owns the Segafredo Zanetti espresso brand, listed a third of the company on the Milan stock exchange last May.The response from Lavazza, Italy’s largest coffee roaster with nearly half of the local market and retail sales almost four times the size of Illycaffè’s, has been to adapt. It is seeking to transform itself from a predominantly Italian company into a global brand able to compete with Nestlé and JAB Coffee Holding, the closely held investment firm backed by Austria’s billionaire Reimann family which in December agreed a $14bn deal to acquire Keurig Green Mountain.In the past year Lavazza shareholders have put up €1bn in additional capital to allow the 131-year-old company to buy Carte Noire, France’s number one coffee retail brand by sales, and Merrild, a Danish coffee roaster, from DE Masterblenders. It also bought back its distribution in Australia and nearly doubled its sales and marketing expenditure.Turin-based Lavazza, which is distributed in 90 countries but still makes around half of its revenues in Italy, funded the expansion by taking bank credit lines for the first time in its history and selling its 3 per cent stake in Keurig, just before the JAB swoop.“We want to be independent. To do it on our own,” says Mr Baravalle, who also rules out a stock market listing any time soon. “It’s a necessary choice. You either sell up or you grow. There is no alternative.”Lavazza’s takeover of Carte Noire will create a group with combined revenues of €1.7bn — Lavazza made €1.4bn sales in 2015, 8 per cent higher year on year at constant currencies. Sales in the US and UK were up 20 per cent, 11 per cent in Germany and 10 per cent in France last year.“It is a perfect symbiosis,” says Mr Baravalle, who expects group sales to be €2bn within the next five years, and does not rule out making further acquisitions of local coffee roaster “jewels” from 2017 onwards.Bankers and company executives say JAB, among other buyers including private equity, approached the three big Italian groups but all refused, wanting to preserve their familial independence.Still, some analysts are sceptical that Italy’s homegrown coffee companies have the financial firepower to compete with multinational consumer goods groups with billions of dollars to spend on brand and innovation. For instance, current trends suggest that the costly-to-develop coffee capsule market, where Nestlé, which owns the Nespresso brand, and Keurig lead the pack, will ultimately overtake traditional roast and ground.Mr Baravalle admits Italian groups have lagged behind but says Lavazza, which last year put the first coffee machine into space, can “leapfrog” rivals. He says consumer demands for sustainable products promise yet more disruption as the industry seeks to make capsules, a plastic pollutant, biodegradable or at least more environmentally friendly.Today Lavazza spends the equivalent of 2.5 per cent of its revenues on research and development, three times more than five years ago.“Italy’s family capitalism has more courage and understanding [about the requirements of competing globally] than in the past,” he says.

Italy’s distinctive coffee culture is based around independent cafés and bars, which account for nearly 90 per cent of the market, according to Euromonitor.“The dream of the company always has been to sometime complete the circle and open in Italy, but we haven’t been ready,” said Mr Schultz in a statement on Sunday. His own experiences in Italian coffee bars inspired the Starbucks coffee shop concept, he explained.Starbucks is working with Percassi, the company that partnered with Benetton for 30 years, brought Zara to the Italian market and has worked with a string of American brands including Nike, Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger. It also runs Kiko, a make-up company.Antonio Percassi, the company’s founder and president, acknowledged the tricky nature of opening a coffee chain in his home market.“We know that we are going to face a unique challenge with the opening of the first Starbucks store in Italy, the country of coffee, and we are confident that Italian people are ready to live the Starbucks experience, as already occurs in many other markets,” Mr Percassi said.Starbucks said that “espresso will clearly be star of the show” in Italy, but that it had not yet settled the menu. “We plan to tailor our offerings to the Italian customer in a way that will demonstrate the respect and learning we’ve acquired” in Italy, a spokeswoman said.We plan to tailor our offerings to the Italian customer in a way that will demonstrate the respect and learning we’ve acquiredStarbucks’ move comes on the tail of another US chain attempting to bring an American interpretation of classic Italian fare to the market. Last October Domino’s Pizza announced its intention to open in Italy.As with Starbucks, Dominos emphasised that its pizzas would be customised to fit with Italian sensibilities, with locally-sourced ingredients and promising “ultimately a local pizza menu”. Its outlets will be operated by a local master franchiser.Starbucks, which is planning about 1,800 net store openings globally in fiscal 2016, has 21,000 coffee shops across the world. However, there have been bumps on the way, and it has not met with success in every market. In 2008 it closed most of its stores in Australia, leaving just 25.Italy is one of the largest consumers of coffee in the EU, which in itself is the largest importer of coffee beans in the world, but being one of the most competitive means Starbucks has a big job on its hands.

In my case, I sacrificed my physical fitness.After long days of classroom discussions, my fellow MBAs and myself spend extra hours at night discussing case studies, preparing presentations and designing business models. I previously cherished a cup of Starbucks coffee, and a sunny afternoon in my favorite park; I now worship a stable WiFi connection and my eyes beam at the sight of a free seat in the study hall. Things have changed, and I have changed, too.Joining a MBA programme, I not only made a significant financial investment, I also agreed to a life changing trade-off between la dolce vita and a proper MBA experience. What promised to be a challenging period of my life in terms of workload and time management, turned out to be a thrill of sleepless nights, nurturing conversations and devastating insights into my unexpected managerial deficiencies.Now, having spent days and nights to excel in those areas that politically correct professors call “improvement potentials”, I am sitting down to apply for the job.

And now I cannot speak about my motivation?Along the way, it is all too easy to lose sight of the reasons why I started studying again in the first place. Caught up in the process, it is all about the next submission, the next deadline, the readings for tomorrow. The big picture suddenly became very small. No longer do we have time to contemplate the greater goal, the job, but focus on the short-term wins. A good grade, winning this case competition, passing the finance class. Just as any other graduate student, I gave a lot for this – and now I am asked to prove my motivation?It goes without saying there were moments of anxiety, doubt and anger. Moments that, apparently, have diverted my attention from the objective of the mission I embarked on. It seems about time to remind myself why I frantically hit the buttons on my keyboard to finish a paper, or why I allow myself to gulp extra strong coffee to stay awake for the late-night study group meetings. Was it the desire to write excellent papers, the quest for another degree, or the longing to see As on the next report card? Or wasn’t it rather because I wanted to become a better analyst, a more confident leader and, eventually, a more skilled manager? Clear, only the latter holds true. Suddenly inspired, I write:“Dear future employer, I suddenly remember that I am a hard-working, fervent individual and went the extra mile to optimise my skill set. Here is what drove me to this point and I shall tell you what will drive me further: passion.”I never sent this paragraph to any employer. But crying out loud about all the frustration and the sacrifices of being a full-time student helped to put things in perspective, and write what I believe to be a piercing cover letter."

Privacy 1/5Shanghai used to be called the Paris of the Orient and Alt Coffee captures that Left Bank feel — but with a touch of the futuristic. This 15-seat café is only steps from the city’s best view: across the Huangpu River to the trio of neon-lit skyscrapers and giant space needle that give Shanghai its distinctive branded skyline.The shopfront café sports no name plate. Those who love the place — a neighbourhood fixture for more than a decade, in a city where eateries open and close with alarming speed — already know it is there. And for the rest of us, there is a sandwich board on the pavement. In a city so glutted with Starbucks that there are sometimes more than one at an intersection, this is a place for the true coffee cognoscenti — with Chinese characteristics.Do not take a contact there and expect to do lunch or cake though: Alt is all coffee, and the odour is its best advertisement. Most patrons sit at the communal table in the main room, next to shop assistants packing up house-roasted beans for shipment all over China.Alt’s owner is Japanese and its signature coffees are made by the Matsuya drip method. Staff adjust each cup to the customer. But each one takes 10 minutes, so feel free to step outside and admire a skyscraper while you wait — in this, the most Parisian city in Asia.Patti Waldmeir

144;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2016-01-29T23:40:12Z;US blasts Brussels over tax probe bias;EU accused of targeting funds owed to American Treasury;The US has unleashed an unusually forthright attack on the European Commission, saying it was unfairly targeting American companies such as Apple, Amazon, Starbucks and McDonald’s in its drive against tax avoidance.Robert Stack, the US Treasury official in charge of international tax policy, visited Brussels on Friday to express Washington’s fears about bias in the commission’s high-profile tax investigations. He accused the EU of targeting funds that were owed to the US Treasury.His remarks add to growing US-EU tensions on themes ranging from internet privacy to an antitrust inquiry into the alleged dominance of Google, the US technology giant.Mr Stack’s intervention comes hard on the heels of last week’s visit by Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, which could be on the hook for a back-tax bill running to billions of euros because of its fiscal arrangements in Ireland.“We are concerned that the EU commission appears to be disproportionately targeting US companies,” Mr Stack said after his meetings with EU competition officials.Because tax policy is technically a competence of the member states, the commission has taken a novel and contentious approach to tackling the “sweetheart” tax deals given to leading multinationals by some EU countries.The commission has argued that these accords constitute a form of illegal “state aid”, in effect defining tax rulings as an illegal subsidy that gives companies an unfair advantage over their rivals.Margrethe Vestager, the commission’s competition chief, struck her first blow in October, ordering Luxembourg and the Netherlands to recoup tens of millions of euros in back taxes in cases involving Fiat and Starbucks. Last month, she also opened in a probe into McDonald’s, the fast-food chain.Mr Stack retorted that the EU was misguided in using the state-aid weapon retrospectively to override tax arrangements legally agreed with member states. “The retroactive application of these new approaches calls into question the basic fairness of the proceedings,” he said, adding that the tactic was liable to trigger uncertainty among US investors in Europe.Most critically, Mr Stack said the EU was seeking to tax income that should ultimately be payable in the US. “We are greatly concerned that the EU commission is reaching out to tax income that no member state had the right to tax,” he said.The retroactive application of these new approaches calls into question the basic fairness of the proceedingsThis issue is highly divisive because public and political anger is growing on both sides of the Atlantic that US multinationals have mastered the art of accumulating vast stockpiles of largely untaxed international earnings. However, the US Treasury argues that most of this money is simply deferred and will have to be repatriated for taxation in the US, although there is no precise timetable for this.Mr Stack also mentioned Washington’s fears that an unexpected consequence of the tax recoveries could be that the affected companies would claim credits in the US over the international tax demands. “If so US taxpayers would end up footing the bill for these state aid settlements.”Ms Vestager has adamantly rejected accusations of bias and argues that she is trying to ensure that EU countries do not give special deals to selected multinationals, which would be unavailable to competitors, simply to secure investment.EU officials are also dismissive of the US argument that state aid is a retroactive tool. They insist that it is long established, and has been used previously in tax cases. Ms Vestager has also been at pains to stress that America’s double-taxation treaties with EU countries should not become “double non-taxation treaties” with no corporate tax paid in either country.Mr Stack’s comments are likely to ramp up an already tense stand-off. Members of the US Senate called earlier this month on US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to intervene and stop Ms Vestager imposing penalties on US companies.The members of the Senate Finance Committee urged the EU “not to reach retroactive results that are inconsistent with internationally accepted standards,” adding that this would amount to a “direct threat” to US interests.President Barack Obama also made criticisms last year, relating more generally to EU regulatory scrutiny of US technology companies, asserting that the probes were driven by the “commercial interests” of European companies that struggled to compete.

A $530m charge was included in the results.Adjusting for one-time items, however, earnings were 65 cents a share, ahead of analysts’ forecasts. Quarterly sales fell almost 40 per cent to $7.74bn.Schlumberger also announced a new $10bn share buyback programme. The stock, which declined more than 18 per cent last year, rose 6 per cent to $65.21.The share price benefited from a rally in oil prices on Friday that pushed both Brent crude, the global marker, and US West Texas Intermediate above the $31-a-barrel mark, fanning investor optimism. The advance pushed the S&P 500 energy index up 2.3 per cent.Meanwhile, American Express was the biggest decliner on the S&P 500, after earnings guidance missed analysts’ forecasts and an analyst downgraded.Shares in the credit card company fell 12 per cent to $55.05, after it said it was targeting earnings of $5.60 per share for 2017, below analysts’ expectations.The news came alongside a 39 per cent drop in fourth-quarter profits to $899m, or 89 cents a share, and revenues, net of interest expense, down 7.6 per cent to $8.bn. Adjusting for one-time items, earnings of $1.57 a share topped forecasts.Analysts at KBW downgraded the stock from “outperform” to “market perform” and lowered their price target from $95 to $67.Starbucks fell as much as 2.7 per cent after overseas sales at the world’s largest coffee chain missed Wall Street forecasts last quarter.Same-store sales in Asia climbed 5 per cent, falling short of analysts expectations of 6.1 per cent. In Europe they edged up just 1 per cent, for which the company in part blamed the terrorist attacks in Paris in November.Howard Schultz, chief executive, this month announced plans for a further 500 stores in China, adding to the 1,900 at the end of last year. Starbucks shares had strongly outperformed the wider market, helped by buoyant growth in the US.Starbucks shares have risen 46 per cent over the past 12 months, trouncing the 8 per cent decline in the S&P 500.A rebound in energy prices pushed US stocks higher for a second day, leading the S&P 500 to its first weekly rise of the year.The S&P 500 closed up 2 per cent to 1,906.90, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.3 per cent to 16,093.51, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.7 per cent at 4,591.18.

That fell short of the $5.39bn Wall Street analysts were expecting, according to a Bloomberg survey, and the retailer’s shares fell 3.5 per cent in after market trading.Chief executive Howard Schultz earlier this month announced plans for a further 500 stores in China, adding to the 1,900 it had by the end of last year. In the quarter, revenues in China and Asia Pacific jumped 32 per cent to $654m from a year ago. Those in the Americas, which still accounts for about two thirds of its sales, firmed 11 per cent to $3.72bn.Profits at the chain, which began life in Seattle in 1971, fell to $687.6m, or 46 cents a share, from $983.1m, or 65 cents a share, a year ago when the company said it recorded a one-time gain from the acquisition of a joint venture.For the current quarter, Starbucks forecast adjusted earnings per share of between 38 cents and 39 cents, shy of the 40 cents analysts forecast.With a 2 per cent drop this year, Starbucks shares have escaped the worst of the drop in the S&P 500, which is down 8.5 per cent.
147;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2016-01-20T15:23:12Z;Bono surveys a Red decade of ‘conscious consumerism’;U2 singer and other prominent figures assess the ‘cause marketing’ push against HIV/Aids;"An appearance by Bono at the World Economic Forum in Davos, alongside world leaders, chief executives and other members of the global elite, has become as common as snow in the mountain resort in recent years. But this week, when the U2 frontman arrives in Switzerland, he will be marking a special anniversary.It is a decade since the star went to the WEF to launch Red, the brand campaign that began with the aim of ending the transmission of HIV/Aids from pregnant women to their unborn children. Described by Bill Gates as an example of “creative capitalism”, Red’s early partners included Starbucks, Apple and Nike, which made products under the Red brand and donated proceeds to the fight against Aids in Africa. The campaign has over the past 10 years raised more than $350m.“Corporate social responsibility is a phrase that is in common usage now but it wasn’t back then,” Bono says, speaking to the Financial Times on the telephone from “bubblin’ Dublin”, the day before flying to Davos. An aim of Red, which he dreamt up with Bobby Shriver, a US lawyer and nephew of John F Kennedy, was to engage companies, and their customers and employees, in the fight against Aids, encouraging them to make and market Red-branded products, rather than just write a cheque.“Red understood early on that corporate social responsibility was not just for how companies gave their money but also for how companies make money.”Now, the challenge facing Bono and Red is the next decade. New partners have signed up, notably Bank of America, which in 2014 pledged $10m to Red, donating $1 for every free copy of the U2 track “Invisible” downloaded the day of that year’s Super Bowl. The bank recently pledged another $10m and has embarked on initiatives that include displaying at its ATMs images shot by the photographer Rankin of HIV-positive mothers and their children, who were born HIV-free thanks to their mothers taking antiretroviral medication.“If we can get these drugs consistently into the hands of these mothers they will not transmit [the disease] to their children and we can cut off its growth,” says Brian Moynihan, Bank of America’s chief executive.Bono says the money Red has generated is “critical to the people whose lives it is saving”. As important, he says, “is the heat, the excitement”, the campaign has generated in terms of enlightening people who may never have thought twice about the Aids epidemic. “You can go to a Bank of America ATM now in Toledo, Ohio, and see a picture of children born without Aids because of Red. That has an effect.”He realised early on that it would be impossible to gain political backing for his plans if the scale of the Aids problem could not be brought home to people who might be unaware of it. “I remember sitting in the office of [then Senate majority leader] Bill Frist and him saying, ‘I want to grapple with this but when I’m at a pig roast I’m not hearing about it from my constituents.’” He laughs. “He meant that we have to be where people are.”Money raised from the sale of Red products is administered by The Global Fund, a non-profit partnership dedicated to the eradication of HIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis. The fund, which disperses $4bn a year, mainly provided by international governments, says Red has been the largest donor from the private sector. “It’s not just about the money. It’s about engaging the companies that are partners and the people who work for those companies to learn about HIV and the opportunity to end the epidemic,” says Mark Dybul, executive director of The Global Fund. “When a CEO talks to an African head of state about HIV it has a huge impact — much more than a global health person.”Aids has killed about 39m people and mothers who are HIV-positive continue to pass the virus to their unborn children. But the number of transmissions is in decline, according to Mr Dybul, thanks to greater availability of antiretroviral medication.“There were 700,000 people on the medication when we started Red; now we’re at 15m,” says Bono. Mr Dybul says an end to the epidemic is in sight. “The big issue right now is keeping people engaged. If we build on what we’ve done over the last 15 years we can control this epidemic …until we get a vaccine. Which we will do.”Red is not the only example of “creative capitalism” to hit the market in recent years. The Procter & Gamble-owed Pampers nappy brand, for instance, launched the One Pack = One Vaccine campaign in 2006 to combat tetanus in mothers and babies in African and Asian countries. With support from stars such as Oprah Winfrey, the campaign raised funds for an estimated 300m vaccines.The late Steve Jobs was involved with Red, designing and selling a Red-branded iPod. Apple has maintained its connection since Jobs’ death in 2011. Two years ago, Sir Jonathan Ive, Apple’s chief design officer, and his colleague Marc Newson, ran an auction of specially designed products, including a Leica Digital Rangefinder camera the pair customised, which sold for $1.8m. The auction raised $13m for Red, matched by The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.I watch my daughters: they think about where they spend and about values. You have political power in your spending powerDoes Sir Jonathan think Red affected how companies think of corporate social responsibility? He demurs. “I’m much more interested in how a mother feels whose daughter is still alive than whether Red has had an impact on other companies.”He adds: “The thing that first struck me was that the magnitude and ugliness of the problem would normally be cause for people to turn away. I loved the way Bono saw it as a problem to be solved.”Christy Turlington Burns, the US supermodel, was an early supporter of Red, appearing in a Red Gap commercial, and has since started her own non-profit group — Every Mother Counts — which aims to end preventable deaths at childbirth. Red, she says, was a good guide for her own group to “see how partnerships can be established to extend your reach in a powerful way”.Bono says he has to fight to keep Aids in the headlines. “When we started out [with Red] the world Aids crisis was the news. After a couple of years the financial crisis became the news.” Red now has to “think differently”, he adds.The Red blend of celebrity glitter, corporate muscle and products that range from Red Le Creuset pots to Gap T-shirts has been called many things, including cause marketing and conscious consumerism.“Does conscious consumerism really exist?” he asks. “I think it does. I watch my daughters — they think about where they spend their money and they think about values. The consumer is changing …you have political power in your spending power.”"
148;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2016-01-14T17:26:49Z;Jakarta attacks not sign of country tipping into fundamentalism;Isis does not enjoy any great wave of popular support in Indonesia, writes Elizabeth Pisani;"A small group of young men armed with guns and explosives attacked a Starbucks coffee shop and a police post in the Indonesian capital Jakarta on Thursday. Now the world’s media are asking: is the largest Muslim-majority nation in danger of abandoning moderation and tipping into Islamist fundamentalism?Those who fear that it is seize on other markers of growing extremism in this constitutionally multifaith nation. They point to Islamic vigilante groups who regularly attack churches and nightclubs and shut down proposed tours by musicians such as Lady Gaga. They highlight the fact that local politicians throughout the country have been passing regulations enforcing Islamic dress codes, forbidding women from straddling motorbikes and banning the sale of alcohol in convenience stores. In addition, some Indonesia-watchers fret that Isis will use Indonesians’ obsession with social media to spread its toxic brand of fundamentalism there too.A closer look at the facts should put these fears to rest. Isis did claim responsibility for the attacks in Jakarta, declaring that it was targeting foreigners and the security forces that protect them. But the group is not riding any great wave of popular support in Indonesia. Fewer than two Indonesians per million are fighting in Syria, compared with 12 per million from the UK and Australia, and 43 per million from Belgium. There is some concern that those who do fight in Syria will come home with new skills and organisational capacity, but there is no sign of this yet.Thursday morning’s attacks did not show many signs of being the work of a well-oiled terror machine. Five of the assailants died; between them, they killed two civilians. The allegiance of those Indonesians who do travel to Syria appears to be split: local police said the Jakarta attacks were masterminded by former prisoner Bahrun Naim, who is currently in Syria.As for social media, it appears to be as much a tool for promoting tolerance as radicalisation. Within hours of the attacks, Indonesian Twitter streams were alive with calls to a mass rally at the site of the bombings on Friday. Dress code: white. Hashtag: #KamiTidakTakut: #WeAreNotAfraid.Working with political scientist Michael Buehler, I have recently examined some of the other signs of “Islamisation” in Indonesia, notably over 400 sharia-inspired rules passed by local governments over the first decade of the country’s political decentralisation. We found three things. First, the regulations are concentrated in a few areas that have a strong history of Islamic-led rebellion — they are not spreading inexorably across the nation.Second, mapping the regulations on to the electoral cycle, we found clear signs of political opportunism. Rules that make politicians look holy are passed in campaign periods, while those that are politically unpopular but profitable (imposing zakat taxes for example) are usually passed by those who cannot seek re-election. “Sharia creep”, in other words, is driven by politics, not religious conviction.Third, we found this “fundamentalism” does not play well with the electorate. In our data, politicians who passed these regulations in their first terms were less likely to get re-elected than those who did not.Sunni Muslims are not a persecuted minority in Indonesia. No foreign power is meddling in Indonesia’s domestic politics, let alone dropping bombs on the country. It is true that a tiny number of the country’s army of poorly educated, desperately underemployed young men are attracted to the guts-and-glory narrative spun by Isis. But their discontent is based on economic rather than religious or political marginalisation. Indonesia is a vibrant democracy and its citizens are proud of their diversity and tolerance. Attacks by a handful of fanatics do not signal a country tipping into fundamentalism in Jakarta any more than they do in Paris.The writer is a visiting fellow at the Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies and author of ‘Indonesia Etc: Exploring the Improbable Nation’"

Jim Duffy, an analyst at Stifel, said the investment bank’s checks showed sales may be benefiting from “availability of ample clearance merchandise”, indicating higher sales could be coming at the expense of profit margins.Lululemon’s shares rallied 3.82 per cent to $56.82, cutting the 12-month loss to around 1.7 per cent.At the other end of the spectrum, Alcoa shares tumbled after the aluminium maker posted mixed fourth-quarter results after the closing bell on Monday.The company swung to a loss of $500m, from a profit of $159m in the same three-month period in 2014. The results included a $565m hit mainly due to plant closures and income tax charges.Sales slipped 17.8 per cent to $5.2bn, missing expectations of $5.3bn. Adjusted earnings per share clocked in at 4 cents a share, topping estimates by two cents.Alcoa’s shares tumbled 9 per cent, extending their fall over the past year to more than 55 per cent.Freeport-McMoRan, a large copper miner, also sold off, skidding 4.64 per cent to $4.11.The energy sector also dipped, reversing course after starting the day with a solid advance.The culprit was crude oil prices. Brent, the international crude benchmark, fell as low as $30.43 a barrel — the cheapest in more than 11 years — before rallying back to $32.38, only to retreat again to settle at $30.86, down 2.2 per cent on the day.US West Texas Intermediate briefly fell beneath the $30 milestone as it traded in a similar pattern.Marathon Oil, an exploration and production company, dropped 4.5 per cent to $9.19.Kinder Morgan, an energy infrastructure company, dropped 3.95 per cent to $13.60.Starbucks, the coffee chain, got a lift after it reaffirmed its commitment to the China market.Chief executive Howard Schultz said in a speech that “over time, it’s conceivable that China could become our largest market”.The shares rose 2.84 per cent to $59.46, extending a 12-month advance to around 45 per cent.Anthem said it expected adjusted earnings per share to exceed $10.80 this year, up from an estimated $10.16 last year. That compared with Wall Street expectations of $10.86 for 2016.The health insurer is in the process of acquiring Cigna in a $48bn deal. The company’s shares climbed 5.64 per cent to $135.60 on Tuesday.By the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.7 per cent to 1,938.84, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had climbed about 0.6 per cent to 16,517.52 and the Nasdaq Composite had advanced about 1 per cent to 4,686.18.The healthcare sector was the biggest gainer.
150;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2016-01-12T09:44:07Z;Vestager: Not a party in the USA;;"To receive this new daily Brussels Briefing every morning via email, sign up here.It wasn’t so much what she said, it was how she said it. On Monday, Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission’s feared competition chief, announced her latest in a series of cases cracking down on sweetheart tax deals offered to multinationals by ordering Belgium to claw back €700m in illegal tax breaks to at least 35 companies.The decision itself had been flagged up a month ago by Belgium’s finance minister, Johan Van Overtveldt, so it wasn’t really a surprise. But in announcing the decision, Ms Vestager went out of her way to highlight a common trait of those able to avoid taxes through the Belgian scheme (about €500m of the €700m). “Most of the companies benefiting are European; it is also European companies that avoided the majority of the taxes under the scheme, which they now have to pay,” she said at a midday news conference.The statement stood out because it comes after American officials have privately raised concerns over the fact that three of the four initial cases in her corporate tax crackdown targeted US companies: Apple, Amazon and Starbucks. Last month, she expanded the list to include McDonald’s. The private grumbling became public in September when Robert Stack, the US Treasury’s man in charge of international tax policy, broke cover to complain about how the investigation would affect American corporate tax revenues, and Ms Vestager acknowledged that she had flagged up European companies in the Belgian scheme to emphasise her services’ impartiality.“There is no such thing as a balance, because we do not keep scores of one or the others,” she insisted. “I address it directly because I, of course, hear the criticism that this is about US companies, which it is obviously not. It is about companies that are given selective privileges.”Still, there appeared to be one key distinction between the other US-focused cases and the latest decision: none of the companies that benefited were named by Ms Vestager. She argued that, because it was the scheme itself that was declared illegal, it was up to Belgian authorities to cite those involved. But she would not be drawn on whether they would be disclosed once the proceeding is complete. “It is still open if the names of the companies will come forward,” she said. And the companies are not small fry. The FT has learned that among the Europeans caught up in the Belgian web are beer giant Anheuser-Busch InBev, oil major BP and German chemicals group BASF.What we’re readingThe controversy over whether police attempted to hush up the New Year’s attacks on women in Cologne is threatening to spread to Sweden, where police are now vowing to investigate allegations they covered up a mass sexual assault by mostly Afghan youths at a festival two years ago. The man in charge of policing the festival, Peter Argen, appeared to admit the decision to play down the incident at the time was political, telling Dagens Nyheter, Sweden’s largest paper, that there were fears of “playing into the hands” of the country’s increasingly popular anti-immigrant party, the Sweden Democrats. In Germany itself, anti-immigrant and counter demonstrations drew thousands overnight in Leipzig.Following David Cameron’s announcement that he will allow ministers to campaign against Britain’s membership in the EU even if the government recommends staying in, the UK prime minister published a letter on Monday detailing the hoops ministers must jump through if they want to oppose his position in an upcoming in-out referendum. Among the measures, which Downing Street put on its website, are a ban on civil servants assisting rebel ministers, and a requirement that personal staff only work on the EU campaign on their own time. Meanwhile, Toyota’s CEO says in an interview that he will keep manufacturing plants in Britain regardless of whether the UK stays in the EU.Last week, we reported that the European Commission was preparing plans for an overhaul of the way the EU tests auto emissions following the Volkswagen cheating scandal. Our Jim Brunsden has now secured a leaked copy of a document outlining the changes, which would include allowing Brussels to order retesting on any model being sold inside the EU even after national authorities have signed off on them. He’s posted a copy on the FT’s Brussels blog.The commentariat has been active on the meaning of Kyriakos Mitsotakis’ upset win last Sunday to become the head of Greece’s leading opposition party, centre-right New Democracy. Hugo Dixon at Reuters Breakingviews argues that the victory for the free-market reformist means Alexis Tsipras, the sitting prime minister, will be less able to peel off MPs from smaller splinter parties to find majorities in parliament, making him more reliant on his own Syriza hardliners for support – which could lead to more conflict with bailout monitors.At Macropolis, editor Nick Malkoutzis argues that those who believe Mr Mitsotakis, who was credited with helping clean up cronyism as a minister in the last New Democracy government, is the long-awaited white knight who will finally fix Greece are likely to be disappointed – as they were with George Papandreou and Lucas Papademos before. Vassilis Petsinis, a political analyst for the European Commission in Athens, argues that among the reasons for the late shift in support for Mr Mitsotakis was the subtle backing for his opponent, party stalwart Vangelis Meimarakis, in the pro-Tsipras press – as well as the belief that a younger leader (he’s 47) could bring back into the New Democracy fold younger voters who have been fleeing to Mr Tsipras.Lastly, we noticed that French municipal authorities have been busily dredging the famed Canal Saint-Martin, and Libération is reporting they’ve found a hodgepodge of detritus of daily Parisian life. Among the finds are about 20 of the city’s famed Vélib rental bicycles."
151;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Starbucks to open 500 more stores in China;;The China market may be short on cheerleaders these days, as global investors fret about a mainland economic slowdown, but Starbucks seems just as keen as ever to expand in the middle kingdom, announcing today that it would open 500 more stores in China this year.That’s in line with the Seattle-based coffee chain’s longstanding plan to buck the economic slowdown spooking global stock markets, and keep expanding rapidly on the mainland throughout the current decade, writes Patti Waldmeir in Shanghai.Starbucks said in 2014 it planned to double its mainland stores, to 3400, by 2019, so adding another 500 this year is just about on target. The brand, which virtually created the mainland coffeeshop market singlehandedly over the past 20 years, had 1900 stores at the end of last year, according to the company website.Starbucks’ bullishness about China demonstrates the fundamentally schizophrenic nature of the mainland economy these days, with some consumption-led industries continuing to grow while manufacturing slumps. The Chinese middle class – especially at the affluent end that can afford Starbucks’ coffee, which is almost a luxury purchase in the mainland market – has not stopped spending money despite the slowdown. And Starbucks is clearly betting that they aren’t about to do so any time soon.Foreign fast food brands like Yum continue to hide behind the slowdown to excuse their faltering sales, with the company reporting last October that the China business is recovering more slowly than expected from a tainted meat scandal.The company said in November that October mainland same store sales were 5 per cent up on the year earlier period — but local market analysts say Yum still faces a steep challenge to entice diners back to the brand despite a shift in the market toward healthier foods and trendier brands – including Starbucks.(Additional reporting by Jackie Cai.)
152;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2016-01-11T15:10:34Z;Belgium ordered to claw back €700m from multinationals;EU ramps up campaign against corporate tax avoidance;"The European Commission has ordered Belgium to recoup about €700m from 35 multinational companies that have benefited from the country’s generous fiscal incentive scheme, as the EU ramps up its campaign against corporate tax avoidance.The case is highly significant as Margrethe Vestager, EU competition chief, is under increasing pressure from Washington to prove that her tax justice campaign targets European companies to the same extent as their US rivals. High-profile decisions concerning tax planning by the US online retailer Amazon in Luxembourg and the technology company Apple in Ireland are expected in the coming months.Ms Vestager rejects accusations of anti-Americanism and said that Monday’s ruling against Belgium would primarily affect European companies.“Most of the companies benefiting are European. And it is also European companies that avoided the majority of the taxes under the scheme, which they now have to pay back – around €500m out of the estimated €700m in total,” she said.The commission has taken a novel and contentious approach to tackling preferential tax deals by using powerful rules concerning illegal state aid. In effect, the commission is arguing that sweetheart tax deals are a form of illegal subsidy that gives companies an unfair advantage over their competitors.Brussels struck its first blow in the state aid tax cases in October by ordering Luxembourg and the Netherlands to recoup tens of millions of euros from the Italian carmaker Fiat and the US coffee shop chain Starbucks. Those cases are now being appealed.The Belgian companies involved in the latest move include ABInBev, the brewer, and Belgacom, the telecommunications company now known as Proximus. Other companies affected are the oil group BP; BASF, the German chemicals company; Atlas Copco, a Swedish maker of industrial tools; Celio, a French fashion business and Wabco, a US company involved in vehicle technologies.A spokesperson for ABInBev, commenting on Monday, said: “While we are disappointed by this decision, we remain confident that our tax rulings are in full compliance with the EU jurisprudence on state aid and that we have always complied with Belgian and international tax provisions. We will consider our options, taking into account the reactions by the Belgian authorities.”Johan Van Overtveldt, Belgium’s finance minister, said that his government would consider appealing against the decision: “At this point we do not exclude any option.”He also warned that clawing the money back would prove tricky and damaging for European businesses. “The consequences for the companies concerned would be considerable and the reimbursement itself would be particularly complex,” he added.Belgium’s so-called “excess profit” tax scheme has been a keystone of national plans to attract investment and was marketed to international companies with the tag: “Only in Belgium.”In one investor presentation from 2012, PwC, the accountant, said companies could benefit from an effective tax rate of just 8 per cent — far below the 33.99 per cent headline corporate tax rate in Belgium.“Excess profit” rulings allowed business to discount profits that stemmed from the benefits of being a multinational, such as cost synergies or reputation, from their tax bill.Instead, companies would be taxed on the hypothetical profits of what a standalone company would have made without these advantages. This resulted in massive tax savings of between 50 and 90 per cent for some companies, according to the commission.“The scheme cannot be justified by the need to prevent double taxation,” said Ms Vestager.“The discounted taxes are not taxed anywhere else.” She added: “This scheme gives carte blanche to double non-taxation.”"
153;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Equities: And then there were nine;Apart from a few stocks, the US markets are in a slump with fears post-crisis rally has run its course;"Had it not been for a small group of nifty companies, 2015 would have entered the history books as a terrible year for the US stock market. As it was, stocks were almost exactly flat, as were bonds and cash, meaning that US bonds and equities had their second-worst collective 12 months since 1995 — outstripped only by the disaster year of 2008.“It’s the world of low numbers,” says Andrew Milligan, chief investment strategist at Standard Life in Edinburgh.Yet there were some very high numbers for a group of four companies that have come to be known as the “Fangs” — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google — and for a slightly wider group that added Microsoft, Salesforce, eBay, Starbucks and Priceline to create the “Nifty Nine”. Both groups gained more than 60 per cent for the year.Away from the excitement generated by these hot companies, things were dire. The S&P 500 equal-weighted index, where each of the 500 companies receives 0.2 per cent of the index, was down, and underperformed the S&P weighted by market capitalisation.Such a “narrowing” of the market is a classic symptom of a lengthy rally — this one has lasted almost uninterrupted since 2009 — that is coming to an end. Investors run out of ideas and instead pour money into a few companies with a positive story to tell. The underperformance of smaller companies is a sign that investors are growing more cautious.The dominance of the Nifty Nine recalls the late 1960s and early 1970s, when a long bull market petered out into a period dominated by a “Nifty Fifty” of companies such as Xerox.“Technically this feels very bearish,” says Jim Paulsen, chief strategist at Wells Capital Management. “The closest feel is the Nifty Fifty era when much of the market peaked in the late ’60s but the Nifties carried on until 1972.”He said the performance of Amazon, which is revolutionising consumer industries, is particularly distorting, and that of the wider consumer discretionary sector — which was the best performing sector of 2015 — had a “night and day difference” without it.Part of the reason is that profits are in decline, mainly due to the problems falling oil prices have created for energy companies. “We shouldn’t be surprised, because there’s a profits recession, and in profits recessions markets become very Darwinist,” says Richard Bernstein, an investment consultant. That Darwinism means that money flocks to the companies that can show strong revenue growth, such as Netflix — whose profits halved in the third quarter but continues to show subscriber growth — or Amazon. Both saw their share prices more than double, as funds flooded out of companies perceived to be losing out to them and registering disappointing profits, such as Viacom and other mainstream television media groups or Walmart and other retailers.According to Peter Atwater of Financial Insyghts, who analyses market psychology, narrow participation is a symptom of extreme nerves, as last seen during the 1990s internet bubble. Writing before the US Federal Reserve decided to raise rates last month, he pointed out that for 2015, “the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 are up 13.9 per cent while the other 490 are down 5.8 per cent — the largest spread since the late 1990s!”It has also grown more important to pick winners, while there are plenty of losers to choose from. Thomas Lee of Fundstrat says that he had seen Fang-like concentrations in the past, but usually the top and bottom 10 cancel each other out. In 2015, the winners far outperformed the losers.Mr Lee warned that “Fang likely ends with a Dang!” as top movers in one year have a strong tendency to underperform in the next.Valuation trends suggest that the next move is more likely to be downwards. US stocks endured a correction during 2015, dropping more than 10 per cent in August as the Chinese currency revaluation sent tremors through the financial world. But, to quote Mr Paulsen, it was “not a pause that refreshes”.“We did not reset valuations or refresh the profit cycle,” he says. Instead, the S&P 500 had almost regained its highs by the end of October, and US share prices, judged by a multiple of earnings, ended the year as expensive as they began it.Telling indicatorsThe two critical measures that should set the market’s direction are earnings and interest rates. In the third quarter, S&P 500 earnings dropped by 0.8 per cent year on year, and the consensus expectation is that they will be down 3.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, mostly thanks to energy. Meanwhile, Europe may have hit the bottom of its own profits recession, with earnings for the Stoxx 600 companies falling 5.1 per cent year on year in the third quarter.The renewed fall in the oil price has raised concerns that energy companies will be forced to write down the value of the assets more sharply. Once this damage is done, hopes on Wall Street are high for a rebound from a low base; brokers’ analysts now forecast 7.9 per cent earnings growth for the S&P 500 as a whole in 2016. However, equity strategists and asset allocators, who take a more top-down view, expect these numbers to be marked down considerably as the year continues. Further, earnings tend to move in cycles, and in the US the cycle appears to have turned.As for rates, the Fed has told markets to brace for four more rate rises this year, while the Fed funds futures market is implicitly only pricing in two. All else equal, lower rates would aid share prices. But all else is not equal. Lower rates would imply a sickly US economy, which would hit hopes for earnings.So the great hope that a narrow US market will not tip over into a bear market this year is the US economy. There are few signs of a recession — and without a recession, equity bear markets are usually not severe. Indeed, outside of manufacturing, which is in a global downturn, the economy looks robust. The hope is that services will start to benefit as US consumers at last begin to spend the money they have saved on oil.“Profit margins are not going any higher, and rates aren’t going any lower, and there’s a lot of things used up,” says Mr Paulsen, whose best guess is that another flat year is in the offing. “But it’s hard to see a recession.”Excitement around a few big new-economy stocks was intense during 2015. Netflix and Amazon both more than doubled, while Facebook and the Google companies also enjoyed a great year. Put these stocks (known as the Fangs for their initials) together with Ebay, Priceline, Salesforce, Microsoft and Starbucks, to create a “Nifty Nine” and they beat the rest of the US market by more than 60 per cent.That is worrying. Dominance by a few big companies – or a “narrowing” market – is a symptom of the end of a bull run, as it was in the early 1970s (dominated by the “Nifty Fifty”) or the late 1990s (dominated by the dot-coms). The biggest 50 companies rose last year, but the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell, showing concerns about the economy, while an equal-weighted version of the S&P also fell. Most stocks were down, and interest is restricted to a few.S&P 500 companies saw earnings decline slightly in 2015. This was in large part due to falling revenues at energy companies, driven by falling oil prices. But the strong dollar, which hit overseas earnings, was a factor. So was declining margins, as wages started a slight recovery. Both earnings and margins tend to by cyclical, implying both could have further to fall. Meanwhile, earnings in Europe fell by even more, raising hopes that European companies have reached the bottom of the profits cycle.Valuing stocks is and will always remain an imprecise science. Many Wall Street analysts now make technical criticisms of Prof Robert Shiller’s cyclically adjusted price/earnings multiple, which compares to prices to average earnings over the previous decade. But a simple multiple of the previous twelve months’ earnings, which is much noisier and leapt to extremes during the earnings recession of 2009 when investors universally assumed that earnings would recover, gives a similar conclusion. Prices are not extreme, but clearly look expensive by historical standards.The US stock market has vastly outperformed the rest of the world (including both developed and emerging markets) since the 2008 crisis. Lenient monetary policy helped this, as did the strength of the US economy, while the strong dollar amplified the outperformance. But the strong dollar should hit US companies’ overseas earnings, while strengthening the rest of the world, and other central banks are now aggressively easing monetary policy while the US Federal Reserve has just started to raise rates.2015 was dominated by speculation over when the Fed would raise rates. There is every reason to expect this to continue. This chart shows the “dots” issued by the Fed, in which each dot represents the prediction of a different Fed governor for where target rates will be at the end of 2016. The median forecast is for four rises of 0.25 percentage points. The market expectation, derived from the Fed Funds futures market, is for two rises. This gap will have to be reconciled during 2016.This article was updated on January 4 to correct yearly references in the information on the first chart, and on the X axis of the fourth chart"
154;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2016-01-03T13:06:13Z;Time to get stoked by the year’s worst corporate guff;Many entries in the 2015 Golden Flannel Awards made the flesh creep as well as offending eye and ear;"Last year was a ripping one for flannel. I know I say that every year, but 2015 broke all records for obfuscation, euphemism and ugliness. Sifting through the drivel — much of it brought in via the FT’s new Guffipedia site — in search of worthy winners for my Golden Flannel Awards, what stood out was the number of entries that offend not only the eye and ear but make the flesh creep too.So I have decided to add a new category — the Sick Bucket Gong, for which the shortlist is as strong as it is revolting. There was “sweat the footprint”, leaving one fearing athlete’s foot. There was a banker who was “pregnant with the deal”. There was “wet bench testing” and “merchant stickiness”. But the soaraway winner was “executive brownout” brought to us by the Harvard Business Review.One of the most eagerly awaited prizes every year is for the Chief Obfuscation Champion (COC). I’m uncomfortably aware that I promised this to guff veteran Tim Armstrong for the new verb “to game-change”, but I hope the AOL boss will forgive me for changing my mind. Last year two successive CEOs of Twitter perverted the clarity and brevity that their site is meant to promote. Dick Costolo crammed into a single, interminable sentence the words “iterate”, “logged out experience”, “curate”, “moments”, “platform” and “deliver”. He subsequently resigned and was replaced by Jack Dorsey, who promised straight-talking in an email only to sprinkle it with “moving forwards”, and “roadmaps” and “reinvest in our most impactful priorities”.Yet even the Twitter duo’s efforts are feeble compared to the unnamed HR head who warned managers attending an off-site meeting to “be cognizant of the optics of your personal brand”, by which he meant: tuck your shirts in. He is this year’s COC.Mr Dorsey almost won a consolation prize for the best euphemism for firing people (“part ways”), but this goes to the head of HR at a big oil group who announced plans “to ventilate” underperformers. This ingeniously suggests that people are stale air and, if you open the window, they will fly out.The Nerb Prize — given to nouns pretending to be verbs — has had a bumper year, with six dazzling runners-up. To effort. To front-burnerize. To town hall. To potentiate. To future. To value add. Any would have been a worthy winner; yet all were swept aside by “to language”. A reader overheard a colleague saying: “There must be a better way to language it.” He’s right — there must.Lucy Kellaway has been prosecuting corporate crimes against the English language for two decades.Read the finest drivel from this archive as well as fresh twaddle submitted by readers and certified by Lucy.View dictionaryThe Communications Cup — given to the worst way of describing a meeting — has an impressive shortlist: diarising visitations; co-creating conversations; to caucus and (a favourite) to front-face. Yet the winner is “bilateral telephonic meeting”, which reveals the sad truth that the conference call is so much the norm that a conversation between two people needs a special term to describe it.The 2015 Mixed Metaphor Award goes to Rick Hamada, CEO of Avnet, who said: “Drilling down one more click on services, we actually think of multiple swim lanes of opportunity around business.” Although this is a modest three-way mix, quality makes up for quantity. Each one of these metaphors is bang on trend, and he has thrown in a gratuitous “actually” for nothing. He well deserves the prize.There have been many fine job titles sent to me in 2015. I admired the Chief Manifesto Catalyst who works at Danone. However the outstanding winner is McKinsey, which calls some of its consultants “Master Experts”, the tautology no doubt a ploy to soften up the client as a prelude to charging twice the normal rate.Now comes the word that summed up 2015. At first I wanted to make this “journey”. At the FT we were on an “efficacy journey” until our old owners, Pearson, ended that journey by flogging us. Meanwhile at Stansted airport (where real journeys start) the customer complaints department said the “customer journey is a seamless intuitive transition throughout the passenger journey”, adding “our Customer Service team now offers a team of Ambassadors providing a human presence”.On reading this I had a change of heart. The word of the year is not “journey”. It’s “human”. Howard Schultz of Starbucks, a superb peddler of drivel, put it splendidly: “Innovation is the force that will continue to drive our business and enable us to expand and increase revenues and profits — always through the lens of humanity.”To future, I’m going to make a prediction for the guff word of 2016. I found it in Larry Page’s memo on Alphabet, in which, after professing to be “excited” and “super-excited” five times, he said: “We are also stoked about growing our investment arms.”I hope you are prepared for 2016. You’ll get stoked, whether you like it or not.lucy.kellaway@ft.com

155;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Mast Brothers ‘remelting’ stirs debate over high-end chocolate;Claims that hipster brand misled consumers shine light on industry;“Remelting” has lurched into the public vernacular and stirred angry debate in the chocolate world as controversy swirls around a hipster Brooklyn-based “bean-to-bar” producer.Mast Brothers has ridden the trend for crafting chocolate in-house, from cocoa beans to bar, opening outlets in New York, London and Los Angeles. Most high-end chocolate shops bypass the expensive and time-consuming process, remelting commercially produced luxury couverture chocolate instead.Rick and Michael Mast, the bearded brothers who founded the company in 2007, were not the first bean-to-bar makers but their smartly packaged $10 bars took off and are now distributed widely through premium stores such as Whole Foods.Mast Brothers has built its brand on its tight control of the entire production process, which starts with roasting beans, winnowing cocoa nibs from their shells and grinding the nibs into a paste.However, after a food blogger queried Mast’s methods this month, the company has admitted it had sometimes remelted couverture chocolate in its early days, before it opened its first factory in 2009.At the time, Mast Brothers was making no more than 200 bars a week, and was not generating profits, the company said, expressing disappointment at “unfounded speculative allegations” in the media, and with the culture of the chocolate industry.Couverture chocolate, made by companies such as Valrhona of France, is coveted for its high percentage of cocoa butter, which gives it a smooth texture and glossy finish.Even though Mast Brothers says it now exclusively uses bean-to-bar processes, the admission has sparked the ire of some customers and shone a spotlight on the industry.Ten years ago, when someone called themselves a “chocolate maker” they usually meant that they crafted chocolates using a commercial product, says Lisabeth Flanagan, owner of Ultimately Chocolate, a chocolatier based in Ontario. Over the past few years the sentiment has changed, she says, and now there is a starker differentiation between those who make bean-to-bar chocolate and those who use couverture.“Everyone is considering bean-to-bar as the thing to do,” she says.Bean-to-bar represents a tiny sliver of the global cocoa-processing industry, which is forecast by the International Cocoa Organization to have ground some 4.1m tonnes of cocoa from October 2014 to September 2015.Interest is rising quickly, however. Ms Flanagan, who closely tracks bean-to-bar companies, estimates that the number of bean-to-bar producers in the US has risen from about 15 to 150 in the past five years.Part of the reason for the popularity of bean-to-bar is a broader trend in which consumers have started to demand more details about the origins of their food, says Jordan LeBel, a professor of food marketing at Montreal’s Concordia University. Consumers’ trust in big brands has been “eroding”, he says, giving bean-to-bar makers fodder as they advertise their relatively small size and closer connection with farmers.The message is strengthened by the fact that many couverture makers are large companies such as Switzerland’s Barry Callebaut, which sold some 1.8m tonnes of cocoa in 2014/2015 and operates 53 factories globally.Amy Bentley, a professor of food studies at New York University, adds that similar trends have swept through other parts of the food and beverage market in recent years.One example is the US coffee market: it was once dominated by Folgers and Maxwell House — pre-ground and canned coffee sold in stores. Then groups such as Starbucks stepped in and gave Americans a taste of higher-end brews on a broad scale. Now so-called third-wave coffee shops are paying close attention to factors such as the origins of the beans, the treatment of farmers, roasting techniques and brewing methods.Still, not all chocolatiers strive to go bean-to-bar. Ms Flanagan, who generally uses couverture but has also dabbled with developing chocolates from the bean, says it is possible to source “very fine” chocolate from specific origins from larger commercial producers.She says that it is often not economical or necessarily desirable for small shops to develop their own chocolate from the bean, especially if they are going to use it to make confections, arguing that for many, a large part of the art is what a maker does with the chocolate itself.“You think initially you can melt chocolate and pour it into a mould and you’ll get a pretty little bunny at Easter time,” she says. “It’s not that easy.”

State income tax: 0% (1 of 7 US states with no income tax)
Students attending University of Washington: 54,000It would be remiss to assess the pros and cons of the world’s caffeine-fuelled start-up cities without visiting the home of Starbucks, the company that kick-started the fancy-coffee drinking revolution. So what is Seattle like for start-ups?The case for: The population is dense with engineers. Many household names from outside the Pacific Northwest have moved their engineering outposts to the city. For example, Palantir, the Silicon Valley big data analytics company whose funding partly comes from the CIA, opened an engineering office in Seattle in 2015. Google, Facebook and Twitter have engineering outposts here.The combination of entrepreneurs and leading companies, here or nearby — such as Boeing, Amazon, Starbucks and Microsoft — means there is a strong mentoring culture for start-ups as well as an abundance of engineers to build the products.The University of Washington is 15th best in the world according to the closely watched annual ranking by Shanghai Jiao Tong University’s research centre into universities.Listen to Jonathan Moules in conversation with entrepreneurs sharing stories about starting and expanding their businessesThe city itself is hilly, green, famously wet with 37in of rain a year, ecologically conscious and a magnet for fans of outdoor sports and hiking.The case against: The start-up scene took a long time to get going. Another surprise is the relatively low level of venture capital activity. “While [start-up finance] is sufficient to fund a major share of promising early stage start-ups, a lack of big VC funds causes a noticeable gap of later-stage investments”, reports the Global Startup Ecosystem Ranking for 2015, produced by analytics firm Compass.There are plenty of engineers to hire but first you have to prise them away from well-paid, steady jobs at established businesses.Support for start-ups: If Seattle was slow to get moving, the support for start-ups is gathering pace. A survey by Seattle-based tech news website GeekWire reported an outbreak of accelerators and incubators and well over 30 co-working spaces. The accelerators include international operations such as Microsoft Ventures and Techstars.Local heroes: Zillow, the online real estate marketplace is valued at about $4.5bn on Nasdaq. Following in its footsteps is Redfin, another online real estate business, which has raised a total of just under $168m to support its national expansion.Tableau Software, the analytics visualisation company went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2013 and has a market capitalisation of about $6.9bn.At the smaller end of the scale are companies such as AutoGraph, an online analytics company that has raised $7.4m in two rounds and which has an office in London.Getting there: Seattle is about two hours flying time from San Francisco, five and a half hours from New York and about 10 hours from London."
157;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-12-16T19:40:10Z;Starbucks tries to draw a line under tax controversy;Coffee chain declares UK profit after reducing rent burden but its legal battles will continue;When Starbucks announced its largest ever UK profit on Tuesday, it appeared to draw a line under a unique episode in British taxation.After becoming embroiled in a scandal in 2012, when it was accused of tax avoidance, the company paid a significant amount of UK tax on its profits for the first time this year.Starbucks reported a £8.1m current tax bill on pre-tax profits of £34.2m — only slightly less than the total it paid over the 14 years following its arrival in the UK in 1998.The results reflected Starbucks’ efforts to reshape its UK portfolio “to build a leaner and more efficient business”, by measures such as the transfer of 74 stores to franchisees.Jeffrey Young, managing director of Allegra Group, a consultancy focusing on the coffee shop market, said the company had shaken off its historical burden of too many sites with very expensive rents. It was now in a strong position to profit from the growth in the coffee shop market, currently increasing at 10 per cent a year, he said. “The company has resumed its growth path.”The turnround in Starbucks’ profitability and tax payments was greeted by some commentators as evidence that the company had been unfairly maligned when it was accused of avoiding tax by shifting profits to lower tax countries. Tim Worstall, a blogger, wrote that it confirmed “there was no tax dodging, they simply weren’t making a profit as they’d overpaid for their leases.”Yet many people who have been troubled by allegations that the company avoided tax have been unwilling to take the results at face value. They said they wanted to analyse the results of Starbucks’ new European parent company — which will receive royalty payments from all of Europe — due next year.That company, previously based in the Netherlands, is now headquartered in the UK.Tax campaigners want to ensure the UK profits have not been siphoned off elsewhere.However, last year Starbucks said moving its headquarters would mean the company paid more tax in the UK.There is a question mark over whether . . . this marks a change to being profitable and materially tax paying in the UK.Starbucks paid £20m of UK corporation tax in the past two years — a voluntary agreement it made following the avoidance claims — but this payment was a result of waived deductions, rather than a charge on underlying profits.Tim Law, who runs Engaged Consulting, a consultancy specialising in governance and transparency, said there was nothing “egregious” in the accounts published this week, although he would reserve judgment until he had a full picture that included the new parent company. He noted that nearly £14m of this year’s profit had arisen from the reversal of an impairment charge and profit on disposal of property.“It’s not entirely clear how much of this upswing in 2015 is sustainable and how much is a one-off resulting from disposals of stores and renegotiations of leases,” he said. “You can only do that once. There is a question mark over whether . . . this marks a change to being profitable and materially tax paying in the UK.”Even if Starbucks has turned the corner in Britain, it is still facing controversy over its tax payments in Europe.Brussels will soon publish the detailed reasoning that lies behind its recent decision to make the Netherlands claw back €20m-€30m that it claims had illegally been given to Starbucks in the form of a tax advantage. The arguments — which originated in the questions in parliament over the company’s UK tax payments — are about the profits of the Dutch coffee roasting company that Brussels said had been artificially reduced.Starbucks and the Netherlands reject the commission’s findings, ensuring that the issue will be fought through the courts. Even if Starbucks’ turnround in Britain defuses criticism in Britain, the controversy that began in the UK will continue to cast a long shadow for years to come.
158;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-12-15T15:09:10Z;Starbucks pays £8.1m corporation tax as profits rise;Amount almost equals coffee company’s total contribution between 1998 and 2012;Starbucks UK paid £8.1m in corporation tax in the past 12 months — almost as much as it contributed between 1998 and 2012 — after posting its largest ever profit in the market.The coffee house recorded UK pre-tax profits of £34.2m in the 52 weeks to September 27, up from £1.99m a year earlier.Starbucks has argued that unprofitability in its troublesome UK business has been to blame for its historically low payments to the exchequer on earnings from approximately 400 branches.But after a slew of criticisms from members of parliament in the UK, it decided to waive one-off tax deductions and relocate its headquarters from the Netherlands to increase headline corporation tax figures.In the year to September 2014 it paid £11.4m corporation tax, but £11.3m of that was from waived deductions. This time the full £8.1m payment will come from taxes on profits.“Before and after tax profits are both up by more than £30m as we have invested in the store experience while managing our costs,” said Kris Engskov, president of Starbucks in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. “As a result our corporation tax payments also increased.”Over the past three years Starbucks has undergone a significant store transformation to improve profitability in the UK and cut costs from a large and expensive estate.In the year to September it transferred 74 stores to franchises, effectively removing them from its UK balance sheet and increasing the total number of franchised cafés to 221.Like-for-like sales growth edged down — to 3.8 per cent, down from 5.9 per cent — because of this and the net closure of 14 stores in the UK.Mr Engskov said franchises were crucial to the future of Starbucks in the UK, where the company will also invest in more drive-through outlets: “If you go back 15 years we didn’t get off to a very good start in the UK,” he said. “It took us a while to figure that out but in the last three years we’ve been in a turnround.”The Starbucks group will report Q1 results next month.
159;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-12-07T18:09:21Z;JAB/Keurig: Coffee is for closers;Growth stories, like caffeine rushes, can crash hard;A strong cup of Joe is the perfect pick-me-up on a Monday morning. But that quick boost can only mask fatigue for so long. Emerging coffee titan JAB announced on Monday that it and fellow investors would buy the pioneering US coffee machine maker Keurig Green Mountain for $13.9bn. Zing.Keurig quickly came to dominate the single-serve hot beverage market in the US. Its shares percolated up from $25 at the end of 2009 to $150 early this year. Like caffeine rushes, the growth spike crashed hard. While JAB is paying a full-bodied 78 per cent premium to Friday’s closing price, it is paying a 40 per cent discount to Keurig’s share price at its May peak.The short-seller David Einhorn started a campaign against Keurig in 2011 but ultimately exited his position at a loss late in 2014. However, he took another position this year, still sceptical of its prospects in the face of saturation and competition.For the fiscal year that just ended, sales ground down 4 per cent after growth of 13 and 8 per cent, respectively, in the past two years. The company sells home brewing machines at about cost and the coffee pods at a big margin.Keurig has an installed base of 21m brewing machines, but device revenue fell a whopping 23 per cent in 2015. Pod revenue is also challenged because an increasing proportion comes from licensing to third-party coffeemakers like Starbucks, meaning that margins for Keurig are lower.Keurig expects that 2016 revenue will be flat to slightly up. Based on its forecast, the deal is valued at a frothy 30 times free cash flow.But as a well-capitalised private buyer, JAB does not need to obsess about near-term earnings dilution.

160;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-11-26T00:18:44Z;Social media is capitalism with a human face;Technology does well while VW, TalkTalk and Ryanair perform poorly;"In 2012, the blog Gizmodo acquired a copy of Apple’s Genius training manual. There was a section on teaching customer-facing staff how to be more empathetic.Naturally, there were a fair few jokes about this, with Gizmodo noting that much of the advice seemed to be along the lines of saying “I’m sorry you feel that way” after a fight with your girlfriend.However, although easy to mock, corporate empathy has been rising up the agenda over the past few years. These days it is no longer just about making staff in frontline roles play nice with those they serve.Rather, it is about being a company that relates in a human way to all its stakeholders. It is about having emotional intelligence on a corporate scale.“In the past you could just deliver goods and services and empathy was easy to ignore,” says Belinda Parmar, chief executive of Lady Geek, a consultancy. “But customers now demand humanity and authenticity. It’s a fundamental change in the way business is done.” Today, Lady Geek publishes its second Empathy Index.The first index, which was released in January, scored 100 of the world’s best-known brands on how they related to customers and employees and how they communicated on social media.The second takes 160 businesses and uses additional criteria such as the number of women on boards and share price volatility.Social media has played a big part in the rise of the empathetic organisation. In some (but not all) ways it is at the heart of corporate emotional intelligence because it allows customers to interact with companies in the way they would with other people.This ranges from simple complaints to the kind of light-hearted to-and-fro humour that brands such as Taco Bell do so well on Twitter.Julien Smith, chief executive of Breather, the room booking website, and author of The Impact Equation, says the trick to empathy on social media is to come across as human.“You go to the places your customers congregate and you employ people who can use these mediums natively and talk to customers as if they were right in front of them.”It may seem obvious that empathetic companies do better with customers. However, they also do better with their staff, especially younger staff. “If you look at millennials, they are much more interested in working in tech firms than in banks,” says Ms Parmar.LinkedIn was the first index’s number one (and is now number 17). “Some 70 per cent of our staff are millennials,” says Wendy Murphy, LinkedIn’s senior director of human resources for Europe, Middle East and Asia. “They want purpose in their lives and meaningful employment.”LinkedIn scores strongly on social media — and this is not surprising as its employees are also its users.However, Ms Murphy says it puts a great deal of effort into the non-tech aspects of its culture, with initiatives such as time to pursue personal development in the very broadest sense (you can take an hour off to read a book) and alumni networks for former staff.She adds: “Working in social media also means that, rather than doing an employee annual satisfaction survey, our employees have a voice all the time. We have a very high feedback culture.”This year’s number one is Microsoft, which may be more of a surprise. But the company has high staff retention rates and employees rate senior management highly; it does well despite public perceptions.Indeed, on the slightly unexpected front, there are also a number of banks in relatively high positions. But corporate empathy is a complex and changing thing: HSBC’s drug money scandal is now being forgotten and the bank is an adept user of social media.Even Goldman Sachs enjoys a relatively high position, which suggests that the vampire squids [of Wall Street] label, from a 2009 US magazine article, are not forever.There are also stark examples of businesses that have destroyed their hard-won empathy.Customers now demand humanity and authenticity: it’s a fundamental change in the way business is doneIn January’s Index, Volkswagen came a very respectable 27th of 100. Now, in the wake of the emissions scandal, it has fallen to 95 of 160. It is not hard to see why. VW was, until recently, a company that did empathy pretty well.If you drove a Golf, especially a diesel, you were doing something decent and worthy and trying to do your bit for the environment; the company was a model of Germanic probity.These perceptions have been shattered. The public reaction was interesting. Some customers were angry, but many of them felt hurt, betrayed and disappointed. They had trusted this dependable, empathetic German company and it had let them down.What is more, they felt far more let down than they might if they had bought a car from a business that did not purport to have these values.However, you can also bounce back from empathetic ignominy. Starbucks’ ranking in this index (42 of 160) is a marked improvement on the last index (92 of 100). The company’s public image plummeted when its tax arrangements were revealed and it compounded these with a less than apologetic response. Many people were disgusted — but this is wearing off. Perhaps there is something to be said for writing customers’ names on cups after all.The experience of VW and Starbucks and even the banks stands in sharp contrast to companies that seem firmly rooted in the bottom quartile of the empathy index. Like VW, TalkTalk has also experienced a very recent scandal. However it fell only from 72 of 100 to 156 of 160. People did not like it much in the first place, so it did not have far to fall.Indeed, there is a whole raft of companies such as Ryanair and Abercrombie & Fitch that sit at the bottom of the empathy barrel. Starbucks may have rebounded fairly quickly because it has considerable experience of empathy, but others have never had it in the first place.Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary has recently started taking a less abrasive stance with his customers, but it could be a long road.Rather than rebuilding Ryanair’s empathy, he will have to build it from scratch.For a Q&A on the approach to the ranking click hereThe Lady Geek Empathy Index (full list):1.

161;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Climate change rains on Nestlé’s Thanksgiving pumpkin pie parade;Record rainfall in Illinois has cut this season’s crop in half in the biggest producing state;From craft beers to M&Ms, vodka to kale chips, breakfast cereals to eggnog, Chobani yoghurt to Coffee-Mate, pumpkin-spiced flavouring has become an inescapable feature of US grocery aisles each October and November.This year, Starbucks even started adding small amounts of real pumpkin to its pumpkin-spiced latte, a pungent seasonal seller since it was introduced in 2003.Yet as Americans sit down to their Thanksgiving meals on Thursday, the biggest supplier of pumpkin pie’s main ingredient is in trouble.Libby’s, the Nestlé subsidiary which commands 85 per cent of the canned pumpkin purée market, has seen this year’s harvest from Illinois cut in half by record rainfall early in the season.Illinois, where Libby’s has 5,000 acres of farmland and a canning plant in Morton, is the biggest pumpkin-growing state by far, and most of its production ends up in the roughly 50m pies consumed each Thanksgiving.In 2014, according to the US Department of Agriculture, it produced 745m lbs of pumpkins out of the 1.31bn lbs produced by the top six growing states. Between May and July this year, however, 23.2 inches of rain fell on Illinois — 10.4 inches above average, according to the state climatologist’s office.Families across America should have enough pumpkin purée to enjoy Thursday’s celebration, said Paul Bakus, Nestlé’s president of corporate affairs. However, it is “iffy” about whether the supply will cover Christmas, when about another 25m pies are usually consumed. That would leave no more purée available until the August 2016 harvest ships.Nestlé, the world’s largest food and drinks company, blames climate change for the erratic weather patterns that have sharply curtailed its pumpkin yield. Mr Bakus said that these were making it increasingly difficult to predict harvests.“The weather is our best friend or worst enemy in this business,” he said in an interview. “We never know what we’re up against, but in this case, it was a much more severe negative impact than anticipated. As a food company which is a huge user of agriculture domestically and globally, our business is particularly exposed to the consequence of climate change.”Demand for pumpkins has grown rapidly over the past 15 years, both for ornamental purposes and as an ingredient, according to the USDA. Production between 2000-2014 rose 31 per cent to 1.9bn lbs, or 5.4lbs per capita.The disparity between rising demand and falling supply pushed retail prices for pumpkins higher in September and October this year, compared with the three months to November last year. Nestlé said that Libby’s had not increased its prices.The weather is our best friend or worst enemy in this businessMr Bakus argued that the plight of the pumpkin is just one example of many that Nestlé and other food and agricultural companies are battling as climate change adversely affects weather patterns. Nestlé and other industry members will be present at December’s climate change talks in Paris, which aim to reach a global agreement on reducing carbon emissions.Nestlé’s own efforts to reduce its carbon footprint include targets to use renewable electricity in its factories, eliminating food waste and reducing water consumption.While Nestlé has struggled with too much rain in Illinois this year, it has faced controversy over its five water bottling plants in drought-stricken California. It is introducing technology to reduce the amount it uses in all its food and drink plants there.
162;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-11-19T15:02:58Z;Female entrepreneurs get a helping hand in a changing Japan;Despite Shinzo Abe’s push for women to be employed, few start-up or lead businesses;Maria Mercedes Corrales knows well the challenges of navigating the corporate world of Japan as a female boss.When she took over the struggling Japanese operations of Levi Strauss in 2001, she vividly recalls how some of her employees and clients refused to speak to a female president. That wall of silence came down gradually as she turned around the company’s performance.“When you are a woman you are put to a test,” she says. “You are measured by the results that you deliver.”Backed by her experience — which later included a stint heading the Japanese unit of Starbucks — Ms Corrales, from the Philippines, has returned to Japan for a new role as mentor to a group of budding female entrepreneurs. “A lot of things have changed. It is like a renaissance in Japan for women,” Ms Corrales says.Much of the change is driven by prime minister Shinzo Abe’s push for more women to be in the workforce. If he succeeds in closing the gender gap in employment, Goldman Sachs estimates it would boost Japan’s gross domestic product by almost 13 per cent.Despite this, efforts to promote more women to senior roles have still to inspire women to become entrepreneurs. In the last financial year, only 16 per cent of new businesses were started by women, according to Japan Finance Corporation, the government-owned bank.“One of the things [Japanese women] face is access to women role models both in leadership and mentoring in different skill sets,” says Rena De Sisto, international corporate social responsibility executive at Bank of America. She heads a global mentoring programme for women leaders co-organised with Vital Voices, a non-profit organisation for empowering women.When the programme, launched in 2012, held an event in Tokyo last month, 70 women applied for 11 slots. Ms Corrales cancelled her travel plans to apply for the role of mentor. She is now coaching managing director Yuki Uchida, 32, in shaping her business strategy at Re:public, which supports innovation in companies and cities.“We’re at a phase many start-ups face,” Ms Uchida says. “We need to think about where we want to take the company from here and how much we want to expand.”Tamiko Hayashi, founder of Social Concierge, a non-profit organisation promoting sustainable lifestyles with online magazines and shops, says the hurdle for her is the lack of know-how in gaining access to capital. Through the programme, she has learnt how to approach bankers to finance the expansion of her business.Analysts say the low level of entrepreneurial activity in Japan also stems from attitudes towards start-ups, including the fear of failure. A report last year from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, which analyses early stage start-up activity, respondents in Japan expressed a fear-of-failure rate of 54.5 per cent compared with 43 per cent in the UK and 34 per cent in the US.As part of her mentoring role, Ms Corrales also sought to ease Ms Uchida’s fears about her prospects and her capabilities. “You have to believe in yourself. We are put on the job because people think we are capable of doing it,” she says.Looking back, Ms Corrales says she would not have accepted her jobs at Levi Strauss and Starbucks had she been offered a No 2 position: “When you are at the top, you set the tone in your organisation.”Rewards can also override the fears of sitting at the top. In Ms Corrales’ case, those rewards were the friendships she forged with her initially sceptical male colleagues at Levi Strauss, that are now a decade old.
163;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-11-12T11:01:33Z;Ireland (still) ♥ Apple;;With Margrethe Vestager handing down her decision last month that Starbucks and Fiat received unfair tax benefits from the Netherlands and Luxembourg, most believe it is just a matter of time before the EU competition chief does the same with the biggest of the tax cases she is examining: Apple’s comfortable arrangement with Ireland.But in case anyone in Brussels expected Ireland to distance itself from the California-based tech giant ahead of the Vestager decision, the FT’s man in Dublin, Vincent Boland, has sent Brussels Blog a note on just how close the relationship remains – as evidenced by the reception chief executive Tim Cook received on a rare visit to the Irish capital:Cook was on his way to Cork, where he announced that Apple’s operations in the south coast city would expand to create up to 1,000 new jobs by the middle of 2017. That will take the total workforce there to 6,000 – which he said would represent a quarter of the company’s workforce in Europe.It is the sort of announcement the Irish government loves. Enda Kenny, the Taoiseach (prime minister) tweeted a photograph of himself and a smiling Apple boss: “Great to chat with Tim Cook on the day apple announce 1000 new jobs in Cork.”Later, Cook was in relaxed form with an audience of admiring students at Trinity College Dublin, where he received the Gold Medal of Honorary Patronage from the university’s Philosophical Society. (Previous recipients include Nancy Pelosi, former speaker of the US House of Representatives, Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel, and Real Madrid football club boss Rafael Benitez.)“Ireland is a country that for Apple feels very much like home,” Cook told the students – many of whom appeared to be aspiring Apple employees, if the questions to him afterwards were any guide.Still, a note of discord was provided by a handful of protesters in the Trinity quad, who brandished placards reminding anybody who cared to listen about the impending Vestager decision.As one of the demonstrators – there were no more than ten of them – shouted to Cook as he toured the Trinity quad, “Apple – how much do you owe the people of Ireland?” The Apple boss did not respond, or acknowledge the protest.Nor, it is understood, was the EU investigation a significant issue in his discussions with Kenny. The jobs announcement will be seen instead by Irish officials and politicians as reinforcing Apple’s commitment to Ireland, regardless of what Vestager rules when she makes the investigation’s findings public soon.The Cork expansion is Apple’s second big investment in Ireland this year – in the spring it said it would build a €850m data centre in Athenry, a town in the west. That represents a whole lotta love. No wonder Cook was looking relaxed.
164;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-10-25T04:44:03Z;Spotlight on tax rulings spooks fund industry;Use of transfer pricing agreements under review by Brussels;Asset managers are worried their tax affairs will come under increased scrutiny after the EU said Luxembourg, Europe’s largest fund domicile, acted illegally by agreeing a sweetheart tax deal with a multinational company.Last week, the European Commission said Luxembourg and the Netherlands issued so-called tax rulings that artificially lowered the taxes paid by Fiat, the carmaker and Starbucks, the coffee chain, respectively.It said the companies used transfer pricing arrangements, which set the prices for goods and services sold between entities of the same group, to let them either shift profits abroad or pay taxes on “underestimated profits”.Keith O’Donnell, managing partner of Atoz, a Luxembourg-based tax advisory firm, says asset managers in the grand duchy are worried about what the commission’s judgment will mean for them.“This has caused quite a few waves. It has created concern among asset managers,” says Mr O’Donnell. “There will be many asset management companies that have rulings on transfer pricing agreements. Those are potentially subject to European Commission reviews now.”Peter Vale, a tax partner at Grant Thornton, the professional services firm, says fund houses are worried they will suffer reputational damage if they are linked to a country accused of helping companies reduce their tax bills. “They don’t like the smell of it,” he says.The ruling comes after several investment houses were named last year in documents that showed more than 340 large companies had agreed secret deals in Luxembourg that enabled them to save billions of dollars in taxes.Roughly 28,000 pages of documents leaked from PwC, the professional services firm, were dissected by newspapers across the globe, which laid out special deals granted by the Luxembourg tax authorities.Fidelity, Henderson, Schroders and BNP’s asset management arm were among those fund companies named in the scandal that became known as the “ LuxLeaks” affair.It is common for companies in Luxembourg to seek tax rulings, which consist of letters issued by tax authorities to provide details around issues such as how corporate tax will be calculated.Jolyon Maugham, a tax barrister, says asset managers will now need to take a close look at any rulings they received in Luxembourg or elsewhere in Europe.“Fund managers cannot see themselves as unaffected [by the commission’s stance on tax]. There is some risk that any tax benefit that they have had from beneficial rulings in the past might be unwound,” he says.A spokesperson for Alfi, the fund association in Luxembourg, says investment funds do not typically obtain rulings.“It is also too early to conclude that the recent decisions of the European Commission will have an impact on asset management groups,” she adds.The governments of the Netherlands and Luxembourg both rejected the rulings although they did not immediately say whether they would appeal against them in the European courts. The commission is still investigating the tax treatment of Apple, the technology group, in Ireland and Amazon, the online retailer, in Luxembourg.Fiat also said that it had not received any state aid, while Starbucks said that it would appeal against the European Commission.
165;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-10-21T18:13:19Z;Vestager’s new front on corporate tax avoidance;EU ruling on Fiat and Starbucks raises bar against aggressive planning;"The tax arrangements of multinational companies have rarely been out of the headlines over the past three years. Taxpayers have both marvelled at the cunning schemes that permit corporations to avoid paying their dues where they do business; and fumed at the impact their sleight of hand has on the amounts national treasuries collect.Now the European Commission has hit back at some high profile practitioners of this fiscal vanishing trick. Yesterday the competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said that schemes concocted by two multinationals in different EU member states — Fiat in Luxembourg and Starbucks in the Netherlands — are illegal. The commission wants each company to pay between €20m and €30m to the authorities in those countries to cover improperly unpaid tax.The decisions open a new front in the battle against tax avoidance by multinationals. Traditionally the commission’s locus in such questions has been limited. Corporate taxation is a matter reserved to national governments, where it should remain.Brussels has been able to step in because of the rules governing the single market. These take a dim view of national jurisdictions tailoring special inducements to encourage companies to locate operations on their soil. The cases involving Fiat and Starbucks focus on transfer pricing regimes, which allow companies to shift profits from one jurisdiction to another. The commission maintains that the authorities showed undue latitude in allowing them to pile up profits in low-tax countries. As this is illegal state aid, Brussels has the right to unpick the deals and force restitution.The companies and jurisdictions involved will doubtless challenge the commission’s findings. Staunch defenders of tax sovereignty will be dismayed at the precedent. But Brussels is right to look at the question of profit shifting. Sharp practice should be uncovered, whether blessed by national law or not. The very fact of the commission’s intervention may help to deter similar infractions in future.Brussels can only help so far. The commission rulings are an imperfect mechanism for tackling the problem. This week’s precedents create new uncertainties for companies. They expose national tax rulings to challenge, meaning these no longer create “safe harbours” for business. But they do not sharpen the fuzzy boundary where legitimate planning ends and unacceptable avoidance begins.Much of the problem lies in the tax system itself. It remains very easy to shuffle income off to low-tax jurisdictions through intra-group debt financing or the transfer pricing of such intangibles as intellectual property.Neutralising the appeal of these arbitrages is not easy. But the commission is rightly implementing rules demanding greater tax transparency of companies. In future they will have to reveal much more about their profits and taxes on a country-by-country basis.Most companies that exploit national differences to minimise their tax bills would prefer to keep such matters secret. Aggressive tax planning, even if legal, is hard to defend to the public, especially when times are hard.Of course, disclosure will not end the culture of avoidance. That can only happen if bosses take a more responsible approach to tax, and politicians find a better system for linking the amounts companies pay to economic activity.The legal and political barriers to the latter solution are vast. It will take time to overcome them. In the meantime, shaming, transparency and an activist Brussels may be the best tools the frustrated taxpayer has to hand."
166;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Multinationals seek cover as EU begins tax avoidance battle;Brussels’ case against Starbucks and Fiat stokes fears at Apple, Amazon and other groups;Starbucks and Fiat took the heat on Wednesday. Now thousands of other multinationals doing business in Europe are asking a similar question: Will they, too, be caught up in a far-reaching Brussels crackdown on tax avoidance?Much will depend on Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, who on Wednesday declared that the companies’ highly-advantageous tax agreements with the Netherlands and Luxembourg, respectively, amounted to illegal forms of state aid.Ms Vestager’s ruling will require Starbucks and Fiat each to make up to €30m in tax repayments on the grounds they had received “selective” benefits from the tax deals.“Paying one’s fair share of tax should be firmly integrated in a company’s corporate social responsibility,” said Ms Vestager, a Dane, warning that she expected tax rulings to be done “by the book”.The commission is already well advanced in investigations into Apple’s tax treatment in Ireland, Amazon’s in Luxembourg and a Belgian tax scheme used by other companies. In an ominous statement, it said it “continues to pursue its inquiry into tax rulings practices in all EU member states”.Tax advisers warn that Ms Vestager’s judgment will have big implications for large numbers of companies that relied on similar tax rulings from EU governments. Often known as “comfort letters”, the rulings are meant to assure companies about the legality of particular tax arrangements — but may no longer be so reassuring.“The general feeling is [the commission] will very much expand these procedures,” said Marc Sanders, partner at Taxand Netherlands, tax advisers.Caroline Ramsay, a state aid specialist at Pinsent Masons, a law firm, said she understood that “truckloads” of documents about rulings had been sent to Brussels and questions were already being asked about specific cases.“While investigations to date have focused on US companies, the complaints from the US Treasury Department about what they see as the targeting of American companies may well mean that the next wave of state aid cases throws the spotlight on European companies,” Ms Ramsay said.The Starbucks case is particularly troubling, according to tax experts, because the tax ruling process in the Netherlands is long-established and well-respected internationally. The tax treatments involved are considered commonplace in much of the corporate world.Specifically, the commission condemned the Netherlands for allowing the coffee chain to use a series of internal transactions to shift profits outside the country to other, lower-tax jurisdictions. The commission claimed, for example, that Starbucks’ Dutch entity bought its coffee beans at an elevated price from a Swiss subsidiary. Starbucks rejected this, saying there were “significant errors” in the commission’s decision.In the Fiat case, the commission accused Luxembourg of allowing the carmaker’s finance arm to place an artificially low value on its capital in order to reduce its taxes. Fiat says there was no preferential treatment.If nothing else, Mr Sanders predicted the commission’s decisions would increase the costs and uncertainty of doing business in Europe. “If they cannot get comfort from rulings they will look to tax advisory firms to provide more detailed transfer pricing reports,” he said. “It will mean additional work and additional costs.”Companies relying on similar rulings to those of Starbucks and Fiat will have to decide whether to make a provision in their accounts to reflect the risk of a potential state aid investigation. The commission can review rulings going back up to 10 years and can order the recovery of underpaid taxes, plus interest.Heather Self, a tax partner at Pinsent Masons, expects very few to make provisions — which would mean an adverse finding was more likely than not — but many more to record a contingent liability. She also expected companies to consider reopening rulings that might be deemed to be illegal state aid. “They may wish to consider a compromise now rather than wait to be on the receiving end of a full EU investigation,” Ms Self said.The decisions against the Netherlands and Luxembourg are likely have a knock-on effect on other jurisdictions. The US Treasury, for example, has signalled concerns that the US may need to credit companies for the extra tax paid in Europe. In a statement, Fiat Chrysler Automobile said the decision would “result in compensating adjustments in other tax jurisdictions” that would need to be agreed between Luxembourg and the tax authorities of the other European countries involved in the intra-group financing arrangements.But tax advisers said there was much uncertainty over whether companies would be able to offset the extra tax they were forced to pay in one jurisdiction by paying less in others.Both the Dutch and Luxembourgish government rejected the commission’s decisions although they did not immediately say whether they would appeal against them to the European courts. In a statement, the Luxembourg government said the commission had “used unprecedented criteria in establishing the alleged state aid” and had not “established in any way that Fiat Finance and Trade received selective advantages with reference to Luxembourg’s national legal framework”.Fiat also said that it had not received any state aid, while Starbucks said that it would appeal against the commission.
167;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-10-21T11:30:35Z;Starbucks and Fiat told to pay up to €30m in tax after EU ruling;Landmark ruling from EU antitrust watchdog opens new front in battle over corporate tax avoidance;Fiat and Starbucks must each pay up to €30m in tax repayments after Margrethe Vestager, EU competition commissioner, opened a significant new front in the battle against tax avoidance by multinationals.Ms Vestager said on Wednesday that the Netherlands acted illegally by offering a sweetheart tax deal to Starbucks, while Luxembourg did the same for Fiat.While she held fire on reaching a decision in relation to Apple in Ireland and Amazon in Luxembourg, Ms Vestager’s rulings are an attempt to forge an important legal precedent. The commissioner is seeking to establish that deals handed by EU governments to large companies to reduce their tax bills can constitute unlawful state aid.This means that European governments have effectively been offering illegal subsidies, which must be clawed back, possibly in hundreds or thousands of cases.Commission officials admitted that they did not have the resources to police all of Europe’s tax rulings, but Ms Vestager said that she expected the practice to stop immediately.“I expect tax rulings to be ‘by the book’ and that they do not contain state aid,” she said, laying down a marker of intent. “I believe that we need a more fundamental shift in corporate philosophies. If it isn’t part of it already, paying one’s fair share of tax should be firmly integrated in a company’s corporate social responsibility.”Ms Vestager stressed that the creation of a legal framework was more important than any financial penalties. These are relatively modest — between €20m and €30m — because the cases focus on two relatively small units: Starbucks Manufacturing BV and Fiat Chrysler Finance Europe.Vestager prepares attack on corporate avoidanceRead moreHowever, many lawyers expect the sums involved in Apple’s case could be far bigger, and possibly run to billions of euros.Both the Dutch and Luxembourgish government rejected the rulings although they did not immediately say whether they would appeal against them to the European courts. Fiat also said that it had not received any state aid, while Starbucks said that it would appeal against the European Commission.At heart, state aid cases hinge on whether companies have received “selective” benefits thanks to tax deals — nicknamed comfort letters — that other companies would not have received.In the case of Starbucks, the commission condemned the Netherlands for allowing the coffee roaster to reallocate a large slice of its profit and attribute it elsewhere internally in the form of royalty payments. The essence of the Dutch government’s defence is that much of Starbucks’ profit derives from its brand value and other intellectual property such as recipes, which are not created within the Netherlands.As the G20 pledges to crack down on multinational tax avoidance, the FT looks at the issues surrounding corporate taxation and why governments are willing to help companies reduce their tax burdenHowever, the commission decided on Wednesday that these internal royalty payments were unacceptable because other roasters could not use the same strategy to reduce taxable profit. The commission also said that Starbucks was inflating its costs internally by marking up the prices of coffee beans imported from Switzerland, making them cheaper than those available to competitors.In an immediate sign of the potential legal showdowns to come, Starbucks immediately rejected Ms Vestager’s methodology, saying: “The European Commission wrongly asserts that independent third parties which roast coffee beans for Starbucks do not pay equivalent royalties as our own roasting plant in Amsterdam. This is false.”In the Fiat case, the commission argues that the company’s financial arm kept its tax low by putting an artificially low value on its capital. Fiat says there was no question of preferential treatment.
168;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Starbucks and Fiat face repaying millions of euros in tax;Apple and Amazon in line of fire of EU’s landmark decision this week on avoidance by multinationals;Starbucks and Fiat face tens of millions of euros in tax repayments when the EU issues a landmark decision this week on tax avoidance by multinational companies, according to people involved in the case.Beyond the size of the repayment, the case — led by Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner — is expected to set a far-reaching legal precedent designed to curtail practices that are routinely used by multinationals in Europe to limit their tax bills.It also sets the stage for a potentially bigger showdown with Apple and Amazon, whose tax affairs have been the target of investigations by Ms Vestager. One senior EU official following the cases said Fiat and Starbucks were only “the tip of the iceberg”.The cases focus on tax rulings — sometimes called “comfort letters” — issued by governments to thousands of companies across the continent seeking to determine in which jurisdiction they can pay the lowest tax.Ms Vestager’s decision is expected on Wednesday and will signal that tax rulings issued to Starbucks by the Netherlands and to Fiat by Luxembourg amounted to illegal state aid. The commission has demanded that almost all EU member states hand over their tax rulings for examination.“We are entering a new era. State aid will have to be part of the considerations of any multinationals setting up a structure in Europe,” said Caroline Ramsay at law firm Pinsent Masons.When the cases were launched last year, state aid lawyers had speculated that recovery orders could run to billions of euros, based largely on Apple’s tax affairs in Ireland.Estimates of the sums involved in this week’s cases are more modest. The countries will probably receive detailed descriptions from the commission of how to calculate the uncollected taxes, rather than an exact amount.People close to the Starbucks case estimate a sum of less than €30m. The commission is likely to rule that Starbucks Manufacturing BV was paying an effective rate of 2.5 per cent, rather than the full Dutch corporate tax rate of 25 per cent.Estimates of Fiat’s tax are more vague. The commission is expected to say that Fiat Chrysler Finance Europe was in effect paying a rate of about 1 per cent in Luxembourg, rather than 29 per cent. People involved say that means it will owe more than Starbucks but not more than €200m.Lawyers and other people involved in the cases said that Ms Vestager was more concerned with establishing a tough line on the illegality of certain types of aggressive tax avoidance than imposing heavy financial penalties on Fiat and Starbucks.“She is slapping the companies now but saying, in future, she won’t accept anything of the same nature,” said one lawyer following the cases.At heart, the cases concern transfer pricing, whereby companies reduce their taxable profit through complex cross-border trades.The Dutch government claims that Starbucks’ local coffee roasting unit was allowed to reallocate a large slice of its profit and attribute it elsewhere internally in the form of royalty payments. The essence of the government’s argument is that much of Starbucks’ profit derives from its brand value and other intellectual property such as recipes, which are not created within the Netherlands.The commission has questioned these internal royalty payments. It has also queried whether Starbucks was inflating its costs internally by marking up the prices of coffee beans imported from Switzerland.The Dutch government claims that all of the calculations it used to assess Starbucks’ tax burden were legal.All of the countries and companies involved in the first four cases — Starbucks in the Netherlands, Apple in Ireland and Fiat and Amazon in Luxembourg — insist that they have done nothing wrong. Lawyers predict that the cases will almost certainly be appealed to the European courts.
169;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-10-15T15:44:59Z;EU tax: Brussels set for multinational crackdown;Vestager prepares attack on corporate avoidance;Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, looks set to launch the international community’s most punitive attack on corporate tax avoidance as early as next Wednesday, with rulings that could impose heavy costs on multinationals.Ms Vestager is understood to have postponed her first trip to China this week so she can finalise cases concerning Fiat in Luxembourg and Starbucks in the Netherlands. Cases involving Apple in Ireland and Amazon in Luxembourg appear to be on a slower track.Why are these decisions so important?Ms Vestager is changing the rules. Cracking down on tax avoidance has traditionally been handled by toothless, gentlemanly agreements in forums such as the G20 and OECD. The commission is now using one of its strongest weapons — state aid — to tackle the problem. Essentially this means that countries offering sweetheart deals in the form of tax rulings, or agreements, to multinationals are effectively giving them illegal subsidies. These rulings are often nicknamed comfort letters. Ms Vestager’s first decisions follow lengthy investigations and can be appealed by countries through the European courts. Her decisions are being watched closely because tax rulings have become a standard corporate practice, with thousands of companies using them.So the countries and companies will be fined?Not exactly. Ms Vestager has the power to issue recovery orders. This means that the country must claw back the unpaid tax from the companies. Some lawyers reckon that she could theoretically issue a verdict without a recovery order, though this is still seen as highly unlikely.Aren’t recovery orders good news for the countries?The national treasuries will certainly benefit in the short term. However, the countries are far more concerned about long-term consequences, particularly investment flight. Ireland does not want the technology industry to be scared away. Luxembourg’s tax haven status is one of its major attractions to investors.How much money are we talking about?Billions of euros, in all. Still, the verdicts may well not make the sums immediately clear. The decisions are more likely to define a methodology to be used to calculate the difference between what the companies paid and what they would have done without a tax ruling.How little were these companies paying?Here are the figures from the commission’s initial concerns:Fiat Group’s profit was €896m in 2012 while the tax base was between €2.3m and €2.8m.Starbucks global post-tax income was €1.08bn in 2012, while its tax is estimated at between €600,000 and €1m.Apple’s pre-tax global income was €25bn in 2011, while it paid tax of between €2m and €20m internationally.Amazon’s operating turnover in 2013 was €13.6bn, while its taxable income in its Luxembourg hub was €75m.So what happens next?All the countries and companies insist that they have done nothing wrong. EU officials expect lengthy court battles as the countries will almost certainly appeal the decisions.But aren’t comfort letters themselves simply illegal?No. The commission accepts that some form of tax planning is essential to companies with complex cross-border operations. The malpractice comes when a country allows a company to engineer its tax so that it pays virtually nothing anywhere.What will the main arguments be in court?The court cases promise to be complex because competition policy is a novel — almost revolutionary — way to tackle tax issues. Under state aid laws, one of the key points the commission has to prove is that the letters were tailored “selectively” to certain sectors and were not simply available to anyone.It will also have to deal with highly technical questions about how much tax a company would ordinarily have paid without a ruling. Another dispute is likely to hinge on how much of the profit is taxable in one country if the intellectual property is generated elsewhere.Additional reporting by Vincent Boland and Duncan Robinson
170;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;More signs Vestager close on Apple tax case?;;Danes are known for being fastidious about appointments. So it’s a really big deal that Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, has cancelled her first trip to China. She was supposed to be there on Thursday and Friday.The commission admits that something is up: “Due to important matters requiring her presence and full attention in Brussels, the commissioner will have to postpone the visit to China,” said a spokesperson.We may be reading too much into these runes at the Brussels Blog, but there is a clamorous army of lawyers in Brussels simultaneously saying that we are reaching endgame in the landmark tax avoidance cases involving Fiat, Starbucks, Apple and Amazon.Vestager is definitely revving up to change the rules of the global corporate tax avoidance game by telling countries they have effectively been providing illegal subsidies by issuing lenient tax rulings to multinationals.These rulings are the so called “comfort letters” governments have provided companies containing assurances they can lower their effective tax rate on international operations if they locate in their country – which critics argue is simply a way of securing sweetheart deals from accommodating governments.The first big four cases up for decisions are Apple in Ireland, Starbucks in the Netherlands and Fiat and Amazon in Luxembourg. All the countries and companies insist that they have done nothing wrong.Vestager has the power to tell countries that their tax deals were a form of illegal government subsidy. They will then have to recover billions of euros of unpaid taxes from the companies. All eyes are on her first decisions, to determine to what extent she is going to move the goal posts in the battle against tax avoiders.People familiar with the deliberations say it is really just a question of timing now. All the lawyers are looking to Wednesdays, the day the College of Commissioners holds its weekly meeting – that is when she will probably notify them of her decision before going public. She chose a similar route before announcing antitrust cases against Google and Gazprom.The thousands and thousands of companies that have received comfort letters from European governments should keep a close eye on Brussels at midday on Wednesdays. And they shouldn’t have to wait too long.The verdicts do not seem to be in doubt. Two EU officials told the Brussels Blog that all the current preparations – and final polishing of decisions – are aimed at readying the commission for what will definitely be bruising showdowns in court. We cannot confirm that all four will definitely be negative decisions against the countries, but the commission is certainly preparing for several court cases.In recent days, the countries have not indicated whether they have been notified, which they will be several days before a decision. Vestager met Jeroen Dijsselbloem, Dutch finance minister, on Tuesday. Officially, Dijsselbloem was at the meeting as head of the eurogroup of finance ministers to talk about issues relating to the EU’s banking union, but the commission is not specific about which competition issues were discussed.Some lawyers and other people involved in Brussels say it appears the Fiat and Starbucks cases are on a faster track towards a decision than Apple and Amazon.After announcing Google, Gazprom and a case on fossil fuel subsidies on a series of Wednesdays back in April, it began to appear that Wednesdays had become Vestager day. The cancellation of her trip to China feels like “Vestager Wednesday” could be a red letter day again soon.
171;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;European fund groups warn tax rules could harm economy;Corporate transparency measures could harm the economy, say Efama and Aima;Two of Europe’s most influential fund associations have urged Brussels not to implement a number of corporate tax transparency measures over fears the changes would harm the European economy.The European Fund and Asset Management Association, which represents the interests of mainstream fund companies, and the Alternative Investment Management Association, which represents international hedge fund managers, raised their concerns in feedback to a European Commission consultation on corporate tax transparency.Their recommendations are likely to fly in the face of consumer sentiment. Large corporations including Apple, Google and Starbucks have come under fire from politicians and the media in recent years over their tax arrangements.Hundreds of companies also faced public ire earlier this year after it emerged that Luxembourg had granted sweetheart tax deals to groups ranging from Pepsi to Ikea.The commission’s consultation set out a number of options to improve corporate tax transparency across Europe, such as whether companies should be required to publicly disclose the taxes they pay in every country where they operate.In its initial consultation document, the commission said: “Some companies currently generate large profits in the single market, but pay little or no tax in the EU. Some multinationals are able to use aggressive tax planning, national mismatches and legal loopholes due to their presence in multiple jurisdictions.“Their use of complex corporate structures often puts small and medium enterprises at a disadvantage. It may also distort competition and pit EU and non-EU companies within the single market against each other.”Efama warned that enforcing tax transparency rules in Europe that were stricter than elsewhere would put domestic companies “at a competitive disadvantage”.The fund body added that additional tax reporting requirements would require “significant investments and technical expertise, and, potentially, would entail the disclosure of data and information that may be of a strategic or confidential nature”.Both trade associations also urged the commission not to force companies to disclose their tax affairs publicly. They were concerned that this could lead to “unjustified reputational damage” for companies seen to have beneficial tax arrangements.Efama said: “There are legitimate reasons for an enterprise not to be in the same tax situation as its competitors (eg different business model) or in situations where it appears to be paying a low level of taxes (eg use of existing tax losses).“[By making such tax information public] competitors would potentially have access to sensitive technical or commercial information essential to the activities carried out and this could put the enterprise at economic risk, [and] further increase their communication and compliance costs.”Aima also warned that public tax disclosures could be misinterpreted by the public and other interested parties, such as the press.The hedge fund body said: “The media often tries to piece together incomplete information that exists in securities filings, court papers and leaked documents, forcing entities to react on allegations rather than referring to accurate facts.”Christian Aid, the non-profit organisation that has campaigned against aggressive corporate tax practices, argued in favour of public disclosure of tax policies and payments.The non-profit believes public disclosure would provide a “deterrent effect” to corporate tax avoidance.
172;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-10-09T18:03:37Z;Global tax deal targets multinationals;Clamp on avoidance could raise up to $250bn a year in extra revenues, says OECD;"The world’s leading finance ministers agreed on Friday to change the rules on taxing profits, and warned multinational companies they could no longer use their size and international presence to dodge taxes.Under the rules, companies such as Starbucks, Amazon and Google will find it harder to concentrate their profits in low-tax countries and tax havens — a shift that promises to raise up to $250bn a year in extra tax revenues, according to the OECD.Angel Gurría, head of the OECD, the club of mostly rich nations that has drawn up the rules, said it was time “to recover the trust of our citizens” and “move to the next phase which consists of a well-defined trilogy: implementation, implementation, implementation”.The plans to crack down on corporate tax avoidance were devised by more than 60 governments in the first overhaul of the rules for taxing profits for nearly a century.Campaigners have criticised the rules for merely patching up the existing system, although businesses say they have a greater degree of consensus than initially expected.The new rules, called “base erosion and profit shifting” or Beps, are designed to improve transparency, close loopholes and restrict the use of tax havens. They are the culmination of an international project launched two years ago by G20 governments in response to public anger over corporate tax avoidance.Finance ministers from the largest economies hailed the initiative, which they hope will raise revenue and force companies to pay the tax they owe. Lou Jiwei, China’s finance minister, said each country needed to “enhance domestic reforms” to implement the rules.George Osborne, the UK chancellor, pledged to turn the rules speedily into law, saying: “People are fed up when they see large international businesses avoiding paying tax in any jurisdiction. So this isn’t about whether you have low taxes or high taxes — it is about paying your taxes.”When the finance ministers were asked whether they would resign if they had not implemented the rules domestically within a year, none raised a hand, but all insisted they had their own ways to make companies pay their tax under the OECD initiative.[It is time] to recover the trust of our citizens [and] move to the next phase which consists of a well-defined trilogy: implementation, implementation, implementationJack Lew, the US Treasury secretary, said: “From a US perspective, there are elements of this that don’t require legislation and we’re looking to getting to work right away.”Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said the ambition crossed party and regional lines. “This is not a plan for the north or for the south; it is not a plan for developed or emerging economies; it is a plan for everyone.”Even though many governments have already moved to tackle tax avoidance by multinationals, there have been doubts about how uniformly the measures will be implemented. In particular, the Beps project will not change US law, although the US Treasury intends to introduce new transparency rules, requiring companies to say where they make their profits and pay their taxes.Governments only agreed to apply minimum standards to some aspects of the new rule book, such as measures to stop the abuse of tax treaties. They will not be obliged to implement other recommendations, such as curbs on the tax deductibility of interest payments for which governments have agreed a “general tax policy direction”."
173;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-10-08T23:36:27Z;Apple Pay rollout gathers pace in US;Three-quarters of top merchants still cannot accept contactless payments;Apple Pay will arrive in thousands more US stores next year thanks to deals with Starbucks and KFC, the iPhone maker said on Thursday, even as the head of the contactless payment system acknowledged that “still there’s more to go” to persuade most merchants to accept smartphone payments.“We’ve seen a sea-change in momentum of acceptance,” Jennifer Bailey told the Code Mobile conference in California on Thursday. Apple Pay launched in 220,000 stores a year ago but will soon surpass 1.5m, she said, adding that restaurants had seen “a huge amount” of contactless transactions.“As robust as the sales of the iPhone 6 and 6s have been, there still aren’t that many consumers capable of transacting” with their smartphone replacing cash or plastic cards, said Karen Webster, chief executive of Market Platform Dynamics, a consultancy, and adviser to ecommerce start-ups. Many consumers who do have the right technology “forget that they can” use it, or “simply don’t”, she said.Starbucks, which already runs a popular mobile payment system of its own and accepts Apple Pay in the UK, will begin an Apple Pay pilot in the US later this year with a view to launching it in 7,500 US stores in 2016, Ms Bailey said. KFC, with 18,000 stores around the world, is also adding support for Apple Pay soon.Starbucks had worked with Square, the mobile commerce group led by Jack Dorsey, but the partnership foundered. Since then, Starbucks’ own app has become one of the most popular forms of mobile payments, accounting for one in five US transactions.Starbucks’ current app uses a barcode-based system that works with existing checkout terminals, rather than Apple Pay’s “contactless” technology, which usually requires a greater investment in point-of-sale hardware.Apple Pay faces plenty of competition in contactless payments from the likes of Google, Samsung, PayPal and a consortium of US retailers known as MCX. However, none has yet spurred widespread adoption of in-store mobile payments among consumers or retailers in the US.About three-quarters of the top 100 merchants in the US still cannot accept contactless payments, according to Ms Webster.According to eMarketer, an analyst group, mobile payments usage in the US increased from 8 per cent of smartphone owners in 2013 to 12.9 per cent this year, and is forecast to rise to 24 per cent by 2017. Transaction value increased from $1.59bn in 2013 to $8.95bn this year, eMarketer estimates. However, each user’s average spend is expected to remain in the hundreds rather than thousands of dollars for the foreseeable future.Android Pay and Samsung Pay both launched in the US in September. However, in an early blow to Samsung, it emerged this week that its LoopPay subsidiary suffered a hacking attack in March. Because LoopPay operates on a separate network, Samsung Pay was “not impacted” by the hack, the company said, which some have blamed on Chinese attackers.From October 23 2014: It’s rare to have a moment of technological revelation in McDonald’s. But it was there among the Big Macs that I realised how Apple Pay, the iPhone’s new digital wallet, could really change things, writes Tim Bradshaw.Read moreApple Pay launched in the US a year ago with support from most leading American banks and after arriving in the UK in July, it now has 12 of the top 13 British banks on board too. Ms Bailey said the UK was a “very fast growing market”.Last year, the iPhone maker said that 1m credit cards had been registered to Apple Pay in the first three days of availability, but it has not provided any further usage figures.At its developer conference in June, Apple announced that it would add loyalty schemes and store-branded credit cards. Apple has also laid the groundwork to launch its mobile payments service in China, a vital growth market. “We want to bring Apple Pay to as many countries as possible,” Ms Bailey said, without indicating any timeline.She also hinted that Apple was investigating whether to bring Apple Pay to ecommerce through traditional web browsers as well as iPhone apps.“Our goal is to have very broad Apple Pay acceptance in all the ways people pay,” Ms Bailey said. “We are not only focused on expansion in terms of physical locations but in other ways as well.”
174;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Peet’s brews bid for hipster coffee brand;JAB-backed acquisition of Stumptown shows how hot cold brew has become;Attention hipsters. Stumptown Coffee Roasters — one of the original cold brewers in the US — has new parents.Peet’s Coffee, the premium US coffee chain owned by JAB Holdings, said on Tuesday that it had acquired the 16-year-old coffee company and roaster for an undisclosed amount from shareholders including TSG Consumer Partners, the private equity group.The deal represents the latest bet on artisanal alternatives to the ubiquitous Starbucks. In June, California’s Blue Bottle Coffee closed a $70m funding round in which Fidelity joined early investors including actor Jared Leto and U2 frontman Bono.Stumptown helped popularise cold brew coffee, where your cup of joe is brewed from room temperature water over as many as 12 hours, creating a different chemical reaction with the coffee grains than if brewed with hot water.The Stumptown acquisition will be a small but upmarket addition to JAB’s growing coffee portfolio. The holding company, controlled by Germany’s secretive Reimann family, is also the largest shareholder in fragrance group Coty and has a minority stake in the UK’s Reckitt Benckiser.Under the leadership of three consumer industries executives — Bart Becht, Olivier Goudet and Peter Harf — JAB is looking to take on Nestlé, the global market leader in coffee. It already has interests in Jacobs Douwe Egberts, which was formed last year by the merger of the coffee business of Mondelez International and DE Master Blenders 1753. JAB bought Peet’s for almost $1bn in 2012 and also holds majority stakes in Caribou Coffee Company and Einstein Bagels Co.In a statement, Peet’s said that Stumptown would remain independent “while having full access to Peet’s resources and scale”. A Stumptown blog post reassured customers: “the proof will be in the cup”.Even under JAB’s ownership, Peet’s has remained far smaller than Starbucks. It was established in 1966 in Berkeley, California, and its followers have been known as “Peetniks”.Cold brew has become so hot that even mainstream — and decidedly unhip — coffee chains like Starbucks now feature it on their menus.Stumptown offers its niche products in 10 coffee shops from Portland, Oregon, to New York’s Greenwich Village and in olde worlde cans and bottles. The growth of such businesses highlights a trend across many consumer industries in the US where younger consumers are increasingly drawn to smaller brands that appear either more healthy or more interesting than the mainstream ones.Craft beer has sipped away 11 per cent of the US beer market in recent years and it is expected to keep growing. Premium coffee is making similar inroads in the US and across the globe, with small coffee houses such as Chicago’s Intelligentsia and Sightglass Coffee in San Francisco generating queues of people waiting for a brew.The growth of cold brew has helped push up the wages of baristas at a far faster rate than overall anaemic US wage growth. While not the highest paying job by any stretch, data from Glassdoor last month showed a 6 per cent increase to $23,600 this year compared to 2014, making it the fifth-fastest growing salary in the US.
175;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-10-03T01:34:22Z;Oregon shooting sharpens US gun control debate;State police say gunman had been enrolled in class he attacked;One month after the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook school in Connecticut that claimed the lives of 20 young children, an Oregon county sheriff urged the White House not to “tamper” with the constitutional right to carry guns, saying it would be an “indisputable insult to the American people”.“Gun control is NOT the answer to preventing heinous crimes like school shootings,” John Hanlin warned Joe Biden, the vice-president, in a letter.Mr Hanlin found himself indirectly on the receiving end of a stern lecture from President Barack Obama on Thursday, just hours after the sheriff announced that 10 people had been killed in a shooting at Umpqua Community College in Douglas county, where he serves as the top law enforcement official.“We are not the only country on earth that has people with mental illnesses or want to do harm to other people. We are the only advanced country . . . that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months,” Mr Obama said.On Friday evening Oregon State Police disclosed that the gunman — named as Christopher Sean Harper-Mercer, 26 — had been enrolled in the class he attacked.In an emotional address, the president urged the public to take a stand so that politicians would be less susceptible to pressure from the National Rifle Association, the powerful lobby group. Tapping into fears about security that have permeated the US since the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks, he asked people to consider how many Americans had been killed over the past decade by gun violence compared with terrorism.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were more than 33,000 gun-related deaths in 2013, with two-thirds considered suicides and a third categorised as murders. In comparison, only 26 people have died in terrorist incidents on US soil since September 11 2001, according to the New America Foundation, a Washington think-tank.The Gun Violence Archive, a group that monitors firearms-related deaths, says almost 10,000 people have been killed by guns in the US this year. More than 4,000 of those came in the four months since Mr Obama sang “Amazing Grace” during a eulogy at a memorial service following the murder of nine African-Americans at a church in Charleston, South Carolina.Mr Obama, who has described his failure to make headway on gun violence as his biggest regret, said other nations, including the UK and Australia, had enacted laws to prevent mass shootings after just one incident.10,000People killed by guns in the US this year“We spend over a trillion dollars and pass countless laws and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil,” Mr Obama added. “And yet we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths. How can that be?”The answer to that question is the National Rifle Association, which runs hard-hitting campaigns against lawmakers who cross its path. But while the NRA has been incredibly effective at preventing the passage of gun control measures at national level, it is facing a growing challenge from groups pushing for measures at state level.One group is called Moms Demand Action, founded by Shannon Watts after Sandy Hook. The mother of five says taking on the NRA is a huge task, but that organisations like hers are gaining traction across the US. She says they have helped force six states to close loopholes that allow people to buy weapons without any background checks since the 2012 massacre.Ms Watts says her group, with chapters in every state and 3m members, has helped defeat 15 NRA-backed state bills to allow guns in schools. “We have been at this for three years. The gun lobby has been at it for 30 years,” says Ms Watts. “(But) they have never had that kind of opposition before. We are making significant strides . . . but this is going to take years.”Ms Watts says companies such as Starbucks and Target have responded to growing grassroots pressure by banning weapons in stores, or barring people from carrying guns openly, something that is permitted in 44 states.While Moms Demand Action is taking a leaf out of the NRA playbook by creating a grassroots lobbying network, the NRA is firing back with its own ammunition. On its website, the group has a video that stresses the need for mothers to be able to protect their families with weapons.‘Our prayers are not enough’ after 10 die at Umpqua Community CollegeRead more“I’m a mom and just like millions of other women, that’s why I own guns,” says a woman in the video. “We’re responsible, we’re law-abiding and we’re everything that makes America strong. Every day we are willing to use a firearm to defend our families . . . it’s time for moms like me to speak out.”Aryln Pendergast, owner of a South Carolina gun shop that runs shooting classes for women, says women account for 20 per cent of his clients, up from 3 per cent four years ago. “I have met way too many ladies who have bad things happen to them and . . . had no way to defend themselves.”Ms Watts says the NRA is engaging in a “craven marketing ploy” to sell more guns. “They have to sell guns to children and women to protect their profits,” she says. “That’s why they made the ad and it’s why they’re pushing for guns on college campuses.”While Moms Demand Action and groups such as Mayors Against Illegal Guns, co-founded by then New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, have made strides, they face tough resistance from parts of the US where people are wary of any government effort to regulate their ability to buy or use weapons.The manager of a gun shop called Shamrock Pawn in Dublin, Georgia, says politicians pushing gun control are hypocritical. “The president has dozens of armed men protecting him and we should have a right to protect ourselves,” he says, adding that 75 per cent of people in his county own guns.Twitter: @DimiSevastopulo
176;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-09-30T11:55:19Z;US Treasury voices fears over corporate tax probes by Brussels;Washington breaks silence to indicate concern that it will end up bearing the cost of extra bills;The US Treasury has broken its silence over the EU’s flagship tax investigations into Apple, Starbucks and Amazon to voice concerns that it would ultimately bear the cost of any extra bills.A senior official said a move by Brussels to force the multinationals to pay back taxes would have wider implications for the US because the company would potentially receive a credit for the taxes paid overseas.Robert Stack, a deputy assistant secretary, said the US was concerned that “any retroactive tax would be borne by US taxpayers in the form of a credit”, adding that “a purely prospective remedy would alleviate these concerns”.The Commission opened in-depth investigations last year into whether certain “rulings” — comfort letters that provide clarity on how a company’s tax bill will be calculated — complied with the EU rules on state aid.The Commission’s competition arm is expected to issue decisions shortly on cases involving Amazon and Fiat in Luxembourg, Apple in Ireland and Starbucks in the Netherlands. If it rules that governments gave companies favourable treatment, it has the power to force governments to claw back 10 years of unpaid taxes, potentially hitting companies with bills running into billions of euros.Apple has warned its investors that it could suffer a “material” hit from the EU probe if Ireland is forced to claw back the money.Mr Stack said he was delighted to hear Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner, tell a parliamentary commission earlier this month that she would not be rushed into a verdict before she has a “quality” case.People in Brussels close to the four cases say that the commission is steeling itself for a difficult court battle to defend its new approach in tackling multinational tax avoidance.The commission case officers working on the four dossiers have determined that illegal state aid is involved, they said. However, Ms Vestager’s team is now subjecting the cases to intense scrutiny, running through the counter-arguments that the commission is likely to face in court.Some EU officials and lawyers have cautioned that the final decisions will not necessarily announce a headline figure of the number of euros that must be recovered. Instead, the final decisions are more likely to map out a methodology that the member states must use to work out how much to recover.Mr Stack told a meeting in London that the US had been reluctant to be drawn into the debate over EU state aid but considered it important to express its point of view. He would not comment on whether high-level discussions had taken place between Washington and Brussels.The US also fears that the Brussels investigations will end up diminishing the role of its bilateral tax treaties with EU member states. It does not want the commission to override member states in deciding companies’ tax bills, as it has no treaty with Brussels that would allow it to challenge its conclusions.He attributed the public interest in corporate tax in Europe to austerity and the activities of non-governmental organisations. He said the political environment concerning corporate income tax was so different in the US it was “almost like night and day”.He called on Europe to join the US in focusing on the “application of the rule of law” rather than succumbing to short-term self-interest driven by the “political fads of the day”.Mr Stack, who represented the US in the global effort to overhaul international corporate tax rules, also drew attention to features of the EU tax system which — like certain US tax rules — had fostered avoidance by companies.European law had also made it hard to enforce effective rules against tax havens, which in turn had allowed countries to justify weak rules “while protecting their real goal of tax competition”.He praised the OECD-led overhaul of international tax rules for allowing European countries to crack down on certain activities, including the “patent boxes” that offer tax breaks for income from intellectual property.He said: “It is to the great credit of the UK that they were able to step back from a patent box widely seen as harmful.”
177;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
178;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Top financier warns on anti-business sentiment;Lloyd’s of London chair says capitalism must show it is an engine of growth for all;"“Extreme” executive pay and malpractice by big business are undermining confidence in global capitalism, according to the head of one of the City’s most powerful financial institutions.John Nelson, who chairs Lloyd’s of London, will on Tuesday night tell an assembly of top financiers that a lack of trust in the economic system has “serious implications” for companies.The head of the three centuries-old insurance market will warn of a “definite shift in the attitudes of populations around the world towards business”.The comments add to rising concern among corporate figures about anti-business sentiment since the financial crisis and subsequent series of scandals.They come a day after John McDonnell, the UK shadow chancellor, singled out Starbucks, Vodafone, Amazon and Google as tax avoiders. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour party’s new leader, has also raised the prospect of renationalising some industries.In an address to the Lloyd’s City Dinner, Mr Nelson will say that “businesses around the world are not taking the warning signs seriously enough.”“There is a lack of trust in business, big business in particular, and indeed in capitalism.”He will add that capitalism “must demonstrate that it is an engine of economic growth for all; not for an exclusive minority”.“How can some of the extreme levels of executive remuneration possibly be justified? Linked to this is the growing wealth differentials in most economies.”Mr Nelson, who has sat on the boards of BT, retailer Kingfisher and property group Hammerson, was paid £557,000 for the Lloyd’s chairmanship last year.The former banker with Kleinwort Benson, Lazard and Credit Suisse First Boston said business needed to take responsibility for the negative perceptions.In an apparent reference to the global emissions scandal at Volkswagen, he will also say: “Just in these last weeks we have seen business, and big business, demonstrating serious corporate irresponsibility.”“Business needs to return to its true purpose: that is providing its customers with the best possible service — in a way that they want — and with integrity.”“As an institution that has thrived for 327 years by being the first to identify new significant risks, we are now seeing a trust deficit that has serious implications.”Lloyd’s has sought to rebuild its reputation after a scandal two decades ago, when a spike in asbestos and liability-related claims almost triggered the collapse of the market.In the first half of the year Lloyd’s paid £6.6bn of insurance claims, including for accidents at oil platforms in Mexico and Brazil, the crash of a Germanwings aircraft in the Alps and the burning up of a satellite over Siberia.The chairman will argue that Lloyd’s, whose 96 underwriting syndicates provide a wide range of specialist insurance cover from fine art to shipping, has demonstrated its social purpose.But he will caution: “Despite all this, we at Lloyd’s, and in the insurance industry, cannot afford to be complacent. We have to understand the need to improve and change.”Mr Nelson succeeded Lord Levene as chairman of Lloyd’s, among the most coveted roles in the City, in 2011. In his time at the helm he has sought to modernise the market, which still carries a reputation as a stiff City establishment, by pushing for greater use of technology and more diversity among its workforce.“The statistics on gender and racial diversity in UK business are still sobering,” he will say. “We must reduce this diversity deficit to reflect the society we are aiming to serve.”"
179;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-09-24T23:44:31Z;Starbucks to raise average UK wages;Coffee chain to offer interest-free loans to help staff pay deposits on housing;Starbucks has upped the ante on its rivals, promising to raise its average UK wage to just under £8 an hour from April 2016 and offering interest-free loans to help its staff pay deposits on their housing.George Osborne set a new minimum wage level of £7.20 an hour for over-25s in the last Budget, but Starbucks said it would pay that amount to all of its baristas, irrespective of age. Previously, baristas had been paid £6.77 an hour.“We believe in equal pay for equal work,” said Kris Engskov, the president of Starbucks in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Supervisor pay will move to £8.72 an hour from the current level of £8.20, and there will be a “material” premium for workers in London.The increases will take the average pay for Starbucks’ 7,500 UK staff to £7.98 an hour and will apply in the 60 per cent of UK stores operated by Starbucks directly. Franchisees will be able to decide whether to mirror the company policy.Last week Lidl, the discount retailer, said it would start paying its UK staff a “living wage” of at least £8.20 an hour from October, while employees in London would earn £9.35.Mr Engskov declined to say how much Starbucks’ increase would cost the company, and said the coffee chain was “supportive” of the government’s goal for pay of £9.35 an hour by 2020.“It is a big investment. I will not go into the financial numbers but this is about the competition. If you look, this is the most competitive retail market in the world and the most competitive coffee market in the world and it is increasingly difficult to find great people,” he said.Starbucks also said it would begin offering its staff interest-free loans in order to pay rent deposits. After polling employees, Mr Engskov said the biggest issue facing them was housing. “That is no surprise. People are working in cities and not being able to afford housing close to where they work,” he said.The loans will be repayable over a 12-month period, he said, adding that he expected them to be extremely popular.Earlier this month, Whitbread, the owner of Costa Coffee, said it expected to cut spending and increase prices to offset the “substantial” cost of the new minimum wage. The company said it would reveal further details at its half-year results on October 20.Starbucks has been heavily criticised for paying millions in royalties and interest from its UK operations to other Starbucks companies overseas in order to lower its tax bill. A Reuters investigation in 2012 showed how Starbucks had made cumulative sales of more than £3bn since it opened in the UK but paid only £8.6m of corporation tax.
180;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-09-17T16:54:00Z;Is Vestager close to pulling Apple tax trigger?;;Margrethe Vestager seems to be preparing for a marathon court battle.At a parliamentary committee on Thursday, she gave a clear sign that she had the political will to issue tough landmark decisions on the sweetheart tax deals that EU countries have been issuing to multinationals.But she also gave away a tell-tale clue that her officials are steeling themselves for a firestorm of litigation in what will become some of the defining cases of the Juncker commission. She won’t be rushed into a verdict before she has a “quality” case, she told the committee.The Danish commissioner was appearing before the Brussels parliamentarians to give an update on four landmark tax investigations – Apple in Ireland, Starbucks in the Netherlands and Fiat and Amazon in Luxembourg.Most critically, she robustly defended the commission’s revolutionary approach of treating “comfort letters” as state aid – effectively defining the letters (which are pre-emptive tax rulings, intended to reassure multinationals about whether their corporate structures aimed at to avoiding high tax bills are legal) as illegal subsidies.Since the cases were launched last year, a chorus of corporate lawyers has been dismissing state aid as a nonsensical tool in the battle against tax avoidance. But Vestager was confident of her ground.“The decisions in our cases will hopefully set important markers for when a measure constitutes state aid,” she told the lawmakers. “I am strongly committed to using the state aid tool against any tax [measure] that seriously distorts competition and, of course, I will not hesitate to take appropriate actions when a company receives a benefit, an advantage that is not deserved and will distort competition.”Those “appropriate actions” could mean ordering the Irish, Dutch and Luxembourg governments to recoup billions of euros of unpaid taxes from the companies. All of the companies and countries involved insist that they have done nothing wrong.Vestager was guarded about when she would announce her final decisions about whether to bring legal action against the deals, cases which have already been delayed, stressing that “in finalising cases, quality should come before speed”.It is obvious what is meant by “quality”: Her ultimate decisions will have to be legally bulletproof as an army of lawyers in the opposition camp will throw everything at trying to undermine the case on appeal.The legal arguments around the commission’s approach are indeed daunting but it doesn’t look like this will deter Vestager. The only real question now is the timing.

Analysts on Wall Street had expected JM Smucker to report earnings of $1.10 per share on sales of $1.9bn.Shares of Tiffany fell more than 2 per cent to $83.29 after the high-end jeweller cut its full-year profit forecast, attributing the move to the effect of the strong dollar and “ongoing external uncertainties”.The New York-based company now expects full-year earnings to be 2 to 5 per cent lower than last year’s earnings of $4.20 a share. Tiffany had previously forecast minimal growth in full-year earnings.The news accompanied profits of $104.9m, or 81 cents a share, and sales of $990.5m in the three months ended in July, both short of analyst forecasts.Shares of Signet Jewelers, the company behind the Kay and Zale jewellery brands, jumped nearly 12 per cent to $135.60, after the group reported second-quarter adjusted profits that topped forecasts, driven by its acquisition of Zales last May.Overall, US equities climbed for a second consecutive day as a closely scrutinised measure of volatility slid and a reading of second-quarter economic activity surpassed expectations.The S&P 500 rose 2.4 per cent to 1,987.66 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.3 per cent to 16,654.77.

182;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Beijing’s futile quest to turn string-savers into spendthrifts;No amount of government prodding can crack a prevalent frugal Chinese culture, writes Robert Boxwell;"My very Chinese Malaysian wife saves string. She saves practically everything that comes into the house that can be used again, but the string is notable because it comes from the small bags in which Kuala Lumpur’s roadside mamak stalls serve drinks — takeaway cups at a fraction of the cost of the ones used by companies such as Starbucks.A hawker pours your drink into the bag, knots a top corner, inserts a straw, pulls a loop of string around it all, and you’re good to go. You can hang five from one finger and not spill a drop on your way to the office. I needed a little string to stake some tomato plants recently and she pointed me to a bunch of loops hanging in the kitchen. It has taken some cajoling to get her to throw away the straws and bags themselves.Though generous with family and friends, she will push a cart full of groceries to the other end of a mall to save 5 cents on two litres of milk. When buying a pen, she gives me the evil eye for being slow to whip out my loyalty card for the points. Our sons might be outgrowing their school uniforms, but they will wait until the next year for new ones.That is the frugal culture prevalent in the Chinese diaspora across east Asia, and it stems from the historical need to be secure in later years. Americans will pick up a $3 coffee each morning whether they are going to work or to the unemployment office. Chinese won’t.China has nothing like the west’s social security systems. If you are lucky, the one child you have is a son — for whose education you will have saved up — because you can move in with him and his family when he has his own home. (If you are really lucky, your daughter-in-law will like you.) If you are not lucky, your daughter — for whose education you also saved up — becomes someone else’s daughter-in-law, and you’re on your own. You probably do not have a company pension; but you would not be living large on it, or on what the government might give you, anyway.You have saved your whole life, as your parents and their parents taught you, and as you teach your own child and grandchild. It was never about having the most toys or about winning; it was about your old-age health, and maybe a place with indoor plumbing. The 600m Chinese who live on a few dollars a day are just a statistical concept to westerners, but they are family to the country’s emerging middle class.Changing this culture from saving to consuming was never going to be easy, and was never going to be accomplished by government prodding. Sure, China’s millions of newly prosperous are happy to consume — conspicuously — but not because the state says so. They are a small percentage of the population anyway, and there is a limit to the macroeconomic impact of even their spending. For everyone else, it will take a confidence in Beijing that has been greatly shaken recently, if it ever existed, by the failure of one state intervention after another to put paid to stock market volatility. Good luck with that.Even living in a controlled society driven by propaganda, Chinese people know state-issued reports are often not accurate, that ghost cities are not productive, that the crackdown on corruption feels cynical, and that massive government lending for infrastructure cannot be good. Now they have learnt how markets work, and that Beijing cannot really control them, the hard way.My wife stocked up on groceries in March, before the sales tax kicked in on April 1. So did most of her friendsMillions of Chinese are thought to have opened new trading accounts — and lost hundreds of billions of dollars — this year heeding the government’s sweet talk about good times ahead in the stock market. This week’s devaluation of the renminbi is more bad news. You think a few per cent is small change? My wife stocked up on groceries in March before Malaysia’s six per cent sales tax kicked in on April 1. So did most of her friends. So did most of Malaysia, if local retailers are to be believed.For Chinese saving to send a child to a western university, worrying about how many renminbi you will need to buy dollars or pounds when that day arrives does not make you want to buy a new iPhone today. My wife had to change universities in the US when the ringgit tanked in 1997. Plenty of Chinese people around Asia had similar experiences.Beijing’s recent financial market moves, which seem more desperate than wise, will not convince more citizens to spend at Starbucks instead of mamak stalls. Nor will a less certain future stop China turning into a consumer society. Centuries of sensible frugality will do that. Either way, it will take more than a few years of state prodding and propaganda. So don’t hold your breath — and, if the economic engine that has driven much of the world’s growth in the past two decades keeps sputtering, you may want to save string.The writer is director of Opera Advisors, a Kuala Lumpur-based consultancyString-savers aren’t confined to China / From D W Sutherland"
183;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-08-06T11:42:59Z;My 10 random business questions;;"“You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards.” ~ Steve JobsIn the spirit of the late Apple co-founder’s words of wisdom, passed on during his commencement address at Stanford in 2005, I figured it’s a good time to look back at how far my cohort and I have come.Much of the business school experience has to do with simply understanding the way the world works. Business is everywhere and everybody who’s not living on a deserted island engages in some form of business every day.I have 10 months left, so what have I learnt so far?Here’s a list of 10 random questions that I frequently wondered about prior to business school, and their very brief and simple answers which I acquired from studying at Thunderbird.1) Why the heck does Ikea make me walk through its entire store? I’m trapped!
Yes, precisely. We are trapped, and it’s for a calculated reason. IKEA forces us to peruse all of their (affordable) products and they decorate a variety of kitchen/living room/bedroom schemes. By forcing us to consider buying all of their products and presenting them fashionably, we are more likely to buy them than if we were at one of their rival’s stores sporting a massive showroom inevitably carrying higher costs.2) How can Wal-Mart afford to have such low prices and still be so profitable?
A combination of the best logistics network in the industry and hefty bargaining power with suppliers. This facilitates a low-cost supply chain, lower prices, and maximum sales volume in their target market.3) How are interest rates adjusted?
Broadly speaking, central banks (like the Fed) can use a variety of tools to manipulate a nation’s money supply to increase or decrease interest rates as a means for controlling inflationary pressures.4) How did Starbucks become so popular? It’s just coffee, right?
Nope, it’s not just coffee. It’s “The Third Place.” Starbucks positioned itself as the place to go when not at work or at home. The ambiance and quasi-Italian names for its coffee drinks are all calculated to differentiate it from its rivals and create a unique customer experience leading to a competitive advantage in the industry.5) What caused that horrible financial crisis in 2008?
In short, private sector lenders issued risky home loans to buyers who couldn’t afford them and then sold the loans to Wall Street as bundled, mortgage-backed securities that eventually became worthless with the downturn in the housing market. Overly-leveraged banks were susceptible to the collapsing asset class, leading to a liquidity crisis, a disturbance of bank lending and global contagion.6) Why does Southwest only fly 737’s?
A common fleet of aircraft means common spare parts and streamlined training, which translates into lower operating costs, lower prices, and higher sales volume.7) What’s up with the IMF bailing out all of these countries?
The “lender of last resort” is funded by member countries to extend loans with conditions to countries suffering from financial crises, contributing to global economic stability.8) How can a company that’s profitable go bankrupt?
If the company doesn’t have the cash on hand now to meet its obligations; it cannot afford to run its business, even if net income is promising. Cash can be tied up in accounts receivable due to poor credit terms, for example.9) Why is Zara so successful?
The retailer exploits the temptation for impulse buying by limiting the amount of time that clothing stays in stores. Extremely high turnover, minimal inventory and an ingenious design team and distribution system contribute to profitability.10) Why are Real Madrid fans so gung-ho?
One word: branding. RM is a franchise that’s mastered marketing by creating a regal brand (via investing in the best players) that keeps fans salivating over an amazing team.So looking back, my recurring questions were finally answered and may never have been had it not been for business school. To be able to apply theoretical learning to everyday questions people may wonder about certainly contributes to making this journey all worthwhile."
184;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;RSA: a fox bolts for cover;Hester may need to employ wiles to escape Zurich pack;"Tally ho! Sometime fox hunter Stephen Hester finds himself the quarry as Zurich Insurance considers a £5bn-plus bid for RSA, the non-life retail insurer of which he is chief executive. But the former banker will give the Swiss gnomes a run for their money. He has produced strong first-half results as evidence that his turnround plan is working.Zurich, in contrast, announced disappointing quarterly net profits. These were 1 per cent lower at $840m, compared with forecasts of a 12.8 per cent rise, according to Reuters. But the behemoth enjoys greater certainty on capital than RSA because it is based outside the EU. It has a $3bn surplus and would pay cash for RSA.Time is the enemy of Mr Hester, who came in as a troubleshooter 18 months ago. He has promised that RSA will raise returns on tangible equity to 12-15 per cent in 2017. But progress has so far appeared patchier than at Aviva, where Mark Wilson and John McFarlane pulled off a near-perfect turnround, and at motor and home insurer Direct Line under Paul Geddes.Today’s numbers give the bears — and Zurich — something to chew on. ROTE is a volatile number but has risen from about 5 per cent to almost 10 per cent at the half-year stage. Group operating profits, which exclude disposal gains, are almost £120m higher at £259m.Analysts have suggested a Zurich bid at 550p per share — a premium of 27 per cent to where RSA typically trades — could end the group’s independence. Mr Hester and the RSA board could justifiably ask for up to 600p, equivalent to the same premium at the earnings ratio of a better-rated rival.Zurich has the whip hand. But Brer Fox has a habit of bettering his persecutors. Lombard recently installed a high-pitched “scarer” to protect his flower beds from an urban fox. The fox uses it as a handy landmark on which to relieve himself.Bring us the not-so poorA new slew of tax inversion deals suggests that London should erect a Statue of Tax Liberty. How about an effigy of mayor Boris Johnson, one hand raising a champagne glass, the other clutching his Plutarch?The trend is underlined by US and continental groups planning to combine and headquarter in the UK. Corporation tax is falling to 18 per cent here but is over 30 per cent in the US and Germany. The appeal is obvious, even if the difference between effective rates is less stark.There’s already plenty of coke in London, particularly in some West End clubs on Saturday night. But Coca-Cola Enterprises, which bottles the Real Thing, will still relocate here from the US after merging with Iberian and German affiliates, though it is fair to point out initial tax savings will be negligible. Fertiliser, augmenting that talked at the London Assembly, will be supplied by CF Industries, which plans to move to the UK after buying the European and North American assets of Dutch rival OCI.A cynic would suspect CCE and CFI of picking a month when many US lawmakers are frolicking beside a lake or ocean. Bolder Democrat-baiting transactions may follow in the autumn. Forestalling determined inverters would require prohibitive US laws (impractical) or cutting taxes on US corporates and raising those on individuals (unthinkable).Wasn’t the chancellor promising to battle tax havens internationally a few years ago? He is now more likely to be spotted talking defence tactics with the Liechtenstein delegation. Brits who boycotted Starbucks for failing to pay tax on UK losses will not even notice the shift.Super party pooperThe Principal, the shadowy figure who runs the City of London behind the scenes, has directed us to print this communiqué:“The Bank of England’s inaugural Super Thursday has drawn my attention to an unseemly clustering of announcements on the fourth day of the week. This reflects the preference of central bankers and chief executives for a late start on Monday and golf on Friday afternoon. But the trend puts a burden on analysts and fund managers. Some struggle to assimilate one data release a day, let alone one dozen. “I propose the following roster:Monday: Rate decisions and growth guesstimates. These will set the tone for the week, while giving BoE officials a much-needed taste of weekend working.
Tuesday: Housebuilders. Their numbers are alike and may thus be combined in a one-page summary.
Wednesday: Impending accounting disasters. Businesses with issues over revenue recognition, such as Quindell and Tesco, will report under a new “aspirational” results heading.
Thursday: Show-offs otherwise prone to scheduling results to coincide with less-impressive rivals. L&G and Tui, you know who I’m talking about.

It already sources a large amount of the coffee it sells worldwide from farms in sub-Saharan Africa.“We certainly don’t think Starbucks is late. The coffee market has been growing over the last five years and there’s been quite a big consumer education around premium specialised coffees,” said Carlo Gonzaga, the chief executive of Taste, which also has the South Africa licence for Domino’s Pizza.“You’ve got an aspirational consumer who, certainly in South Africa, has a propensity for international brands,” Mr Gonzaga added.Starbucks said growth in the premium coffee segment in South Africa was more than 5 per cent last year. “The coffee market here is vibrant and fast growing — we want to be part of that growth,” said Kris Engskov, president of Starbucks Europe, the Middle East and Africa.The coffee chain’s expansion into South Africa follows several other international brands seeking to take advantage of the country’s burgeoning middle class. Africa has enjoyed some of the world’s fastest-growing economies over the past decade. The continent of 54 nations has a population of about 1bn, which is youthful and fast urbanising, and is forecast to more than double to 2.4bn people by 2050.In May, US doughnut franchise Krispy Kreme signed an agreement with local company KK Doughnuts to open 31 shops in South Africa over the next five years. It joins other western brands, including Burger King, KFC and McDonald’s, which have also established a presence in the country.Although Starbucks has more than 22,000 stores across the globe, from Europe to the Middle East and Asia, its African presence has been restricted to Morocco and Egypt in the continent’s north.But Mr Gonzaga said Starbucks would initially only focus on establishing its presence South Africa, with the first outlet to open in Johannesburg in the first half of next year.South Africa is by far Africa’s most advanced economy; with its cities boasting a number of upmarket malls that are home to fashionable restaurants and shops offering luxury brands.“There are always expansion opportunities, but we’ve first got to get these first few stores right,” Mr Gonzaga said. “The African continent is one of the very few untapped parts of the world . . . to say it’s a market of the future is a safe bet, how far in the future is something I don’t think we are going to get much consensus on.”Taste, which saw its shares soar as much as 20 per cent following the announcement, has a presence in five African countries outside its home market."
187;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;EU tax: Tough love for multinationals’ sweetheart deals;Test case rulings will cut to the heart of corporations’ arrangements and could lead to fines worth billions;"Until a few months ago, the medieval town of Athenry in County Galway owed its fame mainly to a song. Irish rugby and football fans often burst into stirring renditions of “The Fields of Athenry”, a ballad about the country’s devastating 19th-century famine.In February, Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, gave Athenry another taste of the limelight, saying the tech group would build an €850m data centre there to power critical online services such as the iTunes and App stores.For Ireland’s politicians, the pledge of investment from Apple, which already has its European headquarters in Cork, has been a godsend. Enda Kenny, the prime minister, promises that there will be “knock-on benefits for the region” as the rural west coast battles to pick itself up from the country’s financial crisis.Crucially, Apple’s big gesture suggests that Ireland’s strategy of turning itself into the European base for leading US technology companies is still paying dividends and creating jobs. Richard Bruton, the jobs minister, calls the Galway data centre “a great example of what is possible with the right policies”.But those policies, so alluring to multinationals, now face an imminent threat. At the heart of Ireland’s cosy relationship with Apple lies one of the most inflammatory global political issues: preferential tax deals.Dublin is at the forefront of an investigation by the EU into countries that it suspects of offering illegal sweetheart tax deals to multinationals. The European Commission says it will “shortly” issue decisions on four watershed test cases: Apple in Ireland, Starbucks in the Netherlands and Fiat Finance and Trade and Amazon in Luxembourg.Brussels is using a revolutionary but highly contentious methodology to argue its case and, if it rules that there has been wrongdoing, it has the powers to impose some of the biggest penalties in the EU’s history. The commission can force governments to recoup 10 years of unpaid taxes. As one EU official puts it: “We are talking billions and billions.”Apple has already warned its investors that it could suffer a “material” hit from the EU probe if Ireland is forced to claw back the money.JPMorgan has estimated that, in the worst case scenario, Apple is on the hook for about $19bn. Very few competition lawyers in Brussels expect any bills to be that high, but big penalties would nevertheless change the rules of the tax-dodging game by adding a muscular level of deterrence.Until now, tax reforms have largely centred on voluntary and often toothless international guidelines. EU countries have doggedly defended their sovereign right to raise taxes as they want. Britain has easily resisted moves to harmonise tax rates across Europe.So Brussels is resorting to the sort of imaginative tactics that are usually the hallmark of the multinationals’ tax advisers. It is arguing that preferential tax deals — the “comfort letters” given to the companies by EU governments — fall within the realm of state aid. This means that they are illegal state subsidies and Brussels can use its “big bazooka” of recovery orders to recoup them.“These are all highly significant cases — and the verdicts will be very important,” says Anneliese Dodds, rapporteur on corporate tax at the European Parliament. She stresses that the cases will cut to the heart of whether multinationals receive advantages that domestic companies would not. “It is that kind of fundamental unfairness — a complete lack of a level playing field — that has made so many millions of people in Europe angry.”Ms Dodds adds that the four initial cases are probably only “the tip of the iceberg”. The LuxLeaks whistleblower revelations suggest thousands of comfort letters have been issued. Brussels is already investigating more than 100 cases in 21 countries. The commission insists that it does not oppose tax rulings per se, which multinationals need to clarify where their profits will be taxed, but is targeting abuses where companies try to whittle their obligations down to virtually nothing.Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner, was expected to announce her decision on the four cases by the end of last month but this has been delayed. “They are taking no risks,” says one lawyer involved in the cases, explaining that the commission needs more time to establish a watertight legal precedent in highly complex probes, where information often has to be prised from recalcitrant states. Luxembourg, Estonia and Poland have all been rebuked by the commission for not being forthcoming with information.According to lawyers familiar with the inquiry, there is a consensus that Ms Vestager’s team is seeking to issue recovery orders in the autumn, although one of the cases could be concluded earlier. However, the commission would then face immediate appeals in the Court of Justice of the EU, where the state aid argument will be tested for several years. To steel themselves for the battle, EU competition officials are bringing in lawyers from other departments to test the commission’s logic.Ireland insists there is nothing illegal about its tax rulings, which are “non-binding” guidelines. Michael Noonan, finance minister, said last year that Dublin would “win the case quite legally and there isn’t a very strong case by the commission”. Luxembourg and the Netherlands also say that they have done nothing illegal.To beat the member states, Brussels will have to prevail in three contentious areas: “selectivity”, “advantage” and the value of intellectual property.One of the defining characteristics of illegal state aid is that it must be tailored to a particular business or sector. In its bid to prove “selectivity”, the commission’s initial evidence about Apple’s deal focuses on a discussion between a company tax adviser and Ireland’s revenue service in 1990. According to a document published by the commission, Apple’s tax adviser made his pitch with the veiled threat that the company was “reviewing its worldwide operations”.The discussion then focused on locking in a special $30m-$40m bracket on which Apple would pay tax. According to the commission’s document, Apple’s tax adviser “confessed that there was no scientific basis for the figure”.This arrangement became even more startling after the iPhone and iPad transformed Apple into the world’s richest company. According to the commission, Ireland-based Apple Sales International accounted for 64 per cent of Apple’s overall 2011 pre-tax income of $34.2bn. Despite this, the tax paid in Ireland in 2011, where Apple’s international sales are almost all booked, was somewhere between €2m and €20m, the commission says.To campaigners, the case is clear: Ireland gave Apple a selective deal to keep it in the country. But the commission is on its guard; at the end of last year, the CJEU rejected commission decisions over selectivity in two Spanish tax cases.State aid lawyers, particularly in the case of Luxembourg, also argue that anyone who wanted a comfort letter received one. By this reasoning, comfort letters do not look selective.“It is difficult to apply the concept of selective advantage in the context of tax rulings. There are thousands of such rulings,” says Jay Modrall, a lawyer at Norton Rose Fulbright. “While each ruling applies to a specific situation, it is difficult to see how the commission could show that a similarly situated company would not have received an equivalent ruling, taking account of the practices in the relevant member state.”Apple stresses that it is “subject to the same tax laws as scores of other international companies doing business in Ireland”. Ms Vestager counters that Brussels is focusing on cases where there is a “suspicion that you can have it but your competitor next door cannot have it”.The obligation to calculate the “advantage” conferred by a comfort letter will demand highly complex sums about what a company would have paid without a tax ruling. The cases hinge on transfer pricing — whereby companies buy and sell goods and services internally between various units, shunting around profit to pay tax in the most advantageous jurisdiction. Campaigners view transfer pricing as one of the gravest injustices.But to win the case, the commission will have to be exact about the scale of unjustified transactions. One of the details in the Starbucks case is that its Swiss operation sells coffee beans to the Dutch unit at a 20 per cent mark-up. Determining whether this is acceptable or not requires a pioneering verdict on the correct methodology for the “arm’s length principle” — how much the same transaction would have cost if it were conducted on the open market. Starbucks denies any wrongdoing.Calculating an appropriate value for intellectual property is another minefield for EU competition officials. Technology companies often argue that their taxable profit should be attributed to know-how generated on the US west coast. Tax is lower elsewhere, they argue, because bread-and-butter assembly, packaging and distribution operations contribute little to profits.Because of those IP implications, some in the Irish camp even raise the provocative argument that any money recovered would be due to the US Treasury, as Apple’s taxable profit is created in California. Whoever is entitled to it, Dublin would not put the money into the national budget, with officials saying the money is simply “not ours”.Despite the legal hurdles, Ms Vestager is vowing to decide on the cases “as soon as possible”. She has already shown a fearless appetite to take on big names, launching antitrust cases against Google and Gazprom. In terms of tax, she promises to ensure “a level playing field is re-established”.She is supported by Gert-Jan Koopman, the state aid chief at the commission. One lawyer observed, only half joking, that the countries under investigation should be deeply worried that Mr Koopman also dealt with the state aid implications of the billions poured into rescuing Europe’s banking system. While many commission officials fret over imposing fines of tens of millions of euros, the lawyer warned: “Koopman lives in this world of very big billions.”Ms Vestager insists that her tax drive is only one plank of a broader EU initiative. The commission is reviving plans to establish a common EU tax base — essentially a set of rules mapping out what countries can expect to pay tax on. This harmonisation is also intended to help curtail on transfer pricing.Sol Picciotto, emeritus professor at Lancaster University, says the EU’s state aid cases are just “one stick” but will help harmonise standards. “At some stage, corporates might say a rational approach is better than being hit from all sides by all these sticks.”Additional reporting by Tim Bradshaw in San Francisco and Vincent Boland in DublinFor the Netherlands and Ireland, something seems deeply unfair about the EU’s tax probe. When will the European Commission go after Britain? “We want to see that they are not just picking on the little guys,” says an official from one of the smaller countries in the EU’s crosshairs.In private, commission officials insist that they are not blind to Britain’s role as a tax haven. An investigation into Gibraltar’s tax regime was launched in 2013 but a decision is not expected before judgment is delivered in the cases involving Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.Britain was among the first countries from which the commission requested tax rulings. State aid lawyers in Brussels say that the commission’s concerns about Britain are almost certain to yield a big case. They predict that the commission’s interest will probably focus on “patent boxes” schemes, which allow companies to pay less tax on revenues associated with intellectual property.Some add that commission officials are also showing an interest in the relationship between some big UK-based companies and Luxembourg.As with many big competition cases, much of the argument about the silence on Britain hinges on politics. Britain’s forthcoming referendum on whether to remain in the EU is widely viewed as a major existential threat to the broader European project in Brussels. Given those political tensions, several commission officials concede that they want to avoid any immediate battles with London. But Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner, has an unusual degree of freedom to launch cases when she wants. She used a speech in London to stress that she would not allow politics to weigh on her cases.“We are committed to the principles of fairness, good administration, transparency and due process. There is simply no room to spare for political interference.”Britain’s tax dodgers have been warned."
188;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Apple Pay taps UK to shake up consumer spending;Brands including Boots, BP, M&S and Pret A Manger and most banks have signed up;Apple Pay, the contactless payment service, is set to launch in the UK on Tuesday, opening up a potentially large market for the US technology company and transforming the way consumers buy goods.Many large brands — including Boots, BP, Marks and Spencer and Pret A Manger — and most big banks have signed up to support Apple Pay, with more than 250,000 locations ready to accept the service.It is the first time the “tap-and-pay” system — which allows users to pay for goods and services by touching their smartphones on contactless payment points — will be available outside the US.Of all the changes that mobile phones have brought to society, one of the most anticipated but underwhelming has been in financial services.There have been countless attempts to launch mobile payments services from banks, mobile telecoms groups, technology companies and retailers.But this fragmentation has failed to convince the general public to opt into any one as an accepted replacement to a wallet or card.Research from Deloitte found that 5 per cent of people in the UK use mobile payments on a weekly basis, which includes some of the more ‘soft’ mobile payment options such as using the Starbucks or PizzaExpress smartphone apps to pay for a drink or food.“The market has moved from nothing to niche in the last few years,” said Deloitte analyst Paul Lee. “The usage of mobile payments is very low — most iterations to use mobile in store have failed.”Mike Cowen, head of emerging payments products UK and Ireland at MasterCard, which provides the payment systems that operate between Apple, retailers and banks, described Apple Pay as a game changer.“It feels like it is a tipping point. In the first 72 hours after Apple Pay went live in the US, it had provisioned over 1m cards,” he said. “The name carries a lot of weight for consumer confidence and familiarity. I expect it to have a significant impact on the market.”Apple’s platform is relatively simple, requiring just a fingerprint touch verification for smaller amounts to take money from a linked account.The mobile payment service will be available in the UK on Apple’s most recent handsets — the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus. Payments can also be made with the Apple Watch, which works with older generations of iPhones.Most high street banks have signed up. Barclays was expected to focus on its own payments application, although said on Tuesday that it would be offering the Apple Pay service “in future”. HSBC said it was launching later this month.As much as 45 per cent of the UK uses an Apple phone, according to one mobile industry executive, which makes for a large potential market in future.“It will grow steadily in the next few years,” said Mr Lee. “This year might be the year that it finally comes off the floor. It’s a long time coming. The numbers are not great at the moment but people will be drawn in by things like loyalty offers and just the ability to buy something while you are sitting on the bus that will be waiting for you when you get home.”Most companies in the mobile payments sector are hoping for a successful launch of Apple’s mobile money, with even rivals admitting that it would be helpful if the US group could finally help establish the phone alongside the wallet and purse as a recognised way for people to pay in future.This article was amended since original publication to reflect Barclays’ decision to launch Apple Pay
189;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-06-16T08:11:14Z;Skimping tax can still leave a bitter taste for coffee companies;A once unlikely selling point has become a big issue for consumers;When Ethical Consumer magazine cast a critical eye over coffee shops’ tax affairs this year, it singled out small companies for praise. Citing AMT, which runs coffee stalls in railway stations, it said it “even boasts about [this] on its counter, with a sign saying: 100% taxes paid”.Paying tax would once have been an unlikely selling point. But corporate tax avoidance has become the number one issue that the public wants companies to address, according to research by the Institute of Business Ethics.The question of whether coffee shops skimp on their tax payments has once again moved into the headlines. It has been raised by MPs angered by Caffè Nero’s decision to stop stocking milk from farms in badger cull areas, which the chain said was in response to threats from animal rights activists.MPs drew attention to Caffè Nero’s business structure, which involves Luxembourg and the Isle of Man, and the absence of corporate tax payments since 2008. Ian Liddell-Grainger, a Conservative MP for west Somerset, called for a boycott earlier this month saying: “If they paid UK corporation tax, I might have had some sympathy, but they don’t.”Caffè Nero is not alone in facing criticism. Earlier this year, McDonald’s, the fast-food group that serves the largest number of cups of coffee in Britain, was accused of avoiding €1bn of taxes over five years by funnelling royalties through Luxembourg. Unions accused the company of not paying its “fair share”. The company said it complied with all relevant tax rules.Tax also remains a potentially toxic issue for Starbucks, not least because it is still waiting for the outcome of a Brussels state aid inquiry. The 2012 row over its tax affairs has cast a long shadow, despite its denial of avoidance, a voluntary tax payment of £20m and moving its European headquarters to London.Why are coffee shops in the front line of consumer activism over tax? Jeffrey Young, managing director of Allegra, a consultancy, says they have been unfairly targeted by journalists. But there are good reasons why they arouse strong emotions, not least their social role as a meeting place. “This is an industry that relies on being perceived as good citizens.”Moreover, it is easy for disgruntled consumers to steer clear of coffee shops that offend them. Even so, Mr Young is sceptical about how much most customers really care about a company’s tax strategy. He says for the majority, liking the coffee and convenience are more important.Daniel Johnson of the Institute of Business Ethics is also cautious about the impact of public anger on sales. “People are well intentioned but it is not clear when push comes to shove they will act,” he says.For the conscientious consumer, tax is just one of myriad factors — from sourcing to how well a company treats its employees — that they might want to take into consideration.Another difficulty is that it can be hard to judge whether companies are unfairly minimising their tax bills. The complexity was underlined when Ethical Consumer initially gave Costa its worst mark for potential tax avoidance. Later, after it received more information, it changed this to its top mark.Caffè Nero is another complex example. The company says it is not shifting profits out of the UK and its operational profits have been wiped out by interest payments to UK banks. In short, it strongly denies that it avoids tax, adding that its Isle of Man parent company is simply a tax-neutral way for foreigners to invest in the UK.Even so, some people prefer to patronise businesses with simple structures. The Fair Tax Mark— a Kitemark for “responsible” taxpayers based on questions about transparency and tax havens, was introduced to help companies set themselves apart.A similar message can be sent out by individual business owners using the “Fair Tax Pledge”, a free, self-certified declaration of opposition to tax avoidance that was launched last Friday.
190;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-06-09T10:58:24Z;Amazon among multinationals yielding to global tax crackdown;OECD says moves signal end to ‘aggressive planning’;Several leading multinational companies have come a long way towards dismantling structures they have used to minimise their tax bills, according to an official leading an international crackdown on avoidance.The moves were a sign that the “very aggressive tax planning of the past is over”, said Pascal Saint-Amans, the top tax official at the Paris-based OECD.He cited decisions by Amazon and Starbucks — two US companies accused of tax avoidance in 2012 — to change their business models, and feedback from lawyers who have been breaking up structures that involve offshore centres such as Bermuda.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Saint-Amans said the OECD was making “huge progress” on a substantial package of reforms that would close loopholes in the global corporate tax system.Even though discussions on some issues are mired in controversy, the OECD is on track to issue its final recommendations to G20 finance ministers in October.It commissioned its Beps project, which is aimed at tackling what it calls base erosion and profit shifting, in 2013 in response to widespread public anger over the lengths to which some multinationals were going to avoid tax.Some critics, including trade unions and campaign groups, have expressed doubts about whether the recommendations will have a lasting impact. Last week a panel of development experts including Joseph Stiglitz, the economist, said the OECD project would not go far enough and called for a fundamental rethink of corporate tax rules.Companies are braced for changes as a result of the Beps project. Nearly three out of five multinationals surveyed by Deloitte, the professional services firm, said the project would have greater impact on their organisations than originally thought.Investment analysts at Citigroup said last month the project had progressed faster and further than expected, although they warned that obtaining international agreement on the most contentious issues might prove impossible.“The tax environment has changed materially and is significantly less favourable for aggressive tax planning than previously,” the analysts said.Some governments have broken ranks and implemented anti-avoidance measures. More than half of the companies surveyed by Deloitte expected “significant unilateral legislative changes”, and more than three-quarters expected some degree of double taxation.In April the UK introduced a “diverted profits tax”, which penalises multinationals that divert profits to low-tax countries. Mr Saint-Amans, who at the time said he was “embarrassed” over the UK legislation, said unilateral action by governments remained a concern. A senior US official said last month such moves “undermined the whole reason to do the Beps project.”The reforms will include minimum standards on issues such as the banning of “harmful” tax practices and abuses of tax treaties. But it will be less prescriptive on other issues.“It’s not a one size fits all,” said Mr Saint-Amans. “We have designed something which is flexible.”Climbdown over Luxembourg deal brings revenues within reach of taxman.Read moreOn Monday the OECD published details of how the “country by country” reporting regime would be implemented, paving the way for next year’s introduction of rules requiring companies to divulge where they earn their profits, carry out operations and pay tax.Mr Saint-Amans said the reporting rules were a big incentive for companies to ensure that profits were reported in the same place as they conducted their activities — a change in their approach to international tax.Details of the reporting rules have attracted criticism, with campaigners objecting to the plan for data to be collected by the country where a multinational is headquartered and then exchanged with other countries.Alex Cobham, director of research at Tax Justice Network, said a corporate transparency measure had been “strangled at birth” because it would exclude developing countries that did not have the instruments in place to exchange information with multinationals’ home countries.Amazon’s low-tax structure, which has sparked intense criticism, is being overhauled, it emerged last month. The online retailer has begun booking sales in the countries where its customers are based, following the establishment of local branches of its Luxembourg operating companies.In April 2014 Starbucks — the world’s largest coffee shop chain — announced the move of its European headquarters from the Netherlands to the UK. The EU is investigating whether a ruling by the Dutch tax authority broke state aid rules.
191;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-06-04T17:00:17Z;Blue Bottle Coffee turns from start-up to upstart with $70m deal;California-based group transforms small-scale, artisanal cafés into big bucks;"It may be seen by some as the anti-Starbucks but Blue Bottle Coffee is turning its small-scale, artisanal cafés into big bucks.The California-based coffee retailer and roaster has closed a new $70m round of funding led by Fidelity. Start-ups that raise such sums are typically valued in the high hundreds of millions of dollars, although Blue Bottle did not comment on its valuation.Blue Bottle is adding Fidelity Management and Research, a unit of one of the largest fund managers in the US, and Tetragon Financial Group, a hedge fund, to its growing list of backers.Investors already include Morgan Stanley and tech venture capitalists Index Ventures and True Ventures; the founders of Instagram and Twitter; and celebrities such as actor Jared Leto, pro skateboarder Tony Hawk and U2 frontman Bono.“I think people like Fidelity see that there’s a great opportunity, in the same way Chipotle and Shake Shack have come from nothing, to do something better with coffee and baked goods,” said Bryan Meehan, Blue Bottle’s executive chairman.The fundraising follows April’s acquisition of San Francisco’s Tartine Bakery and will fuel the group’s expansion in New York, Los Angeles and Tokyo, as well as its native Bay Area. Other locations in Asia, such as South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, may follow.James Freeman, Blue Bottle’s founder and chief executive, said that unlike many so-called third-wave coffee companies that are distributing their beans wholesale, he was focusing on the company’s own retail stores. “Retail is expensive but retail is rewarding if you get it right,” he said.The speed and scale of Blue Bottle’s fundraising has raised eyebrows among some of San Francisco’s coffee purists. Some former Blue Bottle employees have left to start their own independent coffee shops, bemoaning the growing number of MBAs and management consultants now involved in the business.But as it faces off against local rivals such as Sightglass Coffee, backed by Twitter and Square co-founder Jack Dorsey, Blue Bottle has also highlighted investors’ appetite for its style of high-margin, millennial-friendly cafés.Mr Freeman and Mr Meehan are known for carefully selecting and outfitting stores in up-and-coming locations.Blue Bottle has just signed a lease on a 20,000-square-foot site in Bushwick, a gritty but fast-gentrifying Brooklyn neighbourhood, three blocks away from hipster favourite Roberta’s Pizza. Its existing Brooklyn roastery will move there from Willamsburg in spring 2016, alongside New York’s first Tartine outpost.“Putting it in Brooklyn feels right for the brand,” said Mr Meehan. “It feels like a Mission of Brooklyn,” he added of Bushwick, referring to the hip San Francisco neighbourhood that is home to the original Tartine.Next year will also see a new Blue Bottle store open in the Bradbury building in downtown Los Angeles, an architectural landmark dating back to 1893 that featured in the sci-fi movie Blade Runner. Los Angeles’ first Tartine Bakery will open within a year in the city’s Arts District.Chad Robertson, Tartine’s co-founder, is planning a trip to Germany this month to research baking systems that allow one commissary to serve several stores. “It’s important to see what the best people in the world know about scaling a bakery,” he said. “Then we figure out how to do it our way.”Like many start-ups in neighbouring Silicon Valley, Blue Bottle is taking advantage of late-stage investors’ “crossover funds”, which are investing in private companies rather than waiting for them to go public.Before its latest $70m injection, Blue Bottle had raised $46m in two rounds, the most recent of which came just last year, led by Morgan Stanley.Its tech-industry investors, Index Ventures — backer of Just Eat, Moleskine and Sonos — True Ventures, an early Fitbit supporter, and Google Ventures are participating again in its latest round. It plans to raise another $5m from individual investors. Mr Meehan declined to comment on its valuation.While the sums invested may seem large for a coffee chain with fewer than 20 stores today, Blue Bottle is eager to maintain the quality and local appeal that made its name.“The third wave [of coffee] was about artisanal upstarts roasting their coffee in different ways and a super-obsessive attention to detail,” said Mr Robertson. “The fourth wave is bringing that same thing to a much wider audience without compromising it.”"

She added the commission would not “sacrifice the rule of law or the quality of our work to speed up the process”.All the countries deny wrongdoing and question the commission’s use of novel legal theories and allegations, claiming it attempts to interfere in sovereign tax policy through the backdoor. While tax policy is set by each member state in the EU, Brussels’ investigations are a test of whether it can — through competition enforcement — curb selective tax deals that allegedly give certain multinationals an unfair advantage.The commission last year launched four investigations into tax rulings, or comfort letters, where countries give multinationals assurances on their tax treatment. These include Ireland’s arrangements with Apple, Holland’s approval of Starbucks’ tax base, and Luxembourg’s clearance of structures used by Fiat and Amazon.Under its mandate to police the provision of illegal state support to companies, the commission can order countries to recoup any illegal aid stretching back up to 10 years.Earlier this month Apple addressed the potential consequences of the probe for the first time, warning investors that it could face “ material” financial penalties stemming from the probe into its tax deals with Ireland.EU state aid investigations are notorious for dragging on for years, partly because investigators are largely reliant on member states providing detailed information promptly.Luxembourg initially refused to comply with certain Brussels information requests relating to tax rulings and took the matter to court. In December Xavier Bettel, Luxembourg’s premier, agreed to share the information after the commission asked all EU member states to abide by a similar request.“We will do our best. It is among our top priorities,” Ms Vestager told MEPs, while admitting that gathering evidence was “time-consuming”. “Obviously, fast is better than slow, but better than all is being just.”Asked about trade union objections to McDonald’s tax dealings in Luxembourg, Ms Vestager said her staff were looking at the information and would be willing to open a probe if it was found to be warranted.“We cannot do every case in the world but we can find cases that we think [are] deeply problematic,” she said.

But Taposh Bari, an analyst at Goldman, said the new management has acknowledged “the need to change by returning to a culture rooted in creativity and invention”. The company has “expressed a renewed determination to create blockbuster theatrical content”, they added.“Our underlying thesis is that the “toy industry” is evolving from a legacy vendor model into part of a larger ecosystem integrated with media and technology,” Mr Bari said. He added that Lego, which recently announced dates for three new Lego movies, and Hasbro have adapted well to this change and that Mattel is now catching up.The El Segundo, California-based company has already entered into partnerships with Google, Nickelodeon, DC Entertainment and YouTube this year.Mattel shares, which declined more than 20 per cent in the past year, gained more than 4 per cent to $30.22.Better than expected first-quarter results buoyed shares of Starbucks, the world’s largest coffee chain.The Seattle-based company reported a 16 per cent rise in profits to $495m, or 33 cents per share, in the three months to the end of March from a year earlier, as traffic at its stores climbed and the company took greater control of its Japanese business. Sales rose 18 per cent to $4.56bn.Wall St analysts expected the Seattle-based company to report earnings of 32 cents a share and sales of $4.53bn.Same-store sales climbed 7 per cent in the period, ahead of forecasts for a 5 per cent gain.Sales in the Americas advanced 11 per cent from the same period a year ago, offsetting a 10 per cent fall in revenues in Europe, the Middle East and Africa that were hit by the strong US dollar.In China and Asia Pacific sales jumped 124 per cent, largely a result of Starbucks taking increasing control of its Japanese business.Starbucks shares gained 5 per cent to $51.91.Amazon shares jumped 14 per cent to $445.64, after the ecommerce giant topped revenue forecasts as investment in its data centre business began to pay off. The rally added more than $27bn to Amazon’s market valuation, which now sits at $209bn.Sales in Amazon Web Services, a fast-growing technology business that rents out computing power and software services to IT professionals, climbed 30 per cent from the previous year to $1.6bn. Overall sales rose 15 per cent to $22.7bn.Technology stocks rallied after Microsoft and Amazon reported results, while US stocks fluctuated near record levels.The S&P 500 rose 0.2 per cent to 2,117.69, the Dow Jones Industrial climbed 0.1 per cent to 18,080.14.

194;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-04-24T14:58:17Z;Blue Bottle and Tartine look to scale without losing identity;Coffee companies favoured by San Francisco tech elite merge to go global;Silicon Valley is highly caffeinated at the best of times. But when in 2012 the artisanal coffee company Blue Bottle Coffee took a $20m investment from backers including venture capital funds Google Ventures, True Ventures and Index Ventures, as well as the founders of Instagram and Twitter, “everyone was just saying ‘that’s the end’,” recalls Chad Robertson.“Coffee people are pretty particular and very judgmental. It was just brutal, all the talk coming out,” says Mr Robertson, the co-founder of Tartine Bakery, another artisanal favourite of the tech crowd.Mr Robertson had been grappling with the same challenge as Blue Bottle: how to scale a decidedly analogue business. “It’s very hard and rare, and not normal to start growing a company, especially a really artisanal brand, and improve it as you go,” he says.But Mr Robertson is so confident that Blue Bottle has “shown they can do it” that he sold Tartine this week to his Oakland neighbours, as part of a joint plan to expand across the US, into Asia and perhaps even Europe.Founded as a farmers’ market stall in 2002 by chief executive James Freeman, Blue Bottle has almost doubled its store count to 18 since that initial 2012 funding. It opened its latest outlet in Tokyo in February.Despite their popularity with San Francisco’s tech elite, Blue Bottle stores have no WiFi and no plugs because Mr Freeman wants people to talk to each other, rather than hide behind laptop screens.Each bag of Blue Bottle beans bears the date it was roasted but they are never ground in store because, Mr Freeman insists, customers should grind them at home to preserve the flavour.Obsessive details such as this have helped make him a poster boy for independent coffee culture across the US — and beyond.“When that first investment round happened, I told people I wanted them to taste this investment before they see it,” he says. So he doubled Blue Bottle’s quality control staff, built a training curriculum for its baristas, increased employee salaries and benefits, and had its buyers fly to more growers, more often.The coffee chain could become to Starbucks what the burger chain Shake Shack is to McDonald's, suggests Tony Conrad, a partner at True Ventures. “ Starbucks is a $75bn company. Can we get 1 or 2 per cent of that?” asks Mr Conrad. “That’s a billion dollar opportunity.”Blue Bottle says it is tapping into a new consumer that is “waking up” to product quality and food sourcing, says Bryan Meehan, executive chairman.The challenge will be to find a way of scaling an independent-minded brand. “Starbucks were once the highly sought after artisanal place that everyone wanted in their community. Then they became big and monolithic, and perceptions of them changed,” says Glenn Carroll, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.“The problem this company [Blue Bottle] will face is now they are operating like a business that is pursuing market share and possibly maximising profit down the road . . . ” he adds. “They are not anywhere near there yet but to the purist who cares about these things they have sold out. To the person who is fed up with Starbucks and wants something more artisanal they may be very appealing.”Mr Robertson and Mr Freeman have known each other for years but it was Mr Meehan, a co-founder of Fresh & Wild, the British chain of organic food stores that was acquired by Whole Foods Market for $38m in 2008, who sealed the Tartine deal. He managed Blue Bottle’s 2012 fundraising and another $26m round last year, led by Morgan Stanley.Mr Meehan says that sales are due to more than double this year and that the company is “very profitable at a store level”, as it continues to invest in back-office infrastructure and new openings.Tartine is Mr Meehan’s fourth acquisition at Blue Bottle, after Tonx, an online coffee bean retailer, Handsome Coffee, a roasters in Los Angeles and Perfect Coffee. The latter created a system, still in development, which grinds beans in an oxygen-free environment that can be vacuum sealed and mailed to customers to preserve the just-ground flavour.As Perfect Coffee shows, there is more tech DNA in the merging cafés than it might appear. Last year Blue Bottle hired Arion Paylo, who designed the software that runs Apple’s Genius Bar, to be its head of design and development. Tartine, for its part, counts so many Apple employees as customers that it appears in demonstrations and ads for the iPhone maker’s new Watch.Like Apple, Blue Bottle also prefers to control its retail experience, with wholesale accounting for just 10 per cent of revenues. “Nobody looks after your product more than you,” Mr Meehan says.While international expansion has focused on Asia, Mr Meehan says that opening Tartine in London “looks compelling . . . It’s just a question of sequence.”Mr Freeman says he is yet to figure out whether Blue Bottle’s scale tops out in the tens, hundreds or thousands of stores.“I think the coffee is better this year than it was last year and hopefully I can say the same thing next year,” he says.But despite all its tech ties, he is confident it does not face the same threat as other well-financed Silicon Valley start-ups. “We are not going to be disrupted — even though I hate that word — because coffee is tangible.”

Sales rose 18 per cent to $4.56bn.Wall St analysts expected the Seattle-based company to report earnings of 32 cents a share and sales of $4.53bn.Starbucks shares, which have climbed 20 per cent this year, rose another 5 per cent in after-hours trading.Starbucks has invested recently in new food offerings in a bid to buoy sales, opening its first ever tasting room late last year in Seattle, with plans to test delivery service in some metro areas.Same-store sales climbed 7 per cent in the period, ahead of forecasts for a 5 per cent gain.Sales in the Americas advanced 11 per cent from the year ago period, offsetting a 10 per cent fall in revenues in Europe, the Middle East and Africa after the US dollar strengthened.In China and Asia Pacific sales jumped 124 per cent, largely a result of Starbucks taking increasing control of its Japanese business.Howard Schultz, chief executive, said: “Innovation is the force that will continue to drive our business and enable us to expand and increase revenues and profits — always through the lens of humanity— long into the future.”
196;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-04-10T17:05:17Z;High street outlets offer dawn-to-dusk dining;Sandwich and coffee chains want a bigger slice of the eating out market;"Drop into your local coffee shop but order a beer; saunter down to the sandwich bar for an evening meal with wine at candlelit tables.Either sound like a nifty idea — or an outlet’s identity crisis depending on your point of view — but both have arrived, courtesy of Starbucks coffee group and Pret A Manger, the sandwich chain.The boundaries between different types of outlets are becoming blurred in the face of a more demanding consumer and rising competition for a bigger slice of the UK’s vibrant £33.5bn eating-out market.Pret, the UK’s biggest sandwich chain, demonstrated the need for established brands to cater to changing food and drink habits this week when it began serving dinners with wine and jazz at one of its central London branches.Starbucks, which has been selling beer, wine and dinner at its Stansted airport branch since February, has decided to expand its evening format to its outlet at Edinburgh airport later this month.The coffee chain’s action follows an incursion into its own territory by pub operator JD Wetherspoon. The cut-price chain has moved more aggressively into the breakfast and coffee market by cutting the price of its Lavazza filter coffee to 99p, with free refills, while serving breakfast, lunch and dinner as well as the odd pint.“It’s possible we’ll be selling more coffee than draught beer in 15 years, which will make pub aficionados blanch,” Tim Martin, chairman of Wetherspoon said last month. He is aiming to triple the company’s coffee and breakfast sales by the end of 2016.“Different companies are jumping on the bandwagon of the success of others,” said Helena Childe, senior foodservice analyst at Mintel, the market research group.“They are encroaching on restaurants to get a share of the leisure pound at a time when there is still pressure on consumer spending,” she adds.Mintel predicts that eating out will rise by 3.5 per cent this year to £34.7bn. The sector is one of the economy’s most buoyant, but Ms Childe says the relative maturity of the market means that growth is more likely to come from winning market share from other operators, rather than any underlying growth in consumer demand.Though real earnings are now ticking upwards, consumers are also unlikely to forget quickly the frugal lessons they have learnt from the recession. “They are scrutinising their spending more closely and questioning what constitutes value for money. So, operators have to proactively chase sales,” says Ms Childe.Pret says it is responding to consumer demands for more evening options, though is not currently planning to expand the dinner trial beyond its Strand branch in London’s theatre district.Nick Candler, Pret’s chief operating officer, says: “People are eating slightly more throughout the day. They want to be in charge of their own agenda and the times they eat.”Operators are also responding to what Nick Batram, leisure analyst at Peel Hunt, calls the rise of the “on-demand” consumer.“A lot of people used to be governed by the television schedule — having to be home for dinner to watch EastEnders, for example. Now they can watch what they like on demand — in fact they are on-demand consumers. Any successful business is thinking about how to take advantage of that,” he says.Starbucks’ push into dining, which started in the US in 2011, ensures that the coffee shop chain can cater to the needs of consumers at any time of the day, says Ian Cranna, the chain’s marketing vice-president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Offering alcohol has boosted coffee sales, he adds, with the option of beer and wine attracting groups of customers looking for a casual place to meet in the evening.There are other potential advantages too. Attracting consumers for breakfast in the morning, all the way through to drinks and dinner in the evening, means outlets can make the most of their property and equipment. In this way, cafés are “sweating their assets”, says Jeffrey Young, chief executive of Allegra Insights, the consultancy.But venturing beyond their traditional fields of expertise also carries risks.There are operational challenges in catering to the various food and drinks demands throughout the day, says Mr Young. Newcomers to the dinner market, such as Pret, could run into danger if they fail to match the experience consumers have come to expect when they dine out.Pret’s new evening trial matches bottles of wines at £18.50 with a menu that primarily consists of the foods it serves at lunchtime. “It does feel a bit incongruous if you’ve got expensive wines and the same foods you offer during the day,” says Mr Young.Consumers can also become confused about what a company stands for. Peter Martin, director at CGA Peach, the food and drinks consultancy, says the challenge for operators that are branching out, will be that of holding on to a distinct brand identity.“Where is the differentiation if everyone does everything?,” Mr Martin says.Speedy Pret keeps prices low, except on wineWith a candle on the table, polite and speedy service, and a window-side view on to a bright spring London evening, dinner at Pret A Manger promises all the trappings of a perfect date, writes Kadhim Shubber.Founded in 1986, Pret used to be a simple sandwich shop that would close in the late afternoon.Now with more than 300 shops in the UK and as far afield as Hong Kong, the chain is branching out into evening dining with wine, beer and a dinner menu that mostly consists of its hot lunch offering served in ceramics rather than cardboard.The format at Pret’s trial store on London’s Strand is similar to that of the Nando’s chicken chain. From 6pm each evening, staff greet you at the door, guide you to a table and bring you your food after you have ordered at the counter. It stays open until 11pm and attracts theatregoers.All of the food costs less than £6 — I choose the Korean BBQ pulled pork, with quinoa rice and pickled red cabbage, while my date opts for the kale and cauliflower macaroni cheese.Together our meal comes to just over £10.The wine, however, is surprisingly pricey — the selection of three whites and three reds on offer comes in at a flat rate of £18.50 a bottle. Our final bill is £29.40.Amy Morcom, a 26-year-old stage manager who works nearby in the West End, is impressed by the salad and beer she is enjoying with her friend, Zoe.“I don’t know what else you’d do for that price and speed range,” she says.But she would be unimpressed if invited to Pret for a date, she adds, even with the candles.Back to the top of the page"
197;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-04-08T16:43:31Z;Pret A Manger launches dinner menu;Service aimed at theatre goers seeking a quick meal;Pret A Manger, the sandwich chain, has begun serving dinners with wine, jazz and “really posh olives” at one of its central London branches.Diners at the Pret branch on the Strand are shown to candlelit tables and offered a menu including Lemon and Rosemary Chicken salad, Korean pulled pork and sourdough bread from Bertinet, an artisan baker in Bath.On the counter are bottles of wine, prosecco and craft beer.Other fast-food chains have also begun experiments to see if they can stretch their peak service periods and tempt budget-conscious diners.Starbucks now serves wine, cheese and hot meals after 4pm at 34 branches in the United States and at its branch in Stansted airport.“This was in response to customer demand,” said Pret, which is owned by Bridgepoint Capital. “We have been told by customers for quite some time that they want to see more evening options from us.“We have been working on the menu for around six months, and there were discussions prior to that. The majority of the ingredients are ones that we already work with each day, but we have a new bread for some of our small plates and rye and sourdough toasties, for example, that was developed for us by Bertinet, the artisan bakery.”The move is aimed at theatre goers seeking a quick meal, and Pret said it is not currently planning to expand the initiative. The spokesman said the branch on the Strand had already been open until 11pm each night serving a normal menu.
198;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-04-01T16:05:39Z;Companies are preaching to a new audience;Younger consumers with liberal attitudes are a bigger market than religious conservatives;By stepping into the furore over Indiana’s religious freedom law, in defence of gay rights, Tim Cook is boldly taking Apple where companies have been wary about going before. But he is not the only US business leader advocating for a deeply-held personal belief — so have Marc Benioff of Salesforce.com on the same issue, and Howard Schultz of Starbucks on racial discrimination and violence.In addition to chief executives speaking out about social matters on which they might have remained silent a few years ago, they are adopting liberal stances that often clash with political and religious conservatives. On gay marriage in particular, companies are ignoring the traditional advice that they should stick to maximising profits within what Milton Friedman, the economist, called “the rules of the game”.“Discrimination, in all its forms, is bad for business,” Mr Cook declared in an article in the Washington Post this week. Having nodded to the shareholder value caucus, he then made very clear where his heart lies. “It isn’t a religious issue. This is about how we treat each other as human beings,” wrote Mr Cook, who is himself gay, in his effort to change the rules in Indiana and conservative states such as Arkansas.On a narrow view of corporate self-interest, Mr Cook is misguided to criticise Mike Pence, Indiana’s Republican governor. If employers with conservative religious views do not employ gay people, or refuse to serve them, that merely weakens the competition for Apple and others. Prejudice drives up his rivals’ wage costs and reduces the size of their addressable market.On a broader view, including how Apple and Starbucks project their brands, these leaders are talking sense. There would be a far bigger tension between shareholder value and the chief executive’s beliefs had Mr Schultz argued for racial discrimination rather than launching Starbucks’ “Race Together” campaign, which started awkwardly with baristas trying to engage customers in conversation on the topic.Friedman was essentially right in his book Capitalism and Freedom that the discrimination tends to be curbed by the market because it is irrational — it introduces unnecessary costs, giving a company that is colour or gender-blind an edge. “Those of us who regard colour of skin as irrelevant can buy some things more cheaply,” Friedman wrote, with his customary detachment.He drew on The Economics of Discrimination, the 1957 book by the Nobel-winning economist Gary Becker. As Catherine Rampell noted in the Washington Post, Becker found that prejudice imposes costs on discriminators as well as those discriminated against. Prejudice tends to linger in closed institutions such as churches, while being driven out by competition.All things being equal, companies take a liberal view of, for example, immigration because they want to gain access to skilled labour. That is evident in US companies’ support for immigrant visas and UK companies’ backing for free labour movement within the EU. Employers do not mind where a worker was born if he or she is productive, adaptable and hard-working.Oct 30 2014: Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, has revealed his sexual orientation publicly for the first time. Michael Skapinker, columnist on business and society for the FT, talks to Ravi Mattu about what the disclosure means for the corporate world.It does not always work as it should, of course. Whatever their theoretical self-interest, employers are often prejudiced. One study, for example, found that young people applying for internships at German companies were 14 per cent more likely to be called back if they had German, rather than Turkish, names. Smaller companies discriminated most — the national name premium was 24 per cent.Plenty also depends on customer attitudes. Wage discrimination has fallen over time in US professional basketball, where most players are black — white players were heavily overpaid in the 1980s, adjusted for skill, but they now tend not to be. This may be because fans have become less prejudiced and will no longer pay more to see white players, another study suggests.This is the key. Employers can argue narrowly that prejudice is an administrative problem. Some 379 companies including Apple, Amazon, eBay, PepsiCo and Starbucks, have signed a brief to the Supreme Court on a forthcoming gay marriage case. They claim that having different state laws “breeds unnecessary confusion, tension and diminished morale” internally and raises employers’ costs by $1bn a year.But these chief executives are not taking a public stand because of a fine operational calculation. They are doing it because they believe in what they say, and they think that their customers do too. Younger consumers with liberal social attitudes are a bigger target market than religious conservatives, and companies are quickly reorienting themselves to millennials.Aaron Chatterji, associate professor at Duke University, argues that such companies want to “reach younger, more diverse, more progressive customers and potential employees”. Mr Cook’s pledge that “Apple is open. Open to everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, how they worship or who they love,” could equally serve as a marketing slogan.The US is not the only country where religion and anti-discrimination laws clash. Churches in Germany have historically resisted equal rights for employees who are gay or divorced. The Catholic church is now thinking of reforming its ecclesiastical labour rules. It clearly feels in a minority.john.gapper@ft.com
199;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-03-26T17:24:41Z;Indiana signs ‘religious freedom’ bill;Big companies oppose law enabling businesses to refuse service to gay and lesbian patrons;Indiana Governor Mike Pence has signed a bill that would allow businesses to refuse service to gay and lesbian patrons on the grounds of “religious freedom”, even as some of the state’s largest business interests oppose the measure.Mr Pence, a potential 2016 presidential contender, said he signed the bill because “many people of faith feel their religious liberty is under attack by government action”.He added: “If I thought it legalised discrimination in any way in Indiana, I would have vetoed it.”But critics argue that the bill does just that. Some of the state’s largest employers have expressed concerns, including pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, engine manufacturer Cummins and Salesforce, the tech company.Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, said on Twitter that the $43bn company is “forced to dramatically reduce our investment in (Indiana) based on our employees’ and customers’ outrage” over the bill. He said the company would cancel “all programmes that require our customers/employees to travel to Indiana to face discrimination”.Greg Ballard, the Republican mayor of Indianapolis, has said that the Indiana law sends the “wrong signal”. “Indianapolis strives to be a welcoming place that attracts businesses, conventions, visitors and residents,” he said in a statement Wednesday.Mr Ballard’s comments point to how for many companies — including Starbucks, Google and Alcoa — and the politicians seeking to attract their business, same-sex marriage and gay rights are often both moral issues and business imperatives.In recent days, three major conventions have threatened to pull out of the state because of the bill. The organisers of Gen Con, the city’s largest convention, said the law “will have a direct negative impact on the state’s economy, and will factor into our decision-making on hosting the convention in the state of Indiana in future years”.The resistance in Indiana comes roughly a year after Republican Arizona Governor Jan Brewer vetoed a similar bill under pressure from Delta, American Airlines, Marriott International and Apple. Arizona’s Republican senators, Jeff Flake and John McCain, also opposed the bill, saying it was bad for business.Nineteen states have adopted so-called “religious freedom” bills gradually since 1993, when a similar federal statute was passed. But the last two years have seen a flurry of activity in Nevada, Arkansas, Georgia, Missouri, Texas and other states as social conservatives seek to respond to a string of court victories for gay marriage proponents that has swiftly led to marriage equality in 37 states.Many people of faith feel their religious liberty is under attack by government actionThe Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments about gay marriage bans on April 28 and is likely to decide their legality by this summer.The tension reveals a rift between the Republican Party’s traditional big business interests and more religiously conservative small business owners, says Les Lenkowsky, who served in the George W Bush administration and worked closely with its office of faith-based initiatives.“Big (particularly publicly traded) businesses feel that they need a wide variety of stakeholders — they’re in some ways quasi-public entities, whereas small businesses feel they are private entities,” said Mr Lenkowsky.
200;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
201;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-03-24T14:57:21Z;Everyone wants a taste of booming UK coffee market;Pubs and fast-food outlets are giving specialist shops a run for their money;Watch out Starbucks and Costa Coffee. A host of new entrants is piling into the business of providing time-pressed consumers with their caffeine shots.Pubs are stepping up investment in the segment, fast-food operators are improving their coffee offerings, and even the baker Greggs is revamping its shops to get in on the act, fuelled by Britons’ growing thirst for coffee outside the home.About 1.7bn cups of coffee are sold each year in the UK from more than 18,000 outlets, a total set to grow to almost 21,000 by 2020, according to Allegra Strategies, the consultancy.Compared with the rest of Europe, even this is small beans. In the UK people consume an average 2.8kg of coffee each year, far less than 12.2kg per capita in Finland.At the top end, specialist coffee retailers charge premium prices for high-quality beans, but in the rest of the sector, pubs and fast-food chains are jostling for market share with cut-price coffee that can often still compete on flavour.“The gap [in coffee quality] between the premium coffee purveyors and the likes of McDonald’s is much narrower now,” says Simon Matthews, analyst at Goodbody Stockbrokers.Costa is the market leader, with almost 2,000 stores in the UK and like-for-like growth of 6 per cent for the 50 weeks to February 12. The chain, owned by Whitbread, has plans to open another 250 stores worldwide in the next financial year.But it is now facing competition from some unlikely quarters. Last week JD Wetherspoon, the cut-price pub chain, brought the coffee price war to the boil by cutting the price of its Lavazza filter coffee to 99p, with free refills.The gap [in coffee quality] between the premium coffee purveyors and the likes of McDonald’s is much narrower nowThe company now sells almost 1m coffees a week and more people visit the pubs for breakfast than Pret A Manger or Caffè Nero, according to CGA Peach, the food and drinks consultancy.By the end of 2016, chairman Tim Martin aims to triple its coffee and breakfast sales, further blurring the distinction between pub and coffee shop.Wetherspoon already sells almost as much coffee as it does real ale, he says, even before the price cut.“It’s possible we’ll be selling more coffee than draught beer in 15 years, which will make pub aficionados blanch,” he adds.Peter Martin, director at CGA Peach, says the chain should be treated as a serious contender in the coffee market.“[The coffee] may be at an attractive price point, but it doesn’t mean to say they’re playing at it and it isn’t good quality,” he says.1.25mCups of coffee sold by Fuller’s annuallyOther pubs have taken a similar path. Fuller’s, the brewery and pub chain, now sells more than 1.25m cups a year and opened a coffee shop last October as a centre to train its staff as baristas.But pubs are not the only sector chasing consumer demand for breakfasts, food-on-the-go, and above all coffee.“It doesn’t matter where you go, specialist chains, fast-food operators, we’re all looking to offer coffee because customers want it,” says Roger Whiteside, chief executive of Greggs.When he joined the company in 2013, Mr Whiteside abandoned the trial of a sit-down coffee shop format and instead set about revamping the entire estate to make it easier to sell coffee and food-on-the-go. Over the next two years the remaining 400 stores of its 1,650 estate will be completed.Coffee is its fastest-selling product line, and has been growing at double digit rates for six years, though Mr Whiteside declined to put a precise figure on the growth. Last year, Greggs sold £1m-worth of coffee each week.It doesn’t matter where you go, specialist chains, fast-food operators, we’re all looking to offer coffee because customers want itAlthough the coffee comes cheap, often as part of meal deals, Mr Whiteside says they cannot rely on low prices to attract coffee drinkers.“If we want people to drink our coffee, it has to be as good as the coffee operators,” says Mr Whiteside.In turn the coffee operators have had to up their game, says Mark Brumby, an independent analyst at Langton Capital. “There’s no market for bad service and bad coffee. There’s just so much choice,” he says.That choice has encouraged Starbucks to focus on “dessert drinks” to differentiate themselves from the wide availability of good coffee on the market, according to Mintel, the market research company.Despite the increased activity, the coffee sector is still far from saturation, says Stuart Gordon, an analyst at Berenberg.The average spend in a coffee shop continues to rise and consumers are also visiting coffee shops more frequently, he adds. Five years ago, one in nine people visited a coffee shop daily. That has risen to 1 in 5 people.“More importantly this growth has not been slowing,” he says. “In a nutshell it does not look like we are anywhere near saturation despite the mushrooming number of options.”
202;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Starbucks aims to brew the right thing;A model for those seeking to create brand ‘narrative’ in this brave new media world;During the last century, Americans used to say that our political candidates were marketed as if they were soap powder. Now, it’s the other way around. Some of the country’s biggest businesses are behaving as if they are running for something.The latest example comes to us from the land of the Skinny Vanilla Latte and Cinnamon Dolce Frappuccino. Starbucks has decided it is no longer sufficient to simply sell food and drinks with names ending in vowels. The company moved decisively this week to promote harmony and understanding, too.Starbucks wants to chat with its US customers about racism. Partners, as it calls its workers, have been instructed to write the words “race together” on Starbucks cups in hopes of stirring the conversation. “We at Starbucks should be willing to talk about these issues in America,” said Howard Schultz, the company’s chairman and chief executive. “Staying silent is not who we are.”I cringed when I read this because I generally like my baristas on the quiet side. Although I’m not a big fan of Starbucks, I drop in now and then, usually when I’m on the road or struggling at work and need a coffee to keep going. Being reminded of racism and all that entails — Auschwitz, for instance — isn’t exactly what I want at such moments.Nor am I the only American with concerns about the Starbucks effort. The Twitterati served up a venti-sized serving of snark in response, suggesting such faux slogans for the chain as: “some of my best friends are black coffee”, “tea shall overcome”, “brew the right thing” and “I have a cream”.But like it or not, I suspect we will see more of these high-minded corporate campaigns. Times are tough for the big brand builders of the food and beverage world — everyone from McDonald’s and Coca-Cola to Campbell’s Soup, Kellogg and Kraft Foods is dealing with disappointing results — and doing good works represents a logical marketing response.Like many of us, these companies are struggling to adapt to new technologies. They once were able to dominate the conversation about their products, pounding the public with television advertisements proclaiming their virtues. But that world is no more. The internet, the digital video recorder and the television remote control are all enabling people to avoid commercials.Creating a brand “narrative” in this brave new media world is tricky. But there is an obvious model for success — our politicians and those big themes of theirs. The masters of the campaign trail know how to reach the masses and to sell without delving into specifics. Indeed, there is a whiff of the old Barack Obama — the one who presided over a “teachable moment” on race in the Rose Garden of the White House — in Starbuck’s new political brew.Promoting civic harmony represents a way for Starbucks to define itself without reference to its coffee or tea — and, let’s face it, there was nothing particularly virtuous about a $5 Frappuccino in the first place. Rather, the company is encouraging consumers to focus on its ethos — its good intentions. That is the brand, not the flavoured water in the paper cup with the plastic top.Americans this week made fun of Starbucks, but they took notice of the company — and responded. The Starbucks campaign trended on Twitter. Moreover, online mockery reinforced the message that the company is run by nice folks — maybe a tad fey — but nice nonetheless, which is more than can be said for many of its competitors.Danger looms for big companies in the US that fail to do good in the Starbucks sense. They can be carved up in the social media before their public relations teams have time to down their morning cappuccino and respond.McDonald’s discovered this the hard way this week. With help from the Service Employees International Union, McDonald’s restaurant employees in 19 cities filed complaints with federal and state regulators, alleging their working conditions were unsafe.The workers complained in particular about burns from hot grills and fryer oil. Brittney Berry, 24, of Chicago, said when she slipped and fell on a wet floor and burnt her forearm on a grill: “The managers told me to put mustard on it, but I ended up having to get rushed to the hospital in an ambulance.”The filings represented the latest example of what is becoming a familiar tactic of the US labour movement: naming and shaming. Unable to win at the bargaining table, unions are looking to punish managements in the court of public opinion — where their chances of success are as decent as those of anyone else with an iPhone. Similar pressure was applied to Walmart before it said this year that it would lift its minimum wage.McDonald’s responded this week as one would expect, pledging to review the allegations and maintain its commitment to providing safe working conditions. But the public relations damage was done, at least for the time being.It all made me appreciate the marketing method in Starbucks’ political madness. Whatever else you want to say about the company, it was playing offence in the brand wars, displaying a social conscience before anyone could accuse it of not having one.gary.silverman@ft.com——————————————-Letter in response to this column:Starbucks risks stirring up a dangerous brew / From Elizabeth Rohwer
203;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks defends ‘race together’ policy;Coffee chain ridiculed for initiative designed to spur conversations over race and inequality;Howard Schultz, chief executive of Starbucks, announced the company’s first stock split since 2005 as he defended a new company initiative aimed at spurring conversations around race in America that has come under heavy criticism.Mr Schultz announced the two-for-one stock split — the first in nearly a decade and sixth overall — at the coffee chain’s annual shareholder meeting, which included an extended discussion of race involving speeches by the rapper Common, board member Mellody Hobson and Mr Schultz.In the months since police killings of unarmed black people sparked nationwide protests, Mr Schultz said he had learned “the great need for empathy, compassion, understanding, and metaphorically trying to put your . . . feet in someone else’s shoes.”If it excludes people because of their race, “we have to ask ourselves . . . is this the American promise that we were told to believe in?” he said. “We can’t continue to talk about racial injustice as something that doesn’t affect us.”In response, the company announced the “race together” campaign earlier this week. It involves employees writing that phrase on coffee cups and trying to “stimulate conversation, compassion and positive action regarding race in America”.Starbucks said it had launched the initiative after convening open forums with employees around the country in recent months. Around 40 per cent of workers at its roughly 12,000 US outlets are minorities.A national debate over the inequitable treatment of African Americans by law enforcement has raged since last summer, when shootings in Cleveland, New York and Ferguson, Missouri, highlighted glaring racial disparities in law enforcement.Earlier this month, the justice department released a report that revealed that the Ferguson police and court system systematically targeted African Americans in order to generate revenue for the city budget. It confirmed what many black residents of the St Louis region and communities across the country have long argued about unequal treatment.We can’t continue to talk about racial injustice as something that doesn’t affect usMr Schultz said that at times during the employee forums he had to “fight back tears” as employees told tales of “tragic racial injustice”. Though “Starbucks itself is not going to solve centuries’ old problems of racism in America”, he said he expected other businesses to follow its lead.The company has a long history of engaging with social issues, including hiring military veterans, asking gun owners to stop bringing weapons to its stores and supporting gay marriage.But social media users reacted with ridicule, with some pointing out that Starbucks’ leadership team is almost entirely white while others questioned whether employees were qualified to carry on complex conversations about race at the cash register.To cynics, Mr Schultz said: “This is not some marketing or PR exercise. This is to do one thing: use our national footprint and scale for good.”The company’s shares closed up 1.5 per cent at $95.84. Shareholders who own stock as of March 30 will receive one share for each they have, with new shares payable on April 8.The stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on April 9.
204;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-03-17T08:52:01Z;Young Americans turn to tea;US taste for coffee ebbs while Brits swap teapots for percolators;If the US television sitcom Friends were to be remade today, the characters sitting in the Central Perk café would be sipping on mugs of green tea rather than coffee.According to the National Coffee Association’s latest annual survey, 59 per cent of Americans said they drink a cup of coffee a day, down from 61 per cent in 2014 and 63 per cent in 2013.This is bad news for coffee traders already fretting about the recent fall in arabica bean prices.The US is the world’s largest coffee-drinking nation and coffee remains the predominant hot beverage, say analysts. But more people — especially young consumers — are drinking tea, with the total wholesale value of tea sold in the US growing from less than $2bn in 1990 to more than $10bn in 2014.Peter Goggi, president of the Tea Association of the USA, says the trend seems to be pronounced among those who are aged between 16 and 26. “Clearly what we’re seeing is the message that tea is good for your health has really permeated,” he says.Tea shops are popping up nationwide, as it emerges as a low-fat beverage of choice. Companies have moved into tea such as Starbucks, which bought speciality company Teavana a few years ago.Mr Goggi says the trend is “huge” in the US, as tea gains what beverage executives call “share of throat” among consumers. And while iced tea has always dominated the tea category, anecdotal evidence suggests consumption of the hot brew is on the rise.According to a survey by pollster YouGov in the US, coffee and tea are equally popular among 18- to 29-year-olds, with 42 per cent preferring coffee and 42 per cent opting for tea.This contrasted with 70 per cent of over-65s preferring coffee to tea (only 21 per cent chose tea), and a 62 per cent coffee bias among 45- to 64-year-olds.The rising popularity of tea in the US comes as the one of the leading consuming nations of the brew, the UK, is seeing sales decline.Trade data show that tea imports in the UK have fallen 20 per cent in volume over the past decade compared with a 30 per cent rise in the US. Statistics from Euromonitor, the consumer data group, show that the UK is still one of the largest tea-drinking countries, coming in fifth in terms of per capita consumption.However, in the UK, people are drinking less tea and turning to coffee. Consumption has fallen steadily from 1.6kg in 2009 per person to 1.4kg in 2014, compared with a rise in coffee usage from 0.9kg to 1.2kg in the same period.The country’s tea consumption has fallen victim to a change in workplace habits, says one seasoned tea and coffee specialist.Lionel de Roland-Phillips, who heads Johannesburg-based international tea and coffee trader I & M Smith, says: “Thirty to 40 years ago, every company in the UK had a daily tea trolley and regular tea breaks. That’s all disappeared.”The Commodities Note is online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times——————————————-Letter in response to this article:‘ Share of throat’ is too strong a term / From Jonathan P Kahn
205;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-03-12T12:40:41Z;On a tax avoidance tour of London;ActionAid’s guided walk leaves out the capital’s usual sights of interest;"“I support the tax-dodging bill” badges are handed to the group of 20, gathering by the Eros statue in London’s Piccadilly. This is a walking tour with a twist. Buckingham Palace is off the itinerary. The two guides sporting bowler hats and waving umbrellas will avoid the traditional tourist traps. Instead, we will be touring the banks, shops and tax advisers of Mayfair.For this is a tax tour, organised by ActionAid, the international development charity. Making stops at various company branches and offices, the charity hopes to make the complicated subject of tax avoidance intelligible to the assorted group, whose ages range from early twenties to seventies. More than that, ActionAid wants people to lobby whichever government is elected in May to introduce a bill to crack down on tax avoidance by businesses operating in the UK.This is not a hard sell; the walkers are enraged by tax avoidance. On the topic of HSBC, currently embroiled in a scandal over its role in alleged tax-dodging, Mimi Sharma, a professor on study leave from the University of Hawaii, is furious: “All these horrible bankers and heads of companies who have milked the people and walk away with millions as their bonus and pay.”This anger over tax avoidance is not unusual. Last year, a poll by ComRes for Christian Aid and ActionAid, found that more than 85 per cent of British adults say tax avoidance by large companies is morally wrong even if it is legal.The tax tour is not attempting to change people’s minds, says Natasha Adams, guide and activism officer for ActionAid. “It’s trying to get people to get their heads around how this stuff actually works. People switch off when they hear economics being discussed.” Tax lectures can be dull, she points out.Lucy McDonnell works for a charity based in Mayfair and came to find out who the local tax dodgers are. “I’ve read so many articles on tax. [This makes it] a bit more real life.”On this trip, a coffee break turns out not to be a chance for a cappuccino but to stand outside Starbucks and talk about tax avoidance. Ms Adams reads out a quote from the Public Accounts Committee of MPs, which has recently been grilling HSBC. It said that the coffee chain was “either running the business very badly or there is some fiddle going on”.Profit-shifting schemes are explained by bags of chocolate coins. At the end, the tour leaders redistribute the wealth; we each get a coin. Fairtrade, of course; milk-free for the vegans.ActionAid’s tour is one of a number in London run by campaigning groups aiming to explain the inner workings of the City of London and make corporate misdeeds tangible.Occupy London Tours, organised by volunteers linked to the Occupy movement, visit the City, Canary Wharf and Mayfair. Max Wakefield, one of the guides, says they attract a range of attendees including tourists and finance workers, as well as students. On occasion, security tries to move them along. “They can’t really object to people going on a walking tour. It’s not a protest.” The financial sector, he says, can be “fiendishly complicated” and he sees the tours as a “gateway to learning” with the hope that people will then be inspired to campaign against capitalism’s excesses.Julie Botticello, a lecturer in public health is on ActionAid’s tour with three colleagues on a “girls’ night out”. Previous jollies have included talks on in­equality. Next on the agenda is a documentary on the formula milk industry.The tour is helping to clarify tax issues for her. “[It’s] a difficult system to fight. It’s frustrating. People who live in poverty remain in poverty.” She adds with a laugh: “It’s quite a nice evening.”"
206;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-03-11T11:37:29Z;Review: Do the Kind Thing, by Daniel Lubetzky;A mix of preaching and genuine insight into the creation of a ‘not just for profit’ enterprise;"One day, when he was 25 years old, Daniel Lubetzky lay on his bed in his studio flat and realised his life was becoming intolerable. A tower of Dead Sea soaps, piled high by his bed, threatened to collapse on top of him. His path to the bathroom was blocked by stacks of sun-dried tomato spread, also imported from the Middle East, which he could not sell because they did not taste quite right and their lids leaked oil.Every day, as he pounded the pavements of Manhattan, in a new city where he had few friends, shopkeepers told him his products would not sell.Two decades later, Lubetzky is basking in his hard-won success. His Kind Healthy Snacks company sells 458m fruit and nut bars a year, as shown in a chart in his new book, Do the Kind Thing (there is no graph for profit, though he tells us he was clearing sales of $13m in 2008). And the story of how he got here makes an enjoyable read. Lubetzky does not skirt around the painful details of clueless early entrepreneurship, describing his pricing structure at one point as “insanely dumb”, nor the lessons he learns on his long slog to profit.As the title suggests, the book is also Lubetzky’s manifesto for social enterprise or what he calls the “not-only-for-profit” company. His early business, intended, we are told, to help bring peace to the Middle East, has morphed into Peaceworks, a global business that promotes peace through commercial ventures among Israelis, Palestinians and others. This is clearly terrific, but Lubetzky’s social evangelism does not make enriching reading. This is largely down to his tone, which suggests a low view of his readers, as if they might never have considered behaving compassionately before. His description of the importance of empathy, especially, reads like a lesson to robots in human behaviour.At times, the only possible response to his self-congratulatory mix of commerce and compassion is cynicism. “In our ideal world,” he writes, explaining the cards that Kind hands out — an advertising gimmick that also, supposedly, spreads kindness — “in the morning a person eats Kind Healthy Grains Clusters with their yoghurt . . . and in the evening she spots a person doing a kind act and gives that person a #kindawesome card”.When he stops preaching and returns to his own tale, Lubetzky again becomes likeable. As his business flourishes, there is a lot of wise advice about matters from product development to people management. He is endearingly honest about the vicissitudes of his “Starbucks crush” as the coffee chain stocks his bars, removes them and then sells them again.As he finished writing the book, Lubetzky attended a swanky dinner where he recognised the waiter as the smiley building superintendent who had helped him lug boxes of soap into his apartment building 20 years earlier.Admitting he had not given the man a thought in years, Lubetzky thanks him in the acknowledgments for his friendliness at a tough time. This note offers a better lesson in how to behave than any of the self-referential piety that precedes it. As ever, the showing beats the telling.

207;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-03-10T12:49:06Z;The cappuccino kings changing the way Cambodians drink coffee;A local company has brought the café culture of big western cities to Phnom Penh;Starbucks has not launched in Cambodia yet. But Chang Bunleang, co-founder of Phnom Penh-based Brown Coffee, is ready if it does.“I think [we could] give Starbucks a hard time, if they come in,” says the 29-year-old entrepreneur, stressing the need for Brown to be ready. “We’ll educate customers a lot on coffee — what is good, what is not good.”It is a confident response from a young man with big plans and a record of relentless expansion that could be modelled on Starbucks’ own. Since its launch in 2009, Brown has morphed from five cousins’ post-graduation dream into a wildly popular hang-out for wealthier locals and expatriates, in one of the region’s more laid-back capitals. It has also pioneered a gastronomic innovation in Cambodia, where coffee has traditionally meant iced, loaded with sweetened milk and filtered through a sock-like cloth sieve.“Young Cambodians are drinking espressos, cappuccinos and lattes main­ly because Brown taught them how to do it,” says Kevin Doyle, a longtime foreign resident in the country. “It was a huge gamble, but people took to it because the company was Cambodian — and there are no end of imitators now.”Mr Chang Bunleang is speaking in the branch that was eighth of its 10 outlets to open, a spare foundry-like space with high ceilings and metal rails running above the counter. “Now the very trendy café style is more of the post-industrial kind of look — vintage, old,” says Brown’s managing director.If it all feels a bit Lower Manhattan or gentrified east London, that is because Brown’s inspiration is the café culture of big western cities such as Sydney, where Mr Chang Bunleang studied communications. His co-founders comprise two engineers, an architect and an interior designer, a useful combination when it came to creating the melange of styles Brown uses in its branches. These range from Zen minimalist to an old French colonial house set back from the Mekong river. Foreign rivals in Phnom Penh include Costa Coffee, The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, and Caffebene of South Korea.Fresh-faced and lean, Mr Chang Bunleang grew up in Phnom Penh and originally wanted to work in law or development. That all changed when he and his cousins returned from overseas study and plotted, appropriately in a café in the capital now named Secret Recipe, how they would remould the coffee market.Brown’s founding quintet had a big — arguably, crucial — helping hand in the form of a $150,000 interest free loan from their families. The company’s good cash flow also allows it to take out bank loans at about 6.5 per cent interest, significantly cheaper than the norm of 8 per cent-plus. The founders have plough­ed their dividends into the company and plan to do so for some time.“We are lucky to have parents investing in our business,” he says. “But if we were not working very hard, we wouldn’t have what we do today.”While Brown does not disclose full de­t­ails of its financial performance, Mr Chang Bunleang says sales reached about $500,000 a month last year, with a profit margin of 15 to 20 per cent.The company, which also runs two bistros and a franchise for a Taiwanese bubble tea (milky drink) company, may yet become the third to list on Cambodia’s fledgling stock market — the first two are a Taiwanese clothing company and the Phnom Penh Water Supply Authority. Mr Chang Bunleang says Brown has attracted interest from venture capital companies in Singapore and Thailand and from potential partners in Japan, but he is wary of investors who just want to “make us big and then sell us out”.About 70 per cent of Brown’s customers are Cambodian— it had soon realised that its projected 50-50 local-expat split was not viable — but it is still a work in progress to persuade some local clients that the Brown experience is worth it. “The Cambodian customer will say, ‘Oh, we are paying $2 for this amount, 30ml of drink? Are you sure this is the right coffee?’” he says.Brown has also faced some criticism for having its menus in English and prices in dollars, despite official efforts to promote the use of the Cambodian riel. Chea Serey, director-general of central banking at the National Bank of Cambodia, says she has told Mr Chang Bunleang she likes his operation but would “like it even better if you list your prices in Cambodian local currency”.Mr Chang Bunleang says Brown is considering making greater use of the riel. The menus have pictures to help those who do not speak good English, and he adds that making the stores multilingual would be fiddly: “How do you translate ‘cappuccino’ into Khmer?”He is certainly keen to project the company’s Cambodian authenticity. He points to its entirely local workforce of 380, many of them students who go to college in the morning before putting in a shift as a barista or waiter.Mr Chang Bunleang also shows a hint of irritation at Cambodia’s poor image in the west, where it is still remembered mostly for the Khmer Rouge genocide four decades ago. Instead, he highlights the strong economic growth and rising foreign investment over the past decade, with companies such as Aeon of Japan and Asia’s biggest retailer coming in to tap the new wealth in what is still one of the region’s poorest countries. But overseas, people “hear about landmines in Cambodia, human rights issues, land grabbing, corruption”.There is, nevertheless, symbolism in a Cambodian company succeeding on its merits in a country where large sections of business are dominated by politically connected crony capitalism. Brown plans soon to launch a branch in Siem Reap, gateway town to the Angkor temple complex. Mr Chang Bunleang says this will give it a good idea of the feasibility of its strategy to expand to 30 branches nationwide. This will be a big step, since its Phnom Penh focus to date has allowed it to benefit from centralised facilities such as food kitchens.The next leap would be to neighbouring countries, such as Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam and Myanmar — all many times larger than Cambodia, with its 15m people. Mr Chang Bunleang thinks the single market expected to be launched at the end of the year by the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations could help in various ways, including by cutting tariffs such as the import taxes of 20 to 25 per cent levied on the Thai coffee beans Brown imports.As for the potential threat from Starbucks, already in Vietnam, Mr Chang Bunleang — perhaps optimistically — sees such a battle as a matter of taste, which Brown would win. He thinks the new Brown-cappuccino class will be loyal to its flavour, which he says is lighter than the multinational’s signature, and undeniably popular, dark roasts. “Coffee lovers . . . wouldn’t want that smoky taste,” he insists.Tips: Chang Bunleang on coffee in CambodiaTune your service to all clients’ tastes: Some foreign companies have made the cultural misstep of forcing customers to come to the counter, rather than serving them at the table wherever possible, Mr Chang Bunleang says. The flipside is that Brown had to train new and inexperienced staff to not crowd customers by standing too close.Cap the WiFi: Brown cafés are popular as an online hang-out for young Cambodians and expat freelancers, who may not have home internet or unlimited smartphone data packages. Brown limits every user’s bandwidth to stop the service seizing up.Self-criticism: Brown takes instant feedback where it can, especially from Cambodian customers: “We’ll have our customer service approach them to see how do they like it, is it too strong, is it too milky?”
208;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Asia’s coconuts go global – but what about the farmers?;;"For centuries, street vendors across southeast Asia have hacked open fresh coconuts, selling their refreshing water to thirsty passers-by to drink through a straw. For just as long, teenage girls have doused their hair in the coconut’s fortifying oil.More recently, western consumers have discovered the benefits of coconut products thanks to diet fads and celebrity endorsements — but will those benefits extend to producing countries?As dairy-free diets catch on, coconut milk has become a popular alternative to soy, prompting Starbucks to offer it in its US outlets from this month. Coconut water has benefited too, as glossy magazines and food blogs extol its health benefits.“It’s just this messaging about enhanced rehydration has resonated with consumers… when the big fizzy drink manufacturers are struggling with the war on sugar,” says Alex Beckett, drink analyst at Mintel, a market researcher company.The US market for coconut water is dominated by names such as Zico, owned by Coca-Cola, and Vita Coco, which counts pop star Madonna and actor Matthew McConaughey among its investors and sells one-litre packs of the fashionable drink for $5.29. Meanwhile, Pepsico has two labels, One and Kero-Coco, produced and widely sold in Brazil.Euromonitor valued Vita Coco’s global sales at $420m last year, with Kero-Coco making $406m, Zico $115m and One $49m. That remains modest compared with more established beverages like cola, where Euromonitor estimates market leaders Coca-Cola and Pepsi made sales of $52.5bn and $18.2bn last year. But the market is growing fast.As demand for a variety of coconut products ramps up, proving to be more than just a temporary fad,producers in emerging markets are now looking to make the most of the boom. Sri Lanka is one example.Along with tea and rubber, coconuts are big business in Sri Lanka. The country has a dedicated government department, the Ministry of Coconut Development and Janatha Estate Development. Coconut products contributed 0.8 per cent of GDP in 2013, according to the country’s Coconut Development Authority.To some extent, the south Asian economy has upped coconut exports as global demand has picked up. Some 445.7m nuts were exported in 2013, according to the Coconut Development Authority.But this is a small fraction of the country’s total 2.5bn production and many in the industry lament the fact that Sri Lanka hasn’t been able to grow to its full potential on the back of the new fashion for coconuts abroad.The processing industry is trying to move into higher value-added items. A spokesperson for Vita Coco told beyondbrics that one barrier is the fact that farmers in many countries see coconut water as a by-product and lack the technology to bring it to market – the water must be packaged very quickly after the nut is opened. In Sri Lanka, one of the 12 countries where Vita Coco produces, this is beginning to change“We have some technical barriers to get that coconut water into commercial production,” says Nemindra Manamperi, assistant director at the Sri Lanka Export Development Bank. “People are trying now and some mills are converted, and their water is coming into the industry.”Despite encouraging developments in western markets, the family that own Horathapola Estate, a 50 acre coconut plantation an hour from Colombo, converted their home into a luxury hotel in 2001 in an attempt to open new revenue streams – one sign that the Sri Lankan coconut industry hasn’t benefited as much from new global demand as you might expect.One reason is strong demand for coconuts at home, which has eclipsed the export market. Political commentators say onion prices can sway an election in neighbouring India, where the pungent bulbs are an essential ingredient in any curry, and the same claim is made for coconuts in Sri Lanka, where no meal is complete without a curry cooked in coconut milk or a dish based on desiccated coconut.Until production rises significantly, serving the home market will be the priority for the island’s farmers – whatever the demand abroad.“Demand by the Sri Lankans is inelastic, they will pay more and still want their daily consumption,” says Murtaza Lukmanjee, of Adamjee Lukmanjee and Sons, a Colombo trading house.Some producers would like to see the government encourage imports of other edible oils, such as palm oil, to serve domestic needs, freeing up coconut oil for export.Another problem is an inability to expand production in response to recent demand. Over 80 per cent of the land under coconut plantations is part of small holdings, often run by poorly-off farmers. The country’s famous ‘Coconut Triangle’, just north and east of Colombo, is valuable real estate, which also creates pressure for development.“You have to understand that Sri Lanka is a small country with a growing population, with simply a growing need for land, and coconut land is probably flat land and most suitable for housing and real estate,” Lukmanjee says.Sri Lanka’s coconut plantations are ageing as farmers have been slow to replant, even as overseas demand provides new opportunities. Planting anywhere involves risk. Weather conditions affect harvests and market prices change over time, so landowners are inclined to choose crops that can be harvested more quickly.“The problem with coconut is that it’s a five year cycle from plantation to a decent harvest and in today’s day and age people don’t have the patience for that,” says Lukmanjee. “How do you feed your family for the five years that you wait for the coconut tree?”Colombo is trying to tackle this problem and invested Skr596m ($4.5m) in subsidies in 2013, including spending on seeds.For farmers and producers to really invest in changing their ways and expanding exports, however, they must be convinced that overseas demand really is more than a fad and will not evaporate as soon as Madonna stops clutching a carton of coconut water or model Miranda Kerr begins touting an alternative beauty secret.“Yes, there’s a lot of growth,” says Lukmanjee. “But the growth needs to be sustained for, say, another decade to have long-term significant positive impacts.”Related reading:

209;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-02-24T16:38:27Z;Walmart pay rise obscures shift in US labour market;Employers are saving money with flexible scheduling, but the cost to workers can be high;Walmart employees may have cheered recent news that they had been given a pay rise. But for workers such as Fatmata Jabbie, life still feels precarious.Ms Jabbie, 21, who makes $8.80 an hour as a cashier at one of the grocer’s stores outside Washington, is faced each week with a seemingly arbitrary work schedule and has difficulties securing enough shifts.Like many low-paid retail and fast-food workers, she borrows money from friends to make ends meet and relies on government subsidies for childcare and healthcare. “I am a single mum and have a responsibility,” says Ms Jabbie, who works between 18 and 30 hours a week. “I would like to be able to afford to pay my rent, utilities and food.”Walmart last week broke ranks with many other US employers of low-paid workers and said it would pay all staff a starting rate of $9 an hour, rising to $10 for existing staff in 2016.When your hours are unpredictable it is very difficult to budget. It creates enormous uncertainty in workers’ livesThis will be small comfort to those at the sharp end of changes in the way millions of people are employed in the US, including the trend towards fluctuating and more unpredictable hours. Almost 7m US part-time workers are seeking full-time work in spite of a strong recovery in the jobs market.Rising insecurity is driven by sophisticated technology that allows retailers and restaurant chains to adjust work rotas at short notice to respond to their own needs.Such software can be a powerful tool for employers looking to control costs. But for employees, it creates an unpredictable schedule that makes it more difficult to juggle work and family commitments, and creates another hurdle for those who have two or more jobs.Erica Smiley, campaigns director for Jobs With Justice, a non-profit group, says the impact of so-called just-in-time scheduling can range from “aggravating to devastating”.Campaigners agree that wage increases such as Walmart’s are welcome in a country where real median family incomes were no higher in 2013 than the mid-1990s. But they caution that many workers in hourly or part-time posts face deeper problems.A University of Chicago study last year found 41 per cent of workers aged between 26-32 who are paid by the hour are given a week or less notice of their schedules, while four-fifths had experienced sharp fluctuations in weekly hours.Zara and Urban Outfitters, the retailers, and Popeye’s, a fast-food restaurant, are among those to come under fire for the notice employees are given on hours. Starbucks, the coffee chain, responded to a New York Times story detailing how workers were given schedules just days in advance with promises of improved working conditions.Susan Lambert, an author of the University of Chicago study, says: “When your hours are unpredictable it is very difficult to budget. It creates enormous uncertainty in workers’ lives.”Neil Trautwein, vice-president of healthcare policy at the National Retail Federation, an industry body, says part-time work is ideal for many because of “the need for employee flexibility — their desire to fit jobs around other responsibilities . . . school, family, other jobs”.He adds: “In selecting a job an individual needs to consider many factors, including scheduling”.In 1914, Henry Ford offered workers $5 a day for their labour — more than double the going rate. His motivations were not entirely altruistic: paying higher wages was a way of attracting reliable workers who would keep Ford’s factories humming…Continue readingKory Lundberg of Walmart, which has witnessed protests from workers over pay and conditions, insists employees are given their schedules at least two-and-a-half weeks in advance “so they can plan their lives”.Part-timers who want additional work can sign up for extra hours online, Mr Lundberg adds. While this system has been praised by some workers’ groups, others complain that shift availability varies from store to store.Legislation sponsored by Democrats to enforce greater predictability in hours failed to become law last year. Rosa DeLauro, a Democratic Representative who plans to introduce a similar bill in the coming weeks, accuses industry of “taking advantage of workers” and says public policy has not kept up with changes in family lives, where both men and women must juggle jobs and childcare. “That is why the need [for legislation on scheduling] is tremendous,” she adds.Yet inaction at a national level — the federal minimum wage has not changed since 2009 — contrasts with reforms at state and local level.A new law in Vermont gives employees the right to request flexible work for any reason. In San Francisco, reforms that include a requirement for retailers to provide two weeks’ advance notice of changes to workers’ schedules has been approved.Michelle Flores, a student working part-time at a store in the San Francisco Bay area, believes this will make a difference. “The unpredictability of my schedule really takes a toll on the amount of time I can invest in my studies and in myself,” she says.Anthony Rodriguez, who assembles bikes and appliances at a Walmart store in California, says the planned wage rise is a welcome development. “We are changing the way Walmart thinks, which is a good start,” he adds.
210;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2015-02-11T16:39:32Z;More tax pressure brews for Starbucks with EU reform push;Vow to make tax competition fairer could be precursor to more harmonised tax regime across Europe;It took a while.After 17 years in the UK, Starbucks went into the black there for the first time in 2014. Pre-tax profits of £1m in the year to September 28 may not look a lot, but they marked a £21.5m improvement on the year before, a turnround that any company could be proud of.Starbucks says the dramatic increase in profitability had nothing to do with the furore in 2012 sparked by Reuters’ revelation that the coffee chain had paid just £8.6m in corporation tax since opening its first store on London’s Kings Road in 1998. It also said there had been no impact on its numbers from the decision to shift its European headquarters from the Netherlands to the UK last April. Instead, it attributed the improvement to cost-cutting, including shutting underperforming shops, and “giving customers more”. Nevertheless, the upturn in profits was accompanied by a 206 per cent rise in the company’s tax bill. Starbucks paid £11.4m in tax last year, including £230,000 of tax on profits and half of the £20m it promised to pay following the threat of a boycott after the 2012 revelations.The pressure on Starbucks and other multinationals over tax is unlikely to ease. The Labour party has promised to crack down on UK tax avoidance, increase transparency and toughen penalties. The measures are just one of several pre-election promises that big business perceives as unfriendly to its interests, and which prompted the — fluffed — challenge to Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, on BBC’s Newsnight to name one business leader who supported his party.Disillusion with Labour in the big business community has prompted a dramatic decline in large donations to the party. And although Mr Balls and Chuka Umunna, shadow business secretary, talked up their love of business to the 1,000-strong audience at the British Chambers of Commerce annual conference in London this week, the fact that Ed Miliband, the party leader, was the only one of the leaders of the big three UK parties not to attend was widely regarded as yet another snub to the community.The Labour party may feel that alienating big business, even if sometimes inadvertently, will win them more friends than enemies among ordinary voters. The irony is that the core planks of its policy are not aggressively anti-business. Mr Miliband’s plans to raise the top rate of income tax and impose a levy on expensive homes will be more painful for wealthy chief executives than for the companies they run. Doubling paid paternity leave and giving workers a statutory right to bid for their company if it is sold are bigger issues for companies, both big and small, with financiers calling the plan to allow employees to act as white knights in any bidding war “half-baked” and “barking mad”.But on core business policies such as corporation tax, the differences between the main parties are minimal. The tax will fall to 20 per cent in April, a 1 percentage point cut that Labour has said it would reverse. But there are no suggestions that it will raise the tax back to anything near the 28 per cent it was when Gordon Brown, former prime minister, left office. And Labour has taken pains to echo the Conservatives’ pledge to keep corporation tax at the lowest level in the G20 which, both parties argue, gives the UK an important competitive edge.Whichever party wins the general election in May, how long it will be allowed to maintain that edge is debatable, because there are moves afoot to reduce national governments’ decision-making power in this area. One of the many anomalies of Europe’s “single market” is that corporate tax rates vary so significantly between countries. Governments have fully exercised their powers to use the rate — above 30 per cent in France, just below in Germany and a mere 12.5 per cent in Ireland — as a policy tool.However, change is afoot. The European Parliament has recommended setting up a temporary committee to look into tax arrangements agreed between member states and multinational companies. Last month, the new European commissioners for competition and for economic affairs vowed to make tax competition within the EU “fairer and more transparent” and promised to revive the commission’s proposal for a common consolidated corporate tax base.The moves are designed predominantly to address the state-aid cases involving Apple, Amazon, Fiat and Starbucks itself, but could be a precursor to a more harmonised tax regime across Europe. Proponents argue that this would make Europe a more attractive destination for foreign direct investment. What is for sure is that it means Starbucks cannot afford to relax yet — and if it happened, UK business bosses would really have something to gripe about.sarah.gordon@ft.com
211;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks brews up UK profit after 17 years;Under-fire coffee shop chain hails turnround strategy;Starbucks has finally brewed up a pre-tax profit in the UK, almost 17 years after setting up shop in the country.The coffee shop chain, which has been accused of using cross-border payments to minimise its UK corporation tax, reported pre-tax profits of £1m for the 52 weeks to September 28 2014, a £21.5m improvement on the previous year.Starbucks attributed the improvement to a turnround plan aimed at reducing store costs built up during its rapid expansion in the UK. Since 2011, it closed 67 unprofitable stores, contributing to a boost in operating margin of 540 basis points to 0.2 per cent.“The company’s strong performance is the result of a turnround strategy that has focused on engaging with our employees, giving customers more, growing the business and improving our model by rebalancing the store portfolio and carefully managing costs,” said Mark Fox, UK managing director.Campaigners and politicians criticised the company in 2012 after Reuters revealed it had only paid £8.6m in UK corporation tax since it opened its first UK store on London’s Kings Road in 1998. Its tax bill rose 206 per cent to £11.4m last year, including £230,000 of tax on profits and half of the £20m it promised to pay in 2012 following the threat of a boycott.The company has also been under pressure from the UK’s biggest coffee shop chain Costa Coffee, which is owned by Whitbread and has twice as many outlets. Costa’s aggressive store opening programme and its marketing has helped it dominate the coffee-shop sector, according to Nigel Parson, analyst at Canaccord Genuity.“Costa have done a great job of stuffing Starbucks, who haven’t helped themselves over the tax issue,” he said.Starbucks said it opened 121 stores “in more profitable locations and formats” since 2011, ending the financial year with 791 stores. Gross profits rose 24 per cent to £98.8m.The European Commission began investigating the company’s tax affairs last year as it launched a probe into whether the Netherlands had offered improper tax breaks to Starbucks.Starbucks moved its European headquarters from the Netherlands to the UK last April. Although the company said the move had no impact on its numbers this financial year, it is expected to boost its profits in future years as royalty payments from Starbucks’ European businesses that were previously made to its Dutch arm will be booked in the UK.
212;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T02:04:00+0000;Coffee chains brew robust future in China;Starbucks and Costa among western brands accelerating expansion amid surging popularity;From Best Buy to B&Q, many foreign brands and business models have struggled in China. But perhaps the least likely western retail concept of them all has prospered the most: foreign coffee shops.Despite a history of thousands of years of tea-drinking in China, coffee chains from the US, UK and South Korea are expanding rapidly and coffee shop sales are growing faster than almost any mainland retail segment. According to figures from Euromonitor, coffee chain sales have risen from less than Rmb10bn ($1.6bn) in 2008 to more than double that last year, with sales expected to double again by 2017.Starbucks, the US coffee chain, virtually created modern café culture from scratch in China, retail analysts say, pointing out that tea is not just the country’s most popular drink, it is also deeply embedded in Chinese culture.Since opening its first mainland store in 1999, Starbucks has become one of the most famous lifestyle brands on the mainland, by promoting its shops as stylish places to meet friends and approximate western lifestyle. Its popularity has even transformed Chinese taste buds, with fresh coffee consumption rising too.The market is also diversifying as it expands. In the past few years, niche Korean-style coffee houses have sprung up, independent cafés have become the places to see and be seen in big cities and everyone from McDonald’s and KFC to Japanese and Taiwanese convenience store brands has begun promoting fresh coffee sales.Starbucks shrugged off an attack last year on its high mainland prices by CCTV, the state broadcaster, and has only accelerated its expansion. It plans to double its current store count to more than 3,000 by 2019, it said earlier this month.Whitbread-owned Costa Coffee also plans to double its China stores, to 700 by 2018, according to Esteban Liang, Costa managing director for Asia. Maan Coffee, a popular South Korea-founded café-cum-casual restaurant chain, says it intends to double its current 100 mainland shops to 200 by the end of 2015.“Looking forward, the war between Korean, American, British [and] domestic coffee chains and stylish independent cafés…will create a great deal of diversification in the market, which will underpin extensive growth,” says Esther Lau, retail analyst at Mintel.The more coffee shops there are, the more there may be in future, says Frank Yin of UBC, the Taiwanese coffee shop chain that was one of the earliest mainland entrants. “The emergence of more coffee shops is making people more familiar with coffee,” he says.Yet UBC has been one of the biggest losers in terms of market share as Starbucks has grown, with the US chain’s share rising from 12 per cent in 2008 to 31 per cent in 2013 while UBC’s slice has fallen from 33 per cent to 22 per cent, according to figures from Euromonitor.Over the same period, McDonald’s has risen from almost nothing to 6 per cent of the market as it has opened 800 of its in-store McCafes, while Costa has grown from 1 per cent to 5.5 per cent over the same period. Yum’s KFC, most of whose shops did not serve coffee on the mainland until recently, has started promoting the beverage and many mainland convenience shops in first-tier cities now also sell fresh-brewed coffee.“Of course there is increasing competition but when I look at Japan and Korea, the density of coffee shops they have there, not even Shanghai has that density,” says Torsten Stocker, Greater China retail partner at AT Kearney.At one suburban Shanghai branch of Maan Coffee on a frigid weekday afternoon recently, most of the shop’s 374 seats were occupied, primarily by friends chatting loudly in groups, while at Starbucks in a nearby office building most seats are also taken, mainly by individuals working on laptops or meeting with colleagues.Even more surprisingly, mainlanders increasingly are not just patronising coffee shops, but are buying coffee-based drinks rather than the non-coffee beverages that used to be more popular.“There’s a much bigger appreciation for the nuances than even five years ago, when coffee for most people was Nescafe 3-in-1,” says Mr Stocker, referring to the sweet creamy instant coffee popular with new coffee drinkers on the mainland.With mainland coffee consumption currently only four cups per person per year, there is still plenty of room for growth, says Mintel’s Ms Lau.Additional reporting by Zhang Yan
213;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Pocatello, Playwrights Horizons, New York — review;A skilfully woven, well-acted drama set in a restaurant threatened with closure;"Give credit to Playwrights Horizons: in the midst of the holiday season, with joy blaring relentlessly from every shop and doorway, this invaluable off-Broadway theatre presents a play in which the sound system is cracked, the music is bland rock and country, and the message is almost unrelieved despair. Welcome to Pocatello, Samuel D. Hunter’s well-constructed yet dispiriting study of 10 people struggling with life’s basics.Their anxieties are not small ones. Eddie, given a sensitive portrayal by T.R. Knight, manages an Italian-themed restaurant in Pocatello, Idaho, where this 100-minute evening, directed by Davis McCallum, takes place. Corporate powers-that-be have decided to shutter the emporium, and Eddie has not yet mustered the resolve to inform his employees.Those workers are a motley crew. Max is a convicted felon who can’t quite kick a meth habit; Isabelle, the only nearly sane character, goes with the flow; Troy, whose father suffers from dementia, battles with his wife, Tammy; and Becky, their 17-year-old daughter, can barely eat for fear of the pesticides and brutal slaughtering practices.In his previous, acclaimed play, The Whale, Hunter created a central character who weighed more than 500 pounds but whose despair was touching in its extremity. In Pocatello, Eddie elicits less empathy. His father died when he was 13 and his mother, Doris, and older brother, Nick, are mini-monsters of self-absorption. But Eddie’s indecisiveness and willingness to be pushed around make him more annoying than affecting.Eddie’s family has been in Pocatello for many generations. He stays in his dead-end town out of a desire to stay true to his roots and out of a yearning for long-lost family cohesion. Hunter’s larger theme — that brands such as Walmart and Starbucks have sapped the soul out of cities — is powerful yet has been well tilled by American writers for decades.What makes Pocatello reasonably compelling are the actors — Leah Karpel is a grimly humorous Becky and Cameron Scoggins a charmingly hopped-up Max — and the skill with which Hunter weaves so many wounded souls in and out of the story.playwrightshorizons.org"
214;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;US envoy defends Facebook over tax and Rigby incident;Barzun says it is unfair to ‘pin everything on private sector’;The US ambassador to London said on Tuesday he believed Facebook, along with other US companies such as Amazon, Google and Starbucks, were doing nothing wrong by using legal methods to cut corporation tax bills in the UK.Asked if such companies were “tax dodgers”, Matthew Barzun said: “No. These companies are clever about using international rules that exist as written by all of us — UK and US officials. We made these rules and they are playing by them.”The tax paid by US companies in the UK and elsewhere has come under heavy scrutiny. Google UK last year paid £20m in corporation tax on revenues of £642m, while Facebook paid £3,169 on revenues of £49.8m.Such revelations have sparked a push by the OECD, the Paris based group of countries that aims to promote sustainable growth, to stop internet companies moving profits from one company to another to cut tax bills.George Osborne, the UK chancellor, has also announced a crackdown”, unveiling a 25 per cent levy on diverted profits which his allies described as the “Google tax”.Mr Barzun said: “My hope is that if those rules change, they will play by those rules as well.”President Barack Obama said in June that companies which avoid tax in the US by taking up residency in havens were “essentially renouncing their American citizenship”.Mr Barzun also defended Facebook against claims by British politicians that the company withheld information on potential terror suspects as part of an official report into the jihadi inspired murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby 18 months ago. Members of the intelligence and security committee have warned that new encryption methods used by technology companies hamper the government’s attempts to monitor communications.He said: “I don’t think it is fair to pin everything on the private sector.” Though he added: “Nor is it fair to say they have no responsibility in trying to come up with solutions.”Taxation has become a thorny issue in the US-UK relationship, which Mr Barzun described as “vibrant, versatile and vital”.While Boris Johnson has pursued the US embassy for several years over unpaid fees for the London congestion charge, the London mayor himself has recently admitted that he is being pursued by the US tax authorities for unpaid capital gains tax.Mr Barzun defended his embassy’s policy of not paying the charge, the payments for which have now mounted to more than £8m. He called the charge a tax, insisting that countries should not tax foreign embassies. But he was less forgiving of the situation faced by Mr Johnson, who admitted last month that he is being pursued by the Internal Revenue Service on the basis that he is a US citizen.While Mr Barzun said he did not want to comment on Mr Johnson’s personal circumstances, he added: “We have our rules and we expect people to play by them.“If you have the benefit of being an American citizen, you have to pay your fair share of taxes — that’s the general point.”
215;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-12-05T16:58:03Z;Multinationals and the new politics of hate;Think that multinationals can do as they like on tax? Think again;"The odd financial crisis aside, the past 30 years hasn’t been a bad time to be a large multinational corporation. Interest rates have steadily fallen. The resulting surge in credit has been great for revenues. Yet at the same time labour costs have fallen: the share of US corporate value added going on wages eventually collapsed relative to corporate profits around 2000.Finally, corporate tax rates have fallen fast as globalisation has allowed big companies effectively to choose where to pay (or not pay) their taxes. That’s why Google paid a mere £20m in the UK in tax last year on revenues of $5.6bn; why Facebook paid no corporation tax at all in the UK last year; why US companies are estimated to hold some $2tn in cash offshore; and possibly part of the reason why, according to Capita, the biggest listed groups in the UK have £53bn in cash sitting on their books. Revenues up. Costs and taxes down. What’s not to like?The answer is mean reversion. Given the politics of income inequality it isn’t hard to imagine a general rise in wages such that the division of returns to capital and labour returns to normal.It is harder to imagine a rise in interest rates anytime soon, although I think we all accept that in time this cycle too will turn. However, the one that many people find absolutely impossible to imagine is a rise in the corporation tax take. Today’s multinationals are footloose and fancy free, they say. They can pay tax anywhere they want. They are rolling around in money. They can afford to hire armies of smart accountants and lawyers to find a loophole or 10 in every page of tax legislation.The only thing governments can do in response is to cut corporate tax rates to zero and hope to boost employment (and hence employer and employee taxes) along the way. It’s a race to the bottom and the UK is already well on the way. Ireland is even further.There are little fightbacks along the way, such as the “bank levy”. In his Autumn Statement this week George Osborne introduced another one: the idea of a “diverted profits tax” (commonly known as the “ Google tax”) to be paid by companies who artificially report their profits in other countries to avoid paying UK tax.You might think that sounds like a good idea, but one of the first press releases I got on the matter batted it away as irrelevant: “It is unlikely to give the average multinational much cause for concern . . . most multinationals will be able to sidestep these new rules without breaking into a sweat.”I don’t buy this. The idea that there will always be another loophole or a jurisdiction ready to charge less relies on the idea that there is such as thing as a developed country with a respectable legal and property rights system that isn’t completely broke — and dealing with the social consequences of having to cut services as a result of being broke.A few crowd-pleasers in the Autumn StatementThere isn’t. Look back at Mr Osborne’s statement and you will see that the deficit and debt reduction parts of his plan aren’t going particularly well. He needs to get his hands on some of the £53bn mentioned above. And contrary to popular belief, he is more than able to get it.That’s partly because he’s in charge. In times of crisis it becomes more clear than usual who gets to make the law and who gets to follow it. And partly because he isn’t exactly working alone on this one. When he trailed the idea of this new tax in October he was pretty firm in noting that “some technology companies go to extraordinary lengths to avoid paying tax here”; that this abuses the “trust of the British people”; and that “we will put a stop to it”.Pretty much everyone outside the affected companies agreed that seemed reasonable. Institutional investors are increasingly onside too. They don’t want their own reputations to be affected by investments in companies likely to be singled out as an example by the government or by angry mobs of welfare recipients blaming them for “the cuts”.Reputation matters. Ask the banking sector. Or ask Starbucks, now known as much for avoiding taxes as selling coffee. Ask those companies in the US referred to by Obama a few months ago as “corporate deserters” for pursuing “tax inversion” schemes.And investors aren’t sure that companies which spend a lot of time avoiding tax are good long-term investments, either. Aggressive tax planning brings a risk of volatile profits later when governments challenge schemes. It suggests cultural issues too; if a company is paying a very low tax rate, is it also paying miserable wages, or cutting corners on safety, or treating its suppliers poorly? Those are just the sorts of issues that might come back to haunt a business.The voting and serious investing populations appear to be with Mr Osborne on this one. But, crucially, so are international organisations. The EU has a long list of so-called “sweetheart” deals between companies and governments to investigate; Apple, Starbucks and Fiat are in the frame. The OECD is on the case with its base erosion and profit shifting action plan (BEPS). It has major plans to crack down on tax avoidance via country-by-country tax reporting, which should make the diverted profits tax rather easier for the Treasury to figure out and harder to for multinationals to “sidestep.”Jonathan Eley and guests discuss changes to stamp duty rates for housebuyers, inheritance rules for individual savings accounts, and changes for peer-to-peer lendingA few months ago the head of one of Britain’s biggest accounting firms announced that whatever Mr Osborne said they would “carry on as before” helping companies avoid tax. Governments, he said, should “legislate if they want a different outcome.” Well, they are now. Can tax-avoiding firms weather all this “without breaking a sweat?” I don’t think so.This matters to investors. Banks’ share prices now carry a discount for their “most-hated” status. We know they are the first place the state stops when it needs a little petty cash, as indeed it did this week. Maybe it’s time to build a little legislative risk into the share prices of other large companies, too. If profits can be turned into tax revenues with a stroke of Mr Osborne’s pen it might be that forecast price/earnings ratios are a tad too high. So before you invest, look at how much tax the company is paying alongside. If it seems rather low, then ask why. Everyone else is.Merryn Somerset Webb is editor-in-chief of MoneyWeek.

216;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-12-04T00:04:18Z;Ease of use will decide ewallets’ fate;It can take a long time for new ideas to catch on in the payments world;"It can take a long time for new ideas to catch on in the payments world. Plastic debit and credit cards, for example, account for half of payments in the UK and US, but it has taken more than 60 years to get there. Globally, cash is still dominant.Despite being 15 years old, online payment system PayPal only accounts for about 10 per cent of online payments, says Bob Graham, senior vice-president for banking and financial services at consulting firm Virtusa.The online payments market is still small, accounting for just 2-3 per cent of consumer transactions worldwide, says Patrick Collison, co-founder of payment service Stripe. According to some estimates, there are 366bn non-cash transactions each year.However, the online payments market is expected to grow, not least because consumers want easier ways to pay for goods. Businesses also want more efficient mechanisms to handle trade invoices and payments.Barriers for new payment systems include cost and rates of adoption. Retailers have to pay for tills and card readers and banks have to put in software to process payments. New payment systems need to reach a point where there are enough cards, tokens or apps in circulation, and enough tills, ticket barriers, or websites willing to accept them, to justify any investment.Despite this, there is no shortage of newcomers, such as PayM and Barclays’ Pingit in the UK, Swish in Sweden, or Apple Pay, looking for customers.These are likely to succeed or fail based on the experience of consumers. Unless they are secure and convenient, they will remain niche technologies.A million people signed up to Apple Pay (a mobile wallet app that lets consumers make contactless payments with their phones) in its first week of operation in October. But this is tiny compared with the plastic cards market, says Mr Graham.John Skipper, a technology expert at PA Consulting, says payment systems have to be easy for consumers. He says a big barrier to adoption has been confusion about how systems work. Pingit was a success among Barclays’ customers because it was clear and straight­forward to use. But, he adds, it failed
to become widely adopted, because it was too inaccessible for non-Barclays customers.Another problem for newcomers is that the variety of payment systems is deterring retailers from investing in the technology, as they wait for global standards to emerge.But perhaps the greatest change is the way consumers use smartphones to make purchases. To pay by a card on a smartphone, says Jean Lassignardie, chief marketing officer at Capgemini Financial Services, means typing in a card number and an address, which can be awkward, so a an electronic wallet or PayPal is a strong alternative.The services consumers are paying for on their phones are changing too, from purely digital items such as music downloads, to taxis, accommodation, or meals. As a result, digitally driven services, such as Uber, a lift-sharing company, or Airbnb, which lets people rent accommodation online, are as much about processing payments and creating trust as they are about the apps.Physical retailers are also adopting digital payments. Companies such as Starbucks have persuaded consumers to pay by mobile apps by combining payments and a loyalty scheme.One reason electronic wallets – and other alternatives to cash and cards – have so far failed to take off is that they have not made consumers’ lives simpler or brought value to the businesses that use them.“There is no value added in a business such as a hotel accepting additional payment [systems],”says Deborah Baxley, a consultant at Capgemini Financial Services. “But,” she adds, “it can remove a source of irritation for consumers.”Businesses are more likely to invest in systems that will give them greater control over the value such systems can add to their business.“Big corporates are taking matters into their own hands [on payments],” says Christophe Uzureau, a payments expert at analysts Gartner. “There is a movement to have more control over issues such as cash management.”Ultimately, online payments could allow businesses to wrest more control of the payment value chain from banks. Along the way, they stand to gather more data about customers’ habits by combining information on purchases, locations and loyalty programmes.Smart online wallets, which calculate the best bank, card or other payment scheme for a consumer using criteria such as offers, loyalty points, interest charges and exchange rates, may be the next thing, suggests Matthew Friend, managing director and head of Accenture Payment Services in North America.Nonetheless, the online payments sector will grow, if only because accepting more ways to pay will allow businesses to sell more. “Every time a website accepts new ways to pay, it drives more transactions,” Mr Friend says."

We’re 148 years old, and we would like to be here for another 148 years.”He added: “We feel consumers are going to be a big influence in this debate, and it’s important for them to know which side we come out on.”The EPA plan would cut carbon dioxide emissions from power stations by 30 per cent by 2030 from 2005 levels, primarily by reducing the US’s dependence on coal.The latest news and analysis on the world’s changing climate and the political moves afoot to tackle the problem

Further readingThe regulator has set emissions targets for each US state, which must decide how to achieve the cuts by switching to cleaner energy sources such as natural gas, nuclear or wind, by improving grid efficiency, or by reducing electricity consumption.But Mitch McConnell, who will lead a Republican Senate majority in the new Congress next year, has said one of his priorities is “to try to do whatever I can to get the [EPA] reined in”.Industry and fossil fuel businesses are strongly critical of its climate change plan. A coalition of groups including the National Association of Manufacturers, the American Petroleum Institute, the American Chemistry Council and the American Iron and Steel Institute, made a joint submission that said the EPA plan would make US companies uncompetitive in world markets.They said: “The proposed rule far exceeds the authority delegated to EPA by Congress and would have profoundly adverse consequences on both industry and the economy.”The groups urged the agency to withdraw the plan and to “engage instead in a process with all interested stakeholders regarding the development of a lawful and reasonable rule”.The conflicting positions of businesses match divisions between US states. A group of 17 attorneys-general from states that either lean Republican or are big fossil fuel or industrial producers slammed the Obama administration’s plan and said it was illegal.We feel consumers are going to be a big influence in this debate, and it’s important for them to know which side we come out onThe green regulator was attempting to “override states’ energy policies and impose a national energy and resource-planning policy that picks winners and losers based solely on EPA’s policy choices,” they said in a submission. Twelve of the states, led by West Virginia, have already filed a lawsuit against the EPA’s plan.A rival group of 13 attorneys-general from Democratic-leaning states and the District of Columbia backed the EPA, filing a submission that said the agency was obliged to act on power plant emissions and had the legal authority to do so.David Flannery, a lawyer at Steptoe & Johnson in West Virginia who worked on a submission for utility companies opposed to the plan, predicted more legal challenges.“If the administration decides to go ahead with this rule, then we have the odd dilemma of serious litigation proceeding at the same time that states arguably have the obligation to develop plans to implement the rule,” he said. “I am sure efforts will be made to get the courts to stay that or slow it down.”"

Other tax rulings, or so-called comfort letters, under scrutiny include Ireland’s arrangements with Apple and Luxembourg’s clearance of structures used by Fiat and Amazon. The commission is empowered to order countries to recoup any illegal aid.An in-depth state aid investigation into the Starbucks ruling was launched in the summer and the commission’s letter to the Dutch authorities, published on Friday, details its main allegations. The letter is addressed to Frans Timmermans, the former Dutch foreign minister who has since become commission vice-president.“At this stage, the commission considers that the measure at issue appears to constitute a reduction of charges that should normally be borne by the entities concerned in the course of their business, and should therefore be considered as operating aid,” the letter said. “According to the commission practice, such aid cannot be considered compatible with the internal market.”The Dutch authorities dismissed the commission’s allegations as misplaced and said the Starbucks tax ruling faithfully applied Dutch law and international standards. In a letter to Dutch MPs, Eric Wiebes, the deputy Dutch finance minister, said: “I am confident that this investigation will ultimately show that no state aid has been provided.”Starbucks said: “We agree with the Dutch government that this investigation by the European Commission announced in June will find that there is no selective advantage and that we comply with all tax laws and OECD guidelines.”The probe turns on the status of a Starbucks coffee roasting facility in Amsterdam and its relations with other entities in the coffee group’s international corporate structure. Mr Wiebes said the advance pricing agreement struck with Starbucks had been “carefully and sufficiently substantiated”.The investigators contend that the roaster was inappropriately designated as a so-called toll manufacturer that was “stripped of risks for tax planning purposes” because in practice it bore risks that were not remunerated. These transactions between corporate subsidiaries should, under Dutch law, meet the standards of an arms-length transaction.The investigators question why the roaster would “surrender functions and risks that would contribute to a higher return”, especially since the roaster carries inventory and is involved in sales and – contrary to Dutch claims – “did not surrender all such risks”.The Netherlands and Starbucks will be pulled into the political storm over sweetheart tax deals on Friday as the European Commission confronts Amsterdam for allegedly subsidising the coffee group’s tax bill.Continue reading“The economic rationality of the structure is not apparent, since the structure, as it is described by tax authorities, might not have been put in place by a prudent independent economic operator,” the commission said.The tax paid by the roasting operation – together with its Dutch parent company – was €715,876 in 2011 and €600,000-€1m in 2012.The Dutch authorities failed to ask to see the underlying contracts to judge the actual level of risk carried by the coffee roaster. Instead the investigators argue that the Dutch accepted assumptions in the Starbucks’ transfer pricing report “which lowered the tax base of the company in the Netherlands”.“The Dutch authorities were wrong to accept the assumption that the undertaking is a toll or contract manufacturer with almost no manufacturing risk and that the relevant risks have been removed from the Netherlands,” the letter states. “Had such risks been effectively transferred, the tax authorities should have also questioned the economic rationale of such transfers.”Another part of the probe examines the royalties paid by the Amsterdam roaster to Alki LP for licences “necessary for the production process and for the delivery of coffee to shop operators”.Alki, a UK limited partnership, is not liable for tax in the Netherlands. The commission points out that this means any payment to Alki is “considered to be a direct payment to Starbucks US from a Dutch perspective”.
219;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Netherlands accused of subsidising Starbucks tax bill;European Commission confronts Amsterdam for allegedly subsidising coffee group’s tax bill;"The Netherlands and Starbucks will be pulled into the political storm over sweetheart tax deals on Friday as the European Commission confronts Amsterdam for allegedly subsidising the coffee group’s tax bill.Initial conclusions from the first stage of Brussels’ state aid probe, published on Friday, will detail concerns over the Dutch illegally favouring Starbucks by understating its taxable income.Full details of the Dutch probe, which eventually could require it to clawback any illicit state support, will make uncomfortable reading for Starbucks given it has already suffered consumer protests over its tax practices. Starbucks and the Netherlands are confident the arrangements are legal and proper.It also emerges at a delicate time for Jean-Claude Juncker, the commission president, who is under political pressure over revelations of widespread tax avoidance in Luxembourg during his time as premier.Mr Juncker batted off criticism this week, arguing that he was not the “architect” of Luxembourg’s tax policy and now wanted to clamp down on evasion and avoidance by better aligning EU rules.Further questions were raised, however, by a 2003 speech in which Mr Juncker boasted of his lead role luring Amazon to base its European operations in Luxembourg.He said Amazon came to Luxembourg as a result of “a correct tax policy, of a correct infrastructure policy, but also the result of tough negotiations with the top management of the groups. They took place in America, they took place here at home, and I did not lead them alone”. The Wall Street Journal reported the remarks.The Amazon tax ruling is one of four that is under in-depth investigation by the commission; the others being Irish tax deals with Apple, Luxembourg’s arrangements, and Starbucks in the Netherlands.Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition chief, wants to bring the first cases to a conclusion by the end of spring 2015. Mr Juncker has said he will not intervene in the Luxembourg cases.David Cameron, the UK prime minister, will intensify the pressure on Mr Juncker at a G20 summit in Brisbane, saying he has an important role to play in cracking down on tax avoidance.Germany has also questioned the fairness of hundreds of controversial tax deals struck in Luxembourg. But on Thursday Wolfgang Schäuble, Germany’s finance minister, used a radio interview to shift attention from Mr Juncker, saying he did not want to draw “personal accusations” from “annoying” but legal practices.Brussels’ state aid cases do not challenge national tax laws but their implementation. The Netherlands case turns on the methodology used to calculate Starbucks’ taxable profit. The tax ruling allegedly underestimated the business risk carried by Starbucks’ coffee roasting facility and, as a result, attributed too little profit to the Netherlands.The investigators question whether the profits Starbucks attributed to the Netherlands were based on the correct “transfer pricing” methodology, the technique used to assess the prices of goods and services provided by one arm of the group to another.In a press release in June announcing the launch of the investigation, the commission made clear it did not expect to “encounter systematic irregularities in tax rulings” issued by the Netherlands.The investigation into the ruling concerns the tax treatment of Starbucks Manufacturing Emea BV. This manufacturing company, which handles coffee roasting and distribution, buys green beans from its Swiss subsidiary Starbucks Trading, roasts them and distributes them to Starbucks UK and other retail operations.For the year to September 2012, its overall pre-tax profits was €1.6m on sales of €286m, with a corporate income tax charge of €395,365. It paid a royalty of €6m, which it said was based on its tax ruling.In 2012 Starbucks declined to tell British MPs what tax rate it paid the Dutch government overall, citing confidentiality constraints. It said the overall effective tax rate paid on royalties averaged 16 per cent of the past five years."
220;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-11-05T23:01:34Z;Wallonia’s tax incentives attract overseas companies – but also regulatory attention;Wallonia’s tax incentives attracting overseas companies – but also regulatory attention;"For decades, regional authorities such as Wallonia have had to show great creativity in designing investor-friendly incentives – in no small part because of the EU’s restrictions on state aid.Unlike the US or Asia, the EU seeks to stop unfair state support to companies, in order to prevent a damaging race of tax breaks and subsidies that end up hurting consumers and taxpayers.This has long been seen as a brake – and at times an unwelcome intrusion – on the freedom of regional leaders, who want to deploy what fiscal and policy powers they enjoy to attract businesses and investors.From fees for operators at Charleroi Airport, to support for research and development or tax breaks for investors in small and medium-sized Wallonian enterprises, the state aid rules have defined regional business initiatives and infrastructure policies.Indeed, a special tax scheme for Belgium established in 1983 – the so-called “co-ordination centres regime” that came to service up to 200 multinationals – became a test case for state aid and tax. While the method was used elsewhere, European Commission officials referred to Belgium’s system as “the mother of all co-ordination centres”.The scheme was deemed illegal by the Commission in 2003 and, after almost a decade of wrangling, partly phased out. Belgium and other countries responded by offering advance tax rulings for corporations, sometimes referred to as “comfort letters”.The government agency Invest in Wallonia claims that access to tax rulings and other incentives give the region one of the lowest effective corporate tax rates of any eurozone country.In Belgium some rulings can exempt “excess profit”. Bertrand Vandepitte of PwC estimated in 2012 that the rulings can exempt up to 70 per cent of profit, with an effective tax rate of 8 per cent “typically achievable”. While the tax benefits of such rulings are a big draw for companies, they are also attracting the attention of regulators.The stakes were raised recently when the Commission launched a series of investigations into tax rulings by several member states.Most prominent were the probes into arrangements between Ireland and Apple, the Netherlands with Starbucks, and Luxembourg’s deals with the likes of Fiat and Amazon.A special tax scheme for Belgium, created in 1983, became a test case for state aid and was deemed illegalBut Belgium has also faced questions over its tax rulings on “excess profits” – although a formal investigation has yet to be announced. The core allegation behind the various cases is that multinationals have been selectively favoured by the taxman.The Charleroi Airport case – which started with a state aid complaint in 2001 – is a salutary lesson in the sometimes meandering pace of state aid probes; few places in Europe provide a better study of tax competition than Belgium. Last month, the Commission found the Wallonian airport offered a concession fee that was too low and amounted to a state subsidy for airlines. It was ordered to recover around €6m.But individual deals with Ryanair, the airport’s main operator, were deemed compatible – a decision that reflected Wallonia and Ryanair’s victory in a 2004 court battle. The case was all the more tortuous for the fact that the EU’s executive arm was studying competition between Belgian regions; while the aid was seen by the Commission as having “a positive effect” on the Walloon region, it was deemed to be unfair to rivals such as Brussels National Airport.While the federal government levies the lion’s share of taxes, there are five levels of fiscal authority, running through the country’s three communities, three regions, 30 provinces and 589 municipalities.A Wallonian measure that has attracted regulators’ attention is a tax reduction for a public investment fund named “Caisse d’Investissement de Wallonie”, which aims to boost SMEs.Conditions include requiring investors to be resident in Wallonia – a provision that the Commission is challenging in court as discriminatory. Changes have been made to allow non-residents to invest under certain conditions.But Mélanie Staes, a tax adviser at Loyens & Loeff, argues that the scheme is also probably “incompatible” with state aid rules. For now, there is no sign of regulatory action on this front. And if past experience is any guide, the regime is probably safe for the next decade."
221;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Aggressive tax avoidance troubles large investors;Some investors fear tax avoidance could cause reputational and commercial problems;It is no secret that Apple, Starbucks and Amazon are among several high-profile companies that have faced political and public pressure over their tax affairs recently.What is less well known is whether the institutional investors that back these companies share widespread consumer concern about corporate tax practices.There are signs that big investors are becoming more sensitive to the risks of aggressive tax planning at the companies they invest in. Although avoidance can fuel short-term profitability, some investors – but perhaps not enough – fear this advantage may not be sustainable and could lead to reputational and commercial risks with customers, governments and regulators.Leon Kamhi, executive director at Hermes Executive Ownership Services, which advises investors including the BT Pension scheme, the UK’s largest corporate pension fund, on their investments, says: “Our stance is quite straightforward – we want companies to pay an appropriate level of tax.“The normal person on the street sees [excessive tax avoidance] as an issue and there is an increasing consumer backlash. The issue is not only one of business risk but also of the [BT] fund’s reputation, and we will probably increase the level of engagement on this issue going forward.”A fund manager at a large UK fund house, who asked to remain anonymous, admits “low tax per se is not a positive reason to invest, although it might have helped [large companies that have avoided paying tax] establish dominant positions in the first place”.The fund manager did not want to be named as these issues are “sensitive for our invested companies as well as our clients”.But he adds: “We are taking [corporate tax practices] very seriously, talking to our big holdings such as Amazon on the subject. We would put reputation with customers and relations with governments high up the agenda for the global internet giants, not least as their competitive positions are otherwise increasingly powerful.”Scrutiny on corporate tax affairs intensified last month following the move by President Obama’s administration to clamp down on companies that attempt to slash their tax bills by buying an overseas competitor in a lower tax domicile and shifting their headquarters to that jurisdiction.Burger King’s $11.4bn acquisition of Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons in August is one of the latest examples of this controversial manoeuvre, known as a tax inversion. The US crackdown on such deals has halted plans by other large corporates to follow suit, notably leading to the collapse of pharmaceutical company AbbVie’s $53bn bid to purchase UK drugmaker Shire.Alex van der Velden, partner at Dutch investment company Ownership Capital, says: “Aggressive tax planning is an issue investors are increasingly aware of. While it is legal and routine for companies to ensure they only pay the taxes they are required by law to pay, the public ire that has been created by businesses found aggressively pursuing loopholes has been significant and led to serious reputational issues.”The collapse of the AbbVie/Shire deal also demonstrated that tax changes do not just pose a reputational risk to companies and their investors – it can damage valuations. Shire’s share price dropped 11 per cent on the day the deal fell through, catching hedge funds with large exposure to the company, such as Paulson & Co, off guard.Stephen Jones, chief investment officer of Kames Capital, the Edinburgh-based fund house, says: “We do not single out tax activity as the sole driver of an investment decision, but it can and does influence us alongside other things. Sustainability of any business model is key, and volatile approaches to tax management and unpredictable tax rates detracts from this.“We expect companies to carefully manage their tax position like any other cost. However, a very low tax rate can be a red flag suggesting aggressive policies that may have reputational consequences.”International companies used to benign tax regimes that bolster profits have experienced a number of unpleasant surprises this year.Ireland, which has one of the lowest corporate tax rates in Europe, decided to close a contentious tax loophole known as the “double Irish” last month. The loophole allowed large technology and pharmaceutical companies including Google, Facebook, and Pfizer to route billions of dollars of profits to tax havens by exploiting different definitions of corporate residency in Ireland and the US.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has begun a drive, known as the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) action plan, to end the aggressive tax avoidance by companies that it believes detracts from their home economies. Last week an OECD agreement was signed by 51 countries to share information on bank accounts, company ownership and legal structures such as trusts.Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, a UK charity that campaigns for responsible investment, says: “Investors have finally woken up to the risk of global and national rule changes on corporate tax that will punish firms who employ aggressive avoidance strategies. This stuff can play havoc with share prices as we have seen in recent months with pharmaceutical companies on both sides of the Atlantic.”Ms Howarth adds that many investors still have weak visibility on the scale of corporate tax risk given the low proportion of listed companies that disclose robust tax policies. Kames’ Mr Jones agrees: “It is very hard, if not impossible, for investors to have a clear line of sight as to how a company’s tax policies operate.”Nonetheless, shareholder pressure for improved disclosure on tax risk is growing, with some of the biggest investors around the world now pushing for more information, despite the majority remaining silent. Calpers, the largest US pension fund, and Towers Watson, the consultancy that counts some of the world’s biggest institutional investors among its clients, declined to comment on the issue. Fidelity Worldwide Investment, Vanguard, Candriam, Aberdeen Asset Management, Invesco and F&C also declined to comment.Mr Kamhi says Hermes has begun raising the issue of tax practices with companies and is prepared to raise resolutions at annual meetings if a company’s tax affairs do not improve.Nordea Investment Management, the biggest Nordic fund house, is willing to go one step further. Sasja Beslik, Nordea’s head of corporate governance, says he will raise tax-related concerns with a company’s board, and if that fails he will file a motion at an annual general meeting. If that still proves ineffective, the company in question may be excluded from Nordea’s investment universe.Peter Montagnon, associate director at the Institute of Business Ethics, says: “[Investors] have an interest in companies not paying tax because that increases the money available to the company and ultimately to them as shareholders. But they also recognise that companies that go too far can damage their franchise in ways that also damage their investments. There are no hard and fast rules, but tax comes up more frequently when institutions talk to companies.”——————————————-Taxing issues: Seven questions on corporate tax practiceCharities ShareAction and Christian Aid have drawn up a list of questions they believe big investors should ask the companies they invest in about their tax affairs.1. Do you “profit shift” and if so, how might regulatory changes leave you vulnerable to a drop in corporate profits?2. Do you use tax havens and if so, what regulatory risk does that represent?3. How much do you rely on tax incentives in certain jurisdictions, and can you be sure that those incentives are secure?4. Do you rely on transfer pricing, and if regulation changes on this practice can you model the financial risk?5. Do you favour country-by-country tax reporting in each jurisdiction you operate and if not, could such disclosure impact your share price?6. Do you use intra-group financing, such as loans from subsidiaries in low-tax jurisdictions to those in higher-tax jurisdictions, and what is the risk of relying on this practice?7. Do you engage in “treaty shopping” – structuring investments in order to route payments through jurisdictions with beneficial tax treaties – and what are the risks?

However, coffee drinking in China has tended to centre around instant coffee made from lower quality robusta beans.China produces more than 1m 60kg bags of arabica coffee– almost as much as Costa Rica and about a 10th of Colombia’s output – and most of it is exported.Mark Furniss, Volcafe’s business development director for Asia, said European roasters have been buyers of Yunnan coffee, especially at times of dips in Central American production.The recent fall in Colombian output due to leaf rust disease spurred imports of Chinese coffee. “It has become a regular component of the roasters’ blends,” he said.The demand has meant the price for Chinese coffee has risen over the past few years. Chinese coffee beans are now sold at a single-digit discount to the New York arabica benchmark, currently trading at $1.95 a pound, according to coffee traders.By having operations on the ground, Volcafe said it wanted to get closer to the farmers and gain greater quality control as well as making sure the supply chain remained sustainable.The recent price rise in the international coffee market due to adverse weather in Brazil could boost further production in the region. “Price is the best fertiliser,” said Mr Furniss.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

Last week UK Labour party leader Ed Miliband announced a headline-grabbing scheme to fund cancer testing by a levy on the profits of tobacco groups. This follows earlier commitments to pay for youth training by taxing bankers’ bonuses and to fund expanded spending on the National Health Service with a mansion tax. Labour has form on such policies. When it was returned to office in 1997, its New Deal for the young unemployed was paid for by a levy on privatised utility companies.The European Commission is targeting alleged tax avoidance by Google. It is not difficult to see why this company joins Starbucks and Amazon in the dock. All three are American businesses with a high consumer profile.Then there are the fines. For US banks, laying out billions to settle allegations of past malpractice, often without acknowledgment of wrongdoing, is a regular cost of business. Even so, the near $9bn extracted from BNP Paribas was eye-watering. It is now common practice for several regulatory agencies to share the loot.Pharmaceutical companies are also being shaken down; campaigners are aiming at other targets, such as businesses that feed obesity. State attorneys have joined in as their governments eye new revenue to supplement the existing tobacco settlement.Europe is only getting into its stride. George Osborne, UK chancellor of the exchequer, has announced that the fines levied on banks for their part in fixing the Libor benchmark lending rate will go to armed forces charities. Larger penalties still will probably be imposed for abuse in the foreign exchange market.There are good reasons for state action in areas of business misconduct. Financial abuses should be punished. Tax avoidance by multinational companies is at unacceptable levels. Tobacco companies behaved badly; their products have caused great social damage.But announcing ad hoc measures against companies in the news is the wrong way to deal with these issues. The amounts extracted appear arbitrary. The random incidence of penalties and the distant relationship between the sums obtained from the corporation and the individuals responsible means that the deterrent effect on future conduct is weak. The process increasingly resembles an armed gang roaming the streets, picking on unpopular individuals and extorting money, with strangers particularly liable to assault. The gang justifies its bullying by handing some of the proceeds to needy friends.There are compelling reasons why advanced societies have abandoned the rule of the vigilante in favour of careful, dispassionate, deliberative processes. Proper judicial proceedings are free of the pressures of 24-hour news. Frontier justice often emerges when the existing law is too slow and cumbersome, and too much in thrall to established interests, to respond to the legitimate anger of the public – and this is a fair characterisation of what has happened in finance. But the right answer is to reform the law, not to act outside it.There are similarly compelling reasons why, as far as possible, tax should be based on general principles applicable to all individuals and companies. There is danger, too, in hypothecating tax revenues to popular items of public expenditure. We also need tax revenues for unglamorous items of spending – such as effective tax collection and proper regulation of business – and a considered mechanism for assessing priorities among them. Revenue hypothecation is always opposed by the fiscally prudent because it undermines effective public expenditure control.The erosion of constitutional proprieties in favour of populist slogans is a danger to which all democracies are vulnerable. More vigilance than ever is needed to guard against it.johnkay@johnkay.com"
226;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-10-07T17:00:03Z;EU’s Amazon probe steps up pressure over tax deals;Brussels investigation carries far-reaching implications;The move by Brussels to open a formal investigation into Amazon’s tax arrangements in Luxembourg, confirmed on Tuesday, is the latest step in a far-reaching crackdown on alleged “sweetheart” tax deals between governments and large companies.The online retail giant is now embroiled in a probe that has already drawn in Apple, Starbucks and Fiat’s financial arm. The European Commission is investigating whether they received “hidden subsidies” from governments through preferential tax treatment that amount to illicit state aid. Other companies could also be drawn into the net, according to tax advisers.Unveiling the latest investigation, Joaquín Almunia, European Union competition commissioner, said most of Amazon’s European profits “are recorded in Luxembourg but are not taxed in Luxembourg”.The Commission is concerned that Amazon’s main Luxembourg subsidiary paid too little tax because it made too big a tax-deductible royalty payment to a partnership. The royalty payment dictated by a 2003 tax ruling – struck before the Luxembourg companies were set up – “might not be in line with market conditions”, the commission said.Critics have long accused Luxembourg of operating an unusually informal and generous system of rulings, although the rules were tightened in 2011. A former banker said: “The flexibility of the Luxembourg tax authorities was, back in the heady pre-crash days, legendary.”But Luxembourg has denied there was special treatment. Its ministry of finance said: “Luxembourg is confident that the allegations of state aid in this case are unsubstantiated and that the commission investigation will conclude that no special tax treatment or advantage has been awarded to Amazon.”Amazon also rejected the allegations. “Amazon has received no special tax treatment from Luxembourg – we are subject to the same tax laws as other companies operating here.” The retailer, which operates on thin margins, expects to post a loss of between $410m and $810m in its upcoming third-quarter results.Other companies and government embroiled in the state aid investigations also deny there was preferential treatment, sparking suggestions on the part of some businesses that the recent investigations are political. The political climate in Brussels – and across European capitals – has hardened towards the US companies in recent months, especially in the technology sector.Mr Almunia dismissed the idea that the commission had placed undue focus on alleged misdemeanours by American companies. Of the four recent cases, three of the companies involved – Apple, Amazon and Starbucks – are based on the US West Coast. “I don’t distinguish: American, German, Spanish,” he said. “We investigate where there is a lack of compliance.”The decision to probe such tax rulings is not just putting the spotlight on individual companies. By targeting governments alleged to have facilitated corporate tax avoidance, it has opened up another front in the global battle against tax avoidance.This is not the first time that Brussels has used its state aid rules on tax matters. In 2003 it found that special tax breaks in Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands constituted state aid. But the commission has significantly raised the stakes by targeting agreements with specific companies – from which any potentially unlawful state aid could be clawed back.The flexibility of the Luxembourg tax authorities was, back in the heady pre-crash days, legendaryTax advisers say the move by Brussels could affect many companies. Heather Self of Pinsent Masons, an international law firm, said that companies with unusually longstanding or generous rulings should consider asking to revise them. “It may be better to come forward and seek a compromise than to sit back and wait, given the potential damage that could cause.”The move adds to the pressure on companies to make big changes to their structures to comply with the overhaul of international tax rules planned as part of a global crackdown on avoidance. Rocco Femia of Miller & Chevalier, a Washington-based law firm, said: “It is not too soon to respond”.But there are still many uncertainties, not least over how the US administration will respond if it sees other countries targeting the lightly taxed income of US multinationals.It is so far unclear whether the crackdown will embrace all the special regimes used by countries to attract mobile income. One example is the “patent box” regimes, operated by countries including the UK, intended to lower the tax burden on intellectual property. The UK, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Spain are at odds with 40 other governments over how to design rules that will stop the poaching of other countries’ revenues.The Competition Directorate may yet get involved. In March it said it was seeking information on intellectual property tax regimes to assess their compliance with state aid rules.There is a widespread expectation that governments will be forced to sweep away many of the exemptions and deductions used to minimise corporate tax bills. But the crackdown may end up fuelling more tax competition over tax rates. Luxembourg has promised to reform its system by 2017. Many expect a big cut in its tax rate to preserve its appeal to companies.The Commission’s probe will intensify pressure on Luxembourg to make reforms, although Mr Almunia emphasised that he was not challenging Luxembourg’s tax policy. “We are not calling into question the general tax system of Luxembourg,” he said. Instead, the commission was investigating whether the Grand Duchy has been “too accommodating” to Amazon.Whatever the outcome, the initiative amounts to a swansong for Mr Almunia, who is due to leave the commission in November. He said on Tuesday: “It is essential to make large multinationals pay their taxes.”
227;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-10-02T20:35:35Z;Incoming antitrust head promises action on tax deals;Vestager tells European parliament she wants to ‘send a signal’;Europe’s incoming antitrust chief has promised a tough line on state-subsidised tax avoidance, saying she will “send a signal” with the speedy conclusion of probes into deals with the likes of Apple, Fiat and Starbucks.At her European parliament confirmation hearing to become EU competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager described the landmark state-aid cases as “a high priority” that would help ensure companies big and small paid their taxes in full. Her comments will give added impetus to the ambitious European Commission drive to use rules against state support for companies to crack down on sweetheart deals that artificially lower tax bills for multinationals.The commission has already confronted Ireland over its tax deal with Apple, the Netherlands over its arrangements with Starbucks, and Luxembourg for offering what it believes are favourable terms to Fiat.If proven, the in-depth investigations could in total lead to billions of euros of unpaid taxes being recouped, according to people familiar with the cases. But complex state aid investigations have in the past dragged on for many years. All the countries and companies subject to the investigation deny any wrongdoing.“People are offended by some of the things that they see and read because they appreciate when people pay the tax that they are supposed to pay,” Ms Vestager said, adding she hoped the conclusion of the cases was prompt “not only to deal with the matter but to send a signal”.Her focus on tax issues came during an assured three-hour hearing on competition policy before the parliament, where she promised to approach her job with impartiality, rigour and steely independence.In response to several questions on the commission’s case against Google, Ms Vestager gave little away apart from to say she wanted to take steps to bring the four-year probe into the search engine a conclusion.This contrasted with a much more forthright approach to tax issues and state-supported avoidance, which she described as a “very, very serious issue”.As well as pointing to potential problems with tax rulings – where countries clarify tax laws for individual countries – Ms Vestager also highlighted her concern with tax structures that favour big companies.In response to a question, she described the measure known as the Double Irish, which allows foreign companies including Google and Facebook to reduce their effective overall tax rates well below Ireland’s official 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate, as “a very unfortunate arrangement”.Critics see the probes as a means to meddle in tax regimes over which the EU has no authority. Ms Vestager insisted she had no interest in changing tax policy “through the back door”.“Large companies should not be allowed to organise themselves in way that allows them to pay much less tax than other companies,” she added to journalists at the end of her hearing. “We will pursue the investigations, make sure they are substantial, and hopefully win the cases.”

The results missed expectations for earnings of 40 cents a share on sales of $646.6m.“The failure to achieve a substantial increase in pre-tax income consistent with expectations and soft new order growth that is materially below consensus will likely pressure the stock,” Robert Wetenhall, an analyst with RBC, said.The results contrast with several improving economic data points, including new home sales figures reported on Wednesday, as well as better than expected results this month from Lennar, the country’s second-largest homebuilder.Homebuilder confidence, another closely watched indicator, also remains at pre-crisis levels.KB Home shares sank 5 per cent to $16.07, while other homebuilders were less affected. Lennar, PulteGroup and DR Horton each fell less than 1 per cent to $39.96, $18.33 and $21.19, respectively.Shares of Citizens Financial, which remains majority owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, rose 7 per cent after the bank’s New York debut to $23.08 on Wednesday.The lender’s stock initially opened at $21.50 after pricing at that level late on Tuesday evening. More than 20m shares traded hands in the first 10 minutes of trading.RBS, which sold a 25 per cent stake, was forced to lower the price at which it sold shares after originally targeting $23 to $25.Citizens has trailed several US peers as executives work to lift the bank’s profitability.The bank’s return on equity stood at 7.5 per cent at the end of the first half of 2014, lagging behind rivals including PNC Financial and Fifth Third Bank.Starbucks shares advanced 2 per cent to $75.32 after it said it would purchase the 60.5 per cent of Starbucks Japan that it does not already own from Sazaby League for $913.5m.The company said it was approached by Sazaby, a brand owner, over the summer about selling its stake once its licence to operate the Starbucks franchise in Japan expired.Starbucks will purchase the joint venture in two stages, taking a controlling interest by the company’s fiscal first quarter, which runs through December.“It should enable Starbucks to accelerate growth and momentum in this important and profitable market, which should become Starbucks second-largest revenue contributor and fourth-largest market by store count,” Bonnie Herzog, an analyst with Wells Fargo, said.Overall, US equity markets climbed following better than expected new home sales data. The S&P 500 climbed 0.8 per cent to 1,998.30, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose 0.9 per cent to 17,210.06.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 1 per cent to 4,555.22.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
229;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-09-24T03:14:14Z;Starbucks to take control of Japan operations for $914m;US coffee chain seeks speedier growth in second-largest market;Starbucks plans to take full control of its Japanese operations for more than $900m in a bid to accelerate growth in its second-largest market by retail sales.The announcement by the world’s largest coffee chain that it would buy the 60.5 per cent of Starbucks Japan it does not already own from Sazaby League for $913.5m, in two stages, sent shares of Starbucks Japan up 4.5 per cent to Y1,462 on Wednesday morning in Tokyo.The US coffee chain said it was approached by Sazaby, a brand owner, over the summer about selling its stake once its licence to operate the Starbucks franchise in Japan expired. Starbucks has more than 1,000 stores in Japan and employs 25,000 people.Sazaby has run the Japanese operations since the joint venture was launched in 1995. After opening its first store in Tokyo’s upmarket district of Ginza in the summer of 1996, Starbucks became an instant success and a household name, defying the country’s deflationary economic conditions with prices set higher than those offered by homegrown coffee chains.Over the past decade, Starbucks Japan saw its sales more than double while its net profit has increased fivefold. Its rapid growth in Japan came even as some overseas franchises faced difficulty in a heavily crowded market. McDonald’s, for example, has grappled with falling sales in recent years even before a food safety scandal involving a Chinese chicken supplier came to light in July.Starbucks said it would take a 79 per cent controlling interest by the company’s fiscal first quarter, which runs through December. It will offer Y965 per share for Sazaby’s 39.5 per cent stake. The board of Starbucks Japan said it would recommend the Y1,465-per-share offer for the remaining 21 per cent stake held by public shareholders, which represents a 12 per cent premium to the 30-day average share price.The move comes as Starbucks focuses increasingly on its overseas expansion. Asia represented 6 per cent of sales and 10 per cent of the company’s operating profit in 2013, up from 5 per cent and 9 per cent a year earlier, respectively.“Full ownership of Starbucks Japan enables us to build on the amazing foundation of customer trust and loyalty our partners have achieved by continuing to take care of our people, delivering the highest quality coffee and innovating in product, store design and the digital experience,” Howard Schultz, Starbucks chief executive, said.The company said it may introduce new concepts in Japan such as its Teavana brand, a chain of stores selling tea and teaware.Shares in Starbucks have fallen 6 per cent this year, trailing the 7 per cent gain by the S&P 500.
230;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-09-17T17:46:39Z;Can fashion fix the paradox of wearable tech?;;If Google Glass didn’t exist, guys in Silicon Valley would be having affairs or buying unsuitable motorbikes – or so claim the “White Men Wearing Google Glass” Tumblr and Twitter feeds, which mock the device’s associations with unfashionable male geekery.Now Google’s flagship wearable is a step closer to shedding its unflattering image: high-end online fashion sites Net-a-Porter and Mr Porter have started selling Glass to UK shoppers, the first third-party retailers to do so.They are stocking the snazziest versions designed by Diane von Furstenberg, in colours such as “Matt Ice” and “Shiny Elderberry”. Buyers not put off by the Starbucks Frappucino-sounding names can grab a pair – including clip-on sunshades and a little screwdriver to attach the quartz screen – for £1,250 for women and £1,120 for men.Tech and fashion make for an uneasy mix, and not just because of programmers’ hunched and hoodie-wearing image. It is also because the computing that underpins technology is all about stuff that is quantifiable and definable – while fashion focuses on the intangible, the intuitive, how things look and feel.Steve Jobs knew that just because something can be readily categorised and analysed, that does not make it the thing that matters most – an insight that helped him make Apple’s iPhone a success. That unpindownable je ne sais quoi is what Italian eyewear mogul Leonardo Del Vecchio is looking for when he says he could sell “millions” of Glass via Luxottica’s partnership with Google, if only the tech group would do “50 per cent of what they had done with mobile phones”.But aside from design, Google’s high-fashion ambitions face a bigger hurdle, or at least the hypothesis of one: that the more socially invasive the personal technology, the more others want to know if and how it is being used.Take smartphones. Part of why they have become acceptable on dining and boardroom tables the world over is that there is always the moment, obvious to someone else, when a user decides to swipe or tap. “Smart” bands like Jawbone and Fitbit have caught on partly because someone else’s wrist is something you can choose to ignore – plus it is their business if they want to know how many steps they are taking or hours they are sleeping.The challenge with Glass, though, is that it is right there on your face, and that its capacity to analyse the world as you experience makes it an inescapable part of your real-life interactions. Taken together, these features mean Glass has to be both fashionably unobtrusive and obvious to others what it is being used for. After all, it is hard to imagine a world where everyone is entirely relaxed about the prospect of being filmed during intimate conversations or interviews with their bank managers, or their emotions read via algorithms so their credit risk can be assessed.The irony is that the more fashion designers make Glass ubiquitous outside the white male “Glasshole” market, the creepier it potentially becomes – and the more the technology will need to signal what it is up to. That might be too great a challenge even for a company with the inventiveness of Google.
231;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;A first blow against corporate tax avoidance;The reform package approved by OECD states is a promising start;Governments across the developed world have long been concerned by the need to crack down on corporate tax avoidance. As they struggle to cope with declining budgets, cash-strapped treasuries can ill-afford to let revenues slip through the cracks while big companies game the world’s disparate tax systems. This uneven playing field has not only created a fiscal problem. It has also triggered public anger that leading corporations such as Amazon and Starbucks are paying far less corporation tax than appears fair.In response, finance ministers – in particular UK chancellor George Osborne – have argued that corporate tax avoidance is a global problem and one that can only be remedied by concerted international action. No government can deal with this on its own. It is therefore encouraging that the OECD has this week agreed and published sweeping rules to crack down on the problem, including measures to increase transparency, close loopholes and limit the use of tax havens. Governments must now ensure these rules are fully implemented in domestic legislation.Securing any international agreement on corporate tax avoidance is a complex matter. When such an accord was first mooted two years ago, many were doubtful of success. But the OECD package – agreed by all member nations – contains valuable proposals that should guide government action.The most eye-catching reform is an obligation on multinationals to report their revenues, profits and taxes on a country-by-country basis. This extra transparency is vital because it will help busy tax authorities to determine quickly where potential avoidance has occurred.It is also important that the G20 group of leading economies has approved a raft of additional provisions to combat some particularly impenetrable features of tax avoidance. The OECD has produced practical changes to domestic and international law that can help close these loopholes. These include confronting so-called “hybrid mismatch arrangements” where companies exploit differences in law between nations in order to pay tax in neither place. To counter the practice of multinationals shifting profits between jurisdictions, the OECD demands that they provide more information about transfer pricing regimes to national tax authorities.The OECD agreement also confronts the issue of “treaty shopping”, which is where companies shift their activities to misuse bilateral tax treaties that were intended to prevent revenues being taxed twice. With 3,000 tax treaties in operation, it is all too easy for the principle of no double taxation to degenerate into the practice of double non-taxation.Those wary of reform will urge caution, pointing to issues that remain unresolved. The fast-evolving digital economy is an area where combating tax avoidance is proving difficult and there is much to be done. There are sharp differences on the definition of harmful tax practices. One country’s spur to innovation is another’s race to the bottom, as shown in the simmering row about the UK’s patent box.But what is most striking is the progress made rather than the obstacles ahead. Now the task is to maintain this momentum. For too long the highly technical topic of corporate tax avoidance has been driven by populist outrage. Public embarrassment may be a powerful weapon – and one which assists politicians in cracking down on companies. But it is also a crude instrument. If governments fail to build on the OECD’s manifesto, policy can only get clumsier.

It would require microsurgery of the kind needed to divide conjoined twins. The complexity is illustrated by the need to split legacy pension schemes. This is just one problem big companies would find themselves pondering after a Yes vote next Thursday.England would not let Scotland share the pound via a formal currency union. Equally, EU law would make it hard for employers to combine defined benefit pension liabilities for English and Scottish workers, assuming Scotland joined the EU.Funds such as BT’s, which had a £5.5bn accounting deficit at the last record date, would in time become “cross-border schemes” provided they covered at least a handful of Scottish employees. This means schemes could no longer run extended deficits. Employers would then need to fund them fully, and fast, according to Zoe Murphy of law firm Sackers.The UK’s largest companies would struggle to make up a collective accounting deficit estimated at £90bn by Mercer, a consultancy, without a raid on dividends. Some might be immune because they had no Scottish members. But JPMorgan has identified at least 22 big businesses that are “at risk”, including BAE Systems, Mothercare and Tesco.Splitting schemes into UK and Scottish funds would be “hideously complicated” for employers, according to pensions adviser John Ralfe. But it would still be the most attractive optionFew schemes make provision for division in their trust deeds, says Ms Murphy. So there would be spirited argument over the parcelling out of assets and liabilities. If it was done on a per member basis, Scottish schemes would often wind up better funded. Scots lives are generally shorter than English ones.Scottish sub-schemes could be cheaper to fund than English counterparts for another reason. Liabilities could presumably be funded in line with a discount rate that reflected higher Scottish government bond yields. But this would represent only modest compensation to employers for extra administrative expense and, potentially, currency mismatches.Life thru a LenHotels-to-hot drinks combine Whitbread is officially run by Andy Harrison. But Lombard, like many Britons, prefers to believe TV ads frontman Lenny Henry is in charge. This would mean the market has much for which to thank the Dudley-born entertainer: Whitbread has just announced a 12.8 per cent increase in sales for the past quarter.However, the comedian-turned-Shakespearean actor must sometimes ponder the spreadsheets with the brooding intensity he brought to the role of Othello in 2009. Sales from Costa are up 17.8 per cent compared with Premier Inn at 14.7 per cent. A straight line growth projection from last year’s trend shows the coffee chain challenging the budget hotel chain in sales terms in 2019.Premier Inn is a predominantly UK unit, using its dependability to grab sales from patchy independent guesthouses. That will expose the chain to capacity constraints faster than Costa, whose universal consumer appeal and low capital appetite allows it to expand fast overseas.Mr Henry, who shot to fame with such zany characters as PC Ganja, will sense incipient pressure for a demerger. Wyn Ellis of Numis reckons this will be curbed by a profits disparity: he is forecasting £215m for Costa and £550m for Premier Inn and restaurants in 2018. However, any stumble brings splits talk to the surface for widely-held, diversified groups.The modernised Whitbread is on a trajectory to stardom, with slack in the share price compared with titanic rival Starbucks. But soon enough, it will have to cope with the process Mr Henry has handled so elegantly. It will mature.The NED who fledBlink, and you would have missed him. Richard Adam has stepped down as a non-executive director of logistics group Wincanton after three months. In his day job as finance director of Carillion he was central to the services company’s failed and acrimonious attempt to merge with Balfour Beatty.Construction group Balfour is chaired by Steve Marshall. He also chairs Wincanton.Fellow Wincanton directors will now be spared the awkwardness of Mr Marshall glaring at Mr Adam across the boardroom table. Carillion’s numbers man discussed financing for the merged business with City lenders. Mr Marshall may have seen this as the teensiest bit premature.There is something to be said for picking board members who would otherwise rarely run into each other.

233;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-09-05T18:22:40Z;Starbucks targets on-the-go New Yorkers with express stores;;Starbucks plans to launch a new express store format in New York City early next year designed to cater for on-the-go coffee drinkers that are often deterred by long queues.The small stores will offer a reduced menu and customers will be able to order their coffee on smartphone apps ahead of their arrival.The company has seen growing competition from small coffee shops and brands such as Blue Bottle Coffee and Nespresso offering better quality coffee.By creating a store format that emphasises speed and convenience, Starbucks hopes to appeal to more urban customers, said Lisa Passé, vice-president of global communications.“We’re looking more critically at the specific neighbourhoods and their needs,” Ms Passé said. She declined to say how many express stores the company would open and when, saying it was a new experimental format.Starbucks plans to add 1,600 new stores globally in 2015, nearly 300 of which will be in the US.The express format follows the success of the company’s drive-through stores, which account for more than 40 per cent of the company’s US outlets. The stores have generated higher than average sales growth compared with its more traditional stores.Big-box retailers Target and Walmart have also explored smaller footprints in urban areas. To cater for customers’ changing shopping and living habits, the retailers have been shifting some of their focus out of suburban areas and into cities.Starbucks also said on Friday it planned to open 100 Starbucks Reserve premium coffee stores globally within five years, in addition to its first Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room.The roastery will open in Starbucks’s home base of Seattle in December and double the company’s small-batch roasting capacity for its Starbucks Reserve coffee to 1,500 stores worldwide.The company already operates Starbucks Reserve stores in Tokyo and parts of Latin America and plans to open additional locations in 21 counties by the end of the year. In China, which is set to become Starbucks’s second largest market in 2015, the Starbucks Reserve brand will be vital to the company’s growth strategy, it said.
234;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Tim Hortons’ Canadian roots run deep;;Tim Hortons took out a double-page ad in Canada’s largest national newspaper on Wednesday featuring two identical cups of coffee and the words, “before” and “after”.Its aim was to reassure an anxious nation that nothing would change at their beloved Timmy’s – as it is colloquially known – after the announcement this week of its proposed $11.4bn sale to US-based Burger King.Tim Hortons’ place in Canadian cultural lore is rivalled only by hockey – the national sport to which it is strongly linked. The chain started in 1964 with one shop in Hamilton, Ontario, founded by Hall of Fame hockey player Tim Horton.Douglas Hunter, author of a 2012 book on the doughnut and coffee chain’s rise, said that since it overtook McDonald’s as the largest fast-food operator in Canada in 2002, Tim Hortons has “really become a part of the national identity”.“People talk about Tims like it is Canada,” he said, noting that the media refers to “Tim Hortons voters . . .[as] shorthand for who the average Canadian is” – the sort that drinks a “double double” (coffee with two creams and two sugars) and eats Timbit doughnut holes.Its importance is not lost on management. On a conference call with analysts announcing the deal, executives were at pains to stress the strong bonds between country and company.“Tim Hortons is an iconic Canadian brand and its importance to Canada’s community, economy and coffee lovers cannot be overstated,” said Alex Behring, incoming executive chairman and a managing partner at 3G Capital, the Brazilian private equity firm that will own a roughly 51 per cent stake in the combined company.“Burger King and 3G appreciate this and as such the transaction is structured to preserve this relationship and to bring significant benefit to Canada.”The executives stressed that the brands would be managed separately, and that the new company’s global headquarters would be in Ontario.The deal – which would create a company with a roughly $21bn market capitalisation and 18,000 restaurants worldwide – has been promoted as a way to grow Tim Hortons internationally beyond the 50 outlets it operates outside of Canada and the US. The company’s Toronto-listed shares have risen more than a quarter since news of the deal broke.Tim Hortons has more than 4,500 stores and about $3bn in annual sales. In Canada, its ubiquity is unrivalled: it has more than 3,600 stores, in a nation of about 35m people, compared to 1,400 for McDonald’s. It also controls about 75 per cent of the fast-food caffeinated beverage market, compared to 4.6 per cent for Starbucks and 9.6 per cent for McDonald’s, according to NPD data.When Tim Horton died in a car accident on the way home from a game in 1974, there were just 40 Tim Hortons outlets. His business partner, a former police constable, bought the Horton family out and expanded the chain through franchising.By 1991, the chain had 500 Canadian stores. Four years later, Wendy’s bought the chain for roughly $450m, and it reached 2,000 Canadian outlets by 2000. In 2006, under pressure from activist investor Bill Ackman– now a major shareholder in Burger King – Wendy’s listed 29m shares, and spun off the company.The idea that Tim Hortons would again find itself owned by a US company came as a surprise, said RJ Hottovy, analyst at Morningstar.“But Burger King has a much larger global footprint than Wendy’s did, and that is the key difference here,” he said.
235;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-08-21T12:45:06Z;For the fans, by the fans – lessons from the new Doctor Who;The hit BBC series relaunches this weekend with a new title sequence that was inspired by a fan;Miley Cyrus, the US pop singer, this month seriously underestimated the creative potential of fan engagement. A young man who had paid to participate in a preconcert “meet-and-greet” with the star proceeded to grope the singer’s chest. Even if the fan did pay $995 for the privilege, that does not constitute a scaleable business model.Compare her approach to fan engagement with that of Doctor Who, the venerable BBC television show that begins a new series this weekend with a new actor, Peter Capaldi, in the lead role. While Ms Cyrus played to her fans’ basest instincts, Doctor Who has instead tapped their best creative skills. A brand new title sequence – the first fresh concept in more than 50 years – has been inspired by an effort on YouTube.Billy Hanshaw, a freelance designer from Leeds, uploaded his version of the Doctor Who title credits to the site back in September. It rushed to 60,000 views, and now has nearly 900,000. Among those impressed was Doctor Who’s lead writer Steven Moffat, who declared it “absolutely stunning”.“We got in touch with him, and said, ‘OK, we’re going to do that one’,” says Mr Moffat, who is also the co-creator of another BBC hit drama series, Sherlock, and is probably not used to other people supplying the ideas.Doctor Who is one of the most successful shows in the history of the BBC. Last year’s 50th anniversary episode of the science-fiction drama was shown live in more than 70 countries. Cinemas in Australia sold more than 60,000 tickets.The new title sequence for this weekend’s reboot includes Mr Hanshaw’s basic framework, which includes spinning cogs, plus some ideas from the BBC, such as clocks moving backwards.The case offers some lessons for brands looking to use fans’ ideas to create the best possible product.First, Mr Hanshaw, 46, is not a diehard fan of Doctor Who. He watched the programme as a kid, and sporadically since. That may not be a coincidence: casual fans may be able to provide innovations in a way that true devotees would not dare. “If you’re such an uber-fan, you kind of get blinkered,” says Mr Hanshaw.Second, he had design skills, but his real contribution was his outsider’s view. While some aspects of Doctor Who had been pored over relentlessly, the show’s title sequence had been left unchanged. Mr Moffat declared Mr Hanshaw’s offering was “the only new title idea I’d seen since 1963”.Some brands already try to crowdsource innovation. Starbucks operates a MyStarbucksIdea website, where consumers can make suggestions. But the format encourages obvious gripes (“Get a better WiFi system!”, “Pay your fair share of tax in the UK”), instead of creative input.For entertainment brands, the risk is that user engagement does not create a better finished product.In 1896 The New York Times asked readers to suggest a new slogan. As The Atlantic magazine reported, the ideas were quite frankly rubbish. At least one of them – “The top o’ the morning to you, 365 times a year” – is so annoying that it would probably have brought forward the decline in the Times’ print circulation by several decades. Thankfully, the newspaper stuck with its existing slogan.Sometimes insiders will have better ideas. However, there are now so many talented individuals exhibiting their skills on YouTube, Pinterest, Twitter and so forth that outsiders often know best. As Doctor Who has demonstrated, using fans’ contributions also helps create a buzz around the show.Even the most creative minds, such as Mr Moffat, should therefore be prepared to act as curators of others’ ideas. As for pop stars like Ms Cyrus, they can now do more than invite fans onstage – they can involve them in the choreography.
236;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;A step too far for UK tax authorities;HMRC cannot be allowed to raid private bank accounts;Over the past four years David Cameron’s government has subjected Britain’s public sector to a fierce programme of deficit reduction to restore order to UK public finances. One consequence of this squeeze is that the British public is easily angered by the sight of individuals and companies that avoid paying their fair share of tax. Celebrities have found their names splashed across newspaper front pages for engaging in tax avoidance schemes. Multinationals such as Starbucks and Amazon have faced pressure to pay levels of corporation tax that better reflect their huge presence in the UK.George Osborne, the chancellor, has been keen to harness the public’s anger in ways that benefit the UK’s cash-strapped Treasury. He has introduced a raft of legislation allowing Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs more ways to crack down on evaders and avoiders. One new law means that individuals who are engaged in a tax avoidance dispute with HMRC can only get access to the contested cash if they win in the courts. This is a commendable move. Individuals should not be allowed to hold on to the proceeds of disputed avoidance schemes while the legal wrangling drags on for years.A far more controversial reform is now coming closer to the statute book. This would see HMRC gaining the power to remove cash directly from the bank accounts of individuals who owe the revenue more than £1,000. As the Financial Times reported on Saturday, the British Bankers’ Association has thrown its weight behind the large number of UK professional bodies that want Mr Osborne to scrap the idea in his Autumn Statement. The BBA is right to take this stand. Such a law gives the UK tax authorities unprecedented powers and must be opposed.Unveiling this new power, Mr Osborne has talked up the numerous safeguards. A bank account will only be raided after the individual concerned has been contacted four times by HMRC and asked to pay the tax that is due. Withdrawals will not take place if there is less than £5,000 in the account to avoid the victim being cast into penury. Above all, Mr Osborne is pressing home that he is not seeking to target people who are unable to pay tax. Instead, the new law would target an estimated 17,000 individuals who deliberately choose to avoid payment, knowing HMRC lacks the resources to tackle them in the courts.Still, this new power is far too draconian. It would allow HMRC to withdraw cash from bank accounts without any oversight from a court or third party. As the BBA told Mr Osborne in a letter last week: “HMRC would effectively be a judge in its own cause.” The new legislation might also open the way for other public bodies – such as TV Licensing and local authorities – to make similar unsupervised raids on private bank accounts.The biggest concerns touch on HMRC’s accuracy and reliability. For this power to work, the organisation’s tax assessment systems and processes need to be sufficiently robust that the likelihood of mistakes would be negligible. But there is too much anecdotal evidence of its mistakes for this proposal to enjoy public confidence. The official adjudicator examining more than 2,300 public complaints into HMRC last year upheld some 90 per cent of them, either partially or substantially.In any modern state there will always be citizens who can pay tax but refuse to do so. The UK authorities must pursue these people. But in order to improve its capabilities, HMRC needs greater human and financial resources – not blunt legislative powers that threaten to infringe basic human rights. Mr Osborne’s proposal to raid bank accounts is now under attack from a remarkable coalition that stretches from Britain’s banks to the pressure group Liberty. It is time for him to drop it.——————————————-Letters in response to this editorial:HMRC has to be properly resourced / From Mr Paul AplinHMRC wants to be its own judge and jury / From Mr Anthony Thomas
237;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Monopoly is a bureaucrat’s friend but a democrat’s foe;The challenges from smaller competitors spur the innovations that matter;"“It takes a heap of Harberger triangles to fill an Okun gap,” wrote James Tobin in 1977, four years before winning the Nobel Prize in economics. He meant that the big issue in economics was not battling against monopolists but preventing recessions and promoting recovery.After the misery of recent years, nobody can doubt that preventing recessions and promoting recovery would have been a very good idea. But economists should be able to think about more than one thing at once. What if monopoly matters, too?The Harberger triangle is the loss to society as monopolists raise their prices, and it is named after Arnold Harberger, who 60 years ago discovered that the costs of monopoly were about 0.1 per cent of US gross domestic product – a few billion dollars these days, much less than expected and much less than a recession.Professor Harberger’s discovery helped build a consensus that competition authorities could relax about the power of big business. But have we relaxed too much?Large companies are all around us. We buy our mid-morning coffee from global brands such as Starbucks, use petrol from Exxon or Shell, listen to music purchased from a conglomerate such as Sony (via Apple’s iTunes), boot up a computer that runs Microsoft on an Intel processor. Crucial utilities – water, power, heating, internet and telephone – are supplied by a few dominant groups, with baffling contracts damping any competition.Of course, not all large businesses have monopoly power. Tesco, the monarch of British food retailing, has found discount competitors chopping up its throne to use as kindling. Apple and Google are supplanting Microsoft. And even where market power is real, Prof Harberger’s point was that it may matter less than we think. But his influential analysis focused on monopoly pricing. We now know there are many other ways in which dominant businesses can harm us.In 1989 the Beer Orders shook up a British pub industry controlled by six brewers. The hope was that more competition would lead to more and cheaper beer. It did not. The price of beer rose. Yet so did the quality of pubs. Where once every pub had offered rubbery sandwiches and stinking urinals, suddenly there were sports bars, candlelit gastropubs and other options. There is more to competition than lower prices.Monopolists can sometimes use their scale and cash flow to produce real innovations – the glory years of Bell Labs come to mind. But the ferocious cut and thrust of smaller competitors seems a more reliable way to produce many of the everyday innovations that matter.That cut and thrust is no longer so cutting or thrusting as once it was. “The business sector of the US economy is ageing,” says a Brookings research paper. It is a trend found across regions and industries, as incumbent players enjoy entrenched advantages. “The rate of business start-ups and the pace of employment dynamism in the US economy has fallen over recent decades . . . This downward trend accelerated after 2000,” adds a survey in the Journal of Economic Perspectives.That means higher prices and less innovation, but perhaps the game is broader still. The continuing debate in the US over “net neutrality” is really an argument about the least damaging way to regulate the conduct of cable companies that hold local monopolies. If customers had real choice over their internet service provider, net neutrality rules would be needed only as a backstop.As the debate reminds us, large companies enjoy power as lobbyists. When they are monopolists, the incentive to lobby increases because the gains from convenient new rules and laws accrue solely to them. Monopolies are no friend of a healthy democracy.They are, alas, often the friend of government bureaucracies. This is not just a case of corruption but also about what is convenient and comprehensible to a politician or civil servant. If they want something done about climate change, they have a chat with the oil companies. Obesity is a problem to be discussed with the likes of McDonald’s. If anything on the internet makes a politician feel sad, from alleged copyright infringement to “the right to be forgotten”, there is now a one-stop shop to sort it all out: Google.Politicians feel this is a sensible, almost convivial, way to do business – but neither the problems in question nor the goal of vigorous competition are resolved as a result.One has only to consider the way the financial crisis has played out. The emergency response involved propping up big institutions and ramming through mergers; hardly a long-term solution to the problem of “too big to fail”. Even if smaller banks do not guarantee a more stable financial system, entrepreneurs and consumers would profit from more pluralistic competition for their business.No policy can guarantee innovation, financial stability, sharper focus on social problems, healthier democracies, higher quality and lower prices. But assertive competition policy would improve our odds, whether through helping consumers to make empowered choices, splitting up large corporations or blocking megamergers. Such structural approaches are more effective than looking over the shoulders of giant corporations and nagging them; they should be a trusted tool of government rather than a last resort.As human freedoms go, the freedom to take your custom elsewhere is not a grand or noble one – but neither is it one that we should abandon without a fight.tim.harford@ft.com"
238;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Multinationals fret as China’s antimonopoly probes intensify;;A growing number of the world’s most powerful brands, from Microsoft to Mercedes, are being targeted in antimonopoly investigations in China, leaving all multinationals wondering if their Chinese investments could be next.The campaign is being led by China’s powerful state planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, which has focused on alleged anti-competitive behaviour in pharmaceuticals, milk powder, technology and the car sector. The State Administration for Industry and Commerce has also been involved.In several dramatic and heavily-publicised raids in recent days, investigators have visited the China offices of Microsoft and Mercedes-Benz to interrogate executives and confiscate computers.On Wednesday, the NDRC said it will impose hefty fines for “monopolistic behaviour” on Audi, Chrysler and 12 Japanese car and auto-parts makers.The agency is also investigating US chipmakerQualcomm for what it says are anti-competitive practices in China and has banned government and Communist Party procurement of products from Apple, Microsoft and antivirus software companies Symantec and Kaspersky Labs.The response from most of the companies that have been targeted - as well as other mulinationals operating in China - has been stunned silence.Executives at global companies with extensive operations in China say they are trying to work out whether this is part of a broader protectionist push by Beijing and how far the current campaign is likely to go. Those that have not yet been picked on are also hoping they can stay under the radar.“In previous [antimonopoly] cases it has been clear what laws they have violated but this time it’s not that clear,” said Zhaofeng Zhou, counsel at the law firm Taylor Wessing, referring to the antimonopoly investigations into foreign carmakers. “Some companies in this sector really don’t know what they’ve done wrong.”Some Chinese analysts believe the humbling of selected foreign companies is part of a broader nationalist and protectionist swing in the country ushered in by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who took power in late 2012.The start of the antimonopoly investigations led by the NDRC can be traced almost exactly to Mr Xi’s inauguration, when he promised to realise the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”.Jiang Liyong, a former diplomat and Commerce Ministry official with China’s WTO mission in Geneva and now a partner at Gaopeng Law Firm, says the use of antimonopoly legislation to punish foreign companies is intentional because such actions are not expressly forbidden under WTO or other international trade and investment rules.“That is why China is using these laws and why foreign companies have no recourse,” Mr Jiang said.He said there is currently a fierce debate within the Chinese government between “leftists” who think foreign companies should be squeezed out of the country in favour of domestic competitors and “rightists” who believe antimonopoly and other legislation should be applied equally to Chinese companies.For those who believe the wave of NDRC cases are part of a broader protectionist tilt, a series of other public attacks on the cybersecurity and food safety of global brands like Apple, Google, Walmart, KFC, Starbucks and McDonald’s appear to fit the pattern.But some analysts argue the NDRC-led campaign has more to do with institutional infighting and internal political turf wars than a master plan to exclude foreign investors from the country.One of the biggest institutional losers in the administrative reforms introduced by Mr Xi when he took office has been the NDRC, which was previously regarded as the most powerful of all China’s bureaucracies.The agency’s licensing, planning and approval powers have been significantly curtailed since Mr Xi took power and its standing within the government has plummeted, along with its ability to seek rents and procure bribes.“As the current administrative reforms deepen, the NDRC fears it might lose the power to carry out anti-monopoly investigations so it is pushing these high-profile investigations of foreign companies,” says Liu Xu, a researcher at the intellectual property and competition law research centre of Tongji University in Shanghai.Mr Liu points out that the NDRC has also investigated quite a few domestic companies but does not publicise those cases, which are often resolved by negotiation between the NDRC and agencies or powerful party leaders with close ties to the targeted companies.In this context, foreign companies are easier and more effective scapegoats since they usually do not have Communist Party elders to protect them and punishing them can have a powerful deterrent effect on entire sectors.Whatever the underlying motivation for the current campaign, there is no question that it has been highly popular among ordinary Chinese consumers, who often pay significantly more than in other markets for what are sometimes inferior products.Global carmakers, milk powder producers, pharmaceutical companies and some technology companies have all reduced prices for their products over the past year in response to the investigations.With results like that, it is unlikely the NDRC will be taking a break any time soon.Additional Reporting by Gu Yu and Christian Shepherd
239;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-07-31T16:11:12Z;Yum leads S&P 500 fast food sector lower;;Fast-food chain shares were blunted on Thursday after one of the sector’s largest restaurant operators warned it had seen “significant” deterioration in Chinese sales amid a new food safety scare.Yum, the Kentucky-based operator of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, said that an undercover July news report has had a “significant, negative impact to same-store sales at both KFC and Pizza Hut in China over the past 10 days”.The report depicted food safety lapses at Shanghai Husi, a division of OSI that supplies Yum and McDonald’s in China, where employees were alleged to relabel expired meat.Yum, which had recently recovered after a year of sales weakness in China relating to a separate 2012 food safety scare, said it was “too early” to know when sales would rebound.“If the significant sales impact is sustained, it will have a material effect on full-year earnings per share,” the company said in a statement. Yum said it no longer purchases products from Shanghai Husi.Analysts with Wells Fargo and RBC cut earnings targets for 2014 and 2015, as China represents an outsized share of overall Yum sales compared to other markets.“With the current meat supply issue receiving widespread media coverage, we expect the consumer response to most closely resemble that of the 2013 antibiotic issue – meaning KFC and Pizza Hut are likely to see a shortlived, but meaningful, same-store sales hit,” Jeff Farmer, an analyst with Wells Fargo, said.Shares of Yum declined almost 5 per cent to close at $69.40, McDonald’s fell 1.45 per cent to $94.56 and Starbucks, which has more than 1,000 stores in China, dipped 1.55 per cent to $77.68. Burger King Worldwide shares declined just short of 1 per cent to end the day at $26.38.Whole Foods was under pressure after third quarter same-store sales fell short of expectations and the grocer cut its full-year earnings guidance.The Austin, Texas-based company lowered the top end of its full-year outlook, following three previous cuts to guidance. It now sees 2014 earnings per share in a range of $1.52 to $1.54, compared to a range of $1.52 to $1.56 earlier.Whole Foods forecast full-year revenue growth between 9.6 and 9.9 per cent, compared to earlier expectations as high as 11 per cent.The company also said same-store sales rose 3.9 per cent from a year earlier, shy of Wall Street estimates for a 4.8 per cent gain.“With comps running well below 6 per cent long-term goals, we believe valuation will remain under pressure,” Mark Wiltamuth, an analysts with Jefferies, said. Mr Wiltamuth lowered his price target on the company to $41 from $46.Whole Foods shares fell 2.28 per cent to $38.22. Rival grocers declined on the figures. Fresh Market slipped 2.5 per cent to $29.93, Kroger slid 1.51 per cent to $49.98 and Sprouts Farmers Market dipped 2.8 per cent to end at $30.51.US defence contractor L-3 Communications led the declines on the benchmark S&P 500 after the company said it was conducting an investigation into alleged misconduct that led to overstatements of sales and income at its aerospace division.The company, which makes communications systems used in drones and aircraft carriers, said that contract cost over-runs had been “inappropriately deferred” and net sales were overstated.“The company believes that the amounts associated with these adjustments are the result of misconduct and accounting errors at the Aerospace Systems segment,” the company said in a statement. “The misconduct included concealment from L-3’s Corporate staff and external auditors.”L-3 shares declined 12.27 per cent to $104.96.Synchrony Financial, the North American store credit business partially floated by General Electric, edged higher on its debut on Thursday, despite broad declines in US equity markets. Shares rose as much as 1 per cent to $24 before paring gains. Synchrony priced 125m shares at $23, the bottom of its $23-$26 range.Overall, investors sold off US equity positions. The S&P 500 fell 2 per cent to close at 1,930.67 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.88 per cent to 16,563.3. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.09 per cent to end the day at 4,369.77.eric.platt@ft.comTwitter: @ericgplatt
240;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-07-17T01:08:49Z;Colombia: Starbucks arrives in the land of Juan Valdéz;;"Juan Valdéz, the moustached embodiment for Colombia’s coffee industry (along with his loyal donkey), may be grinning from the sidelines. After sourcing coffee from the Andean country for 43 years, Seattle-based Starbucks opened its first store here on Wednesday.The three-story store is the first of 50 the company plans to open here in the next five years. But to the joy of proud Colombians (even Señor Valdéz), this will be the only country in the world to serve exclusively locally-sourced Starbucks coffee.“As we ventured into this market we’ve been really respectful, we came with great humility because of the richness and the heritage of Colombian coffee,” Cliff Burrows, president of Starbucks US and the Americas, told beyondbrics.Colombia is one of the world’s top producers of premium arabica beans. For years, Starbucks has been the largest purchaser of this variety known for its deep, smooth taste, that is handpicked on the misty mineral-rich hills of this Andean country.But now, Burrows says, “for the first time ever we’ve been able to source and roast the coffee that is served behind the bar, we have never done this before in any country,” adding that “all of the espresso served in Colombia is Colombian coffee roasted exclusively in Colombia.”Colcafé a subsidiary of Colombia’s leading food producer, Nutresa, has partnered with Starbucks to produce and supply roasted coffee to the chain’s stores. Those will be developed and operated locally between Starbucks, Nutresa and Alsea, the Mexican restaurant company.Global food chains have mushroomed in Colombia’s bourgeoning market in recent years, as the economy is growing and the country is increasingly becoming recognised for its consumption patterns. Some believe the entrance of Starbucks could contribute to Colombia’s growing market for more gourmet coffee in a place where tinto (essentially, watery and warmed-over black coffee), is still king.Today Starbucks operates more than 700 stores across 13 markets in Latin America, including Mexico, Argentina and Chile, but Burrows described their first Colombian store as a “celebration of coffee, a celebration of Colombia.” The store is located in a leafy affluent corner of Bogotá, not far from one of the 279 stores Juan Valdéz has around the world.The owners of the local chain, the Colombian Coffee Growers Federation -which has spent decades branding coffee from here as a high-quality product – believe not only that competition is healthy, but that Starbucks’ move is good for coffee producers, who have been hit by an overvalued peso in recent years.Related reading:

241;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Two Chinese state behemoths fight – who will win?;;Two of China’s stodgiest state-controlled entities locked horns this week as state broadcaster CCTV accused a major state bank of money laundering and violations of the country’s foreign exchange rules.In a report aired on Wednesday, China Central Television claimed that Bank of China (BOC), the country’s fourth largest lender, was helping clients circumvent foreign exchange controls using a service called “Youhuitong,” a play on words that translates as “Preferential Transfer Channel.”The incident highlights the many regulatory grey areas that have emerged as China has launched a slew of financial reform pilot programmes. Many such programmes take the form of broad guidelines, while detailed regulations appear much later, if at all.Bankers say Youhuitong appears to fall in one such zone. While BOC is probably not in direct violation of any law, it appears to be pushing the envelope of what is permitted under a pilot programme for renminbi internationalisation launched in 2011, analysts said.The report also shows how Chinese and foreign companies alike are finding themselves on the wrong side of muckraking by CCTV, which is traditionally viewed as a Communist Party mouthpiece unlikely to criticise a state champion.In recent years CCTV has targeted high-profile foreign brands such as Starbucks, Wal-Mart, Apple, Samsung and Audi for criticism. But it has also taken on Chinese companies, most famously in a 2007 report alleging that dumplings sold by a Beijing vendor were made of cardboard and toxic chemicals. CCTV retracted that report after it was found that a reporter had fabricated it.In a response to the report issued late on Wednesday, BOC claimed that media reports on Youhuitong were “not consistent with the actual situation of the bank.” BOC said that the service was legal and that regulators were aware of it.And there are signs that CCTV may be backing off its claims. The video of the report has been removed from CCTV’s website, though it remains accessible on other online news sites. Two analysts quoted in CCTV’s report also said on Thursday that CCTV had quoted them out of context and that they weren’t accusing BOC of wrongdoing.But local media also reported that the foreign exchange regulator and the central bank’s anti-money-laundering division had already entered the bank to investigate. BOC, the People’s Bank of China (the central bank), and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange did not answer calls seeking comment.BOC’s Guangdong branch began offering cross-border renminbi payments in 2011 in a pilot programme. Clients have to prove that the funds will be used for emigration-related investments or purchases of foreign real estate, the bank said in its statement. Other commercial banks in Guangdong offer the same service, BOC added.BOC appears to be pushing the envelope, however, by allowing clients outside Guangdong to use the service. CCTV’s undercover reporter recorded a bank clerk in Beijing saying that the client would need to open an account in the Guangdong branch, but that the clerk could help clients handle this without traveling to Guangdong.Chinese foreign exchange rules allow individuals to convert up to $50,000 per year from renminbi to foreign currency. Youhuitong avoids this restriction, however, because renminbi are transferred overseas without first converting them to foreign currency. Once outside China, renminbi can then be converted to foreign exchange in the unregulated offshore market.Additional reporting by Owen GuoBack to beyondbrics
242;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-07-06T22:10:31Z;Recharging comes as part of the table service;;Recharging your smartphone is now as simple as putting your handset down on the table at the local coffee shop thanks to similar services created by a couple of technology start-ups on either side of the Atlantic.London-based Chargifi and Procter & Gamble-backed Powermat Technologies in the US use wireless charging hardware built into the underside of tables to provide the necessary electrical juice for Android and Apple devices.Their services are paid for through targeted marketing sent to users’ devices while they are being juiced up, such as banner ads or discount coupons on drinks or snacks. In the case of Chargifi, any revenue from these offers is then shared between the company and the host venue.Chargifi founder Dan Bladen hit upon the idea while travelling around the world with his wife during a sabbatical from a theology degree he was completing at the West London bible college St Mellitus.“We had been in and out of Starbucks the entire trip, partly to get coffee but more importantly to charge our phones from the power points,” Mr Bladen recalls. “It then hit me, why not charge the phone wirelessly.”Chargifi’s service was launched in outlets in the UK, Ireland and Dubai at the end of last year. This was funded by a £145,000 financing round backed by the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS) tax relief and completed by Mr Bladen’s team just 18 hours before the birth of his first child.Chargifi has since been made available at events organised by the European Golf and ATP Tours, and the company recently appointed Brett Akker of car rental service Streetcar as a board level non-executive director.Although Chargifi is planning another funding round, its expansion is being financed by licensing the technology to outlet operators on a franchise basis.Discussions are under way with organisations in Malaysia, Hong Kong, Russia, Croatia, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Cyprus with the goal of creating charging points in 20,000 venues across 15 countries in the next three years, according to Mr Bladen.Chargifi faces competition in the US from Powermat Technologies, which recently announced a deal to set up charging points in Starbucks outlets nationwide. Its technology complies with a standard developed by the Power Matters Alliance, whose members include AT&T, BlackBerry, HTC, Huawei and Microsoft.Market researcher IHS estimates that global revenue from wireless charging technology will rise from $216m in 2013 to $785m this year, and will grow to $8.5bn by 2018.
243;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-07-06T12:44:00Z;US companies caught in crossfire on right to carry guns in stores;;Brandon Randall grew up in a small town in rural Minnesota where every family home stored licensed guns and most weekend activities centred on shooting ranges and hunting trips. But his attitude towards firearms has shifted.“When I became a parent, my viewpoint changed dramatically on whether people should be able to carry weapons into supermarkets or drugstores – there’s just no need for a loaded rifle to be in that kind of space, or near my children,” Mr Randall said from his home in Arizona.“I support the rights of Americans to have firearms in their houses but there’s a big difference between private property and public spaces. It doesn’t necessarily prevent me from shopping or eating in these places, but it sure makes me uncomfortable.”While Mr Randall may be willing to keep spending, many US retailers are discovering that thousands of others are not. Frustrated by Washington’s inaction over gun violence, fledgling consumer pressure groups, often led by parent activists, are taking the issues generated by the country’s gun laws into their own hands.“Mom groups” have turned up the heat on big-name businesses to force in-store policy changes on “open carry” rights, part of an attempt to tackle the historically passive stance of corporate America. Now, it appears that the rallies, petitions, social media campaigns and walkouts being used to grab the attention of executives are increasingly hitting their mark.On Wednesday, Target became the latest retailer to ask shoppers to take their firearms away from its aisles after lobbying by Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, an anti-gun group partly funded by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg.Starbucks, Chipotle and Applebee's are other major household names – part of a group of at least a dozen US consumer companies – that have asked customers to leave their guns at home in the past year after similar campaigns.“Bringing firearms into Target creates an environment that is at odds with the family friendly shopping and work experience we strive to create,” said interim chief executive officer John Mulligan.“Starting today we respectfully request that guests not bring firearms to Target, even in communities where it is permitted by law.”Shannon Watts, a mother of five from Indianapolis and founder of Moms Demand Action praised the company’s decision, calling it a “stunning” victory in the absence of gun reform in Congress.“We have opened the eyes of a business icon and made them recognise that it’s more important to listen to their customer base majority than a bullying vocal minority. We say if change can’t come through government, then it can come in how we use our voices and wallets,” she said, adding that mothers are responsible for 80 per cent of spending decisions in US households.“When state laws don’t protect customers, then companies must do it instead. A lot of this is about changing American business culture in the wake of tragedies like the Newtown school massacre. Executives must realise that they have an important and powerful role to play in demanding a new status quo.”We have been thrust unwillingly into the debate . . . to be clear: we do not want these events in our storesCompanies are caught between warring customer factions on either side of the gun control debate. Stores have become ideological battlegrounds with pro-gun “open carry” activists staging events in stores, shopping with assault-style weapons slung over their shoulders.Target only changed its stance after demonstrations took place in stores in states including Texas, Alabama, Ohio and North Carolina in the past three months. Similarly, last September Starbucks chief executive officer Howard Schultz asked customers not to openly display firearms after his coffee shops were used as rallying points for public protests. Mr Schultz said he felt a responsibility to protect his staff and prevent the intimidation of patrons.“We have been thrust unwillingly into the debate . . . to be clear: we do not want these events in our stores,” he said, saying both sides had played a role “in ratcheting up the rhetoric and friction.”Many pro-gun shoppers say they will take their dollars elsewhere if retailers block their right to take responsibility for their own defence.“No more shopping at Target, since Target feels it necessary to prevent me from protecting my family with a legally owned and legally carried firearm,” customer Peggy Conrick posted on Facebook after the company’s decision this week.“Leaving it at home or in my car is not at option. Any store that doesn’t allow me to protect my family is a store I will not be shopping at.”The “moms groups” campaigns also run counter to new laws across several states making it easier for licensed gun owners to carry weapons where people congregate.On Tuesday, Georgia’s Safe Carry Protection Act came into effect, allowing gun-permit holders to bring their weapons into bars, restaurants and places of worship, unless explicitly banned by proprietors.
244;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-07-03T17:02:21Z;Amazon embroiled in EU tax crackdown;Brussels to examine ‘what kind of arrangement Luxembourg has’;European officials have demanded that Luxembourg hand over documents relating to Amazon’s tax affairs as the online retail giant becomes embroiled in a crackdown that has already drawn in Apple, Starbucks and Fiat’s financial arm.The EU’s competition commission has sent a request for information to the Grand Duchy, where Amazon’s main European operating company is based, about whether its decisions on corporate tax complied with state aid rules, two people familiar with the matter said.“We are looking into what kind of arrangement Luxembourg has with Amazon,” said an EU official. Another EU official said Brussels was conducting fact-finding missions in a number of EU countries as part of its drive to clamp down on “sweetheart” tax deals with large companies.The commission has already launched three in-depth investigations in Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg into whether decisions made about corporate tax to be paid by Apple, Starbucks and Fiat Finance and Trade breached state aid rules. A request for information is the first step that could lead to a full investigation.Amazon’s tax structure has aroused criticism across Europe at a time when EU governments have been forced to impose tough austerity measures by cutting basic welfare benefits to bail out failed banks and cut budget deficits. Evidence that some large multinationals pay virtually no tax has fuelled negative sentiment to US tech companies, which is now translating into tougher regulatory scrutiny across the EU.Questions over Amazon’s tax affairs will intensify scrutiny of a company whose power and popularity have led to questions over its business practices. It has faced criticism over working conditions in its warehouses, the alleged squeezing of suppliers and its role in putting small bricks-and-mortar retailers out of business.The latest accounts filed by Amazon EU Sarl highlight its tax-efficient structure in Luxembourg, which reduced the company’s overall tax rate by 8 percentage points last year to 31.8 per cent, according to filings by the parent company.Amazon EU Sarl earns profits on the online retailer’s sales across Europe – €13.6bn in 2013 – because it owns the inventory and processes payments. Last year it owed €2.1bn to another Luxembourg company, Amazon Europe Holding Technologies, for the use of intellectual property.The investigations into Apple, Starbucks and Fiat Finance and Trade are scrutinising the companies’ “transfer pricing” arrangements, which determine how their taxable profits are allocated between countries. According to the commission, Luxembourg has failed to co-operate fully with the investigation.We are looking into what kind of arrangement Luxembourg has with AmazonStarbucks came under fire in Britain in 2012 for paying royalties to its Dutch operation, which held some of its intellectual property. Apple’s tax affairs stirred disquiet last year after a US Senate committee claimed that Dublin allowed the maker of the iPhone to apply a corporate tax rate of 2 per cent or less.In principle, where the commission finds evidence of illegal state support, it can force the company to repay all the lost revenues from unlawful sweetheart deals.If there is a full investigation, EU competition commissioner Joaquín Almunia is believed to be keen for it to be under way before he leaves office later this year. At the launch of the investigation into Apple, Starbucks and Fiat in June, he said the net could be cast more widely in the pursuit of “aggressive” tax avoidance.“In the current context of tight public budgets, it is particularly important that large multinationals pay their fair share of taxes,” he said at the time.An overhaul of the international tax rules for digital companies is planned by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.Amazon did not reply to requests for comment. Luxembourg and the competition commission declined to comment.Additional reporting by Barney Jopson in Washington——————————————-Letter in response to this report:Is Amazon worth the chase? / From Mr Jem Eskenazi
245;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Defensive play in the World Cup of corporate taxation;;The global system for taxing multinational companies is broken, but no country wants to alter it too radically for fear of making it worse. That was my impression after hearing international tax experts gathered in Oxford this week to discuss reform.Reform of corporate taxation has been thrust onto the political agenda in Europe and by controversy over the tax policies of companies such as Google and Starbucks. The ease with which they can shift intellectual property and royalty payments to low tax regimes has outraged politicians on both sides of the Atlantic.The attempt by Pfizer to turn itself into a UK company for tax purposes by acquiring AstraZeneca has also drawn attention to the use of “tax inversion” by US companies. They want to use the cash piles held overseas to make acquisitions that allow them to change corporate nationality and reduce their taxes.But while most countries agree that the system of global taxation in place since the 1920s is flawed, there was no consensus at the conference held by the Oxford University Centre for Business Taxation on how to fix it. Instead, most prefer to play defence.“The gameplan is to be positive but hope as little as possible happens,” is how Paul Oosterhuis, a tax partner of Skadden Arps, the US law firm, described the attitude of US corporations to government proposals to amend its global arrangements.He argued that, despite the distortions of the US regime, under which US corporations are taxed on their global income but can shield overseas earnings by keeping them out of the US, both the administration and businesses feared European-led reform.Meanwhile, Wolfgang Schön of the Max Planck Institute for Tax Law and Public Finance, said that Germans were less concerned about US corporations avoiding tax than what they see as unfair competition between Amazon and “a small bookseller in Munich.”He added: “It is difficult for us to say we want to tax Amazon on the books sold in Germany but not have China tax sales of Daimlers there. My guess is that it is more important [to Germany] to preserve existing benefits than to tax Google and Amazon.”The G20 and the OECD are studying ways to reduce “base erosion” of tax yields by companies not only avoiding double taxation but any taxation at all. From what I heard, tinkering is likelier than upheaval.
246;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks to raise coffee prices amid Brazil drought;;US coffee drinkers will pay more for their morning fix, with Starbucks the latest java seller to raise its prices amid a surge in agricultural commodities.The Seattle-based chain will charge less than 1 per cent more for some drinks at its cafés from Tuesday and about 8 per cent more for packaged ground coffee sold in grocery stores starting in July.Coffee prices have jumped this year as an unprecedented drought in Brazil’s coffee-growing heartland has weakened the harvest.Earlier this month, JM Smucker, the maker of top US packaged coffee brand Folgers, said it was raising its prices for the first time in three years, and Dunkin’ Brands said it expects “modest” coffee price increases at its Dunkin’ Donuts shops. In April, Nestlé forecast a single-digit rise in input costs, although it was not clear whether it would pass that on to consumers.The price of high-quality arabica beans has come down a bit from this year’s peak of $2.19 a pound in April to about $1.73. However, most analysts do not expect a further retreat due to lingering drought damage in Brazil. The price is up 54 per cent this year.Zack Hutson, a Starbucks spokesman, said the market price of coffee was “a factor, but one of many factors” in the company’s latest move. Coffee commodity costs account for about 10 per cent of its stores’ overall operating expenses, he said. Other costs include rent, labour, equipment, dairy, fuel and energy.Starbucks says it has locked in “virtually all” of its coffee needs through September and 40 per cent of its needs in the next fiscal year. Howard Schultz, chief executive, has said he is not concerned about coffee prices and that the market has “overreacted” to the Brazilian drought.However, in March he warned that dairy prices are a concern, in part due to rising demand in China. The severe drought in California has also helped push up US wholesale dairy prices 15 per cent in the year to April, according to the USDA.The price change will be the first hike at cafés in about a year. Adjustments will vary across markets and products, with prices for most of the affected drinks rising between five and 20 cents.In Washington, for example, the cost of a medium or large brewed coffee – currently $1.95 and $2.25, respectively – could go up 10 to 15 cents.Starbucks is not raising prices of some of its most popular drinks, including medium lattes, small brewed coffees and Frappuccinos, nor of food items. The changes will affect about one in five customers, the company said.The suggested retail price for Starbucks brand roast and ground packaged coffee, sold by 40,000 grocery stores, drug stores and discounters, will rise by $1 on 12-ounce and 20-ounce bags – but ultimately, it is up to the retailer to set the price.Starbucks had cut the suggested price of those packages 10 per cent last April, so the increase effectively restores prices to their previous level, Mr Hutson said.Additional reporting by Emiko Terazonoshannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareil
247;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;The secret of Generation C;What tweens really love about Starbucks’ secret menu is not just that it feels a little subversive – but that it offers ‘customisation’;"Last weekend I was strolling through central Manhattan with my daughters when they spotted a Starbucks. “We have to go there – please, please!” one declared. “I have to tell all my friends at school!”I was shocked. Many years ago, when my children were tiny, I spent a lot of time in Starbucks, meeting up with other mothers. We fed our toddlers “babyccinos”, or cups of frothed milk, which Starbucks had cleverly started selling to appeal to the mother-and-toddler set. But since coffee is not defined as a childhood drink in western culture, I have tended to steer clear of the chain, as I do not want to inculcate an early love of caffeine in my pre-teen girls.However, what has suddenly got my daughters so excited has nothing to do with coffee, lattes, cappuccinos or espressos. In recent months Starbucks has started selling a “secret menu” of drinks – which are not listed in public. Stories about this have gone viral among American teens and “tweenies” (or preteens), via posts on Instagram and other social media; there is even a secret menu Facebook page.Never mind that canny Starbucks marketing experts have undoubtedly placed those links on social media themselves. Teens and tweenies think it is cool to drink concoctions such as Cotton Candy Frap(puccino), Grasshopper Frap or Rolo Frap, or drinks that never appear on any menu that their parents actually know about (unless they end up having to pay).As a piece of marketing strategy, this is pure genius. It is also a striking symbol of our age. Until the early years of the 20th century, the concept of a teen – let alone a tween – was unknown; in western society people were classified either as adults or children. The concept of the teenager sprang to life as consumer companies discovered a new market for their goods. They realised that the key to selling things in this demographic was to make teen brands different from parental brands, and a little subversive too.Until recently, Starbucks did not seem keen – or able – to tap into the teen demographic. Coffee bars are generally branded as grown-up places where young professionals hang out; coffee drinkers are, on average, relatively old. But Howard Schultz, Starbucks’ CEO, knows that if he wants to keep expanding, he has to get creative. Since the 1970s coffee consumption has been flat or falling; today Americans “only” consume 23 gallons of coffee a year, half the level of 50 years ago. But Starbucks is convinced that it can use the 13,000 outlets that dot the US today to sell something else. Hence the secret menu campaign, which is now cropping up in other places too: Chipotle, Jamba Juice and even McDonald’s are playing with the concept.What is perhaps most interesting about this tale is not simply that it shows that secrecy sells, but that the sense of individual identity is paramount as well. Judging from my daughters, and debates on the blogosphere and social media, what tweens really love about the secret menu is not just that it feels a little subversive – but that it offers “customisation”.A psychologist might attribute this simply to a child’s desire to exert power but I suspect there is something else going on: children these days are growing up in a world where “personal choice” is considered paramount, if not normal. Back when I was a tween in 1970s Britain, middle-class children did not usually expect “customised” drinks. We lived in a mass-market world; our parents had seen rationing.…But today, adults increasingly assume that everything should be shaped by individual choice – be that your flavour of drink, what media you consume or how you take a holiday. And that idea is being passed down to the next generation via millions of tiny, subtle cultural signals; such as those Starbucks drinks (which supposedly can be reconfigured into 87,000 different personal combinations). Today’s kids, in other words, are not so much Gen X, Y or Z – but Gen C, or Generation Customised.Is this empowering? Or utterly appalling? I suspect it is both. Either way, after endless entreaties last weekend, I succumbed and took my daughters to Starbucks, where they ordered their dream (customised) drink – a Cotton Candy Frappuccino. This turned out to be a vile-tasting, shocking-pink concoction. But taste did not seem to be the point. When the barista produced it, he did so with a knowing wink. It was so darn pink that it made a striking photo – which one of my daughters duly texted to her friends.By next month, no doubt a different drink will be considered cool, or maybe teens and tweens will be buzzing about something other than Starbucks. But if nothing else, the phenomenon is a striking sign of how plastic – and malleable – cultural symbols can be in our digital world, with marketing dollars at work. Even (or especially) with something as simple and ubiquitous as “having a coffee”.gillian.tett@ft.comIllustration by Shonagh Rae"
248;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks to help pay for US workers’ college tuition;;Starbucks will pick up part of the tab for its US employees’ college tuition, at a time when heavy student debt loads are being blamed for slowing growth in the world’s largest economy.The coffee chain is partnering with Arizona State University to offer discounted tuition for online bachelor’s degrees to 135,000 employees who work at least 20 hours a week.Workers will receive partial tuition – about $6,500 – for the first two years and full tuition for their final two years, with no obligation to stay with the company after they complete their degrees. They can choose from about 40 programmes including engineering, education and business.Annual tuition for ASU’s online degrees ranges from $480 to $543 per credit hour, and full-time enrolment requires 12 credit hours a semester. The programme will replace Starbucks’ existing offer of $1,000 a year in tuition reimbursement at certain schools. The company did not say how many employees are expected to enrol in a programme that Howard Schultz, chief executive, said represented a multimillion-dollar investment.Student debt has gained national attention as loan balances have ballooned to more than $1tn from about $250bn in 2003, according to a recent US government report, replacing credit cards as the second-largest pool of household debt after mortgages.Economists warn these burdens are holding young people back from making big purchases such as houses and cars, contributing to sluggish economic growth. In addition, mounting debt and challenges balancing work with school has made it difficult for many students to complete their degrees, leaving them owing money on an unfinished education.Last week President Barack Obama announced plans to expand a programme that caps loan repayments, even as congressional Republicans blocked a bill that would allow more people to refinance their loans. Starbucks said its new programme is meant to help more students finish school, as the majority of its employees do not have college degrees.“There’s no doubt, the inequality within the country has created a situation where many Americans are being left behind. The question for all of us is, should we accept that, or should we try and do something about it,” Mr Schultz said.He announced the programme on Monday in New York, accompanied by Arne Duncan, education secretary, and Michael Crow, president of ASU.“We want to attract and retain great people. We want to provide you with new tools and new resources to have advancements in the company,” Mr Schultz said, adding that, “yes, you can leave” after completing a degree without owing the company anything.With about 11,000 students enrolled in online programmes, ASU has become a leader among US public universities in online education, an area that has been dominated by for-profit schools dogged by low graduation rates and high levels of student borrowing.Its online offerings were ranked second in the US News and World Report’s recent survey of national universities making “promising and innovative changes”. Overall, ASU’s undergraduate programme is ranked 142nd out of 280 national universities in the US and 73rd among 117 public universities.Starbucks has long offered other benefits unusual in the low-wage service sector, including health insurance for part-time employees, and stock options.While other companies offer tuition reimbursement, such benefits are often limited to courses related to work, may be restricted to full-time employees and include commitments to remain with the company for a period of time.Walmart began offering tuition discounts for American Public University, a for-profit online school, in 2010. Target and Barnes & Noble, among others, offer tuition assistance for some job-related courses.McDonald’s offers education assistance as well as operations and management training at its own training centre – dubbed Hamburger University – which awards credits that can be transferred to certain schools.shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareil
249;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-06-11T22:26:14Z;EU probe shines spotlight on national tax authorities;;Brussels’ probe of three EU countries over tax deal s for Apple, Starbucks and Fiat Finance and Trade escalates a broader campaign against tax avoidance by scrutinising governments’ role in promoting schemes.The European Commission confirmed on Wednesday that it had opened three investigations into tax rulings secured by the companies and will examine whether the agreements violated the EU’s state aid rules, which are designed to prevent unfair competition in the single market.Joaquín Almunia, the EU’s competition commissioner said: “In the current context of tight public budgets, it is particularly important that large multinationals pay their fair share of taxes.”In particular, the commission will review rulings issued by the tax authorities of Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg concerning the companies’ “transfer pricing” arrangements – intra-company deals that determine how taxable profits are allocated between countries. Aggressive use of transferring pricing is one way that companies can cut tax bills.Brussels does not have direct authority over national tax systems but can investigate whether certain tax regimes would constitute unjustifiable state aid to companies. In that case, Mr Almunia explained that the EU could seek to close the tax loophole and even claim back the funds in question.Fiat and Starbucks said they complied with all tax regulation. Apple also said it had been cut no special exemption, adding: “Apple pays every euro of every tax that we owe. Since the iPhone launched in 2007, our taxes in Ireland have increased tenfold.”Both Ireland and the Netherlands expressed confidence that they had not breached state aid rules, while Luxembourg declined to comment.“Ireland is confident that there is no state aid rule breach in this case and we will defend all aspects vigorously,” the finance ministry said “We will now turn to providing our detailed, technical legal rebuttal to the commission’s position and if necessary will defend our position in the European courts.”Although the commission said it had concerns about the specific cases highlighted, Mr Almunia’s announcement was greeted in some quarters as a broader challenge to EU governments that use tax as a way to gain competitive advantage.“Whatever the outcome of the EU inquiry, it’s clear that sovereign nations will be as much in the line of fire on international tax avoidance as the companies which they wish to attract to their shores,” said George Bull, partner of Baker Tilly, a professional service firm.Ireland is particularly vulnerable to any move to clamp down on corporate tax planning. Successive governments have strongly denied that the country has become a tax haven through its 12.5 per cent headline rate on corporate profits. However, many companies pay less than that.Michael McGrath, Ireland’s opposition finance spokesman, said: “It has been clear for some time that many other European countries have viewed Ireland’s success at attracting multinationals with considerable envy. Our competitors will hope that today’s announcement is the start of the unravelling of our ability to secure multinational investment.”The existing rules are so vague that companies can basically do as they likeThe commission offered some assurance to the Irish and Dutch governments on Wednesday. It said only a “limited” number of tax rulings issued in Ireland related to transfer pricing arrangements.As for the Netherlands, the commission had certain concerns about the ruling between Starbucks and the tax authority but said the Dutch assessments generally appeared to be thorough. It added: “The commission therefore does not expect to encounter systematic irregularities in tax rulings”.But it gave no such assurance for Luxembourg. The Grand Duchy failed to provide all the information investigators requested. As a result, the commission launched “infringement proceedings” against it that could result in a fine.Tax experts said the commission’s investigation was likely to be difficult, as questions over transfer pricing were complex and rarely produced clear-cut answers.“The existing rules are so vague that companies can basically do as they like” on transfer pricing said Jim Stewart, a professor at Trinity College Dublin.Bill Dodwell of Deloitte, a professional services group, said companies were unlikely to be concerned by the commission’s move if their arrangements were in line with standard transfer pricing principles.But if the commission decided to looked into Luxembourg rulings more widely, there would be more widespread concern, particularly if there was any chance that the companies would have to repay their tax savings.At a press conference, Mr Almunia, stressed that the investigation was just a first step and the net could be cast more widely.
250;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;Coronavirus creates new priorities for consultants;Deals have dried up in emerging markets. Now the focus is on helping businesses survive the pandemic;Suddenly the music has stopped for dealmakers. Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”
251;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-06-11T14:24:10Z;Brussels opens tax probe into Apple, Starbucks and Fiat;;Brussels ratcheted up the global crackdown on tax avoidance by multinational companies on Wednesday by launching an investigation into whether three EU states were offering improper tax breaks to companies including Apple and Starbucks.The European Commission said that an in-depth probe would consider the tax affairs of three companies: Apple in Ireland, Starbucks in the Netherlands and Fiat Finance and Trade, the financial arm of the Fiat group, in Luxembourg.Joaquín Almunia, the EU’s competition commissioner, stressed that the investigation was just a first step and the net could be cast more widely in the pursuit of “aggressive” tax avoidance.“In the current context of tight public budgets, it is particularly important that large multinationals pay their fair share of taxes,” he said.The commission is scrutinising the companies’ “transfer pricing” arrangements, which determine how their taxable profits are allocated between countries.Transfer pricing, which refers to the prices charged for goods and services provided by one part of an international group for another, is supposed to use market prices, calculated as though the goods and services were sold to a third party. Brussels said the calculations in the three cases it is probing raised concerns “they could underestimate the taxable profit”.Brussels does not have direct authority over national tax systems but can investigate whether certain advantageous fiscal regimes would constitute unjustifiable state aid to companies. In that case, Mr Almunia explained that the EU could seek both to close the tax loophole and seek funds back, making a “decision on recovery”.Both Ireland and the Netherlands said they were confident that there had been no breach in state aid rules.“Ireland is confident that there is no state aid rule breach in this case and we will defend all aspects vigorously,” the finance ministry said in a statement. “We will now turn to providing our detailed, technical legal rebuttal to the commission’s position and if necessary will defend our position in the European courts.”Apple also said it had been cut no special exemption, adding: “Apple pays every euro of every tax that we owe. Since the iPhone launched in 2007, our taxes in Ireland have increased tenfold.”Explore our global tax map and compare rates in key countries around the worldIreland is particularly vulnerable to any move to clamp down on corporate tax planning. Successive governments have strongly denied that the country has become a tax haven through its 12.5 per cent headline rate on corporate profits. However, many companies pay less than that.The US Senate Committee has claimed that Apple has paid only around 2 per cent on some profits from its global operations routed through Ireland. Despite denying that Apple had claimed a “special rate”, the Irish government has since taken steps to close that loophole.Jim Stewart, an academic at Trinity College Dublin, argued in a recent paper that a central feature of US multinationals’ tax strategy in Ireland was that, though the Irish operations were incorporated in Ireland, they were not regarded as being resident in Ireland for tax purposes.The finance ministry said that Ireland’s tax ruling system was not statutorily based. “Like other tax administrations in other countries, the Revenue Commissioners, in certain limited circumstances, operate a system of non-binding advance opinions where companies can seek advice on the correct application of the law in their self-assessment tax filings.” It said the facility was “open to all taxpayers, including companies, large and small.”The FT explains what makes the Netherlands so attractive to companies that want to cut their tax billStarbucks said in a statement: “We comply with all relevant tax rules, laws, and OECD guidelines and we’re studying the commission’s announcement related to the state aid investigation in the Netherlands.”The commission also launched “infringement proceedings” against Luxembourg on Wednesday, complaining that the Grand Duchy – unlike Ireland and the Netherlands – had only provided a “limited sample” of the documents required for its tax investigations.Luxembourg declined to comment.Additional reporting by Tim Bradshaw and James Fontanella-Khan
252;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-05-20T16:31:42Z;Conscience and the business of addiction;It is easier to make money from people who have psychochemical dependency on a product;"For the cynical entrepreneur, the perfect business is one that sells a legal, high-margin, addictive product. To my knowledge there are only three such industries: coffee, alcohol and tobacco. Each offers challenges, opportunities and moral dilemmas.Coffee is certainly the least harmful of the three. It contains caffeine, which is mostly a beneficial drug – although the recent book Caffeinated: How Our Daily Habit Helps, Hurts, and Hooks Us by Murray Carpenter, points out some of the downsides. The industry is relentlessly consolidating, with newly merged groups such as Jacobs Douwe Egberts threatening Nestlé, the global market leader in the $81bn a year industry that commands a share of about 22 per cent.All the big players, from Starbucks to Nestlé, seem to make juicy operating margins, stretching from 18 per cent to 30 per cent on categories such as Nespresso capsules. These are much higher returns than typical for food and beverage companies. The industry has been transformed in countries such as the UK and the US, where customers are migrating to more expensive espresso coffee. As a participant in the retail segment, I’m astonished at how demand for higher quality coffee continues to rise.Alcohol is a much larger and more controversial trade. It is estimated to be worth $1tn a year globally. It gives considerable pleasure to hundreds of millions, but also causes a lot of damage. The Lancet, a medical journal, reckons it contributes significantly to one in 25 deaths, and the social costs amount to more than 1 per cent of gross domestic product in western nations. However, in Europe, which has the world’s highest consumption of alcohol per person, alcoholic drinks overall are in sharp decline. In Britain, for example, consumption has fallen 18 per cent in the past 10 years. I believe these behavioural changes are more to do with fashion, taste and new habits – including drinking better coffee and more beer and less spirits – than government intervention.I have been a licensed victualler for 30 years, and inevitably have mixed views on the issue. It provides relaxation and employment, and alcoholic drinks have been part of our culture for many hundreds of years. In moderation, some argue it is beneficial to health. But it can wreck lives and cause substantial collateral injury. Unfortunately, a small minority of drinkers consume a large proportion of the total alcohol drunk, and thereby suffer disproportionately: they are the alcoholics. Moreover, governments are hooked too: for example, receipts from alcohol duties in the UK are about £11bn a year.There has been considerable merger activity in the alcoholic beverage business in recent years. Big companies such as Anheuser-Busch InBev, SABMiller and Diageo now dominate the market. Distilling is certainly lucrative: Diageo makes operating margins of more than 30 per cent. Brewing beer and producing wine are less profitable.Tobacco is the greatest villain of the trio. I have consciously avoided having anything to do with the cigarette business in my career. Smoking has essentially no redeeming features, and is the most addictive and deadly of all the legal activities described here. It is believed to kill almost twice as many people a year as alcohol, or 6m. Three companies have more than 60 per cent of the global cigarette market – China National Tobacco, Altria and British American Tobacco. The total business is worth about £500bn. All enjoy huge margins: for example, in 2013 Altria’s operating income was 33 per cent of sales. Of course, the western companies are also engaged in a related activity: defending against litigation. They are constantly battling lawsuits and, like the alcohol businesses, face steadily declining markets in developed nations but growing ones in emerging economies.Two facts are clear from the three principal industries selling addictive consumables: margins are high, and global consolidation is very advanced. Regulatory and ethical issues probably only enhance profitability for the incumbents. It is easier to make money from customers who have psychochemical dependency on your product than from those who possess discretion about their purchases.

253;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-05-20T16:00:42Z;Greencore to supersize its US sandwich offering;;Greencore, which makes most of Marks and Spencer’s sandwiches, is stepping up its expansion in the US through an increase in capital expenditure that could almost double the Irish group’s sales capacity there.The London-listed Dublin-based group is investing $35m in a new sandwich factory in Rhode Island, New England, to capitalise on US like-for-like sales growth of 25 per cent in the six months to March 28.A number of other, smaller US investments will boost sales capacity from $350m currently to a potential $600m by the end of 2015. Greencore’s biggest US customers are Starbucks and 7-Eleven chains.Patrick Coveney, chief executive, said: “The US will then represent a lot more in contribution to revenues” than the current 15 per cent. But he emphasised the group’s commitment to the UK with a £30m investment to expand a Northampton factory.“Our strategy of focusing on the food-to-go market is working well in both the UK and the US,” he said.Damian McNeela, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said: “Greencore remains well positioned to capture the growth from the structural shift to increased consumption of convenience food in the UK. In addition we see good revenue and profit growth being delivered from its investment in the US.”Greencore is Britain’s biggest sandwich maker, with a 37 per cent market share. It operates in the convenience-food sector that has bucked the sluggish food grocery market trend. The company supplies most of the big retail chains.Mr Coveney was speaking as the FTSE 250 group, which has a market value of £1bn, reported strong underlying trading, but a 34 per cent drop in headline interim pre-tax profits to £8m.The headline figure was dragged down by exceptional losses totalling £12.6m. Of this, £10m represented the cost of restructuring the US business while a £5.8m impairment charge was on the £11m sale to a management buyout of Ministry of Cake, which supplies chocolate fudge cakes to outlets including Pizza Hut and Hard Rock Café.Underlying pre-tax profits of £30.7m were 21 per cent up, while sales rose 8 per cent to £619.8m. The operating profit margin expanded 0.3 percentage points to 6 per cent.“Greencore has delivered a good first-half result,” said Nicola Mallard, analyst at Investec. “There is good momentum into full-year 2015 with new business wins.”The shares, which have more than doubled over the past year, jumped 9 per cent in mid-afternoon London trading to 269.80p.
254;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-04-30T23:57:54Z;After 15 years at Starbucks, Ben Packard takes up protecting nature;The coffee chain’s former responsibility chief has made switch into conservancy;"“The determination is unbelievable,” says Ben Packard. He is referring to one of the photographs decorating his Seattle office, home to The Nature Conservancy’s Washington State chapter. The image is of a salmon battling upstream to its birthplace, where it will spawn and die.“I’ll never lose my sense of marvel and awe at that species and the journey it makes,” he says.Mr Packard’s working day might not involve the immense physical struggle of the salmon, but he is on a steep uphill journey of his own – learning the workings of TNC, one of the world’s top conservation non-profit organisations, having recently left Seattle-based Starbucks, one of the world’s largest retail coffee chains.After 15 years at Starbucks – starting in 1998 as environmental affairs manager and finally leading the company’s global responsibility strategy – Mr Packard has said goodbye to the corporate world.Still, the break is not complete – as TNC’s director of corporate engagements, he will be developing relationships with companies to spread adoption of environmentally sustainable business practices.In his new job, Mr Packard must adapt to the way TNC is structured – as a collection of chapters in different locations.At Starbucks, he sat at a desk with his team surrounding him. Now, from his base in Seattle, he manages colleagues who are scattered across the globe.“It demands a very fluid way of working virtually,” Mr Packard explains. “People meet me on the phone and we jump right into meaty conversations.”Yet while all this is new to Mr Packard, in some ways, his entire career has led him to a job focused on conserving nature.As a teenager who spent summers amid the pristine mountains and lakes of New York’s Adirondacks, he recognised the importance of protecting the natural world.So after graduating from college “with a passion for environmental issues but not really knowing how to apply myself”, he started working with an organisation in Seattle that helped graduates find environmental jobs.However, it was his next move that really opened his eyes to the role the private sector can play in promoting environmental sustainability. The position was at a public-private commission in Seattle exploring how to create local markets for recycled materials.The commission showed him the power of collaboration by bringing together law firms and government agencies, venture capitalists and local manufacturers.“Something started to go off and I thought: ‘Wow, the private sector is the solution here.’”As he warms to his topic, it becomes clear Mr Packard is also drawn to sustainable business because “it appeals to a pragmatic and execution-driven aspect of my personality, which is to connect the dots and make things happen”.Later, at Starbucks, he would take over the company’s work to develop ways of recycling more of the 4bn cups it used for drinks every year.Starbucks has often been on the receiving end of activist anger about everything from the amount of paper wasted in its cups to the genetically modified organisms in the feed of cows that produce its milk.However, before the coffee chain appeared on Mr Packard’s horizon, he “needed to understand the language of business and figure out how to apply this in a strategic way in the mainstream”, as he puts it.University of Washington offered a course that “looked at the environment as a strategic issue for business to manage, which in many ways was ahead of its time”, says Mr Packard.Before graduating, he came across an opening at Starbucks for an environmental manager – at the time, it was one of just two with the word “environment” in the title.But given Starbucks’ rapid expansion and a corporate culture that placed a strong emphasis on sustainability, Mr Packard saw the potential to shape the company’s activities.“It felt there was so much room to grow and I had so many opportunities,” he says, adding: “I knew there was something incredibly appealing about the aspiration of the company.”Over the years, Mr Packard watched as his department expanded almost as rapidly as Starbucks itself.But by the summer of 2012, he had an “itch” to try something new. He left Starbucks to travel with his wife and three children before they grew up.Back in Seattle he joined TNC, though his old employer is never far away. On his commute, Mr Packard often stops to pick up some coffee. And where does he buy it? At the store in Pike Place Market where in 1971 the very first Starbucks opened.——————————————-Career ClipsWho strongly influenced you?Dave Olsen, one of the founders of Starbucks, once asked me: “Do you want to be right, or do you want to be effective?” I think about that a lot, because to be effective, you have to adopt different behaviours. To be right you just continue thinking what you think is right. The willingness to listen and the courage to see another perspective is central to effectiveness.What advice would you give those wanting to work in your field?Follow your instincts if you are passionate and curious about an issue. Gain experience and perspective, but take chances in multiple sectors to see where you fit in.What was your most interesting business trip?In 1999, I took a trip with a guy from Conservation International to Chiapas [Mexico], to the Sierra Madre. Being on the ground, understanding on a community level what our work really meant, was very emotional and intense. We took a hike on our last day and spent the night at a ranger cabin. It was unbelievably beautiful. And that appeals to another side of me; I also like to spend time in the wilderness.——————————————-On the DeskBen Packard knows his coffee and his coffee cups – and after a 15-year career at Starbucks, his choice of brew still comes from the Seattle chain.It’s usually two cups before lunch: a cup of Kenya from a French press made at home with the chain’s coffee and then a bought-in split shot Doppio (two shots of espresso, one decaf) later in the morning, he explains.In between, on his way to work at The Nature Conservancy, he stops at the Seattle store where the first Starbucks opened 43 years ago.He drinks his coffee from a reusable cup. It is little wonder – at Starbucks, packaging was a dominant concern.The company had hoped that it could increase the number of drinks it served in reusable cups to one in four, but had to lower that target drastically – to one in 20 – in the goals it set itself for 2015.It was Mr Packard’s job to explain why.Even though one in five customers stays at the shop, few of them opt for ceramic mugs. Promising discounts to those who bring their own cups appears to hold greater potential for the coffee chain.Even so, ordinary customers seem to care about recycling more than reuse.But judging from the cup on his desk, Mr Packard counts as no ordinary Starbucks customer."
255;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Pfizer, AstraZeneca and the UK as an offshore tax base;;Pfizer has finally made a public announcement of its interest in AstraZeneca. One of the main points of the deal, it turns out, is tax inversion – turning Pfizer into a UK-domiciled company.As the FT reported last year, buying an overseas company in order to lower the tax burden is becoming quite a trend for US companies. Valeant and Actavis have been in the lead and the trend is spreading to Big Pharma, if Pfizer has its way.Pfizer is making the most of this aspect of its proposed takeover of AstraZeneca, in order to play down the reality that it would be a US takeover of a UK company. Its statement says:“The transaction, if consummated, is expected to result in the combination of the two companies under a new U.K.-incorporated holding company. As a global corporation, Pfizer would expect the combined company to have management in both the United States and the United Kingdom, and to maintain head offices in New York and list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.”Under US tax law, Pfizer cannot return its overseas cash pile of $63bn to shareholders without paying tax on it. That has given it a strong motive to find an overseas deal to spend the money on. As a UK-domiciled company, it would not face the same problem in future.A combination of trapped overseas cash (General Electric’s cash hoard of $57bn is one reason for it to acquire Alstom of France) and tax inversion is making European and Canadian companies look attractive and cheap to US companies, so more deals are likely.From a UK perspective, the Pfizer approach to Astra is ironic in view of the political furore over companies such as Google and Starbucks not paying enough UK corporation tax. Starbucks plans to move its European base from the Netherlands to the UK to quell criticism.Now, it appears that Pfizer wants to treat the UK as an offshore tax base, not only for corporate tax purposes but because of its tax breaks for research and development. It notes these in its statement:“In addition, the United Kingdom has created attractive incentives for companies to manufacture products and maintain and protect intellectual property, and we have seen that capital and jobs have followed these types of incentives.”It will be interesting to observe the political reaction is to a British/Swedish company possibly becoming a low-tax vehicle for a US enterprise.
256;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-04-25T18:42:55Z;Starbucks UK sales fall for first time after tax furore;;Starbucks reported its first-ever drop in UK sales last year after the chain of coffee shops was criticised by MPs over the amount of tax it paid.Sales in Starbuck’s UK division fell from £413m to £399m for the year to September 29 as the coffee chain cut the number of lossmaking stores in the country.The imbroglio over the amount of tax the coffee chain paid came to a head at the end of 2012, when Starbucks voluntarily agreed to pay £20m to the British taxman.Starbucks took the step of moving its Europe headquarters from the Netherlands to the UK following the outcry. About half of the coffee chain’s European stores are based in the UK.Starbucks reported last year’s drop in UK revenues – which lag behind the parent company’s results by six months – alongside rising sales in its US coffee shops for its fiscal second quarter ending in March. The stronger quarterly US sales prompted the coffee chain to raise its 2014 profit forecast.The Seattle-based company said it expected full-year earnings per share of $2.62 to $2.68, up from a previous forecast of $2.59 to $2.67. Wall Street analysts are calling for earnings of $2.66 a share as Americans buy more croissants and breakfast sandwiches to go with their Starbucks lattes, lifting sales growth at US coffee shops.“The strong momentum we have created in the first half of the year, combined with our robust pipeline of innovation, give us confidence in our ability to meet our fiscal 2014 growth targets,” said Scott Maw, chief financial officer.Sales growth at US stores accelerated in the fiscal second quarter, which ended on March 30, despite an unusually harsh winter in much of the country that Starbucks said led to more store closures and disrupted opening hours than it had ever experienced.Like-for-like sales at US stores open at least 13 months rose 6 per cent, beating Wall Street estimates of 5.4 per cent. Growth had slowed to 5 per cent in the final months of 2013, which Starbucks blamed on more consumers turning to online shopping in the holiday season.The sales increase reflected a 3 per cent rise in ticket price and 2 per cent growth in transactions.“Food was the single largest driver of comparable sales growth in the second quarter,” said Troy Alstead, chief operating officer. He said food contributed 2 percentage points of growth, compared to a previous trend of about 1 per cent.Starbucks is rolling out new baked goods from La Boulange, a bakery it bought in 2012, at all its US stores. Many of the offerings are priced higher than the pastries they replaced, which Mr Alstead said contributed to the higher tickets. “We’re selling more items and we’re selling more at higher prices,” he said.About a third of purchases at US shops include food, so the company thinks it has room to persuade more customers to try the new items. Mr Alstead said food purchases have gone up at locations where La Boulange products have been introduced.Starbucks is also looking to boost its food and non-coffee offerings at other times of day. It plans to test new lunch items in the coming months and roll them out more broadly next year, using the La Boulange breakfast launch as a model. About 3,000 shops, mainly in the southern US, will start serving cold carbonated drinks made in-store this summer.“There is a much larger prize here and we’re willing to go after it,” Mr Alstead said.He said the company had seen “great results” from offering beer, wine and food in the evenings in a small number of stores, and would begin to expand that programme “in a disciplined way over multiple years”.Net profit grew 9.4 per cent to $427m, or 56 cents a share, from $390.4m, or 51 cents a share, a year ago. That was in line with analysts’ expectations and a penny higher than the company’s forecast in January.Revenue was up 9.1 per cent to $3.87bn from $3.55bn, compared with Wall Street’s estimate of $3.95bn.Global sales rose 6 per cent, better than the 5.4 per cent analysts had forecast, but lower than the 7 per cent growth reported in the previous quarter.Starbucks shares rose 1.5 per cent to $72.15 in after-hours trading in New York.shannon.bond@ft.comTwitter: @shannonpareil
257;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Starbucks relocates European headquarters to London;;The Treasury’s efforts to attract multinationals to Britain received a boost on Wednesday when Starbucks, the coffee company, announced it was moving its European headquarters from the Netherlands to the UK, where it faced a row over tax avoidance in 2012.Starbucks is the latest company to move its corporate HQ to Britain, in the wake of reforms of the tax system designed to make it more competitive: publishing company Informa, this week confirmed its plans to move to the UK, and there have been similar decisions from advertisers WPP, UBM, a media group, Aon, an insurance broker, and two oil services companies, Rowan and SeaDrill.Stella Amiss, a partner at PwC professional services group, said up to 100 companies were looking to move activities out of the Netherlands and elsewhere.The world’s largest coffee shop chain said the move, due to be completed by the end of 2014, would mean it would pay more tax in the UK. “The net effect will be largely neutral, and our global effective tax rate will remain about 34 per cent.”It stressed the primary motivation was to “be better able to oversee the UK market, where more than half our European stores . . . are located”.Kris Engskov, president of Starbucks Europe, Middle East and Africa, said: “London is the perfect place to grow our European business.”The UK company, which is making voluntary corporation tax payments, has piled up about £150m of tax losses that would normally be offset against taxable profits before it made tax payments.But moving its headquarters to Britain will help it become profitable more quickly because it will receive royalty payments for rights such as the brand and trademarks. In the year to last September, these payments to the Dutch holding company totalled €92.1m.Starbucks, which opened its first European outlets in 1998, has been a target of political and public ire in recent years, after Reuters reported that it paid only £8.6m in UK corporate tax between 1998 and 2012.In 2012, its executives, along with counterparts from Google and Amazon, were involved in heated exchanges during hearings before MPs on the public accounts committee.Starbucks said at the time it was “an extremely high taxpayer” globally and acted “to an ethical” as well as a legal standard. It blamed its low corporate tax payments on overexpansion. In 2012, it committed to pay £20m over two years, even if it made a loss.This move speaks for itself. London is the perfect place to grow our European businessMargaret Hodge, the Labour MP who chairs the public accounts committee and a fierce critic of companies operating in the UK that pay little or no tax, gave a “cautious welcome” to the move but expressed doubt it would make “any great impression” in terms of jobs or tax contributions.“We will have to see over time whether this announcement really has any substance or whether it’s primarily about appearance,” she said.As part of the HQ move, some senior executives will move from Amsterdam to London.Starbucks also said on Wednesday it would open more than 100 outlets in the UK this year, creating 1,000 jobs on top of the 7,500 it already employs in the country. It also anticipates growth in other European markets.It will keep its roasting and distribution operations in Amsterdam, where it will continue to employ 200.Additional reporting by Helen Warrell
258;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-04-16T15:43:57Z;British coffee chain market heats up;;The British coffee chain market is increasingly competitive, as trends such as “flat whites” and single-origin beans sweep a nation buying an estimated 1.7bn cups of the drink a year.A boom in artisan coffee shops is both a “threat and a big opportunity” for chains such as Starbucks, according to Jeffrey Young, managing director of Allegra Strategies, a consultancy.The artisan shops, which offer speciality coffee and a distinctly local character, are educating consumers to demand higher quality coffee. Some are rapidly expanding, such as the Harris + Hoole, a family-run company now partly owned by Tesco.The competition has spurred chains such as Starbucks to raise their game, providing more training for baristas and introducing single-origin beans. Starbucks is “turning a corner” after it closed non-performing stores and invested heavily, Mr Young said.The availability of better quality brews has cemented the public’s enthusiasm for coffee. One in five of those who frequent coffee shops visit every day compared with one in nine in 2009, according to Allegra.Costa Coffee is by far the largest chain, with 1,670 outlets, followed by Starbucks with 790 and Caffè Nero with 560. Sales of the branded coffee chains grew 9.3 per cent last year to £2.6bn across 5,531 outlets, while overall sales by UK coffee shops rose 6.4 per cent to £6.2bn.
259;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Rescue remedy for vending groups;;The struggles of Europe’s two largest vending machine operators – weighed down by debt after being acquired by private equity groups – have highlighted the heightened competition among funds for distressed assets in the region.Vending companies have faced headwinds during the downturn as companies cut back on the number of machines for their employees as they slashed jobs. Consumers have also been turning to Starbucks and rival coffee providers.Switzerland-based Selecta and London headquartered Autobar now face the threat of breaching covenants on their debt this year.KKR and Blackstone’s credit unit GSO are among the new breed of so-called alternative lenders considering offering a rescue loan to Selecta to help refinance about €800m in existing debt, according to people close to the situation.The package would allow Allianz Capital Partners, Selecta’s private equity owner, to keep a majority stake, scuppering plans by distress debt investors including Strategic Value Partners to seize control by swapping their debt for equity in a restructuring.SVP, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, bought about half of Selecta’s junior debt at about 25 cents on the dollar, according to people with knowledge of the matter. It is one of the many US investors that have been ramping up efforts to buy distressed corporate debt at steep discounts in anticipation of a greater number of companies defaulting as banks, under pressure from regulators to cut assets, stop amending and extending loans.SVP took over German plastics maker Klöckner Pentaplast in 2012 from New York-based buyout house Blackstone after buying its debt.But other investors seeking to offer alternative lending solutions, including KKR and GSO, are disrupting those strategies. KKR in January agreed to inject €100m into Italian coffee vending machine operator Gruppo Argenta, mostly in the form of loans to help it reduce its debt load and secure cash for expansion.Allianz Capital Partners, KKR, Blackstone and SVP all declined to comment.Selecta’s attempt to find a lending partner is being made harder by the troubles of its main competitor, Autobar, however.The UK company, which was bought by CVC Capital Partners in 2010 for €1.2bn including €650m of loans, has started talks with its senior lenders to avoid a breach of covenants by June, according to people with knowledge of the situation.Unlike Allianz Capital Partners, CVC, which has written down its €600m investment and will probably have to inject cash into the business, has managed to keep distress funds at bay by requesting to approve any sale of debt on the secondary market. This requirement, however, ends if Autobar defaults.
260;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-04-04T11:07:26Z;International invaders shake up Australia’s home grown retailers;;In a country whose previously isolated landscape has been devastated by the introduction of rabbits, foxes and other invasive species, Australia is facing its latest incursion: foreign retailers.H&M opens its first store in Australia on Saturday as the Swedish fast fashion giant becomes the latest in a string of foreign retailers to move Down Under in a trend that is shaking up the domestic market.“Australia is strategically important for us. The people here are well travelled, and the country is an important destination for Asian tourists,” says Hans Andersson, H&M’s Australia manager.The influx of global retailers is transforming the high street where rents in Sydney’s prime shopping district are among the world’s most expensive. It is forcing a restructuring at local retailers, which until recently were insulated from foreign competitors due to geographical remoteness.But a relatively robust Australian economy – which has had 22 years of consecutive growth – has become a draw too strong to ignore, while large numbers of Chinese and Japanese tourists to the country have also attracted luxury brand retailers.“There is such pent-up demand from overseas retailers looking for retail space in prime locations that it is proving difficult for them to get into shopping centres,” says Alistair Palmer, head of retail at property company CBRE.H&M is following Zara, Hollister, Miss Selfridge, Victoria’s Secret and Topshop, which recently opened outlets and revealed expansion plans. Japanese retailer Uniqlo, UK retailer River Island and Banana Republic, owned by Gap, are all seeking a foothold in Australia.The Swedish fashion house spent three-and-a-half years identifying a suitable location for its first store in Australia and is still searching for properties in Sydney, Brisbane and Perth.Colliers, the real estate group, estimates international retailers plan to introduce 235 stores across Australia over five years, gobbling up 220,000 sq m of retail space. It is part of a wave of foreign investment which dates back to 2008, when Apple opened a flagship store in Sydney.“The hiccup in the world economy caused by the great financial crisis prompted international retailers to look beyond established markets in the US and Europe towards growth in Asia,” says Michael Bate, head of retail at Colliers International.China was the big draw for many retailers in the first phase of this expansion, with H&M setting up its first store in China in 2007 and Gap following in 2010. For retailers Australia is the next logical step.“Many retailers have got their logistics in place in the Asian region. It isn’t difficult to bolt on a presence in Australia to capture the 23m consumers here,” says Mr Bate.Deutsche Bank suggests Australia can be hugely profitable for new arrivals such as Inditex, which opened its first Zara store in 2011. In 2012, Zara’s six Australian stores made A$106.8m in revenues and earned A$18m profit. Zara’s profit margins in Australia were higher than the group’s average, according to research from company filings.A boom in online sales by Australian residents has lured others, including Topshop, Down Under.“We knew from the success of our online business that brand awareness was strong, and that’s always a great position to be in,” says Paul Gould, international director Arcadia Group, which opened its first Topshop in Melbourne in 2011.Marks and Spencer, mulling setting up stores in Australia, is building a big online presence by offering free delivery for purchases above £30.Almost a quarter of the A$14.7bn online purchases made last year by Australians were from international retailers, most on offshore websites that do not charge local sales tax on items under A$1,000.Australian retailers are lobbying the government to tighten the tax rules, while a recent dip in the value of the Australian dollar has slowed the pace of overseas online sales.David Jones and Myer – Australia’s best-known department store chains – have been hit hard by overseas competition, a key factor in Myer’s decision to propose a A$3bn merger.“We’re seriously considering it,” says Paul Zahra, chief executive of David Jones.“[Australian] retailers got lazy and complacent. Consumers simply got fed up with being treated like mushrooms in a dark room.”He blames the longer-term surge of the Aussie dollar to record highs and the ability for consumers to avoid sales tax for soaring overseas online sales.Some well-established local retailers such as Brown Sugar, Fletcher Jones and Snowgum have been forced into receivership and Billabong International, the surfwear company, has similarly endured a dire few years.“Our retailers got lazy and complacent,” says Nancy Georges, founder of Magnolia Retail Marketing Solutions, a consultancy. “Australian consumers simply got fed up with being treated like mushrooms in a dark room. They moved online or went to the new international outlets.”But not every foreign invader is successful. Coffee chain Starbucks, which arrived in 2000, closed 61 of its 84 Australian stores in 2008 due to slack sales and a local love of European-style coffee.Local competitors such as Premier Investments, which owns the Just Jeans and Smiggle brands, are also upping their game. Last week it opened its first Smiggle store in the UK, and posted a 12 per cent increase in profits to $52m for the first half of the year.“It’s up to H&M and Uniqlo to prove that they can actually do it [in Australia],” says Mark McInnes, chief executive of Premier Retail. “That being said, we’re not taking them lightly.”
261;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Bottled iced coffee comes in from the cold;;"It is a quick fix for the coffee purist. High-end US coffee boutiques are rushing to market with bottled cold drinks that satisfy connoisseurs’ cravings for caffeine.As Americans drink more iced coffee and become more interested in premium beans, shops like Silicon Valley’s Blue Bottle Coffee and Portland, Oregon’s Stumptown are breaking into a market pioneered by Starbucks’ bottled Frappuccino, which dominates 80 per cent of bottled coffee sales.Nearly a quarter of coffee at US restaurants and coffee shops was ordered on ice last year, according to Mintel, up from 19 per cent in 2009.“Interest in iced and frozen coffee is not only accelerating, but is now transcending a summer-only appeal,” the consumer research firm said.It has also powered sales of bottled coffee at grocers and convenience stores, up 69 per cent over the past five years to $1.8bn in 2013, according to Euromonitor International. While that is just 2 per cent of the non-alcoholic drinks market, bottled coffee is growing faster than anything else in the category, including energy drinks and tea.Enter the so-called “third wave” of independent coffee houses, which have taken the taste for better coffee popularised by Starbucks and turned it into the quest for the perfect cup. They pay exacting attention to origin, roasting style and brewing to bring out the subtleties of different beans.Thirty-four per cent of Americans told the National Coffee Association this year that they drink gourmet coffee every day, up 10 percentage points from 2010.Along the way, shops like Stumptown, Blue Bottle, Philadelphia’s La Colombe and Brooklyn’s Gorilla Coffee have helped promote cold-brewed iced coffee. Ground beans are mixed with cool water and left to soak for as long as 24 hours before being strained; the resulting concentrate is diluted with water and ice. The result is a potent drink that is less acidic and more caffeinated than traditional iced coffee, typically a regular drip coffee chilled and served over ice.“Cold brew is part of this general trend that’s focused on coffee as an artisanal product,” said Dana LaMendola, beverage industry analyst at Euromonitor. “There is an appreciation for coffee flavours more akin to wine, and the cold brew really brings it out.”Now cold brew is moving from coffee shops to grocery store shelves. Blue Bottle, backed by Google Ventures, Morgan Stanley and Instagram’s Kevin Systrom, is selling its cold brew, flavoured with chicory, milk and sugar, in school-style milk cartons. The drinks are planned to be available at Whole Foods and its 13 shops in San Francisco and New York. Stumptown, Gorilla and La Colombe are also offering bottled versions.“Ready-to-drink coffee is becoming an important channel for many of these third wave coffee shops to expand their consumer base outside of their local sphere,” said Ms LaMendola. “The wider distribution opportunities available in the ready-to-drink coffee market will help to increase exposure of other, smaller craft coffee players.”There is an appreciation for coffee flavours more akin to wine, and the cold brew really brings it outChris Campbell of Chameleon Cold Brew in Austin, Texas, said: “There is momentum in the market for this right now. Cold brew is super smoking hot.”His company was one of the first to sell a bottled cold brew concentrate, which must be diluted with water. In March it launched ready-to-drink bottled coffee, funded by a seven-figure investment from Houston-based Fortitude Capital.“It’s all about convenience and on-the-go. We were getting so much feedback from our customers: we love your concentrate, when are we going to get the [ready to drink]?” Mr Campbell said. The new drink will be initially available in Texas with distribution expanding to the east and west coasts in the coming months.The popularity of cold brew in cafés has boosted Chameleon’s business, Mr Campbell said, as coffee patrons become “educated” about the premium market.And, he added, “customers are getting conditioned to pay $3 or $4” for a drink, which allows him to command premium prices: $3.99 for a 10-ounce bottle. “We don’t have plans at this time to go toe to toe with Starbucks on a $1.49 beverage.”Even the Seattle-based coffee giant has shaken up its offerings, reformulating its line of ready-made iced coffees last year. The four varieties are less sugary than its bottled Frappuccinos, pointing to evolving tastes.“The flavour profile of ready-to-drink coffee is changing from sweet and mild, to strong and artisanal,” Ms LaMendola said."
262;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-03-23T10:46:28Z;Japan’s retailers play games with tax rise prices;Consumption tax rise comes at delicate stage in recovery;Japan’s revival under Shinzo Abe has pushed up inflation higher than base wages, so many people are feeling poorer. Is this a good time for taxes to go up too? Not really. Which is why the government is allowing retailers to act like they haven’t.Consider the price of a venti green-tea frappucino at Starbucks, now displayed at a tax-inclusive price of Y550 ($5.37). Under a law passed last October, retailers are allowed to show prices exclusive of tax until 2017 – as long as somewhere on the premises there is a reminder that tax is due. Starbucks is choosing April 1, the day of the consumption tax rise, to switch to the new regime, under which the frappucino drops to Y530 excluding tax (and Y572 including it). Thousands of supermarkets and chain stores will do likewise.Starbucks says it is switching for the sake of clarity, but many are bemused. “It’s ridiculous,” says Hiroshi Yoshikawa, a Tokyo University professor leading a panel advising the government on deficit reduction. Appearing to cut prices while actually increasing them is “cheating,” he says – “almost an insult to consumers.”The strong words are a measure of the anxiety surrounding the fiscal squeeze, which comes at a very delicate stage in Japan’s recovery. Few doubt the government needs to narrow its huge gap between spending and income, equivalent to about one-tenth of the economy. And most argue that targeting consumption – a stable 60 per cent of gross domestic product – is the best way to do it. Even at 8 per cent, rising from 5 per cent, Japan’s tax rate will be less than half the OECD average.But there are fears that the rise will be more than Japan can handle. Some are braced for a rerun of April 1997, when consumption taxes rose from 3 per cent to 5 per cent, causing a lull that was later exacerbated by the Asian financial crisis and a series of detonations in the banking sector.Certainly, Japan’s economy is looking stronger now than before Mr Abe became prime minister in December 2012, vowing to overturn more than a decade of mild but persistent deflation. Nominal growth has been positive for four quarters in a row and wages at bigger companies have been picking up too, thanks largely to higher bonuses and overtime payments.But Mr Abe’s “virtuous circle” of higher prices, wages and demand is not yet firmly established.Japan’s headline inflation rate of 1.4 per cent is in line with the US and Germany, at 1.6 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively. But much of Japan’s inflation is in goods, rising at an annual rate of 2.2 per cent, rather than services, at 0.5 per cent – suggesting that prices are being pushed up by the yen’s loss of purchasing power, rather than pulled up by stronger demand. There is no other reason for the price of a TV, for example, to be tumbling by about 13 per cent in the US and 8 per cent in Germany, while rising by almost 4 per cent in Japan.Wages, meanwhile, are struggling to keeping up. For employees of big companies, it has been a good Spring bargaining season, with economy minister Akira Amari saying the likes of Toyota and Hitachi have been “more accommodating than we had hoped.” But per-capita cash earnings – flat in 2013 – will not rise nationwide unless SMEs (which account for 69 per cent of all jobs) and temporary/part-time staff (36 per cent) also benefit. In aggregate, Mizuho reckons real disposable incomes are “bound to decline” in the fiscal year ahead, given the tax rise.As in 1997, there are signs of last-minute demand to lock in lower taxes on consumer durables, implying that a post-rise dip is inevitable. One retailer of household appliances in Gunma prefecture says that sales of air conditioning units have tripled in March from a year earlier, while fridges and washing machines have doubled.Hence the government’s offsetting fiscal spending package of Y5.5tn – more than the extra Y4.5tn it expects to collect in the next fiscal year in consumption taxes – including grants to the poorly-paid and homebuyers.And hence the permission to play games with prices. Allowing tax-exclusive pricing for the next three years – thus covering the second stage of the tax rise, to 10 per cent, scheduled for October 2015 – should “minimise the negative effect on consumer sentiment,” according to a senior official.If it works, it’ll be worth it.
263;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-03-20T17:19:00Z;Starbucks: Grande standing;US coffee chain needs to keep the quality of its growth high;"It’s hard to think of a number much nicer or rounder: $100bn. That’s the market capitalisation that Howard Schultz, Starbucks’ boss, wants for his company. It is now a dreary and asymmetrical $57bn. Should it be so hard to get there? Starbucks has doubled its market cap in three years. And Mr Schultz doesn’t need to rush. Having, apparently, taken forecasting lessons with an economist, he has set a target with no date attached.The increase in Starbucks’ market price has, unusually, not come from a ballooning valuation. While its price to earnings ratio is high at 27 it was already high, at 24, three years ago. It’s the earnings: in the fiscal year ending in October 2010, they were $1.23 a share. This October, they should be double that.How did it happen? Two drivers. First, productivity of the US company-owned (as opposed to franchised) stores. Even as the number of US stores has risen, revenue per store has grown at 6 per cent a year over three years; operating expenses per store have grown less than half as fast. Second, revenue from outside the shops – in grocery stores, restaurants and so on – has quadrupled, and now makes up 12 per cent of sales.The strategy for sustaining growth has four pillars: more sales outside of the shops; in US stores, sell more stuff that isn’t coffee (food, tea, booze); grow stores outside the US, especially in China; and do all the loyalty card/mobile payment stuff which all retailers are planning to do. All very sensible, but execution is all, especially in food and abroad, where Starbucks has consistently fumbled in the past.While management grinds it out, watch whether growth continues to come largely from productivity at the store level, rather than only from growth in the store count or, worse, from acquisitions. And watch how Starbucks invests. A company that has lots of room to grow puts its cash flow to work internally, rather than by growing dividends or buying back shares. Big targets are fine. Quality is what gets you there.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
264;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Activists force companies out of comfort zone amid consumer shift;;"Brewers wrapped themselves in the rainbow colours of gay pride instead of the emerald green of Ireland this week, as St Patrick’s day controversies underscored companies’ rising vulnerability to popular protests.Guinness, Heineken and Samuel Adams all scrapped their sponsorship of parades in New York and Boston under pressure from campaigners who had labelled the parade organisers as homophobes for banning gay and lesbian paraders from identifying themselves.The corporate climbdowns have a significance beyond the growing support for gay rights in the US. They show how it has become easier than ever for activists to pressure companies into policy changes. This pressure can come from organised groups, such as Greenpeace, a nemesis of the oil industry, or spontaneous critics like those who forced a tax U-turn in the UK at Starbucks.Greenpeace’s campaign against Shell in the Arctic shows how old-fashioned activist methods remain potent
See belowThe change is partly about social media and “clicktivism”. Twitter and Facebook are turbocharging critical messages as never before, and corporate executives are finding it harder than ever to control the terms of public discourse.But there are also fundamental shifts in what customers, suppliers and the rest of society expect from companies.Daniel Diermeier, a professor of management at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, says companies are being dragged into a new world of “private politics” that has two key features.First, activists, not governments, are leading the push for change. Second, companies cannot isolate themselves from public debate and are now expected to take positions on all manner of issues, even if they are only tangentially related to their businesses.“The things companies have to worry about are much broader than ever before. We now have higher expectations about what companies are responsible for,” Prof Diermeier says. “In the olden days they would have said: ‘I’m selling beer, I’m not going to get involved in gay rights’. But the expectations that companies get involved in social justice and policy issues are now much higher.”In the past three years, Facebook has introduced new rules to regulate gun sales, fruit producer Chiquita Brands has stopped using fuel from Canada’s tar sands and Starbucks volunteered to pay more tax than it owes in the UK to defuse allegations of tax dodging.Old-school politicians, however, have not been cut out entirely. British members of parliament channelled mostly uncoordinated online criticism of Starbucks into sustained pressure on the coffee chain. And this week in the US, 28 attorneys-general urged retailers including Walmart, Walgreens and Rite Aid to remove tobacco products from pharmacy shelves, following an example set by CVS Caremark.All this leaves companies feeling “rattled”, says Prof Diermeier, who notes that protests can emerge without warning or planning. “They are asking themselves nervously ‘are we ready?’ And the answer is often ‘no’.”Public relations advisers say companies need to remove the walls between the marketers, who traditionally talk to consumers, and the corporate affairs people who deal with non-governmental organisations, the media and governments, because in the outside world their messages blur into one.You’re constantly reading the tea leaves. Now the internet is the most colossal form of tea leaf reading ever made availableThen companies must be able to monitor how public opinion is changing and identify potential threats. “You’re constantly reading the tea leaves,” says Richard Levick, chief executive of a Washington public relations firm that carries his name. “Now the internet is the most colossal form of tea leaf reading ever made available.”The head of a New York PR business says companies need to start reacting like political campaigns. Some have noticed the celebrated grassroots organisation of Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns, realising that if they are under attack a band of loyal customers on social media could be an extra line of defence.Mitch Stewart, a veteran of both Obama races who went on to found 270 Strategies, a campaign consulting firm, says: “We’ve talked to a number of corporate interests who are desperate to build a better relationship with their consumer base.”But what position should companies take on the issues? “You’re always looking for symbols to be able to buy yourself goodwill with different communities,” says Mr Levick. “This is an easy one for Guinness. Withdrawing sponsorship? What does that mean? I don’t write a cheque. That’s pretty painless.”It is not, however, riskless. Campaigns about gay rights, guns and religion drag companies into the US’s culture wars, where public opinion is by definition polarised. While gay activists applauded the beer makers this week, the News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch took to Twitter to urge Irish people to boycott Guinness.Bill Donohue of the US Catholic League did the same, calling the companies bullies that “have nothing but contempt for the constitutional rights of Irish Catholics”.The era of digitally-enhanced protests is breathing new life into old phrases such as corporate social responsibility. It came to the fore in the 1980s due to controversies over environmental pollution, child labour and business investments in apartheid-era South Africa, although it was always more company jargon than a populist rallying cry.Labour and environmental problems have not gone away, but the difference today is that companies have less say over the responsibilities they want to embrace. They are increasingly being chosen by outsiders.Take Walmart. It has tried hard to promote its use of renewable energy, its work on women’s economic empowerment and its drive to source more products from US factories. But those efforts have been eclipsed by activists who have drawn more attention to allegations that Walmart underpays its US workers and buys clothes from unsafe factories in Bangladesh.Walmart rejects the charge of stinginess and said it was “neutral” on calls to lift the US minimum wage after Gap raised its own minimum rate. Walmart launched a plan to improve factory safety in response to a deadly fire in Bangladesh, but it spurned a parallel initiative developed by European companies with labour unions and activists.Its case points to the limits of activism. The closer protests come to challenging the core of a company’s business model, the less likely the company is to change. Walmart’s business is built on low prices and it depends on low costs, which means they are close to non-negotiable.Demanding that an oil company get out of oil is a similar uphill struggle, says John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK. But whether companies are being assailed on issues at the core of their businesses or the peripheries of their vision, he says they can no longer afford to stay silent.“If you’ve got no antennae, no values, no mission, then you will be at the mercy of whatever group wants you to do X, Y, Z,” he says. “If you want to be in charge you’ve got to . . . position yourself as a forward-thinking and progressive company, even if that’s difficult.”Greenpeace tests new waterThe fate of the Brent Spar oil platform is a reminder that activism against companies has been around for much longer than Twitter. In the 1990s Shell, the oil company, received British government approval to dump the rig into the North Sea.But that sparked vigorous opposition from Greenpeace, the environmental group, which in 1995 sent activists to occupy the rig and stoked a public outcry that eventually led Shell to drop its plan.John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, was part of that campaign and says it would have developed much faster today. “There would have been tens of millions of people online, on Facebook, Twitter. It would have had far more depth, far more spread … It would have been extraordinary to see that kind of thing play out.”Greenpeace’s more recent attacks on Royal Dutch Shell’s Arctic drilling programme have underlined the changes wrought by digital media. In collaboration with others, Greenpeace launched a widely noticed campaign with a fake press release, a fake website and a series of hoax ads in 2012 that Mr Sauven said were “parodying the nonsense [Shell] were talking” about safe drilling. This year Shell suspended the programme.Mr Sauven said that social media had speeded up the ways companies responded. “They are much more connected themselves, being able to understand or evaluate what is happening. And they are much swifter. If we launch a campaign now sometimes the company will be on the phone within 24 hours,” he said.But he stressed that activism was not solely about confrontation. Co-operation with companies is becoming increasingly important, not least because multinationals are concerned about environmental threats to their own future supplies of water, food and other raw materials. “None of us alone can solve a problem,” he said.“The kind of alliances and partnerships that need to be built are very different from what was happening 20 years ago.”"
265;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks seeks to double market cap to $100bn;;Starbucks wants to almost double its market capitalisation to $100bn, chief executive Howard Schultz said on Wednesday, even as the US coffee chain underscored the changing landscape facing retailers as more consumers shop online and by mobile phone.Mr Schultz gave no date by which he expected to hit his ambitious target, which comes as the company is expanding its digital business and looking to dominate the $90bn global tea market with the growth of Teavana, the brand it bought in 2012.“We are in the early stages, the nascent stages of our growth and development,” Mr Schultz told the company’s annual investor meeting in Seattle. With 20,000 stores in 64 countries, Starbucks has grown into one of the world’s most visible brands, but it wants to expand its reach in emerging markets such as India and China as US sales growth has slowed.It is also devoting more resources to mobile apps and customer loyalty cards, in an attempt to get more customers to buy its products at Starbucks stores, grocery stores and elsewhere.Mobile transactions now account for 14 per cent of US store sales, the company said, with 5m mobile payments made every week. In response to customer demand, Starbucks will begin testing ordering ahead by mobile app, said Adam Brotman, chief digital officer.“The growth of mobile payments in our stores is significantly bigger than the core growth of our business,” Mr Schultz said.More than a quarter of US store purchases are made with Starbucks cards, which function as gift cards and loyalty cards that allow customers to rack up points toward free food or drinks. During the 2013 holiday season, when fewer US consumers did their shopping in physical stores, Starbucks estimated that one in eight adult Americans received a Starbucks cards as a gift.You’d be hard pressed to find any retailer today who has a business of this scale, in relation to the fact that our average ticket value is $5.Mr Schultz has emphasised the “seismic shift” in retail towards ecommerce, and sees the cards as a way of driving customers back to Starbucks stores even as foot traffic at shopping centres – a traditional source of business from tired shoppers in search of a pick-me-up – has declined.“The challenge for any consumer brand, but especially a bricks and mortar retailer, is to make sure you are as relevant outside the four walls of your store as you are inside,” Mr Schultz said. Customers can now earn points when buying Starbucks products outside its coffee shops, which the company hopes will encourage them to, in turn, visit the stores to redeem points.Tea is another area Starbucks is eyeing for growth. Mr Schultz says he wants to “reinvent” the market for tea, which he described as “ripe for innovation”. Since buying Teavana at the end of 2012, the company has opened about 40 stores in US malls and plans to open another 20 this year.On Wednesday, Starbucks announced a collaboration with Oprah Winfrey, the US talk show host, to sell an Oprah-branded chai blend at Starbucks and Teavana stores in the US and Canada.Since November 2008, Starbucks’ market capitalisation has risen from $5bn to $57bn as its stock has climbed 948 per cent.“You’d be hard pressed to find any retailer today who has a business of this scale, in relation to the fact that our average ticket value is $5,” Mr Schultz said.Starbucks shares closed 1.8 per cent higher at $75.91.
266;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-02-12T23:33:26Z;Mondelez struggles amid tough environment for food groups;;Mondelez International’s fourth-quarter earnings and sales missed analyst expectations as the maker of Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate continues to struggle for growth amid tough economic conditions for food companies.Irene Rosenfeld, chief executive, promised to improve margins, which have been the target of criticism from activist investor Nelson Peltz.She said the company had been hit hard in emerging markets, which contributed about 40 per cent of revenues during the quarter. “Particularly in the Brics [Brazil, Russia, India and China] markets, we’ve seen a steady decline in GDP,” she said. “Though our categories there are growing nicely, they are very much tied to GDP.”“Near-term economic conditions will remain challenging,” she said, but added she was confident in Mondelez’s “potential to significantly expand margins and deliver strong top-line growth in 2014”.Ms Rosenfeld said the company expected organic net revenue, a measure that strips out the effect of acquisitions and other items, to grow about 4 per cent in 2014. The company forecast earnings of $1.73-$1.78 this year, against analyst expectations of $1.71.The Illinois-based company reported earnings of $1.77bn, or 42 cents a share excluding items, in the three months to December, compared with $569m, or 38 cents a share excluding special items, during the same period last year. Sales fell 0.1 per cent to $9.49bn.Analysts had expected earnings of 44 cents a share on sales of $9.57bn. Shares in the company fell 3 per cent, to $32.20, in after-market trading in New York.Mondelez’s headline earnings were boosted by a $1.6bn gain, net of taxes, after the resolution of a licence and supply dispute with Starbucks.Mondelez joins other food companies grappling with a tough operating environment. On Tuesday, ConAgra Foods, which makes Hunt’s ketchup, lowered its forecast for its fiscal year, while Kellogg last week cited difficulties in its core breakfast cereal category.But Mondelez has faced criticism that it has not lived up to the fast growth executives promised when it was spun off from Kraft in 2012, particularly from Mr Peltz.Last month, Mr Peltz said he would drop his campaign for PepsiCo to buy Mondelez after Mondelez added him to its board.Mr Peltz has long advocated lowering costs at Mondelez, and has criticised the company’s profit margins. He will stand for election to the board, which would expand to 12 members with his addition, at the annual meeting later this year.Analysts expect his involvement on the board will force the company to become leaner as it streamlines its supply chain and increase manufacturing efficiency that Mondelez last year said would result in $3bn in gross productivity savings over three years.
267;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-02-06T17:58:14Z;Margaret Hodge attacks UK coalition’s failure to tackle tax reform;;Margaret Hodge, the influential chair of Britain’s parliamentary public accounts committee, has accused the government of talking tough against tax-avoiding corporations but failing to take effective action to reform the tax system.The Labour MP has risen to prominence in recent years after her cross-party committee cross-examined the executives of companies such as Starbucks, Amazon and Google over the low levels of tax they pay in the UK.Ms Hodge said that the government had shown insufficient spine in tax policy despite David Cameron saying a year ago that tax-dodging businesses needed to “wake up and smell the coffee”.She cited recent changes to the regulations governing the taxation of certain types of profit inside multinationals as an example where she said the coalition had made tax avoidance even easier.The OECD has been critical of the UK, as the only jurisdiction in which government changes “have made it easier for people to export their profits to another jurisdiction ” she said in an interview with the Financial Times.Britain’s Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) rules have created a special low rate of corporation tax – about 5 per cent – on finance profits from overseas financing inside multinational groups.The government has defended the changes, saying they stopped the artificial diversion of UK profits, while removing a deterrent to being headquartered in the UK.Mr Cameron has denied that his efforts to increase the UK’s tax competitiveness are undermining a crackdown on tax abuses, saying: “If you want to keep tax rates low you’ve got to keep taxes coming in”.Ms Hodge is in Paris this week to meet the OECD Parliamentary group on tax matters where she will seek to join forces with overseas politicians to pursue the issue. The OECD is working on plans to dismantle structures used by Internet companies to route profits to tax havens as part of a shake-up of global tax rules.Her visit comes just as the French tax authorities are reported to have launched a €1bn claim against Google, although the French authorities and Google have declined to comment. The French tax authority raided Google’s offices in June 2011, in an effort to find evidence to back its claim that the company’s Irish profits on selling advertising to French clients should be booked in France.Ms Hodge said that Britain needed to be more “assertive” against Google and pursue similar legal avenues. “Every time we raise it with the HMRC we get a cautious and negative response,” she said. “I believe we should challenge their interpretation.”During the recent Davos gathering of senior global figures from industry and politics, one senior Treasury figure criticised Ms Hodge in an off-record briefing, saying the activities of the PAC were having an “impact” on inward investment.“We are trying to show we have one of the most competitive corporate tax regimes in the world, but the message is being sent out if you come here you will be exposed to this sort of criticism from Margaret Hodge and her committee,” the person said.The CBI, the employers’ group, said last year that global business leaders were confused by the mixed message from UK politicians. Two-thirds of FTSE 350 companies thought that the media and political debate on tax would reduce UK investment, according to a KPMG survey at the end of last year.The Treasury has sought to reassure companies that its recent changes to the corporate tax system would not be affected by the controversy over multinationals’ tax affairs.
268;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-01-29T23:35:23Z;Howard Schultz sets digital future for Starbucks;;Mobile payments, loyalty programmes and the shift to a digital wallet will be the focus for Howard Schultz as the Starbucks chief executive shakes up his senior leadership in response to what he called a “seismic shift” in shopping habits.Underlining the evolving landscape in US retail, Amazon is planning to introduce a checkout system on Kindle tablets for use by brick-and-mortar stores, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.At Starbucks, Mr Schultz will take on responsibility for the expansion of the US coffee chain’s digital operations, including electronic and mobile payments, gift cards and customer reward schemes, which he described as “undervalued assets”.Troy Alstead, chief financial officer, was appointed to the new position of chief operating officer, taking on oversight of day-to-day operations and retailing in physical stores.“There’s no question that it’s evolving to the point where your digital wallet is going to be the primary currency,” Mr Schultz said. “The consumer brand that’s going to win over the long term will do it only within the four walls of their store but in the digital space.”Mr Schultz has been increasingly vocal about the changing nature of US retail, which sees Americans shopping online instead of in malls or stores – meaning there are fewer chances for Starbucks to lure customers in for a latte.Overall foot traffic at US stores fell 14.6 per cent in November and December 2013 from the year before, according to ShopperTrak. During that period, traffic at Starbucks’ US stores rose 4 per cent, but its sales growth slowed in the final three months of the year, which executives attributed to the rise of ecommerce.“The seismic shift in consumer behaviour was not a December anomaly and will happen quickly,” Mr Schultz said.But he was bullish about Starbucks’ ability to not just weather the change but benefit from it through a greater emphasis on digital operations, which could generate revenue as well as encourage more customer visits to Starbucks shops. Customers loaded a record $1.4bn on to gift cards in the last quarter of 2013.Starbucks recently changed its loyalty programme to allow members to earn “stars”, or points, towards free food or drink not only when they shop at cafés but when they buy packaged coffee at grocery stores. Mr Schultz suggested the points may one day be used more broadly, saying: “there is a currency that relates to stars.”Mobile payments could be the company’s biggest opportunity. Starbucks is an investor in Square, the San Francisco-based mobile payments provider, and processes 5m mobile transactions a week, which it said was well ahead of any other national retailer.While a number of technology companies, including Apple, Google and PayPal, are eyeing mobile payments, there is not yet a standard platform for paying via smartphone.Mr Schultz said that the reshuffle was not related to any planned acquisitions, but added: “the payment space itself is a very attractive opportunity for our company given the digital assets that we have.”As part of the changes, the company’s regional group presidents, as well as Mr Alstead’s successor as chief financial officer – Scott Maw, currently senior vice-president of corporate finance – will now report to Mr Alstead, a 22-year veteran of Starbucks.Mr Schultz said the management shake-up was not related to succession planning.
269;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Mobile apps boost payment security;Mobile technology provides alternative to fraud-prone debit and credit cards;Today, any debit or credit card that carries the contactless symbol can buy you a coffee in Starbucks, a pen in Paperchase, socks in Marks and Spencer or a Big Mac. Such convenient single-tap payments speed up small-value transactions.Even better, a mobile phone equipped with Pingit – a peer-to-peer payment system launched by Barclays in 2012 – can do all of this and more. Later this year, UK customers of HSBC, Santander, Metro Bank and Nationwide will be able to use a mobile payment system, Zapp, developed by VocaLink, which operates the UK national payments infrastructure.The biggest fly in the ointment is security. Last year, some M&S customers said unauthorised payments had been made using their contactless cards. A survey by YouGov last December showed that 56 per cent of respondents did not believe NFC (near field communication) payments were safe.“Are there hypothetical ways that eastern European fraudsters can sneak into your purse at Tesco,” asks Dave Birch, a founding director of Consult Hyperion, a consultancy in secure electronic payments and a fellow of the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation, a think-tank. “Theoretically, yes. But there are no practical attacks.”The technical team at Consult Hyperion carried out tests using the M&S reader and concluded that customers must have rested their wallets on top of the device, since it could only be activated if the card was within 7cm.Losses due to fraud in 2012, according to the UK Cards Association, the card payments trade association, amounted to £388m, up 14 per cent on 2011. But just £14,000 of these were contactless transactions. Moreover, the increases in fraud are not from high-tech remote readers but from unsophisticated scams that persuade the gullible to hand over their cards to official-looking couriers.“I would never use my debit card, with its old-technology magnetic strip, in a shop or online – only in an ATM,” Mr Birch says. “The big picture is that mobile is far more secure than cards.”Barclays’ Pingit was launched for the 2012 Olympic Games in London. It has 2.5m users and more than £1m per day is transacted using it. You do not have to bank with Barclays to use it, and transaction limits are in the thousands of pounds, depending on the kind of account you hold.VocaLink’s Zapp works, like Pingit, over the Faster Payments system. “At launch [forecast to be in the last quarter of this year], we will have 20m users and 65 per cent of the market share of merchants,” says David Yates, chief executive of VocaLink.While Pingit’s ease of use is one its most attractive features, Zapp is likely to have heavier authentication protocols. “We are not going to dictate to the banks the trade-off between usability and security. It is up to them to strike that balance,” Mr Yates says.Pingit and Zapp are both examples of “push” payment systems, ultimately controlled by the payer, in contrast to direct debits, which “pull” payments from your bank account. “It reverses the system,” says Mr Yates, “and puts the payer in control.”Too many security questions and codes can be counterproductive. “Without wishing to be hyperbolic about it, these are transaction killers,” says Mr Yates. “No one can ever remember the passwords and people give up the will to live.“Instead, we have a situation where neither the consumer nor the biller nor the merchant give their details to each other. Their details are stored with the bank, but details are not passed anywhere through the system.”This method is known as tokenisation, says Mr Birch of Consult Hyperion. “When you buy something using your mobile, your phone will pass across something that’s not your real number, but a token and the shop will send a token back to your bank and the bank will pay.”In the future, security codes may be bypassed altogether. Apple’s iPhone 5s features Touch ID, a fingerprint identity sensor that allows users to buy from the iTunes or App stores. “We use biometrics in the Wealth business for caller identity,” says Steven Roberts, strategic transformation director at Barclays UK Retail Banking. “About 45-60 seconds of your voice is enough to give a confirmed identity match.”Barclays is also developing a cheque imaging application designed to speed up clearing times. Even though cheque volumes are decreasing by 12 per cent a year, says Mr Roberts, cheques still need to go to a clearing centre.“[After] telephone banking and internet banking, [mobile banking] is the real dawn,” says Mr Roberts. “I don’t doubt that mobile will take over in the medium term,” agrees Mr Birch.“At one end, you have a credit and debit card payment in the US still using a magnetic strip and authorising . . . with a signature,” says Mr Roberts, “right up to the other end, where you [have] a five-digit PIN and a biometric identifier.”
270;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2014-01-23T23:21:25Z;Starbucks’ US sales growth slows;;Sales growth at Starbucks’ US coffee shops slowed in the final three months of 2013 as more consumers stayed home and did their holiday shopping online.The chain’s shares rose in after-hours trading, however, as it reported better-than-expected profits in its fiscal first quarter to December 29 and boosted its full-year earnings outlook.Net profit rose 25 per cent to $540m, or 71 cents a share, from $432m, or 57 cents a share, a year ago. That beat analysts’ estimates of 69 cents a share. Revenues rose 12 per cent to $4.24bn, compared with Wall Street’s forecast of $4.29bn.The company raised its forecast for 2014 earnings per share of $2.59 to $2.67 from a previous range of $2.55 to $2.65.“For us the importance really comes as there are fewer people out in the malls and on the streets, fewer for us to capture to come in for a beverage,” said Troy Alstead, chief financial officer.Like-for-like sales at US stores open at least 13 months rose 5 per cent in the quarter. It was the second straight quarter of cooling US same-store sales growth, which rose 9 per cent in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and 8 per cent in the fourth quarter of the same fiscal year.“Holiday 2013 was the first in which many traditional brick and mortar retailers experienced in-store foot traffic give way to online shopping in a major way,” said Howard Schultz, chief executive, echoing a note he wrote to Starbucks store managers this month in which he said the company was “not immune” to the growing preference for ecommerce.“Traditional bricks and mortar retailing is at an inflection point,” Mr Schultz said on Thursday.However, he said that Starbucks’ digital assets, including online gift cards, “position us as one of the very few consumer brands with a national and global footprint to benefit from the seismic shift under way”.Consumers loaded $1.4bn on to Starbucks cards in the quarter, a 24 per cent increase.The company has been making changes to draw traffic to its stores, including adding locations of Teavana, the tea chain it bought in 2012, and rolling out a new menu of baked goods across its US coffee shops. The company said sales of croissants doubled at stores where a new recipe was introduced.Starbucks has also started selling homemade sodas in some locations and is testing carbonating coffee and tea drinks.Globally, same-store sales rose 5 per cent in the first quarter, down from 6 per cent a year ago and 7 per cent in the fourth quarter.Starbucks expects same-store sales growth to be in the “mid-single digits” in 2014, compared with 7 per cent in 2013.Analysts have been raising concerns over the deceleration in US sales, with Goldman Sachs citing its worries when it downgraded its recommendation on Starbucks’ stock from “conviction buy” to “buy” this week.Starbucks said it planned to open another 1,500 stores around the world this year, including 600 in the Americas.The shares rose as much as 1.5 per cent in after-hours trading.

The Thai noodle pots, honey soaked cashews and chocolate covered rice cakes have been stacked at the request of Julian Metcalfe, the company’s charismatic founder.Mr Metcalfe is best known as one half of the partnership, with university friend Sinclair Beecham, which launched the UK gourmet sandwich chain Pret A Manger in 1986. But today he wants to discuss the dynamic between him and his new business partner, Robert Jakobi, a 28-year-old former investment bank­er and hedge fund manager slightly more than half his age.No sooner has he sat down than Mr Metcalfe, wearing a pink scarf, white rugby shirt and black body warmer, is up again, grabbing packets and exuberantly extolling the contents like Willy Wonka on a health kick. “Everything about this product is beyond belief,” he says, pulling out a packet labelled Dry Seaweed Thins. “This is made of seaweed, but only seaweed in Korea is like this. It’s 22 calories. You may not like the taste but it’s selling so well, it’s beautiful.”Mr Jakobi, in suit and monogrammed pinstripe shirt, quietly org­anises tea.Although it is years since he step­ped back from day to day involvement in Pret, Mr Metcalfe has lost neither his interest in food – he has co-authored a new cookbook with 100 low-calorie recipes – nor his talent for creating a brand. Metcalfe’s Food Company was started in 2009 “as a hobby” to supply popcorn to Pret and Asian-inspired snacks to Itsu, his own fledgling sushi restaurant business.But in the past three years, since Mr Jakobi came on board, turnover has risen 30-fold to almost £10m.Much of this growth is down to persuading supermarket groups, such as J Sainsbury and Waitrose, to stock the Itsu and Metcalfe’s Skinny brands. In doing that, Metcalfe’s is copying a strategy pursued by other popular chains such as Starbucks, PizzaExpress and Nando’s. “We don’t need to spend much on marketing these because everyone knows the Itsu restaurant chain,” Mr Jakobi boasts. In fact, almost all its 41 outlets and two restaurants are in London.Now Metcalfe’s is planning overseas expansion, laun­­ch­ing its low carbohydrate, “good fat” products in Spain, Belgium, France and the Netherlands followed by the US, help­ed by the opening of Itsu outlets in New York later this year.Mr Metcalfe says no amount of time will undo his relationship with Mr Beecham. From one Pret shop, they built the chain for more than 20 years bef­ore selling a majority stake to private equity firm Bridgepoint Capital in 2008, having earlier sold a 33 per cent stake to McDonald’s.But it does seem as though he has traded in his former business partner for a younger model.It was Mr Jakobi who approached Mr Metcalfe four years ago. After developing a chocolate covered edamame bean snack business called Pod Bites as a sideline, he wanted to sell the idea to Mr Metcalfe. “I was working in finance for a hedge fund and I got the products into Harvey Nichols, Harrods and Selfridges,” Mr Jakobi explains. “I sent the products to Julian because I felt Itsu, with its Asian origins, would be a perfect outlet for the chocolate edamame.”Mr Metcalfe was impressed by Mr Jakobi’s education, which included a degree from Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, and wondered why he would be interested in creating a food start-up. He adds: “My brother went to Yale, my sister went to Brown and my son’s at Northeastern so I know about American universities and I know that I wouldn’t survive one single day at Wharton.”He offered Mr Jakobi a minority stake largely because he could not af­ford to match his hedge fund wage. “His salary was a third of the turn­over of the entire company. I wanted him to want equity and sure enough, he did. That showed me this was a man who wanted to build a business.”Also, Mr Metcalfe believes that the food industry in the UK suffers from having too many “bog standard” people running the big suppliers while bright graduates go into well paid jobs in financial services.Of the 18 full-time staff at Metcalfe’s, eight are Oxbridge graduates, and the average age is 26. “A lot of people have joined as interns and then we’ve taken them on full-time and they have risen up very quickly,” Mr Jakobi says. “Julian and I are big believers that if you’re good at what you do, you should be rewarded with more responsibility.”Mr Metcalfe interjects that only small entrepreneurial businesses can provide the innovation necessary to drive the food industry forward to pro­duce healthy, convenient and af­fordable food. “We’ve realised it’s the indecision in the food business which is giving us such incredible opportunity,” he says. “For big companies it’s hard to be really innovative.”The two men have organised their roles so that Mr Jakobi is managing director while Mr Metcalfe remains most focused on product quality, insisting at one point that his role at the company is not so much entrepreneur as head of research and development. “I need someone who trusts me and doesn’t say, ‘You can’t’,” Mr Metcalfe says about why he and Mr Jakobi get along.Mr Jakobi seems happy with this arrangement: “I give him complete freedom and autonomy to do all the product development and lead that side of the business and then in turn I run the supply chain, the sales, the finance, the budgets and the day-to-day side of the business.”Mr Metcalfe reaches back into the food pile and pulls out a box of the beans Mr Jakobi created, now with the Itsu logo and packaged in cardboard. “It had a certain beauty,” Mr Metcalfe says about how Mr Jakobi’s chocolate covered edamame beans first caught his eye, popping a couple in his mouth. “The shape and the size of the packaging was interesting and new and beautiful. The product inside was lovely and cute and delicious.“The whole thing together said to me that this person, whoever’s done this, has got attitude, they’ve got balls and they’ve got style.”Robert Jakobi on how the partnership took shape●Persistence paid off:
“I called [Julian Metcalfe] and left countless voicemails. I emailed and never got one reply. Most people would have given up chasing after a few calls and emails. I didn’t.”●Create space for each other: “It was just Julian and myself initially and he was more involved with Itsu and Pret . . . As we started to become bigger Julian got more involved and our roles became more defined. I focused on the day-to-day running and Julian focused on the product development and marketing. We complement each other.”●Listen and learn: “An established entrepreneur will have had a lot of success so the last thing they will want to see is someone who doesn’t listen to their ideas. We didn’t know each other before we met and I was a young 25-year-old with very little experience in the food industry. I had to win Julian over. It wasn’t easy.”"

It says that from 1991 to June 2013, the average annual rate was just 5.4 per cent.All well and good… except that it says AICM sees things differently. According to Fumisa, many of the companies which lease space from it – they include McDonalds, Starbucks and banks such as Santander and Scotiabank, as well as duty-free shops and craft stores – have been receiving letters from the airport encouraging them to sign new leases directly from January 1 rather than continuing to sub-let from Fumisa.Ruffo Pérez Pliego, Fumisa’s managing director, told beyondbrics that the airport was threatening not to renew access passes for those companies which did not comply and branded the airport’s stance “highly intimidating”. No one was immediately available at AICM for comment and its press chief did not reply to emailed questions.Now all this may sound like another installment of long-running ructions between AICM and Fumisa which have already brought the two parties to court to clarify parts of their contract (Fumisa says the rate of return part, however, has been upheld by courts and can no longer be appealed).But given that Mexico is now officially courting foreign investment in energy and infrastructure after a newly minted reform to open up a sector locked to state control for 75 years, a spat over contract security involving international investors suddenly doesn’t look look all that clever.Fumisa’s Pérez Pliego says AICM is riding roughshod over contracts and judicial rulings and, “This sends a very clear message to potential investors in infrastructure projects.”Happy New Year?Related reading:

273;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-12-16T12:01:56Z;Golden Flannel Day 4: COC spouting bull;;"Today’s prize is for a person, not for a word. It is awarded to a big-name CEO who in the course of 2013 has shown outstanding dedication to raising the jargon bar across all touch points.Last year’s Chief Obfuscation Champion was John Chambers at Cisco who wrote the following lines in a memo to staff “We’ll wake the world up and move the planet a little closer to the future” – thus managing to be both banal and grandiose all at once.This year there are four strong contenders for 2013 COC. I think my favourite is the last, though as I had never heard of him before, I’m not sure that he qualifies. Please tell me what you think. Your vote counts.Howard Schultz is a natural in this category, as the Starbucks CEO never says one simple word when he could say 35 complicated ones instead. The following was his reply to an analyst who asked if Starbucks was planning any acquisitions: “I would say that we have enough to digest in the near-term, and there’s nothing candidly in our sightline that would suggest that we’re involved in engaging anything that we’re going to acquire.” There’s not much candidly in my sightline that beats that.Irene Rosenfeld deserves the prize for her title alone. The CEO of Mondelez describes herself on the website as “CEO of Joy”; her description of how the company’s highly processed Oreos etc get made, takes the biscuit. “Although our same delicious globally renowned brands are still joyfully crafted by the same world-class people, it’s important to remember that much more has changed than the Mondelēz International name…” and so on. Enjoy.Tim Armstrong’s ability to spout guff is also pretty remarkable. Here is a sentence taken at random from an investor call with the AOL CEO: “We are the first player to have fully built out the barbell of advertising, deep marketing services on one side and programmatic technology on the other side, with both ends being connected by data and analytics and growing digital brands that humans love.”The problem with Armstrong is what happens when he stops talking guff. He got into trouble in 2013 for firing someone during a conference call in the plainest way:
“Abel, put that camera down right now.” Then, without taking a breath, he said, “Abel, you’re fired.” Later, in an email apologising for his bluntness, he reverted to guff: “At a human level it was unfair to Abel.” The implication being that at a canine or rodent level it was just fine.And finally, the little guy: Rob Stone, co-CEO of Cornerstone, explaining the decision to expand the ad agency into Europe. “As brands build out a world footprint, they look for the no-holds-barred global POV that’s always been part of our wheelhouse.” Not only is this meaningless, it is a four-way mixed metaphor too. Glorious."
274;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-12-02T17:30:08Z;Big companies in end-of-year bond rush;;Large corporate borrowers seeking to raise the last batch of funding for 2013 could sell close to $30bn in investment-grade bonds this week in the US, taking advantage of low borrowing rates and renewed appetite for high-quality corporate debt.Johnson & Johnson, the world’s biggest seller of healthcare products, Starbucks, the coffee shop chain, drugstore and pharmacy CVS Caremark and auto-lender Ally Financial led a flurry of investment-grade offerings in the US on Monday.The start of the month was also strong in Europe, where food giant Nestlé and Italy’s second-biggest bank, Intesa SanPaolo, raised funds in the euro and sterling markets.The rush of bond offerings comes after a sharp slowdown in activity in the US last week as markets remained closed for Thanksgiving holiday. But the pace is bound to accelerate in coming days as companies try to squeeze in as many debt sales as possible ahead of a capital markets shutdown towards the end of the month around Christmas.“When you consider all the holidays, the capital markets will be open effectively for only 15 or 16 days in December. For corporate borrowers, if they still have to come to markets, it is better to come at the start of the month,” said Adrian Miller, director of fixed income strategy at GMP Securities.Corporate borrowers and bond investors are also banking on the Federal Reserve maintaining its policy of easy money at its next policy meeting on December 18. A recovery in risk appetite among fixed income investors has helped pull yields lower since the central bank decided not to start tapering its monthly bond buying in September.The combination of low borrowing costs and strong demand for higher-yielding alternatives to top-tier government bonds has pushed corporate debt sales in the US to record levels.There’s a large group of investors mandated to buy only high-grade debtAverage yields on US investment-grade corporate bonds stood at 3.15 per cent on Monday, while those on US Treasuries were 1.24 per cent, according to Barclays indices.Global corporations have sold $1.05tn of high-grade bonds so far this year, compared with $1tn in the same period of 2012, according to Dealogic.Funds investing in investment-grade corporate debt saw inflows of $220m in the week ending November 27, according to RBS data. So far this year investors have poured $52.2bn in funds betting on the securities.“Money keeps coming in to high-grade funds even though yields on the bonds have already declined a lot. But there’s a large group of investors mandated to buy only high-grade debt,” said Mr Miller.In one of the week’s highlights, Johnson and Johnson is breaking a two-and-a-half-year absence from capital markets, offering at least $1bn in triple A rated bonds spread across several maturities.
275;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
276;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-11-28T00:02:29Z;Tax avoidance replaces bosses’ pay at top of concerns over ethics;;Worries about tax avoidance have shot to the top of public concerns about business behaviour, replacing executive remuneration by a wide margin, a study has found.The annual survey, conducted for the Institute of Business Ethics by Ipsos Mori, shows an improvement in the proportion of people who think business is behaving ethically, suggesting there may have been some recovery of trust lost after the financial crisis.However, the picture remains mixed because there has also been a rise in the proportion saying businesses are behaving less ethically now than a decade ago.Business ethics continue to dominate the news agenda, amid allegations that Royal Bank of Scotland defrauded companies by putting them out of business, of profiteering by energy companies and corporate governance failures at the Co-operative Bank.Asked whether business generally behaves ethically, 59 per cent of respondents said it did, compared with only 48 per cent in last year’s survey – bringing it back to a similar level to the 58 per cent recorded in 2011.However, there was an increase of seven percentage points to 35 per cent in the numbers of those who believe that business behaves less ethically now than it did 10 years ago.The findings show that people aged 55 and above are more likely to think that business is not behaving ethically than younger people.The study found that 37 per cent of respondents thought tax avoidance was the main concern that businesses need to address, compared with 30 per cent citing remuneration. This pushed remuneration out of the top slot for the first time in six years.The findings follow controversy over low tax bills paid by companies such as Amazon, Google and Starbucks. Executive pay has been less prominent in the media since 2012’s “shareholder spring”.The ability of employees to speak out about company wrongdoing was rated the third most significant concern at 22 per cent, with business attitudes to the environment and human rights coming in lower at 16 per cent and 15 per cent respectively.Philippa Foster Back, the IBE’s director, said: “These results could indicate that business has clawed back some of the public trust lost in the wake of the financial crisis. But confidence remains fragile with a year-on-year increase in those saying that business is less ethical than it was 10 years ago.”She added: “Tax is also now clearly a reputational issue and has risen very rapidly up the scale. Trust cannot be taken for granted.”The IBE was established in 1986 to encourage high standards of business behaviour based on ethical values.Six years on from the financial crisis, trust remains a leading issue for businesses. Sir Mike Rake, president of the CBI employers’ group, told the Financial Times in September that companies with enough cash on their balance sheets should start investing to help restore business’s bruised reputation.A group of well-known companies this week called for a greater diversity of business ownership structures to win back public trust, motivate employees and achieve sustainable growth.
277;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-11-27T07:29:14Z;China: less friendly to business, or just more mature?;;"Over the past year, Chinese state media has aired a string of critical reports targeting foreign companies’ business practices in China. The reports allege that Samsung and Apple’s warranties are too short, Starbucks is too expensive, and ice cubes served at a Beijing KFC are dirtier than toilet water.As Chinese president Xi Jinping seeks to steady the ship of state amidst slowing GDP growth and growing disillusionment – and as foreign multinationals increasingly rely on the Chinese market for profits – some observers are questioning whether China remains as friendly to foreign business at it once was.“Many are worried about a rise in commercial nationalism in China,” writes FT’s Beijing Bureau chief Jamil Anderlini in a new special report on doing business in China. Deng Xiaoping set the stage for Chinese economic growth in the early 1980s with his policy of “reform and opening up.” However, Anderlini observes that the Party’s new policy agenda focuses heavily on domestic reforms and lacks significant “opening up” to foreign investment.Policy headwinds besides, many foreign companies have little choice but to stick it out in China. The country remains a “must-win” market for global pharmaceuticals companies, writes Bee Lin Ang in a review of the problems facing China’s healthcare system. Adrian Sandiford reports that while growth for foreign luxury brands has slowed in the face of a crackdown on graft, the sector is still expanding. And despite barriers, Charlotte Middlehurst writes that foreign insurers see great potential in the Chinese market and new legislation may ease their entry.In fact, some of this year’s headaches for multinational companies may just be signs of China’s maturing economy and improved regulatory enforcement. The country’s burgeoning antitrust regime is becoming more active in regulating local and multinationals, including a record fine against six infant formula makers, most of them foreign, reports Wing-Gar Cheng. China’s banking sector is innovating as well: Simon Rabinovitch describes a Rmb1bn ($160m) investment product offered by search engine Baidu.Other articles in the special report fill out the picture of business in China today. I report on the ever-evolving fight against counterfeiting in China: improved regulation on the one hand, adaptive counterfeiters on the other. Lucy Hornby describes the business opportunities in cleaning up China’s air and water, dirtied by decades of headlong growth.

278;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-11-22T17:26:35Z;Acer: bringing back the boss;Latest in a series of founder comebacks;What goes around, comes around – including company founders. This week, struggling Taiwanese computer maker Acer reinstated Stan Shih as its chairman. It is nine years since the entrepreneur retired from the group he founded in the 1970s. And it is about three years since Acer, once the world’s largest notebook maker, began to suffer as consumers shifted towards tablets and spending on PCs declined. Red ink has dogged Acer since 2011: last quarter’s net loss was $450m.Recalling founders is a trend with encouraging precedents. Think Steve Jobs at Apple, or Howard Shultz at Starbucks. It is also one that seems to be in vogue. This year, Indian IT consultancy Infosys brought back long-time boss and founder Narayana Murthy as executive chairman, for example. On the buyout front, husband and wife team Michael and Xochi Birch reacquired their social network site Bebo for $1m, having previously sold it for $850m.So should investors feel a cosy glow when a company’s creator takes back the reins? Sadly, they are probably in a bad situation to start with. A founder’s return usually means that the business has hit big problems (although there have been cases, such as at food group Iceland, when a founder has stepped aside briefly for legal or other reasons). These difficulties may reflect poor executive planning or succession arrangements in the first place. The Apple board upheavals that saw Mr Jobs depart in 1985 were a case in point, leaving the company in the hands of a skilled brand manager yet shorn of priceless creative leadership.The good news is that a recalled founder tends to put the focus back on products and customers. Howard Shultz famously shut Starbucks’ outlets so as to retrain baristas after returning in 2008. Out went bagged coffee, in favour of freshly roasted. Starbucks’ shares, previously on the slide, have since risen eightfold. But there can be big challenges if sector dynamics have undergone a shake-up since the founder was last involved. Acer’s problems stem partly from too little investment in innovation and R&D. With dwindling cash, it is now one of a clutch of businesses trying to claw out returns in the PC/device space. Mr Shih has his work cut out.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
279;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-11-20T10:11:52Z;Burger King joins Everstone to open restaurants in India;;Burger King, the US-based hamburger chain, is planning to set up shop in India, joining a rush of Western fast-food companies plunging into a market seen as having huge long-term potential as a result of rapid social change.Burger King has formed a joint venture with the Everstone Group, an Indian-owned, Singapore-based private equity and real estate group, and together the partners will develop a strategy for rolling out the restaurants across India.Elias Diaz Sese, president of BK AsiaPac Ptd Ltd, said Burger King chose Everstone, founded in 2006 by two Indian veterans of Goldman Sachs, as its partner because of its “history, business acumen, and command of the massive and complex Indian market.”Burger King said the joint venture would work on developing the supply chain for the restaurants in the coming months, before rolling out the restaurants, though no details were given about where or when the first store might open.Despite India’s own deep-rooted culinary traditions, Western fast-food chains have been flocking to the country. A growing middle class and a youthful population, which has rising disposable incomes and is increasingly pressed for time, is seen as having a much greater appetite both to eat out and try new foods.India’s overall fast food market is valued at more than $12bn but is currently dominated by local independents making traditional Indian cuisine, while foreign brands account for about five per cent of the total market.However, chains such Domino’s Pizza, Subway, McDonald’s, KFC, and Dunkin’ Donuts, are all operating in the country, and the market for Western fast-food chains is expected to be worth around $1.2bn by 2016. Starbucks, the US-based coffee chain, also set up its first outlet in India a year ago, and now has 29 outlets, mostly in major cities.Operating in India does pose major challenges for Western restaurant companies, as they try to cater to Indians’ spice-loving palettes, and the high demand for diverse vegetarian options. Successful companies like Domino’s have worked hard to develop special menu items– heavy on the chilli peppers – to woo Indian customers, who rejected the chains initial, global offerings as too bland.Like its bitter rival McDonald’s, the challenge will be tough for Burger King, as most Indians – whether vegetarians or not – do not eat beef, which puts the chains core product off limits.But Everstone does bring one strong advantage to a sector where access to suitable real estate is also a major constraint to growth.

But after his admission on national television, the issue quickly died away.Mr Chen’s is the latest in a series of televised public pre-trial confessions that have aired on the CCTV in recent months and have included British and US citizens being paraded before the camera to admit their crimes.The performances, reminiscent of an earlier age in which political “struggle sessions” and show trials were the norm, have raised concerns inside China about the damage that they cause to the government’s stated goal of improving the rule of law.But they have also raised an important question about the role of the state broadcaster and the balance it must strike between being a global media organisation, a commercial moneymaking venture and a political mouthpiece for the ruling Communist party.The question is increasingly important to multinationals such as Apple, KFC, Volkswagen, Starbucks and Samsung, which have all been targeted in the past year by the broadcaster and accused of varying degrees of malfeasance or unfair practices in the Chinese market.For major global companies, understanding why they have been singled out and on whose orders is crucial to avoiding one of the most dangerous pitfalls that can befall their businesses in the country.In a recent book entitled Two Billion Eyes: The Story of China Central Television, author Ying Zhu says: “CCTV is full of serious-minded creators who regularly experience bouts of self-doubt, philosophical ambivalence and in some cases clinical depression.”She also describes: “certain common themes, about ideals distorted or altogether thwarted by commercial and political pressure”.Founded in 1958 as the country’s first TV station, CCTV did not convert to colour or extend its programming beyond a couple of hours in the evenings until the late 1970s.Nowhere is the tension at CCTV between idealism, politics and commercial imperatives more obvious than at 7pm every night on its “Xinwen Lianbo” main news programme, which all regional television stations in China are required to broadcast.A popular Chinese joke says that if anyone were to rely on this show for their information about the world they would come away with the following impressions:After the first 10 minutes, which invariably features the activities of senior Communist cadres, they would believe that China’s leaders were all very busy.The next 10 minutes of the half-hour broadcast would convince them that everyone in China was happy and prosperous, while the final segment would lead them to understand that everybody outside China was living in an abyss of suffering and extreme misery.The format has barely changed in three decades, and the broadcast remains one of the most important ways for the Chinese government to issue decrees and political messages to the nation.But in the age of social media, the show has borne the brunt of popular cynicism and ridicule over state control of information.Ordinary netizens are quick to jump on mistakes or inconsistencies, such as when the show focuses heavily on negative events in western countries but ignores similar stories at home.In 2011, a report about a new Chinese fighter jet showed the aircraft blowing another one up with a missile but ordinary viewers soon worked out that the footage in the news story was in fact taken from the 1986 Hollywood movie Top Gun and the featured fighter jet was American.As late as 1978, fewer than 10m Chinese people had access to a TV, but today CCTV boasts more than 1bn potential viewers for its 45 channels that broadcast mostly soap operas, historical dramas and variety shows.The broadcaster now earns billions of dollars a year in advertising revenue and its direct funding from the state accounts for a relatively minor part of its annual budget.But it remains a vice-ministerial level government department and is always led by a senior Communist party official who has worked his way up through the party propaganda system.The boss of the network, Hu Zhanfan, raised eyebrows in 2011, not long before he took the job, when he declared that the “first and foremost social responsibility [of journalists] is to serve well as a mouthpiece tool; this is the most core content of the Marxist view of journalism and it is the most fundamental of principles”.According to current and former CCTV employees, the constant and pervasive censorship and political orders make it easy for individuals to become jaded.So when they are presented with the opportunity to make money through unethical or, in some cases outright illegal deals, the temptation is heightened by their sense of disillusionment.“The corruption inside CCTV is extremely serious,” says Hu Yong, an associate professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at Peking University and a former CCTV employee. “For example, [CCTV employees] will blackmail interviewees by threatening to expose them publicly or they will become public advocates for their interview subjects in exchange for economic benefits.”Shi Feike, a senior journalist who once had close ties with CCTV, has a more nuanced view.“The corruption inside CCTV is not necessarily more serious than in any other monopolistic state-owned enterprise in China,” he says. “There are many highly professional and ethical staff working at CCTV and the situation varies depending on the department, the channel and the individual programme.”CCTV said: “CCTV has strict requirements regarding its employees’ professional ethics, and employs comprehensive disciplinary measures to restrict their activities.“No matter if it is reporting on Chinese companies or foreign companies, our station always adheres to the principles of objectivity and fairness.“If you pay attention to our station’s programming, you will find that our station broadcasts a large quantity of supervision type and exposure type programmes, and most of them are about Chinese domestically-produced products and brands.”In the wake of serious food and product safety scandals, CCTV has taken on the role of self-appointed public watchdog, with a focus on the transgressions of multinationals operating in China.In recent weeks, the broadcaster has targeted smartphone maker Samsung for allegedly unfair after-sales policies, while earlier this year it directed similar charges against Apple that prompted the company to apologise to Chinese consumers.Other companies such as KFC, McDonald's, Volkswagen, and Walmart have all been targeted by similar reports that appear to concentrate less on large Chinese companies, in particular state-owned monopolies that are often derided by consumers for their substandard products and services.“The reasons for this bias towards reporting [negatively] on foreign companies are complicated; sometimes it is political as in the case of Google, often it is rent-seeking [trying to force large companies to buy advertising or pay bribes] and sometimes it is just the path of least resistance,” says Mr Shi.“They cannot touch state enterprises because they will be censored so it is much safer to beat up on foreign companies. It will get on air without any trouble [from the censors] and it will gain support from nationalists.”The negative campaigns do not always have the desired effect.In late October, CCTV aired a seven-minute segment lambasting Starbucks for overcharging Chinese consumers for its coffee.With more than 1,000 outlets across China and plans for the country to become its second-largest market after the US by next year, Starbucks wants to avoid a fight with the propaganda apparatus at all costs.But on this occasion the reports were mostly greeted with derision rather than outrage from the wider public.“Coffee is not a necessity for life, the price is determined by the market and it is up to Starbucks to charge what it wants,” said one user of China’s Twitter-like Weibo service whose message went viral. “If CCTV really cares about high prices why can’t they pay attention to prices that are actually related to people’s livelihoods?”"
281;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-11-13T18:42:25Z;Starbucks beats the taxman through Kraft charge;;Starbucks’ latest income tax bill has been cut to zero by a $2.7bn compensation charge it was ordered to pay Kraft Foods over a contract dispute.In restated accounts released on Wednesday, Starbucks said a global tax bill of $832m that it had expected for the year to September 29 2013 would instead become a tax credit of $239m.The coffee chain’s taxes have been under scrutiny in the UK, where it faced accusations from politicians and the public that it was not paying enough. Starbucks responded last year by volunteering to pay extra tax but maintained that it had done nothing wrong.On Tuesday Starbucks said an arbitrator had ordered it to pay Kraft compensation for deciding in 2010 to terminate a contract under which the food group had marketed and distributed Starbucks packaged coffee to supermarkets.Starbucks is booking the compensation payment in the year to the end of September, but because of the tax change it will wipe considerably less than $2.7bn from its net income for the period.Starbucks’ previously reported net income of $1.7bn for the year shrank to net income of only $8m in its restated accounts.The company said: “Starbucks does not have any pre-tax income as a result of the arbitration award, therefore we do not have a tax obligation this year. For tax purposes, the payment is deductible. We are still evaluating the ruling to determine the time period for deductibility.”The payment consisted of $2.23bn in damages plus $557m in interest and other fees.The acrimonious dispute with Kraft began because Starbucks said the food group was not fulfilling its responsibilities under their distribution deal, which began in 1998.Kraft said Starbucks’ decision to end the partnership was a breach of contract and took the case to arbitration.In order to cover the costs of the ruling, Starbucks also said on Wednesday that it would sell $750m of new debt in the next three months. It had issued a separate $750m batch of bonds in September.But in a call with Wall Street analysts on Wednesday morning, the company stressed that it had “adequate liquidity” to cover the payment and did not need to cut its earnings forecast for the current financial year.Sara Senatore, analyst at AllianceBernstein, said the ruling did not hurt Starbucks in the stock market because “this is a one-time charge so it doesn’t change the earnings power of the company”.Its share price rose 1.05 per cent to $81.46 on Wednesday, leaving its market capitalisation above $60bn.Ms Senatore said both the company and analysts had been braced for a compensation charge of some sort, but that the $2.7bn figure was higher than expected.Kraft said it would pass the payment from Starbucks to Mondelez, the renamed business from which it split in October 2012.Mondelez said it would use the net proceeds to expand its $6bn share buyback programme.Erin Lash, analyst at Morningstar, said that decision could be an attempt to placate activist investors such as Nelson Peltz, who has criticised Mondelez for not being as profitable as its peers.But she said the company might be better served reinvesting the proceeds in the business.“Advertising their brands, improving their route to market and improving their sales capabilities might be a more appropriate use of the cash,” she said.
282;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-11-12T23:47:01Z;Starbucks ordered to pay Kraft $2.7bn;Bitter coffee dispute ends in restatement of results;Starbucks has been ordered to pay $2.7bn in compensation to Kraft Foods – a charge equal to the coffee chain’s entire net income since the start of 2012 – for terminating a deal to let the food group distribute its coffee.An arbitrator ruled that Starbucks had to pay $2.23bn in damages plus $527m in other fees following a dispute that began in 2010 when Starbucks vowed to pull out of the deal under which Kraft sold its packaged coffee to supermarkets.Kraft, which argued that Starbucks’ move was a breach of contract, said it would pass the payment from the company to Mondelez, the renamed business from which it split off in October 2012.Starbucks said it would restate its latest earnings– released last month – “probably within the next 24 hours” because it would book the compensation costs for its financial year to the end of September 2013.For the year to September, Starbucks had reported net income of $1.7bn. In the nine months to September 2012, its net income was $1bn. Starbucks shares fell 1.45 per cent to $79.45 in after-market trading after news of the ruling emerged.Asked if Starbucks would appeal, a spokesman said: “We’ve just received the decision and we’re still reviewing it.”Since 1998, Kraft had exclusive rights to market and distribute Starbucks’ roast and ground coffee to supermarkets and other stores.Gerd Pleuhs, general counsel of Mondelez, said in a statement: “We’re pleased that the arbitrator validated our position that Starbucks breached our successful and long-standing contractual relationship without proper compensation.”Troy Alstead, Starbucks’ chief financial officer, said “we strongly disagree” with the arbitrator’s decision.When Starbucks said it planned to terminate the deal in November 2010 it complained that Kraft was not fulfilling its responsibilities and that the performance of its business had suffered as a result.Mr Alstead said that ending the deal was “the right decision for Starbucks, our brand and our shareholders” and that its “at home” coffee business was “significantly healthier [now] than it was before we assumed direct control from Kraft”.Starbucks is relying on the expansion of its packaged coffee business – which had revenue of $1.4bn in the past 12 months – to offset slowing sales growth at its existing coffee shops.Mondelez said it would use the net proceeds from the arbitration to expand its $6bn share buyback programme, which it boosted by $4.8bn in August.The company has struggled since it was spun off from Kraft last year, failing to deliver the high growth executives had promised and making missteps in Russia and Brazil.Mondelez has also faced criticism from the likes of activist investor Nelson Peltz, who has attacked the company’s profit margins and urged PepsiCo to buy it.
283;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-11-08T05:00:26Z;Social media can dent reputations;How businesses deal with issues that may affect reputation is crucial;"When Dave Carroll, a United Airlines passenger, saw his cherished Taylor guitar broken by baggage handlers, he sought redress. He complained and complained but when United declined compensation for his damaged instrument the singer responded in the way he knew best – with a song bemoaning the US airline’s customer service. “United Breaks Guitars” and two follow-up songs went viral, with millions watching Mr Carroll’s ditties on YouTube.United took note, apologised and offered compensation. A few years on and the incident is still used as a model of how not to treat customers. The financial impact on United may be hard to quantify – although a brief share price fall was blamed on the video. The case, however, highlights how the internet and social media in particular are forcing companies to change the way they manage their reputation.The web is littered with other less melodious examples of customers hitting back at missteps by big business.There was an outcry this year, when it emerged how little corporate tax global groups Google, Starbucks and Amazon were paying in the UK. Consumers also vented their anger online when it emerged that horsemeat had accidentally entered the supply chain and subsequently meat products being sold by British retailers.Such incidents are a wake-up call to business. Taken to their worst conclusions the reputational fallout from missteps can dent a company’s sales, profits and stock or influence shareholder and regulatory decisions.A recent study by ACE Group found that 81 per cent of the Europe, Middle East and Africa (Emea) companies surveyed saw reputation as their most significant asset but admitted that they struggled to protect it.Anthony Johndrow, managing partner for Reputation Institute North America, says that the growing use of social media has accelerated the time it takes to disseminate information and for the public to respond. “We’re seeing quicker cycles.”He points out how quickly companies involved responded to the collapse of a textile factory in Bangladesh with the loss of hundreds of lives when it emerged workers had been making cheap garments for western retailers. In the past, companies faced with a similar incident would probably have taken much longer to react, he says.The Occupy Wall Street anti-capitalist movement, which arose in the wake of public outrage over the behaviour of banks during the financial crisis, offers another example of how fast public concerns can escalate.Mr Johndrow says: “Occupy Wall Street was an early warning for companies of things to come – showing how customers and other stakeholders can now take information, propagate it and use it as a rallying cry to force change, whether by organising mass defections of bank customers or by lobbying.”Experts say that companies need to ensure that all their employees from the chief executive to the post boy are aware of the reputational risks associated with missteps or errors and understand what happens when these issues are mishandled.“It’s not just about having top-down risk systems; to be really effective systems also need to be influenced from the bottom-up,” says Vanessa Havard-Williams, a partner at law firm Linklaters.She says companies are increasingly concerned about maintaining their reputation, not just with the public but also with other stakeholders and regulators. There is a clear policy focus on increasing transparency, while regulations are being expressed more widely, so it is not just a case of meeting the rules but following the spirit of them and of related guidance as well.“When you have a regulatory environment that is as strict, fast moving and complex as we have today, clearly you will have breaches by companies,” says Ms Havard-Williams.Businesses will inevitably face issues that may affect their reputation; the question is how they deal with them.Having a clear message that filters across the whole company is important. Employees also need to be given practical guidance that is appropriate to all the jurisdictions in which a company operates.Some companies go a step further, carrying out dry-run exercises by bringing together key people to work out how they would respond to hypothetical scenarios.Martin Caddick, head of the enterprise resilience team at PwC, says being prepared for mishaps is essential if a company is to limit reputational damage. He says some companies are too focused on the short-term impact and not on long-term resilience, or misunderstand what they are protecting.“You need to understand who your reputation is with,” says Mr Caddick. “You may think that if the people that matter are your shareholders, then it doesn’t necessarily matter if you upset the public, providing that shareholders get a return.”He says for consumer-facing companies, by and large, their reputation with the public is very important. However, business-to-business companies or suppliers may worry less about what the public thinks, as long as their business customers or shareholders remain happy. Nevertheless, Mr Caddick says, even they can come unstuck when a public outcry influences political or regulatory decisions.Dealt with swiftly and effectively, one-off issues can be overcome and have little impact on the long-term performance and perception of a company. Companies that repeatedly make mistakes will eventually lose credibility and goodwill.“Issues will arise in any organisation, because companies are staffed by human beings engaged in complicated projects, and mistakes occur,” says Ms Havard-Williams. “That may be why some problems have relatively little long-term impact on share price.“Impacts are more likely when there is a repeated behavioural pattern and it is clear that it is affecting the ability of a company to operate its core business.”Be it a one-off or a series of reputation damaging errors, companies would do well to follow Warren Buffett’s advice. The billionaire investor observed: “It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that you’ll do things differently”.In the age of Twitter, YouTube and Facebook, Mr Buffett’s comments are more pertinent than ever."
284;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Revised Google settlement: leaked document stash;;So this is it. Google’s revised offer to settle the European Commission probe into its search business has been described extensively in the press. But the actual text and screenshots of how new Google searches will look under the proposal were not published, much to the annoyance of the complainants asked for confidential feedback. One of the parties has decided to revolt and set the documents free. We’re publishing them here in full.Before the legal text, a screenshot: this is what Google proposes its EU sites will look like for a restaurant search. Note the three “Almunia links” — what negotiators are calling the forced search results that display competitors’ offerings — that appear under the paid-for “sponsored” Google search results. Under the revised offer, they are spruced up with bigger fonts, icons and two lines of text.And here is what a search for an iPod would look like. It’s important to note that the Almunia links (to rival price comparison sites Supaprice, Kelkoo and Shopzilla) are still paid for through an auction, but the minimum offer price has been reduced. More on the objections to that at the bottom of the post.There are more screenshots in the second half of the settlement text, covering searches for kittens, frogs and Starbucks. We’re confident the prospect of cute kitten pics will encourage you to wade through the legal text (we’ve posted the 96-page “commitments” submission here, which is labeled “restricted use” and “solely for the purpose of EU Commission proceedings”).For those who are wondering how it has all changed, this document tracks the changes to the first Google offer. There are apparently 424 new insertions, 377 deletions and 863 total changes.Last but not least is the questionnaire sent to those groups that submitted feedback in to the first settlement. In the questionnaire, the Commission homes in on Google’s specific revisions, rather than offer more open-ended questions inviting the anti-Google camp to vent their frustrations over the package — which many still believe fails to address what they see as Google’s abuse of their dominance in search. Most infamous among complainants is the question over whether the box for Almunia links should be shaded, or plain. Here’s a screenshot with the box shaded:Without wanting to prejudge the responses, it is pretty clear the hardcore Google opponents hate the revised offer as much as the first version. Most see the changes as trivial tweaks that fail to address the core complaint: that Google manipulates search results to its own advantage. To list their basic objections:1. More profit for Google: The Almunia links are bigger. But this will only generate more money for Google, they argue. The proposed auction will allow Google to extract more profit from its rivals since they have to pay for the links rather than rely on appearing in natural search results. Consumers will lose out, the anti-Google camp argues, because the relevant unpaid search results will be hidden down page.2. There are still loopholes: Although the text is tightened to cover all forms of search entry (voice, browser, etc.) there are still ways for Google to sidestep the requirements. In opponents’ view, Google could redirect all its national search results (google.fr) to its US domain (google.com/fr) and evade the commitments made in Europe. This admittedly wouldn’t be the smartest move, unless Google wanted to declare war on Brussels.3. New features make the abuse worse: The box allowing users to “hide alternative search sites” just allows Google to bully rivals even more, or so the complainants fear.4. The process is unfair: The person who leaked the documents claims the consultation process is unlawful and rushed. The confidentiality clauses in the documents sent to complainants are seen as an attempt to gag critics. “Almunia wishes to quickly settle this case behind the scenes before his tenure ends, without being bothered by the press or too many interested parties,” the source said. “It is a muzzle hindering the complainants to publicly speak out again.”5. The long-term result: The commitments last for five years. The complainants think this entrenches Google’s dominance in law and gives no means for rivals to seek redress against abuses. Damage claims will be hampered by the fact that Google admits no wrongdoing in the settlement.A lot of these arguments will be familiar to the Commission, whose stated concerns about Google’s behaviour are more narrow than those of the anti-Google camp. Google of course argues their regulatory tormentors will never be satisfied, short of the company being broken up and the search engine being regulated as a utility. Al Verney, a Google spokesman, claimed the primary aim of their rivals was “entangling us in a never-ending dispute” — which naturally prompted a sharp response from the Microsoft-backed lobby group Icomp. The war weary among you may wondering: “Just where are those kittens?”
285;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;China: Red restoration;Foreign companies are looking for signs that tough tactics are no more than short-term political moves;"In the tranquil surroundings of the Diaoyutai State Guest House in Beijing two weeks ago, Chinese President Xi Jinping was almost effusive as he welcomed an all-star group of global capitalists.“Many of you are renowned entrepreneurs and business leaders in the world today and you all have profound insight into the global economy,” Mr Xi told the likes of Mike Duke, Walmart CEO, Indra Nooyi, the head of PepsiCo, Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola chairman, David Rubenstein, Carlyle Group founder, and Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, the former AIG boss. “Your suggestions are a very important source of inspiration for the Chinese government.”These comments were intended to signal that the world’s second-largest economy remains open for business. But many international businesses have picked up a different, more worrying signal during Mr Xi’s tenure. Since he came to power a year ago, foreign companies have been targeted by corruption investigations, price-fixing accusations and state media-led smear campaigns.“The perception amongst foreign investors is that it is getting harder to do business here,” says Michael Crain, Beijing director of administration for law firm Bingham McCutchen, which advises international companies doing business in China. “In most of the government investigations and media exposés this year the focus has definitely been on the behaviour of foreign companies.”Mr Xi’s friendly tone at the guest house was in stark contrast with the nationalist rhetoric, communist revivalist symbolism and crackdowns on all perceived challenges to Communist party rule that have characterised his tenure since he took power.As the most senior members of the party gather for a crucial meeting this week, global companies that rely on China for an ever-increasing share of their sales and profits will be listening closely to see which message Mr Xi chooses to send.Chinese leaders have suggested that this meeting, known as the Third Plenary session of the 18th CPC Central Committee, will be the most significant since the 1978 gathering that transformed the country. Few expect detailed policy initiatives to be announced but it will set the tone for an administration that is expected to rule until 2023. This meeting, and the signals that come out of it, could determine how global companies fare in the world’s most enticing market.A strong dose of nationalistic, neo-Maoist rhetoric could portend tough times for foreign investors, while a continuation of the welcoming language used at the Diaoyutai meeting may signal an improvement in their fortunes.When he was installed at the top of the party, many within the Chinese system were hopeful Mr Xi would push bold economic and political reforms, including strengthening the legal system and reducing the role of the state in the economy.But Mr Xi has instead fallen back on the tools and symbols of the past in an attempt to halt the erosion of party legitimacy.This “restoration” of Communist imagery and tradition has been fuelled by a heavy dose of nationalism and has been accompanied by a wave of government attacks on foreign businesses in selected industries.GlaxoSmithKline, the pharmaceuticals company, recently revealed that its medicine and vaccine sales in China had fallen 61 per cent in the third quarter from a year earlier, following a high-profile investigation into the company’s alleged bribing of officials and doctors.Many in the industry say GSK’s alleged practices, some of which it has acknowledged, were far from unusual and that most domestic Chinese competitors are much more brazen in paying bribes.The government has also launched industry-wide investigations into pricing of medicines and milk powder and in August levied its biggest ever penalties for pricing violations, fining six infant milk formula companies a combined $110m.Late last month, Japan’s Meiji Holdings became the first international company to pull out of China’s baby formula sector, saying it could no longer compete in a market that is expected to double in value by 2017 from its current $12.4bn.The decision came after Meiji was forced to lower prices by the government investigation and after local media reported Beijing would give Rmb30bn ($5bn) to Chinese milk-powder makers to help them compete with foreign rivals.“These actions are about strengthening the legal system, purifying the market environment and protecting consumer rights but they also show how China doesn’t need these foreign enterprises any more,” says Bao Dike, managing editor of the PKU Business Review. “It’s not just that we don’t need foreign companies to provide jobs and tax revenue, it’s also a fact that these foreign companies are occupying the market that belongs to [Chinese] state and private enterprises.”…The group of international business leaders that lined up at the State Guest House in late October to pay homage to President Xi were all members of the advisory board of the Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management.This extraordinary who’s who of global industry shows just how important the Chinese market has become to many multinational companies and how the balance of power has shifted markedly in favour of the mandarins who control access to this market.Conspicuously absent from the event were Tsinghua board members Andrew Witty, CEO of GSK, and Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.Mr Cook was forced to issue a humiliating public apology and a promise to improve customer service policies in April following an intense campaign of criticism from state media.In March, Volkswagen recalled 380,000 vehicles in China after state television said they were unsafe. In recent weeks several state media reports have targeted Samsung for its smartphone warranty policies and Starbucks for overcharging for its lattes.Since KFC was the target of state media stories last December alleging food safety problems, sales at its parent Yum Brands have slumped by over 10 per cent this year.“The government is very aware of the enormous value of the Chinese market for multinationals and it is becoming more ruthless in ensuring that the money is kept in the family rather than letting outsiders grab the fat profits that are available now,” says Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese politics at Sydney University. “Politically it is also a very easy populist move to beat up on foreign companies; much easier than taking on big Chinese companies and their powerful domestic backers.”In the government investigations of the pharmaceutical and milk-powder sectors, Beijing appears to have adopted a traditional strategy known as “killing the chicken to scare the monkey”.By pursuing foreign companies the authorities are sending a message to entire industries that they intend to clean things up in order to provide quality products at reasonable prices in industries about which the public is concerned.By forcing multinationals to lower prices and improve their offerings they are hoping to raise the bar for domestic competitors as well as provide concrete examples to the masses of how their lives are improving under the new administration.The series of government investigations has been accompanied by a boisterous wave of media campaigns targeting popular global companies for alleged violations of consumer rights.These have often been led by the largest state media outlets, particularly state broadcaster China Central Television, and have been juiced up with inflammatory accusations of racism and disdain for Chinese consumers.“We are actually witnessing two different things: one is the exposing of foreign companies’ bribery and bad behaviour in China and the other is CCTV’s ridiculous populist reports that are not necessarily directly ordered by the top leaders,” says Li Huafang, an independent economist and popular newspaper columnist.“I actually think the new administration wants to strengthen regulations for both foreign and domestic businesses.”…Mr Li and many other analysts believe that what appears to be a concerted and organised campaign of economic nationalism is more likely just fallout from Mr Xi’s much broader domestic political agenda.By this logic, companies such as GSK, KFC, Mead Johnson, Apple and Starbucks are collateral damage in the new president’s campaign to consolidate his power, shore up Communist party legitimacy and avoid political instability.The two sides of this campaign are Mr Xi’s ruthless handling of any perceived challenges to continued one-party rule and his efforts to address the main complaints of his citizens.In that sense, it is not contradictory for Mr Xi to personally praise global capitalists while some of their businesses are targeted under his watch. That is because those attacks are not an end in themselves but rather a side-effect of his primary goals.The rough treatment of some foreign businesses “stems from Mr Xi’s need to establish his authority, to impose his will; this is a very common tactic among new rulers”, says Wang Lixiong, a prominent political writer. “We need to wait until he has consolidated power to see what his real intentions are.”One popular interpretation of Mr Xi’s conservative lurch is that he is consolidating power by adopting what is described in China as a traditionalist “leftist” approach in preparation for an eventual move to the more liberal reformist “right”.But so far there has been nothing to suggest he will eventually shift direction.“I don’t see any evidence from his background or persona or from the way that the current system is structured to suggest that Xi is moving to the left because he wants to move to the right,” says François Godement, professor of political science at Sciences Po and director for strategy of the Asia Centre in Paris. “We’ve really had all indications to the contrary and this seems more like wishful thinking.”The good news for international companies is that, for now, many of them are still being formally welcomed by Mr Xi.As long as they can show that their investments and operations in China support or at least do not get in the way of efforts to garner support for the party and its leadership, they will probably be allowed to stay and even thrive.But “increasingly multinational companies will in all sorts of subtle and not subtle ways be made to adapt their behaviour to meet the political and economic needs of the party”, Mr Brown says. “It is quite a rational response for the government in Beijing to leverage this great prize which is their domestic market.”——————————————-Rehabilitating history: Xi turns to Mao to tighten the party’s grip on the futureAnyone wanting to know which way the political winds are blowing in China just needs to read the propaganda signs posted all across Beijing.As the Communist party prepares to hold the third plenary session of the 18th CPC Central Committee, those signs lay out the central themes of President Xi Jinping’s term so far – conservatism, traditionalism and shoring up authoritarian one-party rule.Along with countless billboards proclaiming Mr Xi’s “Chinese Dream” slogan – or the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” – several motifs from a bygone era jostle for attention.“Study Lei Feng, devote yourself to others, upgrade your behaviour” commands a large poster in a chic Beijing neighbourhood.This “obey morality and observe good manners reminder notice” refers to a legendary propaganda character, Lei Feng, from the early 1960s whose (probably fictional) exploits are the subject of ridicule and cynicism for many ordinary Chinese people today.Lei Feng was supposedly a soldier in the People’s Liberation Army who secretly washed his comrades’ socks at night, revered Mao Zedong and died at the age of 21. Although someone called Lei Feng probably existed, the posthumous propaganda campaigns describing his life of selfless devotion to Mao, the party and modest good deeds are almost certainly fabrications.It might seem counterproductive to reach for a discredited and outdated symbol to shore up legitimacy. But the Lei Feng campaign is part of a wider effort by Mr Xi to rehabilitate history and explain why the party should remain in charge.“Xi is drawing from the register of the 1950s and particularly the early 1960s when the party launched successive Leninist political movements,” says François Godemont, a professor of political science at Sciences Po.“He is trying to bring about a ‘red restoration’ and consolidate his grip on power.”The result is a barrage of language not heard in China for decades as Mr Xi promotes the Maoist “mass line” governance method and orders cadres to carry out “criticism and self-criticism” sessions.In the past three decades, Chinese leaders have tried to play down the Maoist era from 1949 until 1976 to avoid subjects such as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.But Mr Xi has explicitly said the Mao era should be rehabilitated.This is partly because much of his legitimacy derives from his pedigree as the son of Xi Zhongxun, a communist guerrilla leader who went on to be a senior official under Mao but was purged in the early 1960s.By referring to the period before his father’s fall from grace, Mr Xi is seeking to boost his own image as the son of a revolutionary founding father.A less savoury aspect of his campaign has been the arrest of hundreds of people considered to be political “troublemakers”.“All the signs are that what Xi wants is to strengthen the system and his own position, rather than risk structural change that would reduce the power of the existing establishment,” says Jonathan Fenby, director of China research at Trusted Source.——————————————-Letters in response to this article:Local values with a global impact / From Mr Peter MarshThe recipe for enduring growth / From Dr Mario Mariniello"
286;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-10-30T23:32:08Z;Starbucks hits out at growth expectations;Coffee chain forecasts slower sales rise next year;Starbucks’ chief executive, Howard Schultz, expressed exasperation with analysts as the coffee chain forecast that its sales growth would slow next year and urged Wall Street not to harbour unreasonable expectations.The Seattle-based company stressed on Wednesday that it was a mature business and expected its like-for-like sales to grow by “mid-single digits” in the year to September 2014, following a 7 per cent increase in the past financial year.The modest growth forecast saw its shares fall as much as 2.5 per cent to $78.82 in after-market trading. It also prompted a series of questions from analysts on a conference call about when Starbucks would be able to deliver stronger growth again.The questioning prompted Mr Schultz to interject: “It seems like we can’t get through a conference without this tension between us and you regarding this [like-for-like sales] growth guidance.”He said that although many executives at Starbucks thought the company could generate better sales growth than its official forecast, it would be “irresponsible” to indicate a higher number, partly because of uncertainty over the US economy and the need to raise the country’s debt ceiling again in February.Troy Alstead, chief financial officer, said the company was so “large and mature” – it has nearly 20,000 stores worldwide – that its growth rate to date was a significant accomplishment.Mr Schultz added: “We are not going to put a number out there that is such a stretch target.” He noted that analysts would feed it into their own financial models and then declare that Starbucks had failed if it fell short.He also emphasised that the latest results for the September quarter were the best in Starbucks’ 42-year history, and included sales growth that none of its peers could match. Those points, however, had little impact on investors.Total revenues for the quarter rose 13 per cent to $3.8bn, while net profit increased by 34 per cent to $481m.Starbucks said that it expected total revenue in the 12 months to September 2014 to rise by at least 10 per cent following a 12 per cent rise in the past year.It said its operating profit margin would rise in all regions except its China and Asia-Pacific business, where margins were likely to decline from 37.5 per cent in the past quarter to the “low 30s”.Starbucks became engulfed in a brief furore in China in the past month after it was criticised in Chinese state media for charging excessively high coffee prices.
287;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-10-30T00:07:13Z;Will Starbucks’ push into tea hurt its coffee shops?;The Teavana bar’s opening raises questions about how to avoid competing with the original business;THE PROBLEMStarbucks opened its first Teavana bar in New York last week. CEO Howard Schultz said he was not worried about cannibalising the coffee chain because “most people who are tea drinkers are not crossing over to coffee”. When launching similar products, how do you avoid competing with your original business?THE ADVICEThe marketing expert: Tim CalkinsCompanies have to be very careful in introducing new brands. While they might seem like a good idea, they may well cannibalise the existing brand. A bigger problem is that the brand portfolio may become difficult to manage. Companies with many brands in the same space can really struggle. General Motors is a perfect example of what happens when a portfolio becomes unwieldy.It is best to launch a brand only if its positioning is very different from the existing one, the opportunity is compelling and you have the resources to support all the brands. Starbucks clearly has the resources. The challenge will be keeping Teavana distinct.Tim Calkins is a marketing professor at the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University——————————————-The author: Freek VermeulenHoward Schultz might be right, and coffee drinkers don’t cross over, but it is also irrelevant. If it is going to cannibalise your business, perhaps that is exactly the reason to do it. Business history shows that companies often refuse to adopt a new product to avoid cannibalisation – until someone else does.Firestone hung on to bias tyres until the radial tyre all but annihilated them. It was a Swiss engineer who invented quartz technology, which Far Eastern competitors used to outcompete the Swiss mechanical watchmakers. If you can think of a disruptive product that cannibalises your business, someone else can too. Don’t wait for others to take the bite.Freek Vermeulen is author of Business Exposed and an associate professor at London Business School——————————————-The entrepreneur: Tim MartinHistory is against Starbucks. The outstanding success in the restaurant world by miles is McDonald’s. While it has been criticised for what it offers, I think it has got over that because it does only one thing and has been able to upgrade – or try to upgrade – every aspect of its business. Compared to anyone else, including Wetherspoon, it has a very simple business.If you look at the international successes, they have stuck to their knitting. A good example of that is Starbucks. It has an almost ludicrously narrow offer but it has done very well. My estimate is not so much that it will cannibalise existing trade. It’s more about dilution of the effort of the company.Tim Martin is founder and chairman of the UK pub chain JD Wetherspoon
288;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-10-23T18:30:54Z;Starbucks chief calls on US leaders to co-operate;;Howard Schultz, chief executive of Starbucks, has warned America’s political leaders that they must live up to their responsibilities and not allow the US to flirt with the possibility of a debt default again next year.“We are in dire need of co-operation and civility and civil discourse among our elected officials,” he told the Financial Times in the aftermath of this month’s federal government shutdown.“If that doesn’t happen and we have this event again it’ll be very destructive to the American people. It’ll be shameful in terms of the lack of leadership and it will continue to hurt America’s standing in the world.”Mr Schultz, who has become a vocal political activist in the past two years, was adding his weight to criticism already expressed by billionaire investor Warren Buffett and other corporate leaders.The 11th-hour deal to avert a debt default last week suspended the US debt ceiling until February 7, when it will need to be raised again. Mr Schultz said the latest stand-off had caused a “fracturing” of consumer confidence.Some US business groups are revisiting their political strategies in the wake of the shutdown and reassessing attitudes towards the Tea Party, whose agenda they say is not fully aligned with the interests of corporate America.The US Chamber of Commerce, the largest US business lobby group, has hinted that it will become more active next year when midterm elections are due.Before the deal to avert a default, Mr Buffett likened the last-minute negotiations over raising the debt ceiling to wielding a “political weapon of mass destruction”.If Congress caused a technical default on bond payments it would be a “pure act of idiocy”, he said. “I know it’s been used in the past, but we used the atomic bomb back in 1945 and we decided we weren’t going to do something like that again.”Mr Schultz said: “The cause of the shutdown was probably greater on one side versus the other, however the responsibility to reopen the government and not default and reach a compromise is equal on both sides.”He declined to comment on the Tea Party. He said he had not given money to any elected officials for three years and would not do so until he saw more “civility” in politics.The Starbucks chief, who was speaking ahead of the opening of its first Teavana tea bar in New York, said: “The unintended consequences of all of this [are] something I don’t believe the American people can continue to go through.”Before the debt deal last week, Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola chief executive, called the crisis “a bad dream”, and said: “There is no time that I know in history that the world needs US leadership more than today.”Additional reporting by Shannon Bond in New York

290;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Starbucks chief defends China coffee prices;;The Starbucks executive who oversees its China business has defended the chain against local criticism over its coffee prices, but said the public relations storm did not require him to take an urgent trip to China from his US base.John Culver, a group president, told the Financial Times: “I have regular plans to visit China as part of my day-to-day business. This issue right now does not warrant me spending a special trip going to China.”Mr Culver, who is based in Starbucks’ home town of Seattle, said the price of a Starbucks café latte in China was close to and in some cases lower than the prices of its competitors, and that its profitability in China was no higher than in the US.Following criticism of Starbucks in Chinese newspapers, CCTV, the state broadcaster, reported that a medium-sized latte cost Rmb27 ($4.43) in China compared with Rmb19.98 in Chicago, Rmb14.6 in Mumbai and Rmb24.25 in London.It also noted that Starbucks, which will soon open its 1,000th store in China, appeared to have much fatter margins there.Foreign companies from Apple to Nestlé have faced pressure in China from state media and regulators to cut their prices or improve their customer service in recent months. Given China’s increasing importance to them, most have been quick to address the concerns.Mr Culver also oversees new brands and distribution channels for Starbucks worldwide. Asked if he expected the criticism to be a prelude to official action against Starbucks, he said: “We have ongoing relationships with the government and we want to make sure that we are very respectful of them and that we have a very open and honest, and again, a very factual dialogue.”He declined to comment on whether Starbucks had already had conversations with government officials on coffee pricing.Asked if Starbucks was willing to reduce its prices, he did not give a direct answer, but said Starbucks felt it had “the right economic model” and had won the loyalty of customers, while stressing that it would respect “local laws and customs”.The bottom line operating margin in China is in fact not any higher than what we see in the USStarbucks likes to be seen as a good corporate citizen and the Chinese criticism recalled a furore last year over tax in the UK, where Starbucks caved into public pressure and volunteered to pay more tax even though the law did not require it.A Starbucks spokesman said the two situations were “completely different”. It was “apples to oranges,” he said.Below Mr Culver in the Starbucks hierarchy is Jeff Hansberry, president of China and Asia Pacific, who is based in Hong Kong. Reporting to him is Belinda Wong, president of Starbucks China, who is based in Shanghai.Seeking to scotch a “misnomer” that China was a relatively low-cost place to do business for Starbucks, Mr Culver said that at store level its investment and labour costs, including staff training, “approach the levels of what we see in the US”.He said that in the past year Starbucks had invested $100m in the country.“The bottom line operating margin in China is in fact not any higher than what we see in the US,” he said.He would not provide a number because Starbucks does not report on individual countries publicly. Even so, during the UK tax controversy, in a failed attempt to neutralise criticism, it revealed it had made losses for many years in the UK.

292;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Chinese steam over pricey Starbucks coffee;;Starbucks has come under fire from Chinese state media for charging more for its coffee in China than in other countries, making it the latest western company to face scrutiny over its Chinese pricing strategy.The barrage of criticism on television and in newspapers comes as Starbucks, the world’s biggest coffee chain by revenues, has been rapidly expanding its China business.From fewer than 400 stores in China in 2010, Starbucks will soon be opening its 1000th outlet and has said that China was likely to overtake Canada as its second-biggest market next year.But Starbucks has now been thrust into an uncomfortable spotlight. China Central Television (CCTV), the official state broadcaster, has accused it of gouging consumers by charging about a third more than in the US. Its report, aired on Sunday, followed critiques of Starbucks in Chinese newspapers over the past week.Foreign companies from Apple to Nestlé have faced pressure in China from state media and regulators in recent months to cut their prices or improve their customer service. With China an increasingly important market for these companies, most have been quick to address the concerns.It is unclear in the case of Starbucks whether the media attacks have arisen independently and might fade away, or whether they could be a prelude to official action against the company.CCTV reported that a medium-sized latte cost Rmb27 ($4.43) in China compared with Rmb19.98 in Chicago, Rmb14.6 in Mumbai and Rmb24.25 in London.It also noted that Starbucks appeared to have much fatter margins in China. In the fiscal quarter ending June 30, Starbucks reported a 36 per cent operating margin in Asia during the quarter to June 30 – that compares with 22 per cent in the Americas and 3 per cent in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Starbucks responded that its pricing strategy was based on local market costs, including infrastructure investment, real estate and labour. It also added that its Asia-Pacific profit margin was for 14 countries, not just China.Wang Zhengdong, director of the Coffee Association of Shanghai, told CCTV: “Starbucks has been able to enjoy high prices in China, mainly because of the blind faith of local consumers in Starbucks and other western brands.”“Starbucks coffee price investigation” shot up to become the second most popular topic on Sina Weibo, China’s Twitter-like website. But rather than rallying to CCTV’s side, many of the users commenting on the story criticised the state broadcaster for dwelling on the price of coffee, something seen as an indulgence rather than a daily necessity in China.“If coffee is too expensive, I don’t need to drink it,” Monikalo posted. “If you have time to worry about this, why don’t you spend more time focusing on property prices and the cost of medical care and essential food and beverages? These are things that are actually bound up with the lives of ordinary people.”
293;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Ireland pledges to close Apple tax loophole;;Ireland has bowed to international pressure and said it would close a legal loophole that enabled Apple to save tax on $44bn of offshore income in the country’s first major step against tax avoidance.“Let me be crystal clear, Ireland wants to be part of the solution to this global tax challenge, not part of the problem,” Michael Noonan, Ireland’s finance minister, said on Tuesday. “I want Ireland to play fair – as we always have done – and I want Ireland to play to win.”However, tax experts said that the change would be unlikely to raise Apple’s tax bill either in Ireland or globally, and that it was set to leave Ireland’s role as a linchpin in the tax-planning strategies of US multinationals untouched.In his budget speech, Mr Noonan said he would publish legislation to ensure that Irish-registered companies could not remain “stateless” in terms of their tax residency - a loophole that was highlighted in a US Senate committee investigation into Apple earlier this year.The committee claimed that Ireland acted as a conduit for Apple’s earnings so that it could sidestep large tax payments, resulting in a corporation tax rate of 2 per cent or less, well short of the country’s usual 12.5 per cent rate.The move against “stateless” companies will not prevent multinationals engaging in the most common tax avoidance technique deployed in the country, know as the “Double Irish”, experts said.Under this tax structure, companies such as Google and Adobe exploit differences between the US and Irish tax codes to move profits to low tax jurisdictions.Apple may be able to keep its current low-tax status by simply moving formal control of its Irish company to a tax haven like Bermuda, said Dick Harvey, professor at the Villanova School of Law. Referring to the Irish claim that it was closing a loophole, he added: “I will believe it when I see it. One doubts businesses like Apple will be paying the 12.5 per cent Irish tax rate on approximately two-thirds of their global income.”In the hearings this year Senators John McCain and Carl Levin labelled Ireland a “tax haven”, claiming that Apple used it to save US tax on $44bn in offshore income.Ireland rejected the criticism but has admitted that the Apple hearings have damaged its reputation. Under Irish law, multinational companies can incorporate a company in Ireland but establish its tax residency in a different low-tax jurisdiction or, in Apple’s case, have no tax residency at all.Mr Noonan plans to force “stateless” companies incorporated in Ireland to declare a tax residency in another jurisdiction or become liable for Ireland’s 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate in 2015.The move to amend the law follows a decision by Brussels to probe the tax relationship between Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg and some multinational companies. Last month, the Financial Times reported that Europe’s top competition authority asked these countries to explain their system of tax rulings and give details of assurances given to companies, including Apple and Starbucks.“The use of so-called stateless companies, which are incorporated in Ireland but not tax resident anywhere was a bridge too far for the Irish authorities,” said Joe Tynan, PwC tax adviser.“I think they took the view that if you can cut off the diseased limb you can continue to remain competitive in tax . . . Ireland will not jump ahead on its own and outlaw the Double Irish,” he said.Dublin has pledged to work with the OECD, which is drawing up a plan to close corporate tax loopholes that have enabled companies to save billions of euros in tax over the past decade.“Getting to a place where income is at least taxed somewhere is something,” said Ed Kleinbard, a professor at USC law school.
294;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-09-25T21:15:30Z;Colombia: Krispy Kreme takes aim at the humble arepa;;"Tinto (essentially, black coffee) and arepa, (flatbread made of maize flour) have long been the staples of a traditional Colombian breakfast.But if Krispy Kreme, the US-based donut maker, has its way, Colombians would soon be munching on deep-fried, sugary doughs as well.The Winston-Salem-based company on Wednesday said it has signed an agreement with Colombia’s IRCC, a subsidiary of the VA! Group, which is the country’s leading restaurant operator, to open 25 of its shops over the next five years in cities such as Bogotá, Medellín and Barranquilla – the first deal of its kind in South America.“Colombia offers Krispy Kreme an attractive opportunity with its growing economy and long customer experience with international brands,” said Jeff Welch, president of Krispy Kreme International in a statement.Certainly, fast food chains have mushroomed in Colombia in recent years – including one of Krispy Kreme’s competitors, Dunkin’ Donuts – as the country is increasingly becoming recognised for its consumption patterns, especially among foreign investors.A perfect and recent example, that could accompany Krispy Kreme’s breakfast doughnuts, is Starbucks Coffee, which only last month said it plans to open 50 stores in Colombia, also over the next five years. To the joy of proud Colombians, they will only be selling locally produced coffee.The move is part of a strategy to market Colombian coffee in Starbucks chains all over the world, as the country is ranked among the top producers of high quality Arabica beans. This would help Colombian coffee growers, who have been hurt by low international coffee prices and an overvalued peso.Related Reading:

295;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-09-25T15:15:53Z;Corporate America’s odd silence on guns;Bosses have taken a stand on some divisive issues. Why not on one of life and death?;Iam not an American and have no say in its political process. But I spent a year in the US in my late teens, have visited many times since and admire the country’s certainty that there is no darkness that cannot be lightened.Despondency is not an American trait, which is why it was so striking to hear President Barack Obama talk about a “creeping resignation”, a sense that this is “just somehow the way it is”.He was speaking on Sunday at a memorial for the 12 people shot dead at the Washington Navy Yard by a former reservist who had become an information technology contractor.Mass shootings, he continued, “ought to lead to some sort of transformation”. Instead, he said, “nothing happens”.I understand the US divisions over guns, the rift over the meaning of the second amendment and the Congressional deadlock on this and other issues. What I don’t understand is where the voice of corporate America is. Where do company leaders stand on gun control?In a report published before the Navy Yard shootings, the Congressional Research Service identified 78 “public mass shootings” in the US over the past 30 years. A third of those had occurred at “workplaces where the shooter was employed either at the time of the incident or prior to it”. This is higher than mass shootings at any other type of institution.“We must insist here today there is nothing normal about innocent men and women being gunned down where they work,” Mr Obama said.Yet what do those who are responsible for their employees’ safety say about a system that, in the president’s words, fails “to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and dangerous people”?Howard Schultz, chief executive of Starbucks, did have something to say. Last week he issued “a respectful request that customers no longer bring firearms into our stores”. Mr Schultz took no position on gun laws themselves, acknowledging it was a “complicated, highly charged issue”.So it is. Opinion polls show Americans are split. According to a Pew Research Center report in May, 50 per cent believed it was more important to control gun ownership, while 48 per cent said it was more important to protect Americans’ right to hold guns.But there are other, equally divisive issues on which US bosses have taken a stand, such as gay marriage. Here, too, the US was sharply and emotionally divided.Mr Schultz spoke up for marriage equality, telling a shareholder that if he didn’t like it he could take his investment elsewhere.Why the difference? One of the reasons Starbucks backed same-sex marriage was because it wanted to support its gay employees.Quite right. But in that case, why not speak out on an issue of life and death? Why not support employees’ right to be safe from guns, not just by requesting that customers leave them outside but that the US keep weapons out of the hands of the unsuitable and deranged?If companies do not want to thrust themselves into the midst of the debate, why not speak up on issues on which there is broad consensus? For example, Pew found that 81 per cent of Americans favoured background checks on people buying weapons privately and at gun shows.Starbucks told me that it was for elected leaders to make policy on guns. Why did the company not say anything to encourage them? “It’s divisive, I guess,” said a friendly spokesman.Wasn’t gay marriage divisive? Starbucks had had domestic partner benefits for two decades. “It’s deep in the blood,” he said.Other companies that supported gay marriage were equally reticent on gun control. Goldman Sachs, whose chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, made a video supporting gay marriage, said “we’ve not put out any official position” on guns.Microsoft said that while it banned weapons in its offices it had “not taken a position on public policy issues related to guns”. Nike failed to respond to requests for comment.Pro-gun websites claim that Levi Strauss and Ben & Jerry’s support gun control, but the former failed to return my messages and the ice-cream maker said it had never taken a position on this issue. It added that if I wanted to talk about genetically modified food, “that, we would be glad to talk about”.Yes, these are people with opinions on all issues but one. As I said, it is not my country.

Global banks, trust companies and professional services groups have been finding a foothold in Jersey’s prime financial district ever since this 45 sq mile island began building its reputation as an offshore centre in the 1960s.The influx of international investment has brought considerable wealth – with well-funded public services and high standards of living – but also concentrated economic activity in financial services, and, in particular, on the cornerstones of banking and wealth management.Now its leaders are taking steps to expand beyond their core territory with a concerted effort to strengthen the economy through diversification.Digital and technology services, mining and intellectual property are some of the sectors seen as offering the highest potential for growth. Finance, too, is part of the plan, with priorities for expanding the industry’s footprint in the Gulf, Asia and Africa.Philip Ozouf, treasury and resources minister, says: “We are a centre that needs to be at the cutting edge of innovation. As a small economy you have a disadvantage because of your size but you need to play to your strengths …you should be able to move quicker than larger countries.”The financial crisis brought significant challenges. Banking profits – which account for 80 per cent of those generated by the financial services industry – roughly halved after 2008, when interest rate margins fell and head offices sought savings at offshore divisions. Painful public spending cuts followed and jobs were lost.Since 2011 the banking decline has flattened, and signs of recovery in the UK, Jersey’s biggest trading partner, give some islanders cause to believe a fresh phase of growth is around the corner.Geoff Cook, chief executive of Jersey Finance, which represents the island’s finance industry, says the crisis has not made a “structural change” in the ability of the industry to make profits. The island’s asset base remains healthy, with £1.2tn in its custody. “My prediction is it will come bounding back once interest rates normalise,” he says. “We think 2 per cent base rates will largely restore the profit model.”His organisation has spent the past six years expanding Jersey’s presence in emerging markets, opening offices in Hong Kong, Delhi, Mumbai and Abu Dhabi. Shanghai will join the roster in 2014. “We’ve also ramped up our activity in Russia,” Mr Cook says, with visits every three to four months.Attracting new business to the island is one of the motives behind a prospective waterfront development, the Jersey International Finance Centre. With six standalone buildings amounting to half a million square feet of office space, the zone will offer the kind of flexible, high quality premises familiar to global banks in cities like London and Singapore.Lee Henry, managing director of the States of Jersey Development Company, owner of the site, says: “We have 2.8m sq ft of office space in Jersey but very little categorised as Grade A [prime]. We’re hopeful that by creating this dedicated district for finance we will attract a flow of new tenants.”The island will reinforce the importance of its political and economic relationship with Britain next year when it opens a representative office in Westminster. Along with Guernsey and the Isle of Man, its fellow Crown Dependencies, Jersey was pressed by the Treasury to sign up to measures on the automatic exchange of tax information following a similar agreement with the US. The episode came amid hardening international attitudes towards offshore centres, as larger countries sought to shore up their revenues by clamping down on tax avoidance. As part of its response, Jersey points to a report it commissioned from Capital Economics, a UK consultancy, which calculated that half of the assets held in Jersey were funnelled into British investments, bolstering the City of London and the UK economy. The island had a “symbiotic relationship” with the UK, it said, earning the exchequer £2bn more in tax revenues than it lost in tax avoidance or evasion.Ian Gorst, Jersey’s chief minister, comments: “We’re marketing ourselves as a quality jurisdiction, wanting to be involved in the development of new standards and proving the benefit we are to the European economy.”Some believe its case was strengthened by the recent furore over transfer pricing, with global companies such as Amazon, Starbucks and Google under attack over their UK taxes – but where countries such as Luxembourg, rather than offshore jurisdictions, bore the brunt of the accusations.David Cameron this month gave the island a vote of confidence on the tax issue when, in answer to a question in the House of Commons, the prime minister said:“I do not think it is fair any longer to refer to any of the overseas territories or Crown Dependencies as tax havens. They have taken action to make sure that they have fair and open tax systems.”One question that remains is the impact on Jersey of UK plans to introduce a ringfence between banks’ investment and retail arms.Mr Cook says details are yet to be finalised, but he expects some banks will want to operate two models: a branch for local retail clients and a subsidiary for international business. “The principle is accepted,” he says.In its public finances, Jersey’s position is relatively encouraging. It has no debt, and has pumped money into a programme of fiscal stimulus, as well as putting £20m into schemes to relieve youth unemployment. The strategic reserve, a rainy-day fund approaching £700m, is untouched even after the shakedown in global finance.In spite of these signs of optimism, politicians and business leaders remain convinced the island needs to broaden its economic base. A drive to build up the digital sector is one of the brightest prospects.As part of this initiative, the government is investing £41m in replacing the island’s copper wire network with fibre-optic cable that by 2016 will give everyone access to superfast broadband speeds of 1 gigabit per second.Hanuman Tripathi, group managing director and founder of Infrasoft, a Mumbai-based software and IT services company that set up a Jersey arm in 2005, said the initiative would be “immensely beneficial” in attracting businesses to the island by allowing them to work seamlessly with its financial and professional services industry. Jersey could become an international data hub, storing information in a secure and high-bandwidth environment. “It puts Jersey two to three years ahead of other offshore centres.”Diversification is seen as a way of making new career options available to islanders for whom financial services have been the prime route on leaving school or graduating from university.Mr Gorst says the initiative is partly “about making sure there are appropriate and broad opportunities for members of our community to go into”.For Eliot Lincoln, managing director of Greenlight, a management consultancy, the digital initiative was “a ballsy move”. He says: “It would have been very easy for them to say ‘the economy’s going to recover and everything will be fine’. Instead they’re enabling something new – they’re setting the conditions for business to flourish.”
297;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks asks customers to leave their guns at home;;Gun-toting coffee drinkers will have to think twice before visiting Starbucks for their caffeine fix after the US chain, which has been a reluctant hero of gun rights advocates, asked customers to leave their firearms at home.Howard Schultz, chief executive, wrote in an open letter that Starbucks and its employees “have been thrust unwillingly into the middle of [the US gun] debate”.The new policy, which requests customers “no longer bring firearms into our stores or outdoor seating areas” at its nearly 7,000 company-owned US shops, underscores the delicate balance retailers are trying to strike as they face pressure from both sides of the gun control debate.Until now, Starbucks has deferred to local laws, allowing guns in stores in states where people are permitted to openly display their firearms – an approach taken by other retailers including Walmart, Target and Home Depot.Gun control groups have criticised Starbucks for this policy, while it has served as a rallying point for those who support gun rights. Pro-gun activists have held “Starbucks Appreciation Days” at local stores, which Mr Schultz said “disingenuously portray Starbucks as a champion of ‘open carry’”.“To be clear: we do not want these events in our stores,” he wrote, adding: “Some anti-gun activists have also played a role in ratcheting up the rhetoric and friction.”Starbucks said its decision was not a response to Monday’s shootings at the Washington Navy Yard that left 13 people dead, nor to other recent killings at Sandy Hook elementary school and a cinema in Aurora, Colorado.But Mr Schultz said the decision was necessary because the debate had become “increasingly uncivil and, in some cases, even threatening”.Mr Schultz framed the new policy as “a request and not an outright ban”, saying he did not want to ask employees to confront armed customers. The company said it would not post signs about the policy in its stores.The Starbucks chief executive has taken strong stands on divisive issues in the past, advocating same-sex marriage and supporting legalisation of gay unions in its home state of Washington.Gun control advocates praised the company’s new position. “Because Starbucks is a business icon, this policy change represents a sea change in American culture, which is finally shifting away from allowing guns in public places,” said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, a group that has been campaigning for the coffee chain to change its policy.Supporters of open carry policies have hammered other businesses that ban guns on their premises. This year, Facebook groups sprung up calling for a boycott of Buffalo Wild Wings after pictures of “no guns” signs at some restaurants circulated online.On Wednesday, online forums devoted to gun rights were buzzing about Starbucks’ decision. “Bad move, Starbucks. Bad move, and in the wrong direction,” wrote one commenter on OpenCarry.org.——————————————-Letter in response to this article:Earp’s gun ban was a stronger fix / From Mr John Steward
298;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;The next must-have for China’s rich: a fireplace?;;"Ultra-luxury fireplaces and wood burning stoves may not sound like the obvious things to sell in China, which has little or no tradition of decorative heaters – and no wood to burn in them if it did. But if Starbucks can make itself almost a household name in a country that doesn’t like the taste of coffee, then anything is possible.Chesney’s, the high end fireplace and stove brand which opens two large new showrooms this week in Shanghai and Beijing, is hoping that rich Chinese have all the famous-label bling they can handle, and are ready to move on to subtler ways to spend money.For China is rapidly become the land of the niche luxury brand. Tap any market researcher on the shoulder, and he will tell you that Chinese consumers are reaching a state of maturity where they want to express their individuality through the brands they buy – and not just show off the pricetag.Chesney’s is nothing if not niche: its Shanghai showroom, which opens today, looks more like an art gallery than a furniture store, with its location in the chic new Red Town Creativity Centre, at the trendy end of Shanghai’s famous commercial street, Huaihai Road.There’s only one problem: where is the market? “The challenge we have here is that there is no tradition of decorative heating appliances,” says Paul Chesney, the company’s managing director. “There isn’t the architectural tradition that exists in Europe and the States, (where) you put a fireplace in a room for heating, but also as an architectural focus, you group your furniture around it,” he says. “The challenge we have in China is to create demand within what is essentially a vacuum”.Chesney shows off what he thinks could be one of the brand’s best sellers in China: a Rmb129,000 ($21,000) electric fireplace, complete with fake logs and fake smoke, but hand carved in real white Carrara marble. The fireplace “surround” is intricately detailed in 18th century style, complete with Ionic columns. Just the kind of thing that a Chinese millionaire might well want – though the fake Monet above the mantelpiece that was in the showroom might not give the right impression.Chesney says that the fireplace – which is operated by remote control and vaporises water to create the effect of smoke rising from the imitation logs – is near the top of the Chesney price range in China, where prices are likely to be higher than New York, just as New York prices are higher than London. And for those who really want niche to be niche, Chesney’s also does bespoke fireplaces. Its products range from classical to contemporary, but they all recreate a “western” look that he says is popular with the kind of Chinese consumer who has enough money to build a mansion to put it in.Chesney’s is aiming to piggyback on China’s culture of the family, to create a whole new “culture of the fireplace” with family gathered round it. Stranger things have happened: these days more and more Chinese visit Starbucks not just for the ambience, but for the bitter brew itself. If they can sell coffee to a nation of tea drinkers, selling the odd Carrara marble fireplace with fake steam should be a breeze…Related reading:

299;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
300;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Illy in China: no catering to local taste;;"Is not tailoring your food and drinks to Chinese taste a form of “food neo-colonialism”, as Roland Decorvet of Nestle China put it last year? Illycaffe, the Italian premium coffee roaster, thinks not.Even as it looks to grind away Nestlé’s and Starbucks’ lead in China – a market that’s posting double-digit growth and which is worth about $1.5bn last year – the company says it has no plans to “localise” it product for the Chinese market.“You don’t like our espresso? Then drink our cappuccino. But that’s about as far as I’ll go in adapting to local taste,” Andrea Illy, the company’s third-generation family CEO, told beyondbrics on the sidelines of the WEF in Dalian, China. “Our strategy is executed in exactly the same way in any country.”With this approach, Illy is hoping to replicate the successes of a select club of other global brands whose products are the same across the world. “It’s like a perfume, it has to be the same around the world,” Illy said. “Otherwise you’d be disappointed.”But Illy faces an uphill battle to win over the local coffee drinker in China. Asians are known for not liking the bitter taste of black coffee and Nestlé and Starbucks have both adapted their products accordingly.As the FT’s Patti Waldmeir noted:Many mainland Starbucks customers prefer milkshake-type drinks, teas, juices and localised flavours like the green tea latte.And when the Chinese drink Nescafé, “they are not drinking coffee but a sweet concoction of water, milk powder and sugar”, says Torsten Stocker, partner at Monitor Group consultants.“In general, it’s a good strategy is to make your product relevant to local population,” say Rich Lesser and Jeffrey Walters, respectively global CEO and director the Chinese consumer practice of consulting firm BCG, without commenting on Illy’s strategy specifically. “That often means being part of their community and its preferences.”In the case of food, Walters added, consumers will often prefer brands that are either Chinese or seem and taste Chinese. Only in categories where Chinese have a lack of trust in their domestic manufacturers supply chains, the Western-branded alternative might win.Illy however thinks coffee is different. Chinese consumers mostly see coffee as an aspirational product. They often don’t drink it so much for its taste or effect, but rather as a sign of one’s ability to socialise in the more exclusive coffee houses.“Coffee consumption rises with the levels of income of a country, not so much as a function of its population’s taste,” he said. “We want to educate our clients about the wonder of coffee, and the poetry of consuming it.”“We want drinking coffee to be a social-sensorial experience,” the Italian added.But Illy can also hope that as coffee becomes a more integrated part of Chinese life, consumers will get more educated and sophisticated and seek out a more authentic product.Further reading:

301;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:58:35+0000;Brussels probes multinationals’ tax deals;;Brussels is probing Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands over their tax deals with multinationals paving the way potentially for a formal investigation into illegal sweeteners.Europe’s top competition authority has asked the governments to explain their system of tax rulings and give details of assurances given to several specific companies – including Apple and Starbucks – according to people who have seen the request.The move threatens to open a new front in the global clampdown on tax evasion through enforcing the EU’s state aid rules – a unique regime that bans serious distortions of competition through tax breaks to favoured private groups.This request, sent to at least three EU countries, represents the opening step of an informal probe and does not mean the European Commission has identified wrongdoing. But even this preliminary move has rattled officials in some of the capitals targeted.Should the Commission find cause for concern, it will open a formal investigation and start a process that could force the states to recoup all the lost revenues from any unlawful sweetheart deals. A Commission spokesperson said: “At the moment, we are simply gathering information on tax rulings.”The Hague, Dublin and Luxembourg have all been forced to combat claims that they are acting as tax havens, giving big corporations a base to reduce their tax bill worldwide. The rulings under scrutiny give assurances to companies – sometimes in advance of a decision to relocate – over how their tax affairs will be treated.The government in Luxembourg declined to comment. The Irish Ministry of Finance said it was not aware of a formal EU state aid inquiry but said it received queries from the Commission “from time to time” on a range of issues including tax.A US Senate committee recently singled out Ireland for acting as a conduit for Apple’s earnings so it could sidestep large tax payments around the world. The report claimed Dublin allowed Apple to apply a corporation tax of 2 per cent or less, well short of the usual 12.5 per cent rate. Ireland strongly rejects allegations of a “special deal”.Starbucks, meanwhile, came under fire last year in Britain for allegedly slashing its UK tax bill by vesting its intellectual property in its Dutch subsidiary, which then charged hefty royalties to its other subsidiaries, allowing the British unit to show little or no taxable profit.In parliamentary hearings, Starbucks claimed it could not reveal whether its Dutch tax ruling involved a tax break because of confidentiality rules. The Dutch government says this is false, and that while its tax authority is bound by confidentiality, Starbucks is free to make the ruling public if it wishes.Although many tax authorities make upfront agreements with companies on how their revenues will be treated, Luxembourg has faced criticism for going further than most. Companies often pay very low tax rates in spite of a relatively high corporate tax rate of 29 per cent.The EU questionnaire lands at a sensitive political moment for The Hague. The Dutch parliament’s finance committee is holding a hearing on Thursday on the country’s “letterbox companies”, shell companies that multinationals establish in the Netherlands to exploit financial advantages including the tax rulings.In a bid to assuage critics, the Dutch government this month unveiled a tax avoidance crackdown that included a promise to share proactively tax rulings with other national authorities, especially when companies may not qualify for tax cuts under bilateral treaties.Additional reporting by Vanessa Houlder in LondonThree examples of how laws in Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands help multinational companies reduce potentially huge tax bills.Ireland (‘double Irish’): This structure relies on two Irish incorporated companies. The first company, which is generally tax resident in Ireland, pays royalties to use intellectual property, which generates expenses that reduce the amount of tax paid in Ireland. The other company, typically incorporated in Ireland but not tax resident in the country, collects the royalties in a tax haven such as Bermuda or the Caymans, thereby avoiding Irish taxes.Luxembourg (tax on interest income): A Cayman Islands company could lend money interest-free to a Luxembourg subsidiary which then lends the money on to another operating company elsewhere. The notional interest the Luxembourg company is paying on its loan is set off against the interest it is receiving from the operating company. That results in a very low effective tax rate on the interest, far lower than the headline tax rate of 29 per cent.Netherlands (hybrid structure): A US multinational forms a Dutch limited partnership and a corporation which are both treated in quite different ways by the US and Dutch tax systems. The result is that if the partnership makes a loan or licenses intellectual property to the corporation, little or no current tax is paid in either the Netherlands or the US.
302;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:58:35+0000;Looking into sweetheart tax deals;;Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg have long been suspected of wooing multinationals through tax deals. But Brussels’ preliminary inquiry into whether some of the tax deals are in contravention of EU state aid rules, adds political pressure at a critical juncture for the countries already under pressure from international efforts to tackle tax avoidance.The European Commission’s move to issue questions to the three member states about their tax relationship with individual companies, including Apple and Starbucks, follows recent publication of an action plan by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which is designed to close corporate tax loopholes that have enabled companies to save tens of billions of euro in tax over the past decade.The Group of 20 endorsed the OECD action plan last week at their meeting in St Petersburg and urged countries to examine how their own tax rules contributed to profit shifting. Tax justice campaigners have highlighted the issue of tax avoidance for over a decade but the issue has moved centre stage since the financial crisis as governments struggle amid a slump in tax revenues. Investigations by national parliaments in the UK, the US and the Netherlands in recent months have shone a light on the huge scale of the tax avoidance by companies, which deploy complex schemes that exploit loopholes in tax laws.“Parliamentary action has brought the issue to the attention of the public, who have initiated boycotts of Starbucks and Amazon products in the UK,” said Sorley McCaughey, head of advocacy at Christian Aid Ireland, which campaigns against tax avoidance.Luxembourg has had a lower profile in recent controversies than some other centres but it plays a central role in international tax planning and has frequently faced hostility from other tax authorities. Lawyers say that Luxembourg is noted for the secrecy around its system of advance rulings by the tax authority which often results in companies paying very low tax rates. One said: “These rulings are held by the tax authority and cannot even be seen by the client.”Tax justice campaigners highlight how small- and medium-sized businesses do not have the means to employ complex strategies to make use of loopholes, putting them at a disadvantage when competing against multinationals, some of which pay as little as 2 per cent tax on overseas profits.Ireland (‘Double Irish’): This structure relies on two Irish incorporated companies. The first company, which is generally tax resident in Ireland, pays royalties to use intellectual property, which generates expenses that reduce the amount of tax paid in Ireland. The other company, typically incorporated in Ireland but not tax resident in the country, collects the royalties in a tax haven such as Bermuda or the Caymans, thereby avoiding Irish taxes.Luxembourg (tax on interest income): A Cayman Islands company could lend money interest-free to a Luxembourg subsidiary which then lends the money on to another operating company elsewhere. The notional interest the Luxembourg company is paying on its loan is set off against the interest it is receiving from the operating company. That results in a very low effective tax rate on the interest, far lower than the headline tax rate of 29 per cent.Netherlands (hybrid structure): A US multinational forms a Dutch limited partnership and a corporation which are both treated in quite different ways by the US and Dutch tax systems. The result is that if the partnership makes a loan or licenses intellectual property to the corporation, little or no current tax is paid in either the Netherlands or the US.Earlier this year the US Senate investigations committee accused Ireland of being at the centre of a complex tax avoidance strategy devised by Apple, which it said enabled the company to avoid US taxes on $44bn in otherwise taxable offshore income. The committee’s report claimed Apple reached a special deal with Ireland to apply a tax rate of less than 2 per cent on any profits that are taxable in the country – well below the 12.5 per cent Irish corporate tax rate.Dublin rejected the findings insisting Ireland has nothing to hide. “The government is absolutely clear: talk of Ireland being a tax haven is wrong,” Richard Bruton, Ireland’s business minister, told reporters recently.The questions from Brussels are expected to focus on how exactly national authorities make tax rulings when they evaluate multinationals’ tax returns. It is unclear whether it will address complex tax avoidance schemes deployed by multinationals, which have been nicknamed the “Double Irish” and “Dutch Sandwich”.These schemes are at the heart of multinational tax avoidance in the EU. Companies use loopholes in Irish and US law to incorporate subsidiary companies in Ireland or the Netherlands, but with parent companies that are tax resident in havens such as Bermuda. They then funnel profits through subsidiaries to reduce their tax burden.The action by the OECD and G20 has prompted a rethink in the Netherlands, where the government this month unveiled plans to crack down on the use of so called “letterbox companies”, which do no real business in the country and exist largely for tax purposes. The new plans will be the subject of fierce debate Thursday in the Dutch parliament's finance committee, with letterbox-company administrators and tax-justice advocates both scheduled to testify.But in an interview last week with the Financial Times, Frans Weekers, the deputy finance minister, said he will not make changes that discourage real business in the Netherlands. Many multinationals that use the Netherlands' tax rulings have substantial Dutch subsidiaries, including Starbucks, which has over 100 employees at its European headquarters and bean-roasting plant in Amsterdam.But Ireland, which is recovering from a deep financial crisis, has so far resisted making any unilateral move to amend its tax code or its 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate- a cornerstone of its enterprise policy.The country is hugely reliant on foreign investment with 150,000 people employed by multinationals and Dublin worries any tinkering with its tax policy could deter investors.“The Dutch are quite skilfully trying to take the heat off themselves by saying they will do something on tax avoidance,” said James Stewart, associate professor of finance at Trinity College Dublin. “But in Ireland there is still not official acknowledgment of the problem. I think we are missing the public debate on this.”
303;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-09-10T22:41:10Z;Alsea gobbles up Walmex restaurant chain for 8.2bn pesos;;"Nearly three months after putting its restaurant chain, Vips, up for sale, Wal-Mart de México y Centroamérica has finally found a taker: Alsea, Mexico’s largest fast and casual-restaurant operator, as well as the sole owner of all Starbucks coffee shops in the country.The price tag for the 362-oulet chain? 8.2bn pesos ($627m).For Walmex the sale should be something of a relief. The Vips chain was a big distraction from the retailer’s core business, which is suffering from an economic slowdown and greater competition from rivals.Many analysts and investors had lobbied for Walmex to get rid of the chain. The pressure intensified after it emerged that a large investment would be needed to update the restaurants to fend off competition from other rising, low-price chains such as Sanborns, Toks and Wings.Still, as the largest restaurant chain in the country, with 362 outlets, there are reasons Alsea would find Vips attractive.Until now, Alsea has specialized in so-called casual-dinning restaurants, as well as fast-food outlets. The company manages in Mexico the Italianni’s, P.F. Chang’s China Bistro and California Pizza Kitchen chains, among others.It’s also the largest operator of Domino’s Pizza and Burger King restaurants in the country.One thing that Alsea did not have have, however, was a Mexican restaurant chain.While Vips might not sound Mexican, it does offer a wide range of local dishes, from enchiladas to chicken tacos to noodle or “fideo” soup.“The Vips brand complements our current portfolio and will help us with our diversification strategy from the point of view of concepts, as the Vips restaurants offer mainly Mexican food and is primarily focused on a demographic not served today by our restaurants,” said Alberto Torrado, Alsea’s board president, in a statement.The company, which has had the fastest growth rate in the casual-dining restaurant segment in Mexico over the past 10 years, will be able to broaden its presences across the country thanks to the Vips acquisition. This might later on help expand some of its other brands to places where they currently have no presence. The Vips restaurant chain is in 65 cities and has 80,000 seats and 20,000 employees.Indeed, Vips will become Alsea’s largest restaurant chain. At the end of the first quarter, Alsea had 610 Domino’s Pizza units and 482 Starbucks coffee shops in the country, among the more than 1,400 food outlets it manages.For its part, Walmex gets to make a clean exit from a business that was profitable but which had little to do with its core business: supermarkets, of various sizes, qualities and formats.Related reading:

304;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-09-08T22:59:47Z;Revenue suffers big drop in yield from company probes;;The amount of additional corporation tax collected through investigations into Britain’s largest businesses has fallen to its lowest level since 2006-07, according to data which show that inquiries into some of the UK’s 770 biggest companies yielded just over £3bn in the year to March.Jason Collins, head of tax at Pinsent Masons, the law firm, said HM Revenue & Customs could face criticism for the fall in yield from those angered by the low tax bills paid by companies such as Amazon, Google and Starbucks. But the fall in compliance take was more likely to stem from reforms to corporation tax, he said.HMRC said the yield from its compliance teams was inherently “spiky” because it involved a relatively small number of cases that were responsible for a large proportion of revenues and the time to resolve issues was uncertain, particularly if litigation was involved.It said: “HMRC’s job is to enforce the large-business tax rules as passed by parliament. We do this extremely effectively, bringing in £23bn additional revenues from large businesses since 2010 alone.“HMRC exceeded its target for additional revenue raised from large businesses as a whole in 2012/13 and we have year-on-year increases in our targets for the next two years. The actual amount of yield will naturally fluctuate from year to year, depending particularly on major cases where inquiries are ongoing.”The large-business service, which deals with the 770 largest businesses, collected an extra £3.17bn in tax in 2012-13, an 8 per cent drop from £3.44bn the year before – and a 25 per cent drop on 2010-11. Extra revenue gained from challenging large businesses over how much corporation tax they pay peaked at £4.1bn in 2010-11.
305;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-09-04T23:01:29Z;Rush to US debt markets ahead of jobs data and Fed meeting;;Big companies are rushing to the US debt markets this week, trying to lock in borrowing costs at low levels before a possible jump in rates and ahead of important jobs figures and a Federal Reserve meeting.Large corporate borrowers including Starbucks, Home Depot, Caterpillar Financial Services and the UK’s Unilever Capital have tapped the US markets, selling a combined $10bn worth of new securities in a single session, according to Dealogic.The flurry of bond sales came after a slowdown in the past couple of weeks, which brought new debt offerings almost to a halt ahead the US Labor Day holiday. At least another $6bn in debt offerings from companies such as US home-improvement retailer Lowe’s and Nabors Industries, a Bermuda-based land drilling contractor, took place on Wednesday.Corporations are trying to fit in as many bond sales as possible in the days ahead of Friday’s closely watched release of US monthly payrolls data. The Federal Reserve at its meeting later this month may start slowing the pace of its bond-buying programme, sending benchmark interest rates higher.The market for investment-grade dollar bonds, in particular, could be hit by billions of dollars in additional supply.Verizon is expected to raise a portion of the financing for the acquisition of a 45 per cent stake at Verizon Wireless in a blockbuster debt offering that may exceed Apple’s $17bn record sale in April. The company is expected to start marketing the bonds as early as next week.“This month is shaping up as a very busy one,” said Justin D’Ercole, head of the Americas investment grade syndicate at Barclays.“There is a lot that could impact markets and rate-sensitive clients, such as the jobs report, Fed and ECB meetings, and additional supply. It’s not an easy window, but many clients may prefer to come with supply now, rather than try to forecast what the market is going to look like in a couple of weeks.”A combination of record low borrowing costs and strong demand for higher-yielding alternatives to top-tier government bonds have sent sales of dollar-denominated investment grade debt, excluding financials, to $448bn so far this year, according to Dealogic.Since the Fed first indicated it may start slowing down its aggressive stimulus policy in May, the yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose over 100 basis points to 2.86 per cent on Wednesday.Mr D’Ercole said, depending on how well markets absorbed a slowdown in Fed stimulus, debt sales could jump in the last months of the year. “One thing we know is that interest rates are going to be even higher one year from now. For many companies, this may be a good time to come to markets,” he said.

307;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-08-22T15:57:46Z;A place to tap the fuzziness between work and life;An upscale co-working space for New York entrepreneurs could be a glimpse into the future;"When serial tech entrepreneurs Joshua Abram and Alan Murray were trying to lure executives from big names such as Google or Goldman Sachs to work at their start-ups, they bumped up against a workplace problem. As co-founders of marketing technology companies Media6Degrees and Every Screen Media, they had got used to starting out in Starbucks or a hotel lobby, but it was new to their recruits.“These weren’t guys who were [lobbying] for a big corner office with a view,” says Mr Abram. “But they were people with established careers, and they cared about where they were going to work.”The pair say they were losing about half their candidates because they had no “theatre of operations”. They reasoned they were not alone, so they decided to fix the problem. They have opened Neuehouse, a five-floor, luxury co-working space on the edge of Gramercy Park in New York. Part-office, part-members’ club, it is being pitched as the first collaborative office space targeted “not at ‘start-up nation’, but an urban independent creative class in mid-career”.The “big bet”, as Mr Abram puts it, is that there is a growing number of entrepreneurs running small businesses who can also afford to pay a premium for aesthetics, logistical ease and like-minded company. It is a big bet: of Neuehouse’s $10m capitalisation, he and Mr Murray contributed “about 25 per cent”.“We live in a shared economy, where people are comfortable with not owning their car or their bicycle, and yet the one giant fixed cost that hadn’t been touched was real estate,” he says. Hence, unlike the tech-focused start-up spaces that prioritise economy and are predicated on a high churn of users, Neuehouse stresses environment and community, and assumes a long-term commitment. “All the studies of workplace happiness and creative productivity tie back to the question of ‘how do we feel when we walk in the door?’” says Mr Murray.This drove the decision to create a space that tapped into the fuzziness between work and life, that was “residential” as much as functional.Decorated by David Rockwell, a partner in the business and an architect also known for his work on set design, the space is all shades of chocolate and steel grey. “We specifically stayed away from playroom colours of the Googleplex,” says Mr Murray.The ground floor is a “gallery” space and the top four have wood-panelled cubicles that can house two to 10 people. There are also lots of social spaces – of Neuehouse’s 50,000 sq ft, 23,000 are communal. The idea is that you pay your fee – gallery membership costs $750 a month, and the fee for companies of four-plus starts at $6,000 – and everything except a computer is provided, including a social circle.The risk is that such a planned community can seem exclusionary, like a cool kids’ version of The Stepford Wives. But the co-founders describe their strategy as an “intentional community”, and point out that they have been careful to maintain a gender balance – 40 per cent of their members are companies led by women – and a mix of professions.So far they are 80 per cent committed, and members include music and hotel entrepreneur Chris Blackwell, fashion consultant Julie Gilhart and media maven Jefferson Hack. The venture will turn a profit next month.About a third of the membership is foreign, and there are plans to expand to at least 10 other cities including Los Angeles, Berlin, Shanghai and London.Mr Abram believes the potential of the boutique co-working space is the same as that of the boutique hotel; to transform our understanding of a market. “Now we all take it for granted,” he says. “But when Ian Schrager started, it was a revolution.”"
308;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-08-14T16:32:47Z;Western brands get a feel for Chinese customers’ needs on WeChat;;It is not just Durex, owned by Reckitt Benckiser, that found WeChat’s one-to-one messaging and other features useful for reaching potential Chinese customers.Starbucks, one of the first US brands to run a campaign on WeChat, asked its followers there to tell the company what mood they were in by messaging them an emoticon. In response, the company would send them an audio track of a song that matched their mood.Asking users about their feelings made the company itself seem welcoming, said Joseph Tsang, digital business director with ad agency Grey in Shanghai.As coffee itself is difficult to sell digitally, “they use the soft approach to make themselves your friend”, Mr Tsang said.One vodka company used the app to invite followers to an event it was holding in Shanghai. Bringing the invitation message on their smartphone to the event got them a special VIP card.Rand Han, head of the agency Resonance China that arranged the event, said the group also often uses the Twitter-like microblog Weibo but sending a message for an event that pops up on someone’s phone, compared with posting it on a website that also collates general news, is more personal.“There’s a slightly different spin,” he said.Other companies have found that using WeChat can make it easier to track ads’ effectiveness because each WeChat account links to just one person’s phone number, said Giulia Callegari, who works on luxury advertising with the agency Ogilvy in AsiaAdvertisers in China, like in the US and Europe, can track users’ behaviour online and are starting to develop ways to check whether their online followers make offline purchases. But, said Ms Callegari, tracking customer data online in China is still a bit trickier than in other markets.“A lot of luxury and beauty brands are starting to use WeChat because it’s one to one, it’s social, and you have the person’s number so hopefully you can match it to [other customer] data,” she said.This piece has been updated to reflect the correct spelling of ‘Joseph Tsang’
309;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;JC Penney: public spat;Retailer is struggling and Bill Ackman’s judgment is in question;So you are a billionaire investor whose reputation, not to mention business model and lucrative fees, rests on your ability to at least leave companies in a better state than you found them. Now imagine that the latest project has not gone so well.Bill Ackman is facing just such a scenario. He installed his own man at department store chain JC Penney in 2011. Penney turned, but down, instead of around. Under former Apple executive Ron Johnson, sales dropped 25 per cent and it posted a loss of nearly $1bn during the last fiscal year. Mr Johnson is gone and the chief executive Mr Ackman ousted is now back, and appears to be getting comfortable. The company is struggling and the board – which backed Mr Ackman’s decision but is happy for him to take the blame – has no sense of urgency. What to do next? Pick a fight.Mr Ackman has taken his concerns about interim chief executive Mike Ullman public, after threatening to resign from the board and sell his hedge fund’s stake – 18 per cent in stock and 7 per cent via derivatives. The stand may be a good pretext. Mr Ackman can either cut his losses – “I tried, but the directors were against me” – or recruit a new chief executive for a shot at redemption.JC Penney’s board, meanwhile, has come out fighting. Howard Schultz of Starbucks even jumped into the fray with a spirited defence of Mr Ullman, who is also on Starbucks’ board. But none of this is helping Mr Ackman to make up his losses. As the debate raged last week, the shares fell 8 per cent to close at $13 on Friday.The next few months are crucial, with the holiday season approaching. Mr Ullman may not be the visionary that people even beyond Mr Ackman believe JC Penney needs to revitalise the brand, but Mr Ackman’s own judgment is now in question. An old fashioned tussle is good theatre, but Mr Ackman et al are company directors, not actors. Their public spat is doing JC Penney no favours at all.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
310;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-08-09T19:19:27Z;Starbucks chief steps into JC Penney fight;;Howard Schultz, chief executive of Starbucks, has accused the hedge fund manager Bill Ackman of being a “destroyer of companies” as he stepped into a fight between the investor and the struggling retailer JC Penney.Mr Schultz, one of America’s best-known businessmen, spoke out after Mr Ackman, a JC Penney board member, wrote a letter urging fellow directors to find a new chief executive quickly and released it to the media.“I thought it was disgusting,” Mr Schultz told the Financial Times, accusing Mr Ackman of bypassing established governance procedures. “When I saw what happened [on Thursday] . . . I’m distraught.”The JC Penney dispute has escalated into one of America’s most public and ill-tempered corporate spats and marks a return to the days of activists as reviled insurgents.Mike Ullman, the JC Penney chief executive who Mr Ackman is trying to force out, is a member of the Starbucks board. Mr Ackman’s Pershing Capital owns nearly 18 per cent of JC Penney.“As someone who runs a public company, I’m speaking out on behalf of people whose livelihoods can be destroyed by people like this,” Mr Schultz said of Mr Ackman.Perry Capital, a hedge fund that owns 7 per cent of JC Penney, sided with Mr Ackman on Friday, saying it wanted JC Penney to hire Ken Hicks from Foot Locker as chief executive and appoint Allen Questrom, a former JC Penney chief, as chairman.Mr Ackman has already forced Mr Ullman out of the job once, in 2011, when the activist investor installed ex-Apple executive Ron Johnson in his place.But Mr Johnson oversaw a disastrous fall in sales and in April the board ousted him and rehired Mr Ullman.“Bill Ackman has blood on his hands for being the one who brought Ron Johnson in,” Mr Schultz said.Over the past decade the perception of activists has changed as many have sought to work with boards rather than against them, transforming themselves from agitators into mainstream advocates of shareholder rights. But Mr Ackman has often been ready to deploy the confrontational tactics of old.Mr Ackman did not offer a response to Mr Schultz’s criticism. However, he released a second letter to the board on Friday calling for JC Penney’s chairman, Thomas Engibous, to be replaced as well.Mr Ackman said his Thursday letter release was “an extraordinary step”, but that he did it because “our board has ceased to function effectively”.Mr Engibous counter-attacked on Friday, for the second time in two days, calling Mr Ackman’s comments “misleading, inaccurate and counter-productive”.JC Penney has initiated a search for a new chief executive, but Mr Ackman wants the company to speed up and find one in 30 to 45 days.Mr Ackman said: “I am concerned that a small subset of the board is negotiating and speaking on behalf of the full board, that the rest of the board has not been properly informed and has not been given an opportunity to express its views.”JC Penney shares were down almost 6 per cent at $12.85 in mid-afternoon trading in New York, after falling almost 10 per cent to a low of $12.34 in the morning.
311;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Abuse of language that keeps going forward;There is no link between business success and talking like a regular human being;"Two bad things can happen when you get back to work after a holiday: one small and the other big. The small thing is that your computer password has expired; the big one is that your job has expired too.Both happened to me last week on my return from a week away. The first was predictable, though still a mild downer as it involved dreaming up a string of new passwords all of which were rejected by the computer as insufficiently unmemorable.The expiry of my job wasn’t predictable at all. As the FT’s management bullshit correspondent, I always thought I had the most stable position in journalism. The bullshit market, as I’ve often pointed out, has only one phase – the bull phase – so there is never a shortage of things to write about.Yet in the space of one short week two disruptive things happened. First was the news that UK civil servants have been banned from using 30 ugly words. There will be no more “delivering” – unless pizzas are involved; no more “empowerment” or “facilitation”, and nothing will ever be “key” again, apart from things that fit in locks. “Going forward” – another banned phrase – there will be no more “fostering” without children and no more “driving” without steering wheels.A couple of days later Harvard Business Review published a blog with the title “Your Company is Only as Good as Your Writing”. Kyle Wiens, chief executive of iFixit, argued that good writing makes the difference between a good business and a bad business – a sale or no sale. From the rapturous response, his readers seemed to agree.While my back was turned, there has been a pincer movement from either side of the Atlantic. On this side, the weapon is compulsion, while on the US side it is an appeal to sense; either way, for a bullshit correspondent it is worrying news.Wondering what to do with the rest of my life, I started mournfully sifting through my emails, but almost at once came on something cheering. Howard Schultz had been asked if Starbucks planned any more acquisitions, to which he replied: “I would say that we have enough to digest in the near-term, and there’s nothing candidly in our sightline that would suggest that we’re involved in engaging anything that we’re going to acquire.”This is diabolical. It is 34 words, where one would do. It is self-important, horribly waffly, and makes a queasy nod towards honesty that makes one suspect the reverse.It should be taken seriously, not just as a reminder of how business people are addicted to abusing meaning, syntax and metaphor, but to show that Mr Wiens is wrong: there is no link between business success and talking like a regular human being. The company that launched the Caramel Frappuccino has no problem selling things.Mr Wiens supplies no proof that bad words mean bad business. Instead, the blog itself undermines the theory. Despairingly, he quotes his toaster manual, which calls the button that pops up the toast the “extra-lift carriage control lever”. And yet it is his toaster: however much he deplores the language, it didn’t stop him buying the machine.The sad truth is that words matter to only a few of us, and we get unreasonably agitated when people use them badly. But even sticklers end up buying toasters that abuse language, because a) there aren’t any that don’t, and b) the quality of the toast trumps the words that pop up alongside.If there is no business link between language and sales, there is no point in exhortation – which means the only way to improve matters is by following the civil service route and outlawing the worst phases.Yet history tells us that banning things people are hooked on does not work. Even among civil service mandarins, addiction to bad language starts at the very top. In the blogs by Sir Bob Kerslake, head of the civil service, there are orgies of delivery in every entry. He “delivers” results, budget cuts and services with equal aplomb. Only in the last post – two days after the ban – does Sir Bob go cold turkey on delivering, though I see he couldn’t resist a “key” or two.He begins this last post: “Having benefited from investment in my personal development over the years, I am passionately committed to the Civil Service being a learning organisation.” The civil service might be a learning organisation (whatever that is). But learning how not to talk flatulently about passionate commitment is going to be very hard indeed.What is my key takeaway from all this going forward? I would say there is nothing candidly in my sightline that would suggest that my job has expired at all.lucy.kellaway@ft.com——————————————-Letter in response to this column:Here’s a blogger’s doozy for you, Lucy / From Ms Margaret McGirr"
312;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Earnings in focus for US stocks;Starbucks up, Expedia down on mixed reports;Earnings were still in focus on Friday as the S&P 500 finished the day nearly unchanged and Starbucks shares rose after the company reported revenue and net income that beat expectations.The coffee shop chain was up 7.6 per cent to $73.36 after it said that global sales rose 13.3 per cent, but that it continued to struggle with profitability in some parts of the world.Starbucks has been criticised for not paying taxes in the UK. The company has said that it has been unable to turn a profit due to mistakes in its expansion plans.The Seattle-based company is up 36.8 per cent on the year to date.Elsewhere on Friday, online travel company Expedia reported earnings per share that broadly missed estimates. Shares were off 27.4 per cent to $47.20.Competition from other discount travel sites has squeezed the company’s revenue and forced it to spend more on advertising.Computer game developer Activision Blizzard rose 15 per cent to $17.46 on news that the company has agreed to buy 429m of its shares from French media company Vivendi.An investment company operated by Activision’s chief executive and its co-chairman will separately buy 172m shares, also from Vivendi.Company earnings were the focal point for the week, as investors drove most trading in some of the largest US brands.The S&P 500 rallied late on Friday to finish flat, leaving the benchmark index down fractionally for its first weekly loss since a sell-off in June was triggered by concerns over near-term plans from the Federal Reserve to taper the quantitative easing programme.Some high profile earnings reports sent shares sharply higher. Tech stocks fared somewhat better than the average, helping the Nasdaq to add 0.7 per cent on the week at 3,613.16.Apple, the heaviest-weighted stock on the Nasdaq, rose 3.8 per cent on the week after reporting iPhone sales that stymied fears about demand in the smartphone market.Social network Facebook was another tech standout, with shares jumping 31.4 per cent after a midweek earnings report showed growth in advertiser numbers and mobile ad revenue.Homebuilders, which have been among the best performing stocks in the past 12 months, fell sharply over the week on worse than expected order expectations.DR Horton and PulteGroup, the two largest US homebuilders, were off 12.4 and 15.5 per cent respectively, as investors began to factor in rising interest rates on the US housing market.The Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.1 per cent to 15,558.83 on the week, with US blue-chips AT&T and Caterpillar both declining on weak earnings.AT&T fell 0.6 per cent as it reported net income that missed expectations and customer growth that lagged behind rival Verizon.Construction equipment maker Caterpillar declined 4.2 per cent to $82.06 on concerns about the global economy. The company also cut its full-year guidance.With the earnings season just past the halfway mark, results so far have been tepid.Of the 52 per cent of companies that have reported revenue, 44 per cent have missed expectations, according to data from Thomson Reuters. In a typical quarter, only 38 per cent miss revenue projections.The combination of elevated stock prices and concerns about the US economy have pushed investors to focus on revenue growth and forward guidance. Many companies have focused on improving margins to boost earnings numbers, a move that can only help so much.“To take another sustained move upward in this very long bull market . . . quality of earnings is going to start to be important. We’re going to start needing to see some top line growth,” said Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners, a New York-based hedge fund. “Cost-cutting, financial engineering, I don’t think companies are going to get paid for that going forward from here. They’re going to need to show some legitimate growth.”
313;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks points to progress in UK business;;Starbucks, the coffee chain that volunteered to pay extra UK tax to defuse public criticism, said it was making progress in reforming its UK business but would not say when it would turn profitable.“As we approach the several quarters ahead, we’ll be in a better place,” Troy Alstead, chief financial officer, told the Financial Times, but he declined to be more specific.Starbucks has said its low tax bill in the UK reflects the fact its business has been losing money in the country for several years, but last year it faced a barrage of criticism from politicians and the public.Last month it paid £5m in corporation tax in the UK– its first payment since 2008 – having caved into the criticism at the end of last year and pledged to make tax payments that were effectively voluntary.Mr Alstead said the tax issue “remains a concern because it’s been a concern to our customers”.He added: “We’re always conscious of and take very seriously how our customers feel about us . . . We’ve taken some hits . . . We think we’ve done our best to respond to that.”Starbucks’ efforts to generate a profit in the UK include selling some of its stores to licensees and overhauling its distribution system to reduce costs.Mr Alstead was speaking after Starbucks released results for the quarter to the end of June, when the UK’s poor performance – albeit not reported separately – showed up in the low profits of its Europe, Middle East and Africa regional business.The region had an operating profit margin of 3.2 per cent, compared with 22.3 per cent in the coffee chain’s Americas business and 36.2 per cent in its China and Asia-Pacific division.For the quarter, Starbucks’ global sales rose 13.3 per cent to $3.7bn, exceeding Wall Street expectations. Its net income increased 25.4 per cent to $417.8m, or 55 cents per share, narrowly beating analyst forecasts of 53 cents.Starbucks shares jumped 6.1 per cent to $72.34 in after-hours trading following the release of its results.
314;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-07-22T17:10:05Z;Starbucks takes its Mexican partner south;;"Alsea, the operator in Mexico of the Starbucks chain of coffee outlets, is to take over 100 per cent of the Seattle-based company’s operations in Argentina and Chile.The decision is recognition of the advantages Starbucks has found in a trusted local company that helps it to better understand and operate in Latin American markets.Alsea has operated Starbucks in Mexico since 2002 and opened 382 coffee shops in the country. It operates a roster of other fast food outlets in Mexico that includes Domino’s, Burger King and Chili’s. Starbucks and Alsea were already partners in Argentina and Chile, but last week’s announcement puts Alsea fully in charge of the Starbucks’ operations in the three nations.“Our partnership of many years with Alsea and the success we have had together, have given us the confidence to expand our strategic partnership,” said Cliff Burrow, president of Starbucks for the Americas. “Alsea’s business model has demonstrated the capacity to replicate the successful culture and philosophy of our brand Starbucks”.Many Latin markets have seen the arrival in a new middle class over the past decade, with larger disposable incomes and clear aspirations of enjoying world-known brands. Coffee consumption has risen accordingly, giving rise to local competitors with similarities to Starbucks.In Mexico, two coffee chains that have emerged quickly in the past couple of years are Punta del Cielo and Cielito Querido, which are posing a challenge to the dominant position so far enjoyed by Starbucks.Both chains have sought to differentiate themselves from the US giant by emphasising their Mexican origins, promoting Mexican coffee and Mexican beverages such as café de olla – a sweet type of Mexican coffee with added cinnamon.Yet both Mexican companies also seek to adhere to the Starbucks formula of inviting people to have different types of experience while drinking different types of coffee – lattes, frappuccinos, cappuccinos – in well-lit branches with a cool ambience.Starbucks’s decision to venture south with Alsea is no big surprise. Their partnership has shown growing signs of trust and reliability. Back in October 2007, Starbucks invited Alsea to buy an 82 per cent stake in its Argentine affiliate and an 18 per cent interest in its Chilean one.And it rewarded Alsea after five years of partnership by extending the expiration date of their partnership contract to 2027, from a previous end date of 2022.In return, Alsea committed to openning 225 additional coffee shops in Mexico and 75 more in Argentina by 2016.This year, the partnership grew closer when Starbucks gave Alsea the right to acquire the 18 per cent stake it didn’t own in their Mexican partnership, called Café Sirena. As a result, Alsea now owns totally that Mexican company, which controls all Starbucks operations in the country.Now the same treatment is being given by Starbucks to Alsea in Argentina and Chile. The only caveat is that Alsea must open a further 130 coffee shops in both countries by 2018.Related reading:

315;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Cricket, tax and when to do the right thing;Why should anyone go beyond simply obeying the law or the rules of the game?;"The world’s first international cricket match took place in 1844 in New York between the US and Canada. That cricketing rivalry has not endured, unlike the fierce contest between England and Australia, who began playing each other 33 years later, and who on Thursday begin the second of their current series of five five-day matches, at Lord’s, “the home of cricket”.The first of this year’s matches, narrowly won by England, was full of controversy, notably over the refusal of Stuart Broad, one of the English players, to leave the field when it was obvious to everyone except the umpire that he was out.Jonathan Agnew, the BBC commentator, was, like many, severely critical. “There is nothing within the laws of cricket that says Broad had to depart. But when he chose not to, it became an issue for the spirit of the game,” he wrote.Nonsense, said Kevin Pietersen, Broad’s teammate. “You respect the umpire’s decision,” he said. The players obey the rules.This immediately reminded me of US companies such as Starbucks, Amazon and Google, which defended their tax-reducing arrangements by saying they, too, were within the rules. “If the international tax regime changes, we will absolutely follow it,” said Eric Schmidt, Google’s executive chairman.I wasn’t the only one to spot the tax-cricket connection. Andrew Strauss, former England captain, contrasted Broad’s refusal to “walk” with the fine and suspension given to a West Indian player who claimed a catch that he knew wasn’t clean. “Not walking in cricket is a little like tax avoidance. It is frowned upon to various degrees according to the audacity with which it is applied. Claiming a catch that you know you have dropped is far more like tax evasion, which is against the law . . . Neither policy is right morally but one is deemed semi-acceptable,” Strauss wrote in The Sunday Times.There is enough material there for an entire conference, as the psychiatrist said of Basil Fawlty, but let us start with the basic question: can you, in business or sport, get away with merely obeying the rules?The bald answer is “yes”, although there are attempts, in business, to extend the law to behaviour that would previously have attracted only popular opprobrium. For example, the UK government is proposing that bankers’ “reckless misconduct” be made a criminal offence.Some legal experts have said this is unlikely to result in convictions because the law dislikes vague attempts to regulate conduct. This was why the US Supreme Court limited prosecutors’ right to use the “honest services” statute employed in the trials of Jeffrey Skilling, the former Enron boss, and Lord Black, the one-time press proprietor.So why should anyone go beyond simply obeying the law or the rules of the game?Both sport and business require a certain amount of mutual trust; you treat people well in the hope they will reciprocate. So footballers kick the ball out of play when an opponent falls injured because they want the same consideration. There have been business equivalents, such as companies allowing each other more time to settle bills, but these have come under strain as economic conditions have worsened.Another reason for going further than the law requires is that you don’t want to alienate the people who keep you in business. So Starbucks agreed to pay £20m in UK taxes to take the sting out of a threatened customer boycott.Sports people worry less about losing customers. While Broad’s standing his ground was widely debated, stands will be packed for the entire England-Australia series.The final reason for going further than the rules require is because it is right.Adam Gilchrist, the Australian cricketer, was known for “walking”, even when the umpire thought he was not out, but he was criticised by some for letting his team down.This is what makes doing as your conscience tells you so rare: there are others – shareholders, teammates, fans – who are counting on you to win and who ask who you think you are to put your own qualms ahead of the rules.Yet I imagine Gilchrist will look back on his career with more pleasure than many others.And that US-Canada match? According to an account by ESPNcricinfo, Canada won, after a US batsman came late. When he arrived, the game formally over, the Americans asked the Canadians to allow him to bat. They refused.michael.skapinker@ft.com——————————————-Letter in response to this article:Stump up, if that’s the spirit of the law/ From Mr Jay Elwes"

An identical table is right behind mine and every time its occupant moves, I get jabbed in the back. The cash register opens and closes. The steam machine hisses. Welcome to my new office: Starbucks, Highbury Corner, north London.Until now, I’ve never had the slightest desire to bring my work to a coffee shop. My children swear it’s where they do their best work. Luke Johnson recently wrote a column in the Financial Times saying they are perfect places to start a business. If the alternative is the kitchen table, then I suppose Starbucks has something going for it. But for those of us with free offices, I can’t see the big draw.Last week, I read two articles that changed my mind. First, a blog post in Fast Company arguing that we should all periodically decamp to cafés as the break to routine makes us creative, and the absence of colleagues makes us productive. The second was a piece in the New York Times saying that the background sounds in coffee shops are so conducive to work that they are being piped into office buildings as white noise.So this morning I set off for my new workplace. The commute was a dream – four minutes by bike. Some of the time saved was lost queueing for coffee, but when I got to the front and parted with £2.15 for a “tall” cup of beige milk, I felt pleased with the bargain: it comes with an unlimited side order of table, chair, WiFi and electricity.“Do you mind people sitting here all day over one coffee?” I ask the woman at the till. “No!” she beams. “I like it. They keep me company.”It’s a rum business model. The argument goes that people with laptops look cool and give the place a buzzy atmosphere; I can’t imagine that I look any cooler hunched over my computer than my bald and paunchy neighbour looks hunched over his.In advance, I’ve been doing some homework on how best to work in a café. You might have thought it is easy: get coffee, sit down, open laptop, work. But no. There’s a whole page on WikiHow about the “coffee shop experience”, advising clothes that are “comfortable but elegant” and that you sit far from the door and the till.I settle at the only free table and remove the previous occupant’s squalid litter. The background noise is quite nice – both upbeat and soothing. The foreground noise is less so. A mobile goes.“So no, yeah, it was all good. So, like, basically, yeah, all good. No, I’m literally at Starbucks. I came to charge my phone …. ” I turn round. He’s plugged in his mobile, but hasn’t even bought a drink.I’ve finished mine, and need the loo. WikiHow does not advise on how to deal with this eventuality, so I decide to take all my stuff in with me. When I return, my table has been taken by someone else.I leave Starbucks and head down the road to Euphorium, a brighter and groovier independent coffee shop. I get a nice table, and even though it’s barely 11am order a salt beef bagel. I enter the WiFi password and get down to work. Within five minutes I’m joined by two women, each with a buggy the size of a small car. In one a baby screams. “Oh, Oscar”, says his mother.With some effort I block this out, but when I look up, someone is waving at me. It’s the mother of a boy my son knew at primary school, who comes over to say her boy has just got into Oxford university and that he’s spending his gap year acting in some Hollywood film. Great, I say, continuing to type. In the office this trick always works: colleagues take the hint. But in coffee shops it does not seem to work at all. When I finally get rid of her I order a strawberry tart to lift my spirits. And then a cappuccino to lift them some more. While I drink it I read something from the New Yorker online about how caffeine destroys your creativity.I don’t believe this any more than I believe that working in a café can increase it. There is only one effect coffee shops have for sure: they are rough on your skeleton. The chairs are designed to be sat on for half an hour – not all day.After three hours, my back hurts and carpal tunnel syndrome can’t be far off. They are rough on the stomach too: two coffees, a Diet Coke, a bagel and a tart, and it’s not quite lunchtime.I’ve just googled famous people who work in cafés, and at the top of every list is JK Rowling. I now forgive her everything. If she wrote Harry Potter sitting in a coffee shop, she could surely have managed Middlemarch in Locked in their own little laptop universes, nobody talks / From Mr Eugene Versluysen. a quiet office with a comfortable chair.lucy.kellaway@ft.com——————————————-Letter in response to this article:Locked in their own little laptop universes, nobody talks / From Mr Eugene Versluysen"
317;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-06-25T19:56:59Z;US businesses give mixed reaction to Obama’s emission cuts plan;;Several large US companies spoke out on Tuesday in support of President Barack Obama’s plans to curb greenhouse gas emissions, although other companies and business lobby groups signalled their intention to fight his proposed new regulations.Businesses including Mars, the privately held confectionery group, and Swiss Re, the reinsurance company, issued statements urging action to tackle the threat of man-made global warming.The companies are signatories of a recent declaration that the US should be “taking the lead” in addressing climate change, which is also backed by businesses including General Motors, Starbucks, Nike, Intel and Unilever.Mark Way, Swiss Re’s head of sustainability for the Americas, said: “We applaud this announcement by the president . . . We view the threat posed by climate change as a very real one. As a society we need to act now and not stick our heads in the sand.”The Geneva Association, the global insurance trade body, warned on Monday that some coastal areas of the US and UK were becoming “uninsurable” because of the rising risks created by global warming.Mars said climate change would affect its business because of its impact on agriculture, and said: “It is imperative we continue to improve sustainability in our approach to business, as well as the way we create policy.”However, some business lobby groups attacked Mr Obama’s proposals, warning they would cause severe damage to the economy.Tom Donohue, president of the US Chamber of Commerce, said the plans risked “punishing Americans with higher energy bills, fewer jobs, and a weaker economy” for negligible environmental benefits.He added: “American consumers, workers, and businesses simply cannot afford another smothering layer of new regulations whose benefits are unproven and whose true costs are hidden.”The US coal industry, which would be the principal loser from Mr Obama’s attempt to curb greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants, was particularly vocal.Mike Duncan, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, which represents the coal-fired power industry, said: “This is going to be a legacy issue for the president: a legacy of higher energy costs, lost jobs and a shattered economy.”He added: “If the Obama administration fails to recognise the environmental progress the industry has made and continues to adopt more regulations, coal power could cease to exist which would be devastating for our economy.”The latest news and analysis on the world’s changing climate and the political moves afoot to tackle the problemThe shares of US coal mining companies have been falling sharply since details of Mr Obama’s plans began to emerge over the weekend.Alpha Natural Resources’ shares have lost 9 per cent of their value since Friday night, while Peabody Energy’s are down 10 per cent.Although the details of the plans for existing plants have not been worked out – Mr Obama is calling on the Environmental Protection Agency to come up with proposed rules in a year’s time and then final regulations a year after that – analysts expect their impact is likely to be to shift power generation away from coal and towards natural gas.Burning gas for power generates roughly half the greenhouse gas emissions of burning coal.The gas industry welcomed the president’s statement.Dave McCurdy, president of the American Gas Association, which represents gas utilities, said: “We envision a future where natural gas not only provides energy for homes and businesses, but runs a significant number of our vehicles, generates power and supports other forms of renewable energy.”Kevin Kennedy of the World Resources Institute, an environmental think-tank, said opponents of new regulation typically tended to overestimate its costs when debating whether it should be introduced.“Once regulations are actually in place, industries often find that their estimates have been overstated, and they are able to comply at a reasonable cost,” he said.
318;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-06-23T17:05:03Z;Starbucks pays first UK corporation tax since 2008;;Starbucks, the global coffee shop chain, has paid tax in the UK for the first time since 2008.The chain, one of a number of household names to face bruising attacks from MPs late last year after it emerged they paid little tax in the UK, caved into pressure in December and agreed to hand over £20m to HM Revenue & Customs by the end of 2014.Starbucks has insisted its UK business has consistently made a loss because of high rental costs. While the chain expects to make a loss this year too, it said in a statement that it “felt that our customers should not have to wait for us to become profitable before we started paying UK corporation tax.”Starbucks said it had already paid £5m and would pay the remaining £5m later in the year.The coffee chain said it had “decided to forgo certain tax deductions” in order to pay more tax than it needed to in the UK.It was “also undertaking measures to make Starbucks profitable in the UK, such as relocating unprofitable stores to more cost effective locations, closing them where that is not possible and placing greater reliance on franchised and licensed stores.”Up to the end of last year, for the 14 years it had been in the UK Starbucks had paid only £8.6m in corporation tax from sales of £3bn.
319;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Even Starbucks gets the China real estate blues;;"China’s soaring property prices have been a problem for a long time. But this week, it was not the country’s nascent middle class complaining about rising rents. It was Starbucks.On Friday afternoon, the US coffee chain closed the coffee shop that had been its first in China. And if its staff is to be trusted, the reason was skyrocketing rent prices.CBD No. 1, a shop on the ground floor of the Chinaworld shopping centre, at the heart of the Chinese capital’s central business district, within a stone’s throw from a major subway station and next door to one of Beijing’s oldest five star hotels, has been busy around the clock with white-collar workers and business people ever since it opened in 1999.And yet, on Friday afternoon the shop invited loyal customers to celebrate with a last cup before closing its doors. According to a written statement Starbucks China provided to beyondbrics, the shop is moving to a newer part of the Chinaworld shopping mall to provide customers larger space and better decoration, and because the property management has its own plan for the vacated property.But according to staff at the store, the shop is closing because of a rent hike. “One problem is that we are too profitable, and the property’s management want to squeeze extra money from this place,” one employee told the FT. “Our daily income is Rmb30,000, which only equals to a luxury bag’s price. Of course they want to sweep out our store. Our monthly rent is Rmb110,000, which is rather cheap. So the property management wanted more than we can afford.”According to Chinese media, rent and wages for this particular Starbucks together cost more than US$1m a year.To Beijing residents, none of this is a surprise. The government has turned to radical measures to curb the unbridled growth in property prices, including limiting the purchase of residential property to one apartment per household and to households with permanent household registration status.But commercial property is much less regulated, and that has been pushing rental as well as sales prices in this segment on an even faster trajectory than residential property. According to Soufun.com, a Chinese online real estate portal, Beijing’s commercial property prices grew 22.83 per cent in May compared with the month before. This is far more than the 15.2 per cent month-on-month price increase seen in residential property.Many Beijing residents expressed their nostalgia on Sina Weibo, China’s leading Twitter equivalent, about the closure of the first Starbucks shop in China. But one customer was more anxious than others. If even Starbucks cannot afford it, he wondered, how on earth could normal people pay for property in China?Gu Yu and Kathrin HilleRelated reading:

320;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-06-20T21:52:47Z;Lombard: Tax breakdown rule would give avoiders the Willies;Cadbury’s contortions inspire distaste;Cadbury is mythologised in the UK as a Quaker confectioner hijacked by greedy Americans. But an FT investigation shows the company engaged in aggressive tax avoidance in the years leading up to its acquisition in 2010 by Kraft. The let-down is equivalent to discovering that crack Oompa Loompa accountants employed by Willy Wonka routed sales offshore to reduce his tax bills.Some transactions were shockingly artificial. For example, the group parked £400m in the Caymans so it could be lent back to Cadbury UK, reducing taxable profits. The transfer pricing strategies of contemporary hate figure Starbucks do at least involve coffee beans.Cadbury paid UK tax of just £6.4m annually on ongoing operations before the takeover, belying claims its purchase prefigured lower payouts to the Exchequer.The whiskery philanthropists who founded Cadbury would have disapproved. But by the time Kraft intervened the family stake was negligible and the company was run by an ex-lawyer who preferred fruit gums to Dairy Milk.Unabashed tax efficiency was what you would expect of a streamlined multinational. This was what Cadbury had become. Back then, neoconservative theorists extolled the hegemony of the corporation and UK tax officials charged mates’ rates to the biggest companies.In the postlapsarian present, Cadbury’s contortions inspire distaste. However, the factors underpinning them persist. These are the deductibility of interest and tax competition between states. Reform is unlikely. But a requirement for companies to publish a yearly breakdown of what tax they paid where would at least improve transparency. No one wants to be caught behaving like a Wonka.It’s the pixBricks and clicks good. Clicks but no bricks bad. Web device-to-white goods retailer Dixons Retail has taken £135m in charges on Pixmania, a French e-tailer bought in 2006. That figure will cover restructuring and a full impairment of goodwill.Dixons was left nursing a £115m pre-tax loss in the year to April 30, barely better than a £119m deficit last time. But there is an optimistic extrapolation. If multi-channel competition hurts an online-only vendor, prospects for its multi-channel owner could be better than digital prophets imagine. Maybe old school shopkeepers are not merely whistling in the dark when they insist websites can complement store chains instead of cannibalising them.The adjusted profits of Dixons – “earnings before bad stuff” as Panmure’s Philip Dorgan calls them – were up 15 per cent to £94.5m on rallying sales, beating forecasts. John Browett, the Dixons boss whose transplantation to Apple failed to take, injected system and vim into flogging tablets and kettles, a work continued by successor Sebastian James.It helps that Comet, the white goods business once owned by Darty, lies full fathom five, with capitalism’s bottom feeders picking its bones. Shares in Dixons, submerged at 9p in 2011, are now worth 42p. If you believe Mr James can go on building sales without the collapse of a competitor to help him, the stock remains a worthwhile recovery play. The shares cost 26 times “earnings before bad stuff”, compared with 17 times for Darty.Continent isolatedBritish exceptionalism in Europe is apparent in a different approach to capital adequacy as well as a preference for driving on the left. The Prudential Regulation Authority is imposing a minimum leverage ratio on banks as an adjunct to easy-to-game capital measures. But the PRA has taken a further tilt at Brussels by insisting that banks cannot lump in the loss-absorbing capital of insurers with their own.Permitting this was a crowd-pleasing departure by the European Commission from Basel III. Bancassurance is common south of La Manche. The British do not even have a word for it. The only big UK practitioner under the beady oversight of the PRA is Lloyds, owner of Scottish Widows, which was undercapitalised by £8.6bn at the end of last year.The PRA’s decision imposed no additional strain on Lloyds, which had anticipated the move. Indeed, Scot Wids announced a £1.6bn payout on Thursday, around £1bn of which will help reduce Lloyds’ capital shortfall to some £1.8bn.On one level the refusal to indulge bancassurers is part of the UK’s gold plating of capital adequacy for safety and City prestige. On another, it is just a victory for common sense. These are rare in a world where banks ascribe zero-risk weightings to Mediterranean sovereign loans and bolster profits with imaginary gains from discounted debt buybacks.
321;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-06-04T11:45:46Z;Andrew Cuomo proposes tax-free zones to lift New York economy;;While Apple, Starbucks and other big companies are drawing scrutiny for their low tax rates, New York’s governor wants to woo businesses with a promise of no taxes for 10 years.Andrew Cuomo has proposed tax-free zones centred around the state’s public universities to attract jobs. New and existing businesses that open near campuses would pay no corporate, property or sales taxes, and their owners and employees would be exempt from income taxes.“By tax-free, I mean really, really tax-free,” Mr Cuomo said last week as he toured the state to promote the plan.The plan comprises 120m square feet of space on and around dozens of State University of New York campuses and a number of private colleges, all outside Manhattan.It is Mr Cuomo’s latest attempt to jump-start the sluggish upstate economy by encouraging growth in the tech sector and changing New York’s reputation as a high-tax environment.Critics, however, say the programme risks favouring some businesses at the expense of others and would undermine an already weakened tax base in upstate New York – a broad swath that excludes the New York City metropolitan area.Cities in the state’s north and west that were once manufacturing and transportation hubs have seen businesses shutter and workers leave as the region failed to adapt to a post-industrial economy. Buffalo, for example, has lost more than half its population since its peak in 1950, when it was the nation’s leading industrial centre, largest inland port and 15th largest city.In the past decade, upstate job growth has run at 5 per cent, lagging New York City’s 16 per cent, the state’s 11 per cent and a national rate of 9 per cent, according to Economic Modeling Specialists, a labour-market data provider.The plan will “help end the brain drain that’s plagued our communities for years”, said Brian Sampson, executive director of Unshackle Upstate, a business advocacy group.New York has worked to develop a technology industry centred around its universities, including creating a $50m venture capital fund to invest in new companies. The tax-free initiative would help keep those businesses in the state, Mr Cuomo said, adding that as many as three-quarters of tech start-ups leave within a year.“If you just reduced the loss of jobs, that would be a home run. We create start-up businesses. Right now we just can’t keep them,” Mr Cuomo told the Financial Times. “They get their legs under them, so to speak, then they leave for a lower-tax environment.”New York faces competition from states such as Texas and Florida that do not have personal income taxes and where corporate levies are lower, a factor business leaders say hampers the further development of a local tech economy.“Look at the trajectory of growth in the tech sector in Austin [Texas] compared to New York,” Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, a business lobbying group, said recently. “Austin’s competitive pricing, quality of life and affordable housing allow them to attract a lot of companies that we would like to see growing in Brooklyn.”Although Mr Cuomo’s planned zones include five locations on Long Island and four in New York City’s outer boroughs, their focus is the upstate economy. This will probably mean an uphill battle for passage in the state legislature, which is dominated by representatives from New York City and its suburbs.While legislators have yet to weigh in on the proposal, it has drawn scepticism from observers on both the right and left. E.J. McMahon of the fiscally conservative Empire Center for New York State Policy said in a recent blog post that “the initiative is highly unlikely to generate growth on a game-changing scale”.“If our taxes are such a hindrance to growth, why not reduce them for everyone?” he wrote. “A more daring approach, for example, would be to simply phase out the state corporate franchise tax entirely throughout the 50-county upstate region, for all businesses operating there, whether new or existing.”Ron Deutsch of New Yorkers for Fiscal Fairness, a union-backed progressive group, warned that Mr Cuomo’s plan was too similar to the state’s now-defunct “empire zones”, which offered incentives to businesses who moved into low-income neighbourhoods. That programme became associated with fraud and abuse by companies who got tax breaks but created few jobs.Mr Cuomo said that the tax-free plan is different from the “complicated scheme” of empire zones, which had contained “a lot of fraud”.Mr Deutsch also questioned how the communities around tax-free zones would pay for services without tax revenue. “It doesn’t mean that these businesses don’t need municipal services – fire, police, sanitation, sewers, roads and bridges, schools. Somebody’s going to pick up the tab.”But Mr Cuomo said the increase in population from a revived economy would spur spending and bring in other revenue.“There would be more economic activity in the area that would only help,” he said. “Even if a person is not paying income tax to the state, they are still going to the grocery store and buying food, they bought a house that gave a real estate agent a commission, they’re buying a car from a local dealer.”
322;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-05-28T14:18:54Z;The benefits of business with no fixed abode;You can save money and have happier workers if they labour from home, car or an espresso bar;"Do entrepreneurs need an office? Increasingly the view seems to be no.A nifty new book called Out of Office by Chris Ward, is a manifesto in favour of roaming around using temporary hotspots to work. It was hard for me to resist this freelancer’s manual: the inside cover features a picture of one of my Gail’s bakeries.The author explains how President Barack Obama’s first inauguration speech was written by 27-year-old Jon Favreau sitting in Starbucks; how Richard Tait, creator of Cranium, started the board game in a coffee shop; how Michael Acton Smith invented the children’s virtual world Moshi Monsters in his local Caffè Nero; and how JK Rowling, the novelist behind Harry Potter, believes a café is the best place to write.It is a convincing narrative, and for basic start-ups it makes much more sense to work from home and public spaces such as cafés than committing to an expensive office lease. Offices are hard to find, costly to fit out and involve much tedious administration. Moreover, by staying independent you avoid the misery of a daily commute, which for many is the worst part of a job.Thanks to mobile communications, ubiquitous WiFi and cloud storage, together with the increasing irrelevance of heavy-duty equipment such as photocopiers, fax machines and desktop PCs, the traditional office is becoming redundant for many sorts of organisations and workers. Of course, factory managers, surgeons, chefs and industrial chemists are still tied to specialist locations. But many of us – from software engineers and copywriters to architects and fashion designers – can operate almost anywhere. That freedom, and a willingness to adapt, can make one’s career more enjoyable and, sometimes, more efficient.Some oppose flexible working. Notoriously, a few months ago Yahoo sent round a memo stating that all employees must work “physically together” – essentially banning working from home. The company worried that falling productivity was caused by remote staff, who cannot respond to issues as quickly, while missing impromptu meetings that can make an important contribution to an organisation’s output.Unquestionably, real collaboration and interaction are much harder using digital devices instead of face-to-face contact. A discussion using Skype is not as good as being in the same room, just as an email exchange is never as good as a conversation on the phone.But this is an age when fixed costs must be kept to a minimum. If founders or employees prefer the informal method of distributed working, then you can save money and have a happier workforce if they labour from home, car or a cool espresso bar.There are alternatives to relying totally on ad hoc spaces. New clubs are springing up that permit their members to hire smart board rooms by the hour for important meetings when you have to impress clients. In London, these include the likes of Adam Street, One Alfred Place, and The Clubhouse. Then there are co-working spaces, rather more basic resources with hot desking and a sharing ethos. And there are serviced office providers such as Regus, MWB and Workspace. They offer a much more structured solution to the problem of where you locate your business.I tried working from my study at home briefly and hated it. I needed to separate my domestic and work lives physically: thanks to always-on mobile devices this is hard to achieve anyhow. So I make the daily pilgrimage to a specific place of work, because I enjoy the sociability, and because when companies reach a certain scale they struggle to be taken seriously if the only meeting room is a coffee shop. Other challenges include a lack of confidentiality and the inability to tap nearby support.But I like businesses with small headquarters – they are better placed to minimise bureaucracy and office politics. In industries I know well, such as retailing and hospitality, it is assumed staff are on the road most of the time and hence they are able to share offices. This saves costs and keeps management close to customers and the action.Overall, the anti-office movement is probably a good thing for the morale of your people, your cost base and the productivity of your teams.lukej@riskcapitalpartners.co.uk

323;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-05-24T19:44:32Z;The right direction to point the finger of blame on tax;If companies are taxed inappropriately, only the legislators can be blamed;It was Apple’s turn in the line of fire this week. Tim Cook, its chief executive, was questioned by the US Senate investigative committee over claims that an Apple subsidiary filed no tax returns between 2009 and 2012 despite receiving $30bn of income.Apple, as Mr Cook robustly argued, has done nothing illegal. Instead, by registering the subsidiary in Ireland but managing it in the US, the company exploited an anomaly in the international tax system.Apple joins Amazon, Starbucks and Goldman Sachs as the latest corporate titan to be criticised for gaming the global tax system. In the UK it was Google and its chief executive that were under attack. “When Google does great things, I will praise you,” announced Ed Miliband, the leader of the opposition. “But when Eric Schmidt says that its current approach to tax is just capitalism, I disagree.”It’s rather difficult to see how anyone could disagree with Mr Schmidt’s explanation of why Google paid only £10m in corporation tax between 2006 and 2011 on revenues of £12bn. “Just capitalism” is, after all, the rule-book by which companies, particularly those that are publicly listed, have to abide, and the techniques used by Google and Apple are, tax experts agree, not at all unusual.It is an easy win for politicians to pour opprobrium on these techniques. But, if companies are taxed inadequately or inappropriately, the blame can be laid at only one door – that of the legislators who design tax codes. Companies should be run for the benefit of their shareholders and other stakeholders. They are not tasked with looking after the common good – governments are.The international tax system contains many exploitable anomalies. Ireland’s very low rate of corporation tax has given it a significant competitive advantage in attracting foreign investors. The Irish government is unwilling to give this up – despite the fact that it disadvantages the country’s EU partners and also, arguably, contributed to Ireland’s particularly acute form of the financial crisis.Italy’s corporation tax rate, meanwhile, is over 30 per cent, while the UK’s is set to fall to 20 per cent by April 2015. Already, companies such as Fiat Industrial are responding to the differential by moving their tax residence to the UK. This week’s Senate hearings aired another well-known anomaly – that the US taxes foreign earnings when they are repatriated, while most of the world’s leading economies impose little or no tax on international profits. This has encouraged US companies to keep their overseas income overseas – at the last count this totalled $1.7tn.Suggestions for how to reform the system are many and complex. Greater transparency is clearly useful. The EU agreed this week to compel large public and private companies to reveal their corporate profits and taxes on a country-by-country basis. However, this is often a relatively meaningless piece of information, given companies’ ability to move intangibles such as valuable intellectual property, brands and knowhow to low-tax countries.David Cameron says he will begin intergovernmental talks to overhaul the global tax system at next month’s G8 summit. Attempts to do so are likely to be an uphill struggle. But at least they may help point the finger of blame in the right direction.sarah.gordon@ft.com
324;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations.

325;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-05-23T17:39:33Z;EU rushes out corporate tax transparency law;;Big companies’ tax affairs in Europe are to be opened up to greater public scrutiny with the EU rushing out a law compelling them to reveal corporate profits and taxes on a country-by-country basis.Amid a political furore over allegations of tax avoidance by corporate-giants such as Apple, Starbucks and Google, the EU is extending transparency reforms for banks and resources groups to all large public and private companies.At a summit on Wednesday, EU leaders ditched longstanding reservations about more intrusive reporting rules and broadly backed a shake-up that could see a law passed as soon as this summer.The overhaul will have far-reaching implications for big multinationals in Europe, as most do not break down tax, profits, revenues and staff numbers by country. It would also pile public pressure on groups using low-tax bases such as Ireland or Luxembourg as a revenue hub for their European operations.Michel Barnier, EU commissioner for the single market, is working on legislative options for the disclosure rules, including by amending an existing proposal from April on corporate reporting of social and environmental issues.An alternative fast-track approach is for EU lawmakers to table amendments to new rules on accounting issues, which are almost agreed and is expected to be voted through by the European Parliament next month.Mr Barnier told the Financial Times: “It is necessary that large companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon that we have recently spoken a lot about – but not only these – are obliged to report how much tax they pay to whom and where.”Sharon Bowles, chair of the parliament’s economic affairs committee, said the change of heart from ministers to “force proper transparency” should be made law as soon as possible. The directives on the verge of being passed should be “reopened rather than waiting”, she said.Corporate tax avoidance has risen on the EU agenda in recent months after it emerged that a series of large multinationals paid little or no tax at all in many of the countries where they operate.Yet the boldness of the latest EU transparency drive will be a surprise to campaigners and companies.“We weren’t expecting this to come up [at the summit],” said Carl Dolan of Transparency International, the anti-graft lobby group. “There was no sense that this was going to be tackled now, especially as previous efforts to force extractive companies to report on a country-by-country level were opposed [by several member states].”Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, defended his company’s policies this week as US senators quizzed him over congressional charges that the company avoided billions of dollars in taxes on international profits.“We pay all the taxes we owe, every single dollar. We not only comply with the laws, but we comply with the spirit of the laws,” he said.Google’s chairman also defended the group’s tax practices after Ed Miliband, leader of the UK’s opposition Labour party, accused the US group of going to “extraordinary lengths” to avoid paying taxes.“In the tax controversy as it’s called I think it is most important to know that Google feels very, very strongly that tax information and tax policies should be done completely transparently,” said Eric Schmidt. “With respect to the current sort of issues, I don’t think a company should decide what tax policies should be, I think governments should.”

She has torn strips off men from Starbucks and Amazon in her rage against tax avoidance. Others have felt the lash, from HM Revenue & Customs to the big four accounting firms. Her steely stare unnerves many.Ms Hodge, 68, spent 20 years on Islington council, followed by more than 18 as Labour MP for Barking. This late flowering of her career arose in part because of reforms that ensured committee chairmen were elected rather than appointed, giving them more independence.Her gutsy performance in seeing off a challenge from Nick Griffin, British National party leader, for her seat at the last election soon after the death of her husband, the judge Sir Henry Hodge, impressed MPs.Ms Hodge, a former leftwinger who was an early backer of Tony Blair’s leadership, is often controversial. She faced criticism of her handling of a care home abuse scandal while head of Islington council in the 1980s, which resurfaced when she was children’s minister. In 2007 she was accused of playing into the BNP’s hands by saying allocation of council houses should favour locals. But at the 2010 election, she doubled her majority and all 12 BNP councillors lost their seats.Lord O’Donnell, former civil service head, has accused the PAC of “theatrical exercises in public humiliation” and Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, recently accused Ms Hodge of “political grandstanding”. But every report is agreed unanimously by a committee that has a Conservative majority.The combination of a sharp tongue with issues that resonate amid austerity makes her a formidable proposition.…Mushy peas againThanks to all who responded to last week’s item on mushy peas. This brought one of the biggest electronic mailbags in my almost four decades of journalism. To recap: while marrowfat peas cooked in their own juice have been eaten for centuries, I questioned how old the term was. I pointed out that although mushy peas are now a ubiquitous British dish, the earliest written reference in the Oxford English Dictionary was 1973, and challenged readers to find anything earlier.Enough readers have sent personal reminiscences – including one of a chip shop serving the dish in 1970 barely two miles from my childhood home in south Manchester – to persuade me that the term dates in many places at least from the 1960s and probably long before.The economist Diane Coyle wrote: “I grew up in Ramsbottom [Lancashire] in the 1960s and 1970s, and we always referred to them as mushy peas. Every Friday tea came from the chippy, and we’d take our plates and bowls over to the shop. My sister’s preference was an upside-down pea mixture, which had mushy peas on top of chips, turning the whole lot into green mush.”Various readers pointed to the Mushy Pea Stall in Norwich market, which opened in 1949. But not everywhere was the dish known as mushy peas. Anne Tansley wrote: “In my County Durham childhood of the 1950s cooked marrowfat peas was a ritual – steeped every Saturday night to go alongside the Sunday roast. We called them steepy peas – mushy was unheard of.”It remains odd that there are so few written references. The only reader to find one before 1973 was Daniel Goldblatt, a student at St Andrews, who found this in Mrs Eckdorf in O’Neill’s Hotel, a 1969 novel by the Irish writer William Trevor: “His noisy manner leaves him when he dispatches these words, for otherwise – when he tells his wife she is ugly or a bitch – he shouts, and bangs anything he can lay his hand on, a saucepan lid, a tin of mushy peas, a spoon.”Mr Goldblatt can claim his pint, pie and mushy peas when he likes.…English graveyardIn regard to the protests against Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence party, in Edinburgh last week, I suspect the tactic long deployed against English comedians by audiences at the Glasgow Empire – stony silence – might have been more effective.brian.groom@ft.com
327;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-05-18T02:32:36Z;MPs accused of ‘demonising’ US multinationals over tax;;MPs have been accused of “demonising” US multinationals over tax after Google was this week branded “evil” by the chair of an influential parliamentary committee.Amazon and Starbucks have also faced fierce scrutiny from MPs over efforts to limit tax payments in the UK.The National Foreign Trade Council, a US lobby group, said the criticism was “misguided and for political theatre” and questioned why MPs were failing to hold British businesses to account for similar practices.Catherine Schultz, vice-president of tax policy at the council, said: “Why have they singled out only American companies for this scrutiny?”Her comments followed a stormy parliamentary hearing on Thursday when Margaret Hodge, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, confronted Google executives over the internet group’s tax-efficient structure.Vince Cable, business secretary, later described Google’s behaviour as “amoral and not driven by ethical commitment”.David Cameron faces a potentially awkward meeting with Eric Schmidt next week when the Google chairman visits Downing Street.Mr Schmidt is a member of the prime minister’s Business Advisory Group, which has its regular quarterly meeting on Monday.The group is intended as a sounding board for Mr Cameron to hear the concerns and priorities of business and discuss policies for growth.
328;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-05-16T23:00:18Z;Peru: a new kind of corporate tax;;"As Google, Starbucks and Amazon have learned to their detriment, companies that take advantage of legal tax-avoidance schemes such as the “Dutch sandwich” and the “double Irish” are right up there with bankers in the public’s estimation.Peru’s tax office, Sunat, has found a way to help make the medicine go down, it seems, giving companies the option of paying part of their tax bill in the form of regional infrastructure works in some of the countries’ poorest regions.The mechanism is new and little-known, but catching on quickly.In the second trimester of this year, 12 companies funded projects worth $62.8m (165.4m soles), more than half the number of projects for 2012, and almost double the number of projects for 2011, when the scheme was inaugurated.Javier Illescas, executive director of Proinversion, the investment promotion agency that facilitates the projects, says companies can choose from approved lists of public works projects in various regions, or make their own proposals.It’s not surprising that mining companies such as Volcan, Antamina, Xstrata and Southern Peru, which are expected to fund significant infrastructure and community works as part of their social contract with communities, have been quick to spy the opportunity, using it to build new roads, potable water systems and agricultural irrigation schemes.But Telefónica Peru, Banco de Crédito, Peru’s biggest bank, El Comercio, Lima’s flagship daily newspaper, and Backus, the SABMiller subsidiary that is Peru’s biggest brewer, have also leapt in, funding, respectively, a citizen security monitoring system, highway improvements, renovations to the city of Trujillo’s theatre, and roadworks to improve the flow of traffic and pedestrians in the city of Arequipa.Companies are happy because all of these projects will look good in glossy annual reports under the heading of corporate social responsibility, and, presumably, improve the company’s image at the grassroots level. Given the rapid economic growth taking place in regional hubs such as Arequipa, Trujillo, Cusco and Ica, the chance to boost your company profile and social outreach at no extra cost is valuable. Regional governments are also happy, because they have one less public work to fund out of their take from mining and other royalties.“After a bit of a slow start, the amount of investment committed under the scheme has started to rise at an important rate,” Illescas told beyondbrics. “Investment in only the first half of this year has been more than 50 per cent higher than for the whole of 2012.”Related reading:

329;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-05-05T18:55:07Z;Autogrill to split food business from duty free;Italian group’s chief eyes growth in emerging markets;Autogrill, the world’s largest duty free and travel catering group by sales, has approved the demerger of its core food and beverage business and is considering tie-ups to tap the “vast opportunity” in emerging markets.The Italian group, which operates in 39 countries and manages airport, station and motorway concessions for the likes of Starbucks, Burger King and Brioche Dorée, approved the split of its catering arm from its smaller duty free business at the weekend.Gianmario Tondato da Ruos, chief executive, said the demerger would allow both sides of the business to more easily tap growth opened up by the development of travel infrastructure in China, India, Turkey, Latin America and Vietnam.“These countries are our future. They are opening up opportunities that didn’t exist 10 years ago. There are also now opportunities for business combinations that could open up these markets even more,” Mr Tondato said in an interview with the Financial Times.The logic behind the demerger is that, given the businesses have developed into different areas – and attract different investors – a separation is the best way to develop both. The food and beverage business is valued at about €4bn and the duty free about €2bn.Analysts consider Dufry, the Swiss operator of duty-free stores, as a possible merger partner for Autogrill’s travel retail business. In food and beverages, its competitors are Sodexho and Compass.Sales for Autogrill are strongly linked to changes in the global economy, as people tend to travel when they feel flush. Mr Tondato says the US economy is “entering another rhythm compared with Europe”. In Europe, travel on the roads is suffering, whereas the airports benefit from international travellers from emerging markets.As for Italy, a near two-year recession and infrastructure regulation dating from the country’s postwar boom has dragged on the profitability of the company’s food business, triggering Autogrill’s slow retrenchment in its home market.“In 2003, we generated more than 45 per cent of our cash flow in Italy. Now we make around 13-14 per cent. If you want to grow, you need to expand internationally,” says Mr Tondato.Mr Tondato says the oversupply in the motorway system in Italy must be dealt with. If the number of service stations is not cut, Autogrill could decide to exit its home market.“There is great resistance to change. If there’s not a change in Italy we’ll get out,” he says.Like Luxottica, the Italian maker of Ray-Ban and Oakley eyewear, and Italian chocolate maker Ferrero, Autogrill is a multinational defying stereotypes of Italian corporate provincialism.The Benetton family established Autogrill in the early 1990s and the knitwear dynasty still owns 59 per cent of its shares.In a similar vein to the Agnelli family at Fiat, the Benettons are happy to be diluted below 50 per cent for the right opportunity, such as a merger that creates value.For the catering business, the first step after the demerger, which is expected to be completed in September, will be to restructure to improve margins and cash generation, “in particular because of a slowdown in the highways business in Europe and Italy”, says finance director Alberto de Vecchi.“In retail the strategy is a completely different and the focus will be on growth of the top line. We have the best margins in the sector taking out the rents,” he says.Chiara Rotelli at Mediobanca believes the spin-off will “unveil the hidden value of the travel retail business”.Based on 2012 numbers, Ms Rotelli believes that if the travel retail business traded on the same multiples as Dufry, which is valued at 10.6 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, then the implied valuation of the food and beverage business would be 3.2 times ebitda.Ms Rotelli believes this is “a sharp and unjustified discount” to peers Compass and Sodexo, which trade at 9.5 times ebitda.The Autogrill listing will be in Milan, but the travel retail side of the group could go to another European capital. Analysts expect it will probably be Madrid, where Mr Tondato’s friend Pablo Isla has listed Inditex, owner of Zara.Mr Tondato will remain chief executive of the food and beverage side of the group. While he does not rule out retaining a chairman position at the travel retail group for a transitional period, he expects that the management team of the travel retail side will be confirmed in their positions.“I’m going to stay with the catering business. It’s more from the heart. I like eating,” he says with a smile. Before adding: “And I think there are great opportunities for growing the value of the business.”
330;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Independent coffee shops give big brands a brewed awakening;;"More than 20 people are in the queue at Stumptown Coffee Roasters on West 29th Street in Manhattan. While their patience is rewarded with a high-quality coffee, customers must jostle for a place to lean; there are no seats or tables. Chains such as Starbucks might offer faster coffee a couple of blocks away, but here at Stumptown the customers are happy to wait.A report this year by the New York Economic Development Corporation revealed that the city’s independent coffee shops outnumber its chains: out of a total of the 1,700 shops within the five boroughs, the 972 single-location or small-chain shops represent 57 per cent of coffee spots. With the competition thriving, established chains are looking at injecting some of the practices of the independent sector into their own offerings.Stumptown started out in Portland, Oregon and has now expanded to eight cafés and three roasteries across the US. With a competitive coffee-shop scene in the home town, operations manager Matt Lounsbury says the business learnt fast to compete on customer experience and quality of coffee. “You need a value-add,” he says, explaining that the company is introducing a “brew bar” to offer advice about the brewing experience. The idea is to help customers make coffee at home, rather than see this as a threat to the business. “When people buy an accessory or some beans, we’re there to help them make it as well as buy it.”On London’s Great Ormond Street, Ben Townsend is behind the counter at The Espresso Room, his café and one of the capital’s smallest at just 10 sq m. He is chatting with his customers, a mix of people who work locally, and staff and visitors from the children’s hospital across the street. “We work incredibly hard on service,” he says. “We work hard on mood – when the door opens, the curtain goes up. In a chain the mood is much more restrained.”Stumptown also has a close relationship with its coffee producers, and Mr Lounsbury thinks chains could learn lessons here. “We know where our coffee comes from, we care about where it comes from. And if customers are interested, we can practically get them the dissertation on where it’s from,” he says.In the UK, big brands such as Costa Coffee and Starbucks have experimented with adopting the feel of the independents. Alongside their standard shops, for instance, each has tried out concept stores featuring funky furnishings, bare brick walls and shared tables.Where big companies struggle is in scaling an independent’s level of customer service. With a smaller number of shops and fewer staff, many of whom are often obsessive about the product to begin with, the independents have a strategic advantage.Nonetheless, George Scott, a food and grocery retail analyst at Conlumino who also owns a café, believes getting staff passionate about the product is essential. “It’s not just about training people, it’s about exciting them,” he says. “That passion for the product is missing in the chains.”Of all the high-street brands, he suggests Starbucks has been most proactive. In its new Conduit Street store in London, for example, the company has made attempts to soften the layout with more neutral branding.But Mr Scott remains cynical about initiatives such as writing customer names on cups, which suggests a personal relationship that doesn’t exist. “A proper local coffee shop will know your name and usual coffee order,” he says. “If they actually have to ask your name, then it’s just very superficial.“Putting names on cups is more about process efficiency and getting orders out of the door fast than delivering an intimate customer experience.”"
331;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-04-29T17:37:54Z;Austerity exposes the global threat from tax havens;All eyes are turning to leaders to see whether they are beholden to the public’s needs, says Jeffrey Sachs;"The curtain has been pulled aside on the once secret world of tax havens, and the scale of abuse is nearly beyond reckoning. Week after week, Americans and Europeans worn down by budget austerity have learnt about the secret accounts of their politicians, tax evasion by leading companies and hot money destabilising the world economy. The darker truth is that these havens are not gaps in the world’s financial system; they are the system.The A-List provides timely, insightful comment on the topics that matter, from globally renowned leaders, policymakers and commentators.How many politicians and political parties have secret accounts abroad? Inevitably, given the nature of the arrangements, we cannot say for certain – but the list of those that have come to light is long. US presidential candidate Mitt Romney was found to have huge wealth in the Cayman Islands, never adequately explained. In France, Jérôme Cahuzac has resigned in disgrace from his position as budget minister following the revelation that he held a secret account in Switzerland. He has since been charged with tax fraud. Spain’s ruling party has been making payments from secret Swiss accounts for years. One senior Greek politician has been sentenced to jail for falsifying financial declarations. Many more revelations will come, especially now that investigative journalists have their hands on the records of hundreds of thousands of offshore accounts.Groups such as Apple, Google and Starbucks have been shown in recent months to have used outlandish accounting gimmicks to shelter their profits. These include Google’s claim, approved by the US Internal Revenue Service, that its intellectual capital resides in Bermuda. There are thousands more like them working with the tax authorities to keep their money out of reach. Banks such as HSBC and UBS have been caught in the money laundering that facilitates this process.How much tax revenue is lost to the global havens? Here, too, we can only guess but the numbers are likely to be vast. Recent estimates by the Tax Justice Network suggest that deposits are in the range of $21tn.The havens serve countless purposes, yet not one is for the social good. They support massive tax evasion. They underpin a global system of bribery to corrupt officials. They service the accounts of drug runners, arms traders and terrorist groups. They create veils of secrecy through shell companies, which allow tax evasion, land grabs and environmental destruction.The prime movers of the world’s tax havens are the US, Switzerland and the UK. Indeed, many of the leading havens, including the British Virgin Islands, Cayman and Bermuda, are British Overseas Territories. The secreting of trillions of dollars in the Caribbean has been undertaken with the support of America’s IRS, and with the approval of the US political class and Wall Street.These playgrounds of the rich and powerful were largely hidden from the public’s view during the long financial boom. In the new world of austerity following the 2008 crash, however, they are increasingly seen as a cancer on the global financial system that must be excised.The public’s animus was greatly accelerated by the Cyprus crisis. The island has for many years been a notorious secrecy-and-tax haven, especially for Russian money. Yet this was winked at rather than controlled. Then Cyprus blew up – a reminder of how an unregulated financial centre can quickly turn into a mortal threat to the world economy.Many of the reforms that are required are obvious. All foreign bank accounts in any jurisdiction should be reported back to the national tax authorities of the account holders. Unreported incomes diverted to overseas accounts in the past should then be taxed at national rates with penalties for evasion. The thousands of hedge funds and corporations domiciled in the Caribbean for operations in the US and Europe should be required to redomicile in the US and Europe. Beneficial ownership should be disclosed on all foreign-owned companies.Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, François Hollande, the French president, and David Cameron, the UK prime minister, have recently acknowledged the need for a serious clampdown, yet the real actions still lie ahead. Barack Obama, the US president, has spoken in the past about cracking down but has not said much recently. All eyes are now turning to US and European leaders in advance of the summits of the Group of Eight leading nations in June and the Group of 20 in September to see whether the politicians are beholden to the needs of the public or to heedless and destabilising private greed.The writer is director of the Earth Institute and author of the forthcoming book, ‘To Move the World: JFK’s Quest for Peace’"
332;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Starbucks seeks fresh US tax breaks;Coffee chain lobbies Congress after UK backlash;Starbucks has launched a US offensive to protect and expand tax breaks on foreign profits – just months after its tax structure provoked a political backlash and public relations crisis in the UK.In a letter to lawmakers on the House ways and means committee, which is weighing a sweeping overhaul of the US tax system, the coffee shop chain said its effective global tax rate exceeded 32 per cent.Starbucks is one of a dozen large US companies to have made individual submissions to the committee – offering a rare and detailed glimpse into its priorities for tax policy.Starbucks also said it was willing to consider forgoing some US tax breaks, including a domestic manufacturing deduction and accelerated depreciation for business investments, as long as the revenues could be used to lower the US corporate tax rate, currently set at 35 per cent.In addition, the coffee chain argued that Congress should continue the US tax deferral on foreign sales of coffee beans, which are protected by an “agricultural commodity exception” under US tax rules. It also asked that taxes on royalty revenues – at the centre of last year’s UK tax furore – should be deferred until the money is brought back to the US.At the moment, deferral is allowed for international royalty payments coming from unrelated franchisees, but not parties related to Starbucks.“This discourages Starbucks employing its core business model, which is to own and operate its stores,” wrote Brian Ugai, Starbucks vice-president for tax and customs. “Reform that provides consistent treatment of active royalties received from both unrelated parties and related parties . . . would be good tax policy, would increase Starbucks’ ability to compete in markets outside the US and would facilitate further growth of our company.”One Republican aide said Starbucks’ history in the UK had garnered “a lot of attention” from the panel.Starbucks ended up voluntarily paying £20m to the UK Treasury after an uproar over its low UK tax bill caused by the structure of its inter-company royalty payments. “It was used as an example of how, in tax reform here, that [issue] would need to be addressed,” the aide said, especially if the US moved towards a “territorial” system that imposed much less onerous taxes on foreign earnings.Starbucks told the Financial Times that it was “simply seeking a level playing field and fair treatment of income from royalties for US tax purposes regardless of the business structure from which those royalties are generated”.The company added: “To be absolutely clear, there would be no impact to the taxes we pay in the UK or any other country in which we operate outside the US.”Scott Dyreng, assistant professor at Duke University’s School of Business, said Starbucks had less room to lower its US tax bill than other companies that can easily shift profits on intellectual property – such as patents – to low-tax countries.Other big companies to make submissions to the ways and means committee included United Technologies, Honeywell, Hyundai and Walt Disney. Disney also said it was willing to give up its domestic manufacturing deduction – as well as a special tax break for film production – but asked lawmakers to enhance tax incentives for the generation of new intellectual property in the US.
333;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-04-18T17:14:06Z;Treasury uses tax levels to woo US groups;;The Treasury has stepped up its marketing of Britain as a “respectable” low tax country in a series of high level meetings with US businesses that played down the recent political row over avoidance.David Gauke, exchequer secretary, last week told US companies that the government had stuck to its plans in spite of public anger over corporate tax planning.“Since the controversy about large corporations and tax broke last year, we have twice announced further cuts in corporation tax,” he said.He told West Coast businesses that their ideas and intellectual property would be “taxed lightly” in Britain. But he said the UK was not a tax haven and had a “stronger reputation for respectability than some of our competitors” because it did not strike preferential deals with individual taxpayers.Britain’s attempt to woo US businesses is a sign of intensifying competition for inward investment following the decision to cut the corporate tax rate to 20 per cent by 2015. The cut signalled the government’s intention to stick to its policy of creating a business-friendly tax system, despite a public backlash after MPs accused Starbucks, Google and Amazon of avoiding tax last year.Mr Gauke said the UK was determined to tackle aggressive behaviour and “we do not expect businesses to pay no or very little tax altogether”.Matt Ryan, a tax partner of PwC, the professional services firm which took part in the discussions, along with senior officials from the Treasury and HM Revenue & Customs, said businesses, largely from the technology, insurance, oil and gas sectors, were interested in moving key operations to the UK.A handful of high profile businesses, including WPP, UBM, Aon, Rowan and Seadrill, have moved head office functions to the UK in recent months. Mr Ryan expected about 15 more to move in the next year.A recent survey by KPMG, the professional services firm, put Britain ahead of low-tax rivals such as Ireland, Luxembourg and Switzerland as multinationals’ favourite tax regime. The flow of foreign direct investment into the UK rose 7 per cent in 2011, according to a UN report, but this was not enough to prevent it slipping from fifth to seventh in the global league table of recipients.
334;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Little Chef serves up a turnround story;;"Little Chef is back on the block, with a price tag expected to be in the tens of millions of pounds on the motorway restaurant chain that has passed through a string of owners.R Capital, the turnround investor that bought the chain when it went into administration six years ago, has hired KPMG to find a buyer.The move indicates it has succeeded in turning round the company’s fortunes – not least by bringing in celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal to jazz up the menus in 2007. News of the appointment was first reported in the Sunday Times.Likely buyers are seen as service station operators, such as Welcome Break and Moto, as well as coffee chains such as Starbucks that are expanding in the UK.Despite having been around for more than half a century – with, some would say, little change in the menus over that time – Little Chef has been through many incarnations. The first Little Chef opened in 1958, the same year as Britain’s first motorway.Modelled on American diners, it became a well-worn feature of UK-style road-trips in the 1970s and 1980s. Owners included Trusthouse Forte, who stabled it together with more upmarket hotels; Trusthouse was in turn subsequently taken over by Granada and what is now Compass, a contract servicing group. It has also been owned by private equity firms.It expanded rapidly in its heyday, including through acquisition, but tough restructuring under R Capital saw cafés shed and there are now 78 outlets, from Scotland to Cornwall, all of which are said to be profitable."
335;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-04-03T19:15:20Z;KFC eyes more orders with ‘mobile wallet’;;Kentucky Fried Chicken has become the latest company to allow customers to use a “mobile wallet” to order and pay for food before they arrive at an outlet.The company has joined McDonald’s, Starbucks and other quick service restaurants trying to attract new customers and boost sales through smartphone apps and mobile payment systems.Forest Research estimates that mobile payments are expected to reach $90bn by 2017.“When you have a very comfortable ordering environment, like a smartphone, you just order more,” said Jeremie Leroyer, chief executive of Airtag, which built the app for KFC.He said mobile ordering for fast food restaurants would count for about 5 per cent of transactions in the next year, but expected that to “grow drastically” in the next two to three years.KFC implemented its technology in 10 locations in the UK on Wednesday, with the goal to extend it across the country, then to the US and the rest of the world.The move comes as companies from Google to start-ups race to build the default technology, in what analysts now refer to as the “digital wallet wars”.PayPal, the payment arm of e-commerce company eBay, is developing apps that allow people to order and pay in sit-down restaurants without having to wait for the server to bring the bill. It is also running a test with Jamba Juice that allows people to order and pay for smoothies from their mobile phones, then pick them up in the store, bypassing the line and cash register.When you have a very comfortable ordering environment, like a smartphone, you just order moreLast year Starbucks began replacing the payment systems in its 7,000 US locations with mobile payments technology built by Square, a San Francisco start-up.Carrefour, the second-largest retailer in the world by sales after Walmart, has deployed a version of the technology in its grocery stores in France.It allows people to order and pay for all their groceries from their mobile phone or a computer, then pick them up in the store, where everything is bagged and waiting for them at a set time.The KFC campaign may eventually include posters in underground trains with discount offers embedded in the image, as has already proved successful with Carrefour. Potential customers would be able to photograph a code in the poster to obtain a discount, which would be stored in their phones and applied automatically when they check out at the restaurant.

Each of the companies pays intellectual property royalties to affiliates in the Netherlands, where many companies reach individual agreements or “tax rulings” with authorities on the rates they will pay.Starbucks justified its tax bill in Britain, where it paid just £8.6m in taxes from 1998 to 2012 on more than £3.4bn in revenue, by saying it rarely earned a profit there. But MPs have claimed that its reported profits are lower because it pays a royalty of 6 per cent of gross revenues to its Dutch branch, which holds the rights to license the intellectual property in Europe.Starbucks later explained it paid an “overall effective tax rate” on royalties to its Dutch subsidiary averaging 16 per cent in the past five years, well under the 25 per cent official Dutch corporate tax rate. It has declined to explain what rates are specified in the tax ruling.Dutch MPs said they planned to press Starbucks to explain its tax rulings in the Netherlands at hearings of their own.“I think they don’t pay enough taxes in the Netherlands and that’s the reason they’re here,” said Jesse Klaver, an MP for the opposition GreenLeft party.
337;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-03-26T15:11:45Z;Guatemalan coffee: launched by Starbucks, blighted by fungus;;"Starbucks is launching its first espresso branded with a place of origin – undeterred by the fact that Guatemala, home of the new “cocoa and baked spices” brew has declared a state of agricultural emergency because of rampant coffee tree fungus.Guatemala’s blighted crops and 275,000 coffee farmers stand in sharp contrast to the pomp surrounding Monday’s launch of the Guatemala Antigua, the first time Starbuck’s customers anywhere will have a choice of bean for their drink.Amid the grandeur of the British Museum, home of artefacts pilfered from across the world, Starbucks managers and suppliers were treated to Mayan dancing and Guatemalan snacks as they sipped lattes from paper cups.Alfredo Nuno, Starbuck’s buyer, raved about Guatemala’s coffee growing conditions, which he described as among the best in the world: mineral-rich soil, high altitudes, mild climate and abundance of sunlight.Yet he omitted to mention that other abundance: coffee rust, which causes trees to lose their leaves, resulting in beans that are lower in quantity and quality and which has sparked a wave of national emergencies across Central America.Coffee rust has form in destroying even a huge export industry, wiping out virtually the entire crop in 1860s Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and killing off coffee growing on the island.The trickle-down impact is huge, as Guatemala witnessed in an attack a decade or so ago when the collapse in revenues pushed farms big and small into bankruptcy; shrivelled household incomes and prompted a wave of immigration to the US.Guatemala is stumping up $13.7m in emergency aid to help small farmers buy pesticides to fight the fungus. Honduras and Costa Rica have already declared national emergencies. El Salvador and Panama are also affected.Back at the British Museum, Starbucks appeared nonplussed by the blight. “We have already purchased all our beans so it doesn’t impact the launch at all,” said Michelle Gass who runs the coffee chain’s European, Middle East and Africa business.Besides, Starbucks farmers fare better: “The coffee trees are more vibrant and the coffee is better”.Henning Andrés Droege, head of co-operation, trade & investment section at the Guatemalan embassy in the UK lent a more balanced perspective. “It’s a huge huge situation for the whole of Latin America,” he told beyondbrics. “We all recognise how serious it is but are hoping to find a solution.”Starbucks has a programme for working with farmers to improve yields and quality. Earlier this month it acquired a farm in Costa Rica for use as a laboratory for farming research and development as part of its billion-dollar commitment to ethically-sourcing 100 per cent of its coffee by 2015.Related reading

338;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-03-22T18:13:29Z;From Lantana to Prufrock: perfect coffee;London’s top baristas on what it takes to make the perfect cup of coffee;"Remember the late 1990s? It was a time when many of us – when not putting on long-sleeved T-shirts and going out to superclubs (and, no, that’s not a mistype of “supper clubs”) – would sit around fretting about the effects of something called “globalisation”. One of globalisation’s most feared agents was Starbucks, a corporate coffee chain destined to drive out our neighbourhood cafés and replace them with mere neighbourhood-style cafés.In the end, things turned out very differently. Independent or, as they’re properly known, “specialist” coffee shops have been on the ascent for the better part of a decade, and London is now recognised by the world’s most hardline coffee fanatics as a place they could conceivably spend some time in. The Old Truman Brewery in Brick Lane will host the third London Coffee Festival (April 25-28), a popular event that explores the (oft-overlooked) borderland between coffee industry trade exhibition, food-and-drink fair and music festival. London-based roasters such as Square Mile and Monmouth have gained a kind of superstar status, name-dropped in menus by restaurants who wish to say “we care about coffee” and, by implication, “we care about everything”.The key figure in all this is the barista. Ten years ago, making coffee was seen, at least in this country, as relatively unskilled work. Now, in places such as Kaffeine in Fitzrovia or Milk Bar in Soho it belongs to the same highly specialised category as the sommelier or the cocktail mixer. If you apply for a barista job at any specialist coffee shop, you will need to have several years of training to ensure you know how to get the best from your painstakingly sourced beans. Grind size, water purity, milk temperature, brew time: get these and many other factors wrong, as so many unknowingly do, and you’ll end up with that burnt-toast flavour we often put up with when we drink bad coffee. An adept barista will create a cup so delicious it distracts you completely from your business meeting or book.This year’s World Barista Championship will be held in Melbourne at the end of May. Competitors will attempt to make the finest espresso, cappuccino and “signature drink” (involving alternative flavours like citrus). It is testimony to how far the UK has progressed in the international coffee pantheon that it has sported two winners of the competition in the past 10 years. The most recent, Gwilym Davies, has since opened his own café, Prufrock in Clerkenwell, which, replete with glass tubes and minimalist furniture, resembles a wonderful 1990s arthouse-cinema vision of what the future was going to look like.But still, many ask, isn’t a cup of coffee just, well, a cup of coffee? What sets this so-called “specialist” coffee apart? I talked to the new-breed baristas to get some answers.Seb Emina is author of ‘The Breakfast Bible’, published by Bloomsbury——————————————-Baptiste Kreyder, Caravan King’s CrossFrom: Brittany, FranceYou can make a bad coffee from a good bean but you can’t make a good coffee from a bad bean, and there are a huge number of steps before the barista even enters the picture.There is the terroir, which is where the coffee is grown, right down to what part of the mountain it was on and whether it was shaded or in the sun. There are the people who pick the coffee cherries and how those cherries are processed: a decent product can be ruined if the pip isn’t removed in the right way. There’s the storage and the way it’s shipped to Europe. Have they used the kind of sacks that will protect the beans? And, of course, there’s the roasting.It all means that good coffee is scarce, and it’s why the prices that we pay for it are tremendously expensive compared with regular café coffee. Even then all that would amount to nothing if, say, I left my machine for too long without cleaning it or heated the milk in a flat white too much or too little. Coffee is really unforgiving in that way. After all those layers it’s my job to treat it properly.Granary Building, 1 Granary Square (Off Goods Way), London N1C 4AA. www.caravankingscross.co.uk——————————————-Celeste Wong, LantanaFrom: Dunedin, New ZealandI drink coffee every day. I think you have to when you’ve been doing it for such a long time. I love making it, I love tasting it and I love being around it.When I make coffee, I want to make sure it’s consistent. Every morning I set the weight, test the grind, extract the coffee and see if what all these factors give me is the same as what I want. Then I’ll keep the methodology consistent and I’ll keep checking in. I believe it’s possible to pinpoint when other variables come into play, so if the temperature of the room affects the grind, then I’ll know more or less what I need to do to get it back to where it needs to be.Sometimes I’ll notice that the colour or flow rate has changed, and correct it. It becomes instinctive.A flat white should be between 65C and 67C. Not lukewarm, but you should be able to drink it quickly. As you heat the milk, it gets sweeter, so the more you heat it the more you’re going to taste the milk and not the coffee. Sometimes I do wonder whether serving them too cool is a trendy thing. You go too hot or too cold and you don’t get the best out of the coffee.13 Charlotte Place, London W1T 1SN. www.lantanacafe.co.uk——————————————-Ross Brown, Brown’s of BrockleyFrom: Kent, UKI was really into music and zines when I was younger. My girlfriend and I went to a zine symposium in Portland, Oregon, and while we were there we went to a speciality coffee place called Stumptown.I think I was probably interested in the idea of coffee but I lived in the Home Counties where there was nothing but Starbucks or Caffè Nero. I sat at the bar and had an espresso and it was a bit like the legendary “God shot”, a cup that tastes like nothing else. That got me interested in coffee.I used to be really into the culture that surrounds it but now I’m just focused on making good coffee and don’t involve myself in the other aspects so much.Getting people to understand that it’s not “just coffee” is hard. Do you need to know why it tastes good? Often I just want a cup of coffee.I don’t want to be lectured. I don’t want to know about this non-homogenised milk that comes from a farm owned by one family. You have to strike a balance.5 Coulgate Street, London SE4 2RW. www.brownsofbrockley.com——————————————-Victor Frankowski, Protein by DunneFrankowskiFrom: Sydney, AustraliaI don’t think coffee is an art or a science. It’s a craft. There are scientific principles, but being a barista is more like being a chef, a baker or a sommelier in that it’s about understanding a product and working with it.I think it’s hilarious how flat whites have caught on in London. But apart from that, the city does have its own really unique coffee scene. It might have received a boost from Antipodeans but it has now developed its own identity and has done so within a very short space of time and the UK has had two champions in the World Barista Championships. The world’s coffee eyes are on London because what has happened here can happen elsewhere.It’s not just about making coffee. There is the culture as well, and the history. I enjoy working behind the machine but there are other avenues that I want to pursue.

It’s super important. Coffee contains things such as caramelised sugars, fruit acid, vegetable oil and fattiness and you want them all to be showcased in your drink.But London tap water, for example, is a little alkaline, so it just knocks a lot of them out. Using it is a bit like spending a lot of time EQing a piece of music and then listening to it on your car stereo.I’ve done tests using Evian and distilled water, blending the two to get varying hardness levels and then trying the same coffee with the different waters. I laid out playing cards in which the value – 10, say, or jack – represented the coffee, and the suits represented the water.The question was is there more of a theme in the suits or the numbers? Is the water doing most of the work or the coffee? When you used very different waters, the water was more of a factor in how the coffee tasted than the coffee itself. It was a blinding result.23-25 Leather Lane, London EC1N 7TE. www.prufrockcoffee.com; 27 Clerkenwell Road, London EC1M 5RN. www.workshopcoffee.com"
339;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-03-18T17:30:58Z;From boycotts to business briefs;Charities are increasing pressure on corporations as a means to effect change;"A strange alchemy is under way. As big business stakes claims to being more charitable, charities are becoming more business-minded – and employing rather uncharitable language to whip multinationals into shape.Thus while organisations such as BP, GlaxoSmithKline, Unilever or Clifford Chance promote their role in creating a fairer world – “ We passionately believe in the power of the private sector to improve people’s lives . . .” they and others wrote recently in a letter to the Financial Times – charities have been busy exposing corporate failings elsewhere in lengthy reports that compile forensic detail.Top food and drink companies were blasted last month by Oxfam for “a veil of secrecy [that] hides human costs”; and Associated British Foods came under fire from ActionAid for exploiting loopholes to avoid paying taxes that it claimed would have sent 48,000 Zambian children to school.There is a long history of non-governmental organisations policing corporations – think Barclays Bank in South Africa in the apartheid era, or BP in Nigeria – but it is “definitely increasing” says Robert Blood, foun­der of Sigwatch, which tracks and analyses activist campaigns for NGOs. And the tactics have changed.“Like all political institutions, NGOs have to be effective and they have discovered over time [that] one of the best ways to achieve real change is to put pressure on corporations,” he says. They do this by playing businesses off against each other or by embarrassing management into switching policies. Thus Oxfam’s report offered (with caveats) praise to Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch maker of Flora margarine and Dove shower gel, while flagging up failings at Associated British Foods (ABF), owner of Primark, the high street discount retailer. Reports by ActionAid have highlighted tax issues in Africa – which the companies concerned, including SABMiller and ABF, reject.Acting as corporate watchdog may seem a long way off for pleasant,
cardigan-wearing ladies selling second-hand clothes in Oxfam shops on behalf of African babies, but charities have realised that companies could play big role in the eradication of poverty in emerging markets.“Companies are so powerful in these countries, not least because governments don’t have very tight regulations, so they have freedom to behave however they want to,” says Barbara Stocking, until recently chief executive of Oxfam GB.Corporate power also stems from scale. Emerging markets now frequently ac­count for a significant slice of revenues: in the case of the westernfood and drink industry, emerging markets make up 30-50 per cent of sales. Also, the companies source substantial volumes from poorer parts of the world: cocoa in the Ivory Coast, or coffee in Latin America and Vietnam, and palm oil in southeast Asia.Ms Stocking says: “It is not by accident that [Oxfam is] doing more in the food and drink industry”, where many smallholders are poor.Oxfam’s Behind the Brands report on the world’s top 10 food and drink companies, was “at least a couple of years” in the making and followed a similar report on banks in the Netherlands. The research, done in conjunction with domestic charities in local countries, is a continuing effort, and the report changes online if the policies of the companies featured change .In total, about 10-15 per cent of Oxfam’s spending on poverty (£285m last year) goes on campaigning work, which includes research, policy and advocacy, and public campaigning.ActionAid UK, which spent just 0.2 per cent of its total income (£61.5m) scrutinising corporate behaviour last year, claims big bang for its bucks. In 2010 it published a report accusing SABMiller, the world’snumber two brewer by sales, of adopting a “complex system of tax havens to siphon profits out of subsidiaries in developing countries”.While SABMiller swiftly denied the accusations, ActionAid says the report helped spur 21 African tax authorities to create a new treaty in 2012, giving them information-sharing powers to tackle tax avoidance together.ActionAid, like Oxfam, believes consumers have become more concerned about poor behaviour by corporations. Thanks at least in part to the financial crisis, says Beverley Duckworth, director of policy, the public is more interested in issues such as tax avoidance and in linking them to poverty and how companies conduct themselves.“The driver from our perspective is poverty and injustice, so the work we do is always about being rooted in the communities we work with and our job is to bring these issues to the attention of the public and then put pressure on the government to act, in this case to change international tax rules,” says Ms Duckworth.Nestlé, no stranger to being challenged by NGOs on issues ranging from baby milk to palm oil, ran into a row in Ethiopia in 2002 when it – legitimately – claimed compensation over a plant that had been nationalised in the 1970s. However, the Swiss- based food group’s attempt to add on interest charges as well raised hackles, particularly as it was demanding payment against the backdrop of an extreme drought and food crisis. Oxfam pointed the finger; Nestlé dropped its additional charges.Also in Ethiopia, Starbucks’ marketing fell foul of Oxfam when it opposed the government’s efforts to trademark the names of local coffee bean varieties such as Sidamo and Harrar. It did not want to shell out for the right to use the Ethiopian names in selling coffee, but following an Oxfam media campaign, Starbucks backed down.Mr Blood says many companies are becoming quicker to react to this kind of criticism. “Corporate management is changing faster than public opinion,” says Mr Blood. “Companies are acutely sensitive of how they look to the rest of the world.”The crucial difference with past campaigns is that the aim is to change regulatory structures as well as company policies and there is less call for the kind of boycotts that charities famously called for against Nestlé in response to the sales of
baby formula in the developing world.Instead, charities now want consumers to articulate what they want, if only by clicking the “like” icon on Facebook. Button pushers “may not be doing something dramatic”, says Ms Stocking. “But they’ve noticed and want to do something.”Ms Duckworth describes cases such as the Zambian tax issue as “catalysers for change, putting pressure on individual companies to be responsible and play fair and also building pressure on governments to take action.”Sometimes, rather than triggering change, a charity report triggers a tit-for-tat row over misinterpretation or accuracy of facts. ABF, for example, was criticised by both the ActionAid and Oxfam reports for poor corporate citizenship, but rejected the points.“The idea that ABF would use a ‘veil of secrecy’ in order to hide the ‘human cost’ of its supply chain is simply ridiculous,” the company, whose holding include Twinings Tea, said. “The company has worked hard for many years, over a wide geography, at all levels of the supply chain to ensure its suppliers meet the highest ethical standards . . . Where issues are found, they are appropriately resolved.”But ABF and its peers can expect charities to remain on their case, wink­ling out and highlighting issues. Not least, says Mr Blood, because no one else is doing so: governments in emerging markets have more pressing matters and cash-strapped consumers are increasingly more worried about shopping to their own budget than helping those in far-off countries.“NGOs like Oxfam and Christian Aid are going for the one source of power that’s still left, and that’s corporations,” says Mr Blood. “It’s fascinating, not least because NGOs are waking up to the fact that large corporations are their ally, not enemy.”"
340;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Whitbread buoyed by setbacks at rivals;;Whitbread’s chief executive said he expected competition from its two biggest rivals to be resumed in earnest after each had suffered from “shooting themselves in the foot” in recent months with internal problems.Andy Harrison said Whitbread’s Costa Coffee chain had seen its brand tracking scores strengthen at a time when Starbucks was having to defend its tax affairs.Travelodge, the main competitor to Whitbread’s Premier Inn budget hotel chain, has undergone restructuring and a takeover by its creditors to tackle a debt mountain.Mr Harrison said: “In this financial year, we have had a relatively benign situation with two of our competitors shooting themselves in the foot. One would expect these companies to get their houses in order.”Starbucks’ tax issues had seen no statistical knock-on benefit to Costa, Mr Harrison admitted. “The problem for Starbucks is they have had a lot of adverse publicity,” he said.Whitbread suffered its own publicity problems last week after being caught up in the horsemeat food contamination crisis with the discovery of equine DNA in two of its products.The coffee shop and hotels chain has announced a series of measures to tighten quality control, including a new tracking system for ingredients. But Mr Harrison said the costs to the group were “negligible”, and the only impact on customers was a shift to the purchase of chicken products.Announcing results for the 11 weeks to February 14, Whitbread said like-for-like sales rose 2.7 per cent, with revenues from Costa up 5.5 per cent and from Premier Inn rising 2.9 per cent.Taking openings into account, sales for the group were up 16.9 per cent. In the 50 weeks to February 14, like-for-like sales were up 3.7 per cent and total sales 14.8 per cent.Whitbread pointed to a surge in Premier Inn’s London room capacity and a fourth-quarter rise of revenue per available room of 2.2 per cent in the capital, compared with a 5 per cent decline in the mid-scale and economy sectors.Across all regions, Premier Inn’s revpar was up 0.7 per cent.However, shares in morning trading lost 3 per cent of their value. James Hollins, analyst with Investec, who rates Whitbread a sell, highlighted a resurgent Starbucks and Travelodge and Whitbread’s high multiples among reasons for his bearish stance.Whitbread said in October that growth was moderating, but Mr Harrison said the fourth-quarter results had shown that “the growth momentum has been maintained”.He dismissed the share price fall, pointing to the trend over the past 12 months, which had seen Whitbread shares rise 46 per cent.He added: “If you focus on the 50 weeks, you’ve got the same sales story. How many other companies are delivering 14.8 per cent organic growth?”The figures were described by Greg Johnson, analyst at Shore Capital, as “robust” and encouraging given inflationary pressure on incomes.Whitbread shares were down 87p to £24.76 in early afternoon trading.
341;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-02-24T04:17:15Z;Food chain alert for investors;Many global food companies are failing to monitor animal welfare adequately;"Investors will get a wake-up call on Monday when findings from a new benchmark reveal that many big global food companies in which they invest are failing to adequately monitor the welfare of farm animals used in the food chain.The benchmark, which is the first of its kind, and supported by Compassion in World Farming and the World Society for the Protection of Animals, comes as a growing number of food companies are being drawn into the horsemeat scandal across Europe and consumers and investors are becoming increasingly worried about risk management in the food chain.Among the worst offenders in the ranking are Walmart, Auchan, Mars, and El Corte Inglés, where no evidence of farm animal welfare was found on their business agendas.Nestlé, Premier Foods, Starbucks and Carrefour also scored poorly. Farm animal welfare was found to be on the business agenda but there was limited evidence of implementation.Out of 68 of the largest food retailers, producers and restaurants evaluated in the Business Benchmark on Farm Animal Welfare, fewer than half (46 per cent) publish a formal farm animal welfare policy; only 41 per cent describe how their board or senior management oversaw their approach to farm animal welfare in their supply chains; and just a quarter (26 per cent) publish objectives and targets.Hilary Green, head of research and development communications at Nestlé, the world’s number-one food producer, said the company had updated its farm animal welfare information and commitment statement since the evaluation was carried out last summer. She added that a report, Nestlé in Society, due out next month, would further outline its commitment to farm animal welfare.Last week, Nestlé removed pasta meals from shelves in Italy and Spain and suspended deliveries of all processed products containing meat from a German supplier after tests revealed traces (above 1 per cent) of horse DNA.The benchmark was constructed using an average company score, evaluated on management commitment, governance, policy implementation and innovation. Forty-two of the 68 companies ranked in the bottom two of six categories.Managing and reporting farm animal welfare “is a risk issue few companies are on top of,” said Rory Sullivan, an adviser to the business benchmark and independent consultant.Some respondents said it was difficult to impose their animal welfare policies on suppliers, particularly where the supplier was more powerful than the purchaser or when the latter made up only a small part of the supplier’s turnover.The Co-operative Food (UK), Noble Foods and Unilever made it into the second tier of the ranking, where best practice was found to be integral to business strategy, while J Sainsbury, Marks and Spencer and McDonald’s, the burger chain, were among those in tier three.M&S agriculture and animal welfare manager Mark Atherton-Ranson said that animal welfare was at the heart of the business and that the company had recently gone further on the issue. “We added our animal welfare charter to our website just after the report was conducted, so we look forward to seeing this included in the next update later this year,” he said.Investors must “engage with companies to encourage better risk management and reporting,” said Mr Sullivan.That call is echoed by Neville White, senior analyst for socially responsible investment at Ecclesiastical Investment Management.“The benchmark will bring to the forefront an issue that perhaps has not been on investors’ radars hitherto but may increasingly feature as a key reputational and operational risk for food companies in the producer, processor, retail and catering service sectors,” he said.None of the companies assessed made it into the top tier."
342;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-02-13T21:32:04Z;Tax avoiders face Whitehall contracts ban;;Big companies face being banned from bidding for major government contracts under rules aimed at clamping down on aggressive tax avoidance by some of Whitehall’s most important suppliers.Danny Alexander, the Treasury chief secretary, will announce on Thursday that companies will have to sign a declaration that they have not fallen foul of wide-ranging tax avoidance rules in the past 10 years before bidding for government contracts worth £2m or more.The initiative follows controversies about how major companies minimise their tax bills. The Financial Times revealed on Wednesday the tactics used by some of the world’s biggest IT companies that supply the government to make sure their corporation tax bills stay low.Other sectors, including water companies and other strategic infrastructure suppliers, have previously come under fire for aggressive tax avoidance. Some of the UK’s most well-known consumer brands, including Starbucks, Amazon and Google, have also been criticised over their tax affairs.There is no suggestion that any of those companies would fall foul of the new rules. But Mr Alexander, who has been working on the issue with Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister, since the summer said: “It is clear there has been an approach to tax which I don’t consider to be acceptable, and I think most importantly, the British public don’t consider to be acceptable.”He added: “If you work for the government, whether you’re an individual employee or a company that has got a contract with the government, you need to be behaving properly with regard to tax rules.”Under the new regime, which will come into force in April, companies will be forced to disclose any occasion in the past 10 years when they have not complied with tax rules. That would include flouting specific bans on certain tax-avoidance schemes or setting up complex payment structures to avoid value added tax.It will also include any breach of the new general anti-avoidance rule, which also comes into force in April and is aimed at ending highly artificial tax avoidance schemes.The new rules could raise complaints from companies about the burden of extra regulation. Mr Alexander said the regulations would apply only to businesses big enough to bid for contracts worth £2m or more but he resisted some in government who wanted to set the limit higher because of worries about how many companies would be affected.The Treasury chief secretary said: “Every company should be able to put their tax affairs in good order, so they don’t fall foul of these rules …I don’t think it’s an onerous burden.”

They will retain the Esso brand and supply Esso fuels.ExxonMobil is selling its 570 forecourts in the UK, in packages over several years. Petrol consumption is falling and forecourt profitability is increasingly driven by convenience retail sales.About half the 9,500 forecourts in the UK are expected to change hands in the next few years as oil producers pull back.Euro Garages will convert the shops to Spar outlets.Mohsin Issa, managing director, said: “This is a transformational acquisition for our business, which accelerates our consolidation strategy in the UK and increases our presence in a number of important regions. It also fits perfectly with our retail proposition, which is based on partnering with quality brands to offer our customers the very best experience and value across our forecourts.”It has partnerships with Subway, Burger King and Starbucks and has opened 25 of 100 planned drive-through outlets of the coffee shop chain.Sales at Euro Garages increased from £305m to £314m in the 12 months to 31 July 2012 compared with the year before, with earnings before, interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation up from £12m to £13m.
344;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-02-03T03:19:26Z;Shareholders resist political donations;There is unease about US companies’ campaign spending;The recent filing of shareholder resolutions calling for an end to political contributions has added to growing evidence of investor unease at the rise in corporate political spending in the US.Spending has increased sharply since the Supreme Court’s 2010 ruling in the Citizens United case. The ruling paved the way for political groups to accept unlimited sums of money from donors such as companies or unions, so long as they do not get involved with candidates’ official campaigns.“The broader drive to transparency predated Citizens United but this type of ‘stop-spending’ proposal we first filed after the ruling,” says Shelley Alpern, director of social research and advocacy at Clean Yield Asset Management, one of the investment firms behind the proposals.“Stop spending” resolutions have now been filed at seven companies, with those filed this year at energy companies Chevron, ExxonMobil and EQT, as well as Starbucks, the coffee chain, adding to those filed at 3M, the industrial conglomerate, Target, the US retailer, and Bank of America last year.The proposals have a number of goals. While the Chevron proposal calls for an end to the company’s political contributions, the ExxonMobil, 3M, EQT, Target and Bank of America proposals call for feasibility studies into the possibility of adopting a no-spending policy.“Companies should explain to shareholders why corporate political spending is justified – why corporate persons should decide the outcome of elections rather than individual persons,” says Ms Alpern.Shareholder activism in this area has emerged in a variety of forms. As well as calls for companies to refrain entirely from making campaign contributions, some resolutions have proposed that investors have a formal say on spending, by either approving it or by voting on reports about it.Investor activism on corporate lobbying has risen particularly sharply in recent years. The number of these resolutions has increased from six in 2010 and 11 in 2011, to 44 last year, according to the Sustainable Investment Institute (Si2), a specialist research group.Investors are also demanding transparency by companies on their political contributions. The five largest US mutual fund families supported corporate political disclosure more than 80 per cent of the time in 2012, according to the Center for Political Accountability (CPA), a Washington-based advocacy organisation.Between 2010 and 2012, investors filed 282 shareholder resolutions about corporate political spending, according to Si2, with about 79 per cent calling on companies to disclose more about their spending before and after elections.And these disclosure-focused resolutions often gain support levels of 30-40 per cent, says Heidi Welsh, executive director at Si2.Driving shareholder concerns are the risks posed to companies. When spending is made through trade associations, companies face potential conflicts if those associations take positions that are at odds with their business strategy.This has been the case with climate change, prompting several businesses, including Apple, the technology company, and Nike, the sportswear group, to withdraw from the US Chamber of Commerce or express dissent at the chamber’s opposition to carbon reduction measures.Reputational damage is another risk when companies’ political spending fails to match their values. For example, in 2010, Target encountered consumer disapproval and calls for boycotts over its contributions to a political group supporting a Minnesota gubernatorial candidate openly opposed to gay rights.“No shareholder wants their company to be the one that is making contributions and having them blowing up in their face,” says Mike Lapham, director of Responsible Wealth, a project of United for a Fair Economy, a US non-profit.Disclosure may even become mandatory. In January, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it was considering a proposal to require that public companies disclose to shareholders their use of corporate resources for political activities.This may not necessarily prevent further shareholder action on spending, however. “Some companies get high marks for transparency but are still very involved in the political process,” says Ms Alpern.This is unpopular with consumers, argues Mr Lapham, who points out that polls consistently show strong public opposition to corporate influence in the democratic process.
345;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-01-30T18:13:39Z;Corporate tax posturing should stop;Companies are complying with laws that governments could change if they wished;When David Cameron flew to Davos last week to tell companies that reduce their tax bills by dividing activities among countries to “wake up and smell the coffee”, his target was clear. Starbucks now faces a consumer boycott and has been publicly accused of acting unethically.The only problem is that it is not true. Starbucks’ supposed immoral act is not to pay UK corporation tax that it does not owe, and would not owe even if it did not license its brand from the Netherlands. It obeys both the letter and the spirit of global tax law, which governments could reform if they wished.A better target for the UK prime minister would be countries, such as the Netherlands and Ireland, that lure businesses with low tax rates. Oh, yes – and his own government, which has cut corporation tax and introduced a “patent box”, similar to the Netherlands’ “innovation box”, giving relief on intellectual property.I look forward to Mr Cameron naming and shaming companies such as Google (also a target of British politicians) if they are drawn from Ireland to the UK by his tax arbitrage. Perhaps that is too much to expect of a politician’s intellectual consistency.The division of responsibilities in regard to tax is clear, despite the wave of political rhetoric designed to obscure it. Governments must decide which regime is fair, and companies and individuals must comply. The latter ought not be blackmailed into carrying out the former’s job.As Lord Tomlin put it in a tax case involving the then Duke of Westminster in 1936 (quoting a 17th century chief justice), governments should not substitute “the uncertain and crooked cord of discretion” for the “golden and straight mete wand of the law”.Plenty of tax avoidance by individuals and companies relies on exploiting legal loopholes. UK authorities estimate that £5bn a year is sheltered by “contrived, artificial transactions that serve little or no purpose other than to produce a tax advantage”. Such structures obey the letter of the law rather than its spirit.However, most companies that place operations or intellectual property in low-tax countries – or even in tax havens such as Bermuda – are not breaching the spirit of global tax law. They comply with a structure established under the League of Nations in the 1920s.This allows – indeed, encourages – multinationals to split their operations among countries, paying taxes as if they were separate entities, in order to avoid double taxation. They have to make transactions at “arm’s length” – as they would deal with others.It worked for a long time but is under strain because of the growing value of brands, intellectual property and intangibles to global corporations. “Ideas are their biggest asset, and what generate profits, and it is far easier to shift intangibles than factories,” says Jeffrey Owens, of the Institute for Austrian and International Tax Law.Most of the outrage relates to US companies placing brands and IP in low-tax shelters. Carl Levin, chairman of a US Senate subcommittee accused Microsoft of “tax shams and gimmicks” last year. Margaret Hodge, who chairs the UK public accounts committee, fiercely assailed Starbucks, Google and Amazon.Ms Hodge was particularly tendentious, claiming not to believe that Starbucks would have operated at a loss in the UK for most of the past 15 years, or that its brand is worth 4.7 per cent of its sales – the licence fee that its UK operations pay. “I do not find your business model very compelling,” she told its chief financial officer loftily.Since Starbucks is among the world’s best-known brands and has a market capitalisation of $41bn, this says little for Ms Hodge’s potential as a business executive. Luckily, she instead has a job that puts her in a good position to change the law if she can achieve consensus.That, however, would be harder than sounding off against companies for lacking morals. It would require governments to take responsibility for dividing corporate taxes, rather than telling companies to do so and then criticising them.There are clearly flaws in any regime that permits companies to shield high-value intangibles from tax. “The global tax regime is pretty arbitrary. If you started with a clean sheet of paper, you would not do it like this,” says Michael Devereux, professor of business taxation at Oxford university.The much-hailed alternative is unitary taxation of global companies, under which profits would be split according to where the substance of their activities took place, and then taxed in those countries. This would require governments to agree a formula for dividing taxable profits “fairly” – for example by assets, workforce and turnover.The difficulty is obvious – who says what is fair? Should intellectual property count for more or less than employees or assets? Which countries should gain tax revenues and which lose? The European Commission has suggested unitary tax for the EU but the chances of achieving consensus within Europe, let alone the rest of the world, are slim.Most countries tend to assume they would gain from changing the current set-up, but it is questionable. One US study found that unitary taxation would not generate any more tax globally, once companies adjusted behaviour by, for example, shifting staff rather than intellectual property to low-tax countries. It would be a zero sum game.Politicians thus have the choice of indulging in easy rhetoric against companies that obey the laws they have passed or struggling to reform the tax regime for little reward, with lots of disruption. In their position, I might posture too.john.gapper@ft.com
346;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-01-27T17:39:06Z;Starbucks dismisses talk of investment threat;;Starbucks said on Sunday it had no plans to suspend millions of pounds in investment in Britain amid tensions between the government and the coffee chain over its tax arrangements.The US-based coffee chain said it did “not recognise” reports that it had threatened to pull £100m of investment from the UK in a meeting on Friday with the prime minister.“We had a very constructive meeting which was long scheduled. We do not discuss the details of our government meetings but can say that we do not recognise how it has been reported,” the coffee chain said in a statement.“Starbucks agrees with the prime minister that all businesses should pay their fair share. In the UK, we employ 9,000 people, contribute £300m a year to the economy and are forgoing tax deductions that will make the exchequer at least £20m better off,” it added.Mr Cameron exacerbated tensions between the government and coffee chain last week when he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos in Switzerland that tax avoiders had to “wake up and smell the coffee”.The remarks prompted a “frank exchange of views” between Kris Engskov, Starbucks’ managing director, and Mr Cameron on Friday, with the former expressing frustration that the chain was being targeted despite voluntarily offering to pay additional tax of at least £20m. Many other multinational companies, such as Amazon and Facebook, also pay little tax in the UK.Grant Shapps, Conservative party chairman, sought to damp down tensions on Sunday. “I don’t think we would ever single out a single company but I do think companies in this country need to pay their way,” he told Sky News’ Murnaghan programme.“I think they need to do what’s right as far as that is concerned and I think most people watching this would agree: companies should pay their fair share of taxation. That applies to that company and anyone else you care to mention. It certainly applies to millions of smaller businesses in this country.”Downing Street refused to comment. “It was a private meeting.”
347;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-01-25T22:01:02Z;Wall Street rises on positive earnings;;US stocks climbed for a fourth consecutive week despite weakness in shares of Apple, which lost its position as the world’s largest company by market value as technology sector results came into focus.The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent to 1,502.96 on Friday as stocks moved higher for an eight straight session – the first time that has happened since 2004.The benchmark finished the shortened trading week above the 1,500 threshold, gaining 1.1 per cent to close at a fresh five-year high.The advances came as policy makers in Washington took steps to delay a showdown over the nation’s borrowing limit until May.Investment strategists said the move removed some of the macro-level uncertainty that had been holding back stocks.“We are encouraged by recent legislation to sever the issue of spending cuts from the debt ceiling,” said David Bianco, US equity strategist at Deutsche Bank. “A higher debt ceiling sidelines the tail risk of default on debt or entitlement payments and puts the focus on a new spending cut agreement.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.8 per cent for the week to 13,895.98. The Nasdaq Composite index lagged behind and rose just 0.5 per cent to 3,149.71 as the tech-heavy measure was held back by the sharp losses in Apple.Shares in the iPhone maker slid 12 per cent to $439.88 on the week, suffering a steep decline on Thursday after investors reacted negatively to its latest quarterly results.On Friday, Apple lost the distinction of being the world’s largest company by market value as its capitalisation slipped to $413bn and below that of oil major ExxonMobil. Exxon, which rose 1 per cent to $91.68 for the week, finished with a market value of $418.2bn.As Apple fell to its lowest level in a year, analysts attributed the declines to questions about the company’s ability to sustain its robust growth rates and margins.Colin Gillis, tech analyst at BGC Partners, said: “Competitors are using price as a lever to get traction in the market. Apple may also run into difficulty posting both the volumes and maintaining its prices over the next several quarters.”Shares in Apple have fallen 37.3 per cent from their September peak.The losses dragged on the S&P 500 information technology index, which was 0.5 per cent lower for the week.That drop came despite better performances from other heavyweights in the sector, including Google and Microsoft.Google climbed 6.9 per cent to $753.67 for the week as the online search company said it had stemmed the slide in its advertising prices caused by the shift to mobile internet use.Meanwhile, Microsoft shares gained 2.3 per cent to $27.88 even as the world’s biggest software company said its latest quarterly figures were depressed by weak demand for its latest operating system.Netflix was among the week’s biggest risers as its shares enjoyed a two-day surge that began on Thursday after it reported a surprise profit and said subscribers grew by 2.5m in its latest quarter.Shares in the company recorded a 71 per cent gain for the week to $169.90 and were trading at their highest level in a year.Procter & Gamble rose 4.7 per cent for the week to $73.25 as the world’s biggest consumer group by sales reported a rise in profits for the three months to the end of December, narrowly beating analysts’ forecasts.Honeywell moved 0.8 per cent higher for the week to $68.33 as the diversified industrial group said its latest quarterly figures were lifted by growing demand for commercial aerospace products.Starbucks climbed 3.6 per cent for the week to $56.81 after the coffee retailer said sales rose almost 11 per cent in 2012 to $3.8bn.Fresh housing data released this week continued to show signs that the sector’s recovery was gaining traction. The reports helped lift the S&P 500 homebuilders index by 3.2 per cent this week.One of last year’s top returning industry groups has gained 13.73 per cent so far this month.

349;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-01-25T02:59:12Z;Starbucks praises ‘loyal’ UK customers;;Starbucks said that its British customers had “stayed loyal” during a quarter when it bowed to public pressure by volunteering to pay more tax in the UK, but it declined to provide specific sales figures for the country.Like-for-like sales fell 1 per cent in its broader Europe, Middle East and Africa region in the quarter ended December, as a fall in the average amount spent by each customer more than offset a 2 per cent rise in customer numbers.Starbucks reported results on Thursday six weeks after it said it would pay £10m in UK corporate tax in each of the next two years, even if it makes a loss, following calls to boycott the coffee chain over its “immoral” tax practices.The company – led by chief executive Howard Schultz – had blamed its low tax payments largely on the fact the 569 stores it owns in the UK are running at a loss, but it declined to comment on its UK profitability in the latest quarter.Starbucks did, however, tell the Financial Times that its proposed tax payment was yet to be approved by HM Revenue & Customs.“We are in contact with the HMRC about our proposal and our discussions are ongoing. What’s important is that our customers have stayed loyal and that we just reported the best quarter in our company’s history,” it said.Globally, Starbucks’ revenue rose nearly 11 per cent from last year to $3.8bn, broadly in line with market expectations. Its earnings per share of 57 cents – a rise from 50 cents last year – also matched expectations.The company’s shares climbed 2.8 per cent to $56.12 in after-hours trading after it released its results.Asked whether the tax UK decision – which Starbucks has described as an “unprecedented commitment” – would alter its tax policy elsewhere, the company said: “No.”The decision to pay extra UK tax came after weeks of intense criticism of the company’s tax arrangements from customers, the media and politicians after it emerged it had paid just £8.6m corporation tax in the 14 years it has been in the UK.The company had admitted to being taken by surprise by the “emotion of the issue”.Starbucks also said on Thursday: “We are committed to investing in local economies wherever operate, and we fundamentally believe that acting responsibly and listening to our customers makes good business sense.”None of the analysts on a post-earnings call with company executives asked about tax, reflecting the UK’s limited size in the context of its 17,000-plus coffee shops worldwide.
350;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Retailers call for action on tax avoidance;;High street retailers are putting pressure on the government to deliver a level playing field on tax, or at the very least reduce the tax burden on UK retail chains, following a string of high street collapses.John Lewis, J Sainsbury, Waterstones and Home Retail Group have told the Financial Times that the government must get to grips with tax avoidance on the part of multinationals and ease the broader tax burden bearing down on the high street.In a nod to recent public outrage over Starbucks’ tax arrangements, David Cameron told an audience at Davos on Thursday that tax avoiders “need to wake up and smell the coffee”, pledging that Britain would use its year-long presidency of the G8 to push for a co-ordinated international approach to tackling “aggressive” tax avoidance.In practice, the government is not sure it can resolve the issue without international accord. However, retailers have warned that until the complicated issue is resolved, more high street chains face collapse.“If you create a situation where multinational companies of the Starbucks and Amazon variety are able to exploit the rules perfectly legally to minimise their tax and we are conversely unable to do that, we are not operating remotely in a level playing field,” said James Daunt, managing director of Waterstones, the bookseller.“There will be further casualties as a result of that. My outrage is not to the companies trying to minimise their tax bill. My outrage is directed to our political masters who have created an environment in which that is legal and permissible,” he said.Justin King, chief executive of J Sainsbury, and a former business adviser to Mr Cameron called on shoppers to take companies’ tax contributions into account when they decided where to spend their money.“It is now for consumers to ask tough questions of the companies they do business with about where they pay corporation tax,” he said.Terry Duddy, chief executive of Home Retail Group, owner of Argos and Homebase, said high street retailers faced a double whammy. While online rivals benefit from lower tax rates, physical retailers pay business rates, and making investments to upgrade stores do not qualify for tax breaks. “Its a problem for general retail,” he said.The British Retail Consortium, the trade body for store groups, is set raise the issue of tax competitiveness in its submission to the chancellor next month ahead of the budget.Their comments follow Andy Street, managing director of John Lewis, and Sebastian James, chief executive of Dixons, both calling on the government to tackle the discrepancy.The collapse of HMV, Blockbuster and Jessops has pushed the issue up the agenda as more than 10,000 jobs come under threat. According to the BRC, half of retailers plan to cut jobs over the next three months, compared with about a third in the same period a year ago.Ann McKechin, a Labour MP, lambasted Vince Cable at a select committee this week for failing to address the high street’s woes in a meaningful way.“I would be hard pressed to think of another sector where we have had such relative inertia from government. If 20,000 jobs had gone in a month in the automotive sector I anticipate we would have had an emergency summit at Number 10,” she said.In 2011, Amazon reported UK sales of £3.35bn, with pre-tax profits of £74m reflecting its slim operating margins and the payment of £151m to its Luxembourg company for the use of its intellectual property. But these profits were overwhelmingly earned by Amazon’s Luxembourg company, which owns the inventory, bears the risk of losses and processes payments. This meant that in Britain, Amazon paid just £1.8m in tax for that year.An Amazon spokesman said: “Amazon pays all applicable taxes in every jurisdiction that it operates within. Amazon EU serves tens of millions of customers and sellers throughout Europe from multiple consumer websites in a number of languages dispatching products to all 27 countries in the EU. We have a single European headquarters in Luxembourg with hundreds of employees to manage this complex operation.”
351;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-01-21T00:00:37Z;Revenue homes in on profit shifting;;HM Revenue & Customs has stepped up its investigations into profit shifting by multinationals, according to statistics that suggest a sharp increase in the scale of “ transfer pricing” enquiries.Just over £1bn of tax linked to transfer pricing – the pricing of inter-company transactions such as interest payments and royalties – was under investigation in July 2012, an increase of 47 per cent over the previous year, according to figures obtained from a freedom of information request by Pinsent Masons, a law firm.Transfer pricing came under the spotlight last year after MPs accused multinationals including Amazon, Starbucks, and Google of deliberately transferring profits from the UK to lower-tax jurisdictions to reduce their UK liability.The contraction of the commercial lending market is likely to have boosted HMRC’s transfer pricing investigations.Heather Self, partner at Pinsent Masons, said the current lending drought would allow HMRC to challenge the tax relief on some loans, on the grounds that similar financing would not have been available on the open market.The tax-under-consideration figure may include both potentially underpaid tax and the risk to the exchequer from companies litigating over amounts they have overpaid. The steep rise in 2012 could also reflect a larger-than-usual number of settlements in 2010 as well as increased compliance activity.HMRC, which increased its focus on transfer pricing as part of the £917m it received in the last spending review to boost its compliance activity, said: “We are bringing in more people and additional legal support to speed up our work identifying and challenging multinationals’ transfer pricing arrangements and to further strengthen our risk assessment capability across the large business sector.“This in turn will help to ensure that multinationals do not shift profits out of the UK and pay the tax due in line with UK law.”
352;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Tax crackdown to target middle class;;Middle-class professionals are to be targeted in a new crackdown on tax evasion promised by the chief prosecutor of England and Wales.The Crown Prosecution Service will dramatically ramp up the number of tax evasion cases it takes on – with a view to prosecution – over the next two years, Keir Starmer, the director of public prosecutions, told the Financial Times. The CPS will increase fivefold the number of tax files it handles, to 1,500 a year by 2014-15.This compares with 200 tax convictions the CPS secured in 2010 – its current conviction rate for tax cases stands at 86 per cent.Tax consultants who push dishonest avoidance schemes – and the professionals who invest in them – are central targets in the strategy.“There have been some cases involving lawyers, some involving tax consultants, and plumbers,” Mr Starmer said in an interview. “Within the ramped-up volume, it’s intended that we will select cases to send a clear message as to the breadth of our coverage.”His comments come amid wider scrutiny of the tax affairs of household names, both corporate and celebrities, as the prolonged financial downturn causes aggressive but legal tax avoidance to attract widespread criticism, as Starbucks found to its cost last month.Goldman Sachs became the latest multinational company to attract negative headlines: last week it rowed back on proposals to delay awarding bonuses to its UK bankers until the next fiscal year in order to benefit from a cut in the top rate of tax.Mr Starmer will telegraph the CPS’s new approach in a speech on Tuesday. He is expected to dispel the idea of tax evasion as a victimless crime, stressing that tax cheats cost each household the equivalent of £533 a year.The CPS’s tougher stance matches that of HM Revenue & Customs – which investigates cases before referring criminal files to the CPS – as both organisations try to rein in the £14bn a year that the economy loses from tax evasion. HMRC’s prosecution office was merged into the CPS in 2010.“This represents a significant policy shift. Historically the Revenue has been a reluctant prosecutor, preferring to concentrate on tax collection and bringing deterrent prosecutions only in the most blatant cases,” said Jonathan Fisher QC, a barrister who specialises in tax cases.In targeting those who invest in schemes or do not declare their full income, Mr Starmer has chosen what could be labelled low-hanging fruit.It is carousel fraud that haemorrhages the most money from the economy, estimated at £6bn a year, making it the biggest single source of tax evasion. Organised criminals operating across borders are often behind such scams, making them difficult to prosecute.“Middle-market cases are easier to prosecute and they don’t cost as much,” said Tessa Lorimer, a former Revenue prosecutor now at GSC Solicitors. “They attract a lot of publicity, and hence achieve a lot of deterrence.”Additional reporting by Vanessa Houlder
353;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-01-20T19:23:51Z;SSP looks to tempt Chinese travellers;;The owner of the Upper Crust and Caffè Ritazza chains hopes persuade greater numbers of Chinese travellers to eat on the go in order to offset sluggish Eurozone growth.Privately owned SSP, which operates 2,100 food and beverage concessions in travel hubs worldwide, said new contracts won last year at railways and airports in China and the US – including Phoenix, Arizona and New York’s JFK – would bring in revenues worth an additional £82m per year.“We see a strong pipeline of opportunities, particularly in Asia and the USA, that should help offset the continuing economic uncertainty in the eurozone,” said Andrew Lynch, SSP’s chief executive.In 2012 the company won concessions in Hangzhou and Xian airports in China, taking the number of Chinese airports it operates in to five.“China is putting so much money in infrastructure and that gives us an opportunity to go in in scale,” said Mr Lynch, who added that China accounts for about five per cent of company sales.“The behaviour of the Asian traveller used to be different to the European and American because you had lower spend per passenger – that’s changing because they’re travelling more widely and frequently so eating [at airports] becomes more familiar,” he said.SSP was spun-off from the FTSE 100 food service group Compass in June 2006 in a deal worth £1.8bn.The rail and airport divisions went to the Swedish private equity group EQT Partners and Macquarie Bank bought Moto, the motorway service stations business.SSP is better known by British commuters for its mainstay brands, including Upper Crust, Caffè Ritazza and Millie’s Cookies. It also runs franchises of Burger King, Starbucks and the genteel airport staple Caviar House & Prunier.In the 12 months to September 30 SSP’s total sales grew by 3.2 per cent year-on-year at a constant currency basis to £1.74bn, according to accounts filed last week at Companies House. However, like-for-like sales growth slowed to 2.7 per cent from 4.8 per cent in 2011.Pre-tax profit was £14.4m compared to a loss of £6.7m a year earlier.Despite its recent expansion in China and the US, SSP is still heavily tilted towards Europe, which accounts for 85 per cent of its revenues.Mr Lynch said that with SSP’s business split roughly evenly between air and rail travellers, the company had performed robustly despite Europe’s economic downturn.“The rail business is more resilient than airports and [during] economic disruptions people tend to travel more on rail,” he said.

355;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-01-16T19:33:53Z;Doughnut chains to expand to feed demand;;US consumers will be tempted by a bulge of new doughnut-buying opportunities as Dunkin’ Donuts and Krispy Kreme both plot to open stores in a section of the US consumer market where appetites remain strong.Dunkin’ said it would open 330-360 stores in the US in 2013 and planned to enter the Californian market by 2015 with shops in Los Angeles, San Diego and elsewhere. The Massachusetts-based chain already has more than 7,200 US stores.Krispy Kreme said in a presentation filed with regulators that by 2017 it would increase its US stores to more than 400 from 240 at the end of its current financial year.The enduring popularity of doughnuts has defied a shift towards healthier eating in the US fast food and supermarket businesses, as consumers turn to them as an “affordable indulgence” in tough economic times.In a presentation, Krispy Kreme said people were “willing to eat doughnuts any time of the day” and, in an allusion to their motivations, said “emotional feelings [are] more powerful than physical cravings”.Coffee has also become an important product for both companies as they try to peel away on-the-go customers from Starbucks and other higher-end chains by positioning themselves as cheaper, down-to-earth alternatives.The companies have begun to supplement their menus with healthier options such as oatmeal and juices, although Dunkin’ also promotes products such as a sausage, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich.Thanks to a revival in its sales and its real estate holdings, Krispy Kreme, based in North Carolina, has become the centre of speculation that it could be a takeover target.This week it introduced a complex “poison pill” plan to fend off predators by ensuring that the company would lose certain accumulated tax benefits if its ownership changed.About 60 per cent of Krispy Kreme’s US stores are franchises with the rest owned directly by the company.The vast majority of Dunkin’ Donuts stores are franchises and Nigel Travis, its chief executive, said the company was maintaining a “disciplined approach” to expansion while continuing to work on improving the profitability of franchisees.
356;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Not all banks seek to toe the line on tax;For Goldman, there is a badge of honour in being audacious;"Bonus season is upon us again, but this time with a twist. If you are a top City banker wondering which is the best institution to work for, the evidence of the past week has been unmistakable.At one extreme lies Royal Bank of Scotland, which is considering cutting its investment banker bonus pool by as much as 40 per cent to fund its imminent fine from regulators over alleged abuses of the Libor interest rate benchmark. Not only does RBS need to find the money to pay the fine from wherever it can; but the bank, still 82 per cent owned by the UK government, needs to cut pay whenever possible, to avoid becoming a political football again.At the other extreme is Goldman Sachs, the unreconstructed investment bank par excellence. On Sunday night, the Financial Times reported that Goldman was considering a delay to its payment of prior-year deferred bonuses to beyond the new tax year on April 6 when the top rate of income tax falls from 50 to 45 per cent. If it presses ahead, bankers will make a £50,000 saving for every £1m bonus.In a normal tax year, if an income tax rate was about to change like this, experts would expect any company worth its salt to tweak its bonus payout dates. Not even the taxman would raise an eyebrow.But this isn’t any normal tax year – as Starbucks knows to its cost. Outed by UK politicians fuming about the coffee chain’s Byzantine corporate structure and low tax liabilities, Starbucks last month ended up “volunteering” to pay £20m of tax to keep the authorities happy. At the same time it ran grovelling adverts and slashed coffee prices to keep the punters happy.Sure enough, most banks have read the runes. A month or so ago, according to tax advisers, half of the big City institutions were considering just the kind of move that Goldman is eyeing. But they have since backed away from anything that might even carry a whiff of reputational threat. With their image tarnished by everything from Libor abuses to mis-selling scandals, accusations of tax dodging are the last thing banks need.Goldman, apparently out on its own among big rivals, was similarly unbowed in the US, pushing through early bonus payouts on December 31, to avoid new higher taxes for top earners, introduced under the fiscal cliff compromise.Other banks used to take a similarly bold view of the world – notably Barclays. But under new management, the UK lender has reinvented itself as a friend of regulators, government and the people.Talk to many City bankers and they will say Barclays has judged the mood just right – the world has changed and anyone who fails to recognise it is simply asking for trouble.Talk to Goldman bankers and the mood is very different. For them, there is still a badge of honour in being audacious.The furthest Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman boss, has gone towards recognising politicians’ “we’re all in it together” mantra came in November when he admitted that “ tax increases, especially for the wealthiest, are appropriate”.But there is no real acknowledgment of the world’s changed attitude to banking. Delaying bonuses is legal. Therefore there is nothing wrong with it.Might Goldman be wrong? Might clients, particularly those in the public sector, see the bank taking advantage of the taxman and go elsewhere for fear of being fleeced themselves? Possibly, but previous instances of the bank being accused of putting its own interests ahead of its clients’ have done little to dent Goldman’s reputation as the best and brightest in the business.With fourth-quarter earnings, due out on Wednesday, forecast to show a 74 per cent year-on-year increase in net income and the shares up more than 40 per cent since last summer, stakeholders are clearly not punishing the bank.One big advantage for Goldman clearly comes from being a bank with only a remote connection to the man or woman on the street. Universal banks, particularly those in Europe where the effects of the financial crisis are still being most acutely felt, do not have that luxury. Like Starbucks, Barclays, RBS and Deutsche Bank have high-street outlets that are prone to popular sentiment. Hence they are toeing the line on tax.That might sound like a rather odd defence of universal banking. It is one that regulators concerned with protecting the safety of financial systems have barely considered. But for politicians, tax authorities and others attempting to make banks reform themselves in the wake of the crisis, keeping that link with the real world is vital to maintaining moral influence.Patrick Jenkins is the Financial Times’ Banking Editorpatrick.jenkins@ft.comwww.ft.com/insidebusiness"
357;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-01-13T18:42:17Z;Labour seeks to end corporate tax secrecy;;"Labour has vowed to end the “tax secrecy” enjoyed by large multinational companies as it launches a consultation to explore ways to force greater transparency on to corporate world.The move comes weeks after Starbucks voluntarily agreed to give £20m to the Exchequer over two years after it emerged it had paid only £8.6m corporation tax in the 14 years it has been in the UK.Among Labour’s proposals is to force major companies to list a single figure for their UK tax paid, even if they have a complex network of companies in the country.The party also wants to examine the Danish model, which has a greater level of transparency on corporation tax receipts. At the same time the party wants to consult on whether there are international lessons to be learnt on improvements to transfer pricing rules.However Labour appears to have retreated from a previous idea to list in one place the tax paid by all major companies in Britain. That would have made it easier for the public to see which groups paid the most and the least tax; but some advisers feared it could have played into criticism of Labour as “anti-business”.Ed Miliband, the party leader, said on Sunday that he wanted to act on the growing public concerns about corporate tax levels.“We have a situation where many British companies and individuals are paying their fare share of tax and they look in horror at a system where multinational companies from other countries can make large profits in Britain but not pay taxes in Britain,” Mr Miliband told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. “We’ll end the tax secrecy.”George Osborne, chancellor, said in last month’s autumn statement that the government had taken more action against “aggressive tax avoidance” and evasion than its predecessors. He had authorised an increase by 2,500 in the number of tax inspectors chasing “evaders and avoiders”, he said.The coalition is this year introducing Britain’s first “general anti-avoidance rule” (Gaar) and will use the UK’s presidency of the G8 summit in 2013 to lead international efforts to prevent artificial transfer of profits to tax havens.A Labour aide said the party backed this approach, but said: “We don’t want to put all our eggs in the G8 basket. The rules in this country need to be clear, tight and properly enforced.”"
358;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Executives split by company tax dispute;;Half of the chairmen of the largest FTSE 100 companies believe the public is justified in being angry about how some multinationals minimise their tax bills, a survey has found.The findings of the poll by Korn/Ferry Whitehead Mann, the headhunters, show big business is split by the row over companies such as Google, Starbucks and Amazon moving money between jurisdictions to keep tax payments down.“Business has to come to terms with the emerging reality that tax is not just a legal issue, it is also a political and moral issue,” said one chairman who thought the anger was justified.Even many who thought the anger was misplaced accepted that it was genuine, but said it should be directed at policy makers rather than companies.“Directors have a fiduciary duty to minimise tax bills providing they are acting ethically and not inviting legal or other enforcement risks,” said one. “Politicians moralise and showboat, when they should be relentlessly tightening tax loopholes.”Korn/Ferry surveyed chairmen of 25 companies at the upper end of the FTSE 100, with a combined market capitalisation of £180bn and more than 1.1m employees, as part of its regular Boardroom Pulse poll.Dominic Schofield, senior client partner with Korn/Ferry’s board practice, said business leaders were “in a catch-22 situation where their responsibility to shareholders can often conflict with their responsibility to society”.Respondents were also divided over the chief role of business. Some 56 per cent said its responsibility was primarily to increase profits so long as it did so fairly and within the rules. But 44 per cent agreed with Paul Polman, Unilever’s chief executive, that its role was to improve the lives of citizens and come up with “genuine, sustainable solutions”.Some of the concern about multinationals’ tax planning reflects a perception they are able to decide how much corporate tax to pay. This month, Sir Martin Sorrell, head of WPP advertising group, said the contributions made by multinational companies to the public purse were “a question of judgment”.Last year, the National Audit Office said there was sometimes no clear answer as to what represented the “right” tax liability. The complexities of multinationals’ operations “together with the possibility of quite different but defensible interpretations of complicated tax legislation, mean that establishing UK national tax liabilities in the context of a multinational group is often far from straightforward”.The 100 largest UK companies pay lower rates of corporation tax than smaller businesses in all but two sectors, according to research by Oxford university using confidential corporate tax data. Possible reasons included big groups’ greater use of capital allowances, interest deductions and their ability to surrender losses to other companies within the same group through group relief.But the research also highlighted the contribution of big business, showing that 81 per cent of all corporation tax is paid by the largest 1 per cent of companies. Almost 90 per cent of corporation tax is paid by multinationals – evenly split between foreign-owned and UK multinationals.
359;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-01-08T00:19:25Z;Yum licking its wounds in China;;Shares in Yum Brands fell in after-market trading on Monday after the owner of the KFC fast-food chain warned that a controversy surrounding its Chinese operations would hit fourth-quarter earnings.“Due to adverse publicity associated with a government review of China poultry supply – and the corresponding significant impact on KFC China sales during the last two weeks of December,” same-store sales fell 6 per cent during the fourth quarter, Yum said in a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing.Yum had previously forecast a quarterly 4 per cent drop in same-store sales at its KFC outlets. Yum’s shares fell more 5 per cent in after-market trading.China accounts for around half of Yum’s profits and revenues and is expected to generate $1bn in operating income in 2012. It is also China’s leading western restaurant company by sales and number of restaurants.Allegations last month that Yum’s suppliers had injected growth hormones and antiviral drugs into chicken beyond food safety limits sparked outrage, with some consumers calling for a boycott on Sina Weibo, the popular microblogging site.Fast food consumption in China has grown rapidly in recent years, with western groups, including KFC and McDonald’s, enjoying a reputation for quality ingredients. That made the allegations against Yum particularly damaging.In late November, when the Kentucky-based company warned that same-store China sales would fall 4 per cent – the first quarterly decline since 2009 – Yum’s shares fell more than 10 per cent. Same-store sales rose nearly 20 per cent in 2011 compared to the year prior.Analysts have questioned why the company’s performance has deteriorated while other groups, such as Starbucks, continued to see growth in sales and a time when China’s economy improved after a period when growth fell.Weiwei Chen, chief financial officer of Yum’s China business, said in December that Beijing’s plan to double per capita income in China was expected to bring 600m more people into the consumer class, increasing demand for fried chicken and pizza.The company, which will report its fourth quarter and full-year results on February 4, said in its filing with the SEC that it expects earnings per share, excluding special items, to be $3.24.
360;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Sir Martin’s foray;Taxation is not simply a matter of corporate charity;Sir Martin Sorrell has confirmed many of the public’s suspicions about multinationals and their attitude to taxation. In a radio interview, the chief executive of WPP, the global advertising group, observed that the amount such companies elected to pay the exchequer was, for them, increasingly “a question of judgment”.While conceding that there were rules, he implied that these were so riddled with loopholes that a company’s tax return could almost be seen as part of its corporate and social responsibility statement.Sir Martin has an established role as a provocateur in corporate life. Last year he courted ridicule by mounting a trenchant if ultimately unpersuasive defence of high executive pay and his own £6.8m package in particular. Even so, his suggestion that corporation tax has – to paraphrase John Kenneth Galbraith – become little more than a warm personal gesture by companies to HM Revenue & Customs cannot be lightly dismissed.While the comparison with charitable giving is over-egged, the UK has adopted over the years too much of a “light-touch” approach to taxation in the case of multinationals that might invest in Britain. Companies such as Amazon and Starbucks have consequently been able to whittle their tax bills down to a fraction of those paid by homegrown enterprises, and in a perfectly legal manner. There may be merit in a flexible tax system, but this should not be at the expense of domestic businesses that have neither the option of relocating to lower-tax regimes (as WPP itself did temporarily, returning this year) nor of shifting profits from one jurisdiction to another. An excessively complaisant HMRC has only increased the incentive to exploit loopholes.Public shaming can be an effective weapon against companies that are too aggressive. Starbucks recently rethought its own tax arrangements even though it broke no laws. But it is not enough to rely on a mixture of corporate conscience and public opinion. This is a job for government.It is welcome that the UK is now taking a more active approach. David Cameron has signalled that Britain wants to use its presidency of the G8 to seek multilateral co-operation on making corporate taxation more effective. But there are also things countries can do unilaterally to make this tax less optional. For instance, a hard limit on the deductibility of payments to foreign affiliates, including the interest paid on intra-group debt, would make it harder for multinationals to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions.If the government’s tough line is to mean anything, such measures should be used. Relying on companies’ charitable instincts is a sure-fire way to see the principle of no double taxation degenerate into the reality of no taxation at all.
361;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Starbucks takes on Vietnam coffee culture;;Starbucks will take on the traditional coffee culture of Vietnam next month when it opens its first outlet in the Communist-ruled country, writes Josh Noble.The Seattle-based company would open its debut coffee shop in Ho Chi Minh City in early February, it said yesterday, increasing its presence across Asia to 12 countries. Starbucks will join other US chains including Subway and Yum! Brands’ KFC and Pizza Hut, which already operate in the southeast Asian nation.In the fourth quarter of 2012, Asia-Pacific brought in revenues of $198m for Starbucks compared with $2.5bn from its Americas division. However, Asia is Starbucks’ fastest growing retail market, with fourth-quarter revenues rising 23 per cent year-on-year.The company aims to boost its Asia store count from 3,300 to 4,000 by the end of this year, when it hopes to have 1,000 outlets in mainland China.Starbucks said in December it expected China to become its number two market behind the US by 2014, and by the following year it hoped to have 1,500 stores across 70 Chinese cities. It currently has about 700 mainland shops.Unlike in China, where the US company must convince a country of tea drinkers to switch to coffee, Vietnam has a long history of drinking and producing coffee, with coffee shops commonplace along the streets of the big Vietnamese cities.Jinlong Wang, Starbucks’ Asia-Pacific president, said he was “very excited” about the company’s entry into Vietnam, with its “emerging middle-class consumers who want to enjoy international products”.Mr Wang said the group was considering Hanoi and other major cities as future locations. Starbucks has more than 200 stores in the Philippines and more than 140 in Indonesia. Hong Kong-based Maxim’s Group, which runs Starbucks’ stores in Hong Kong and Macau, will operate the brand’s outlets in Vietnam.Vietnam is the world’s second-biggest producer of coffee beans after Brazil, although more than 90 per cent of production is for export. While most of the coffee is the low-grade robusta used in instant coffee, a small but growing number of farmers are moving to grow higher quality arabica beans, which command a higher price.Starbucks planned to work with local coffee farmers to promote the arabica industry, said Mr Wang.Despite the large production base and the prevalence of coffee shops, Vietnam still consumes far less coffee on a per-capita basis than some of its neighbours, such as Thailand.Starbucks, in partnership with the Tata group, recently opened its first stores in India, another traditionally tea-loving nation. It plans to add a New Delhi location early this year to its three outlets in the commercial capital of Mumbai.But as it expands in Asia, the chain will not be relying just on coffee drinkers. In November, Starbucks paid $620m for Teavana, a US-based chain of tea houses, which it hopes will help build its presence in India, China and the Middle East.

363;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2013-01-02T15:52:15Z;Corporation tax ‘a question of judgment’;;WPP’s Sir Martin Sorrell has reignited controversy over the levels of tax paid by multinationals in the UK stating that the amount of corporation tax paid by companies is largely “a question of judgment”.Speaking in an interview on Radio 4’s Today programme, the chief executive of the world’s largest marketing services group said that companies such as Google and Starbucks paid tax more out of a sense of corporate social responsibility than in order to comply with the law.“There are the rules,” he said. “If then companies choose . . . just as they choose to do socially responsible projects . . . in terms of building their long-term brands, to make a contribution to all the stakeholders on a long-term basis, all credit to them.”“Every company we deal with without exception knows that doing good is good business, not because it’s legislated,” he added.His remarks could reignite debate over the effectiveness of UK tax laws following public anger over the amount of corporation tax paid by some international companies with operations in the UK.Last month, Starbucks announced that it would pay £10m in UK corporate tax in each of the next two tax years even if it makes a loss. Its pledge followed weeks of public criticism over its tax arrangements after it emerged that the company had paid just £8.6m in corporation tax in the 14 years that it had been operating in the UK.But the move by the Seattle-based coffee chain sparked anger from some protesters who argued that the pledged payments by the company indicated that corporation tax was little more than a voluntary tax.This is not the first time that WPP has been vocal on tax matters.In 2008, the world’s largest advertising group by revenues moved its tax domicile to Dublin in protest at new legislation that raised the prospect of “double taxation” of its overseas profits.Sir Martin had criticised the new legislation and indicated that the company would only return to the UK once there were no tax costs in doing so.The UK coalition government has since enacted legislation that will ensure that UK-domiciled companies will not be “double taxed” on foreign profits from next year. The new law has encouraged a number of companies with significant overseas earnings, such as UBM, the media and marketing services company, to return to the UK.WPP recently decided to move its corporate headquarters back to the UK after four years in Ireland.
364;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;In one year and out the other;Wearing yellow or polka dots, new year rituals offer hope;Ancient Babylon may have been an autocracy but once a year its subjects knew how to put their rulers in their place. At the new year, the king was publicly humiliated in a ritual of penitence for his wrongdoings. The royal symbols of power were taken away and he was slapped so hard that he cried. If there were no tears, the omens for the new year were not good.As 2012 draws to a close some may be tempted to revive this tradition. Confidence in politicians from China to the US has been ground down by years of economic hardship, by scandal and by corruption. But as the new year approaches, so too does the hope that 2013 will bring a fresh start.It was this aspiration that led the Babylonians to invent the new year’s resolution 4,000 years ago. But other cultures have also developed useful ways of relegating the past to the past that are worth reflecting on as midnight approaches.In Hungary and Latin America, effigies of unpopular personalities are burnt on doorsteps. In some of these countries, households search out symbols for all that was unpleasant or annoying the previous year and chuck those on the bonfire as well. This year there will be no shortage of candidates. In Britain newspapers might be first on to the pyre, thrust there as a result of revelations about phone hacking and the Leveson inquiry. Bankers and traders can also expect a new year’s roasting following last summer’s disclosures that the biggest banks had colluded for years in rigging interest rates. Big corporations that pay small tax bills could also fuel the flames in Paris, Berlin and beyond. As individual taxes rise and public services are cut, public tolerance of fiscal arbitrage by multinationals such as Starbucks, Google and eBay is wearing thin.Japanese traditions offer another useful way to close the door on past peccadilloes. Shinzo Abe, Japan’s new prime minister, and his newly-anointed counterpart in Beijing, Xi Jinping, should heed the custom of forgiving grudges. Rising tensions over the disputed Senkaku islands– known as Diaoyu in Chinese – pose a grave threat not just to trading interests, but to regional peace.Japanese custom also demands that people try to pay off outstanding debts before the new year arrives, a tradition ignored by successive governments. But this is also useful advice for Europe’s banks. If they admitted the scale of their true liabilities, the clouds of uncertainty over the eurozone might finally begin to clear.Europe’s bickering politicians, meanwhile, might consider adopting the Indian practice of completing unfinished business. In an emergency New Year’s eve summit, they could try to seal a deal on how they will implement the measures they agreed in 2012 to improve the functioning of the EU. No doubt, in the best tradition of European summits, agreement would be pushed right up to the stroke of midnight.In many countries, what one wears or does on January 1 sets the tone for the new year. So here is a bit of advice for those hoping to steer a better course for their economies in 2013. Finance ministers could sport yellow undergarments – in Latin America this is said to bring success and wealth. The more adventurous could adopt the Philippine tradition of polka dots, the circle being the symbol of money. In Washington, Republicans and Democrats might consider a truce in the battle that has taken the US economy hostage. A more efficient Congress is not only in US interests but could offer hope to the global economy as wellSharing these traditions will not guarantee 2013 ends on a brighter note than 2012. But, at the very least, they offer hope that the mistakes of the past year can be avoided in future. In the end, that is the best reason for looking forward to a new year.
365;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-12-26T12:15:35Z;Group to ramp up support for energy drinks;;Beverage industry lobbyists are preparing to increase support for energy drinks, the highly caffeinated sodas that have been criticised in recent months amid allegations that they are linked to deaths.Susan Neely, chief executive of the American Beverage Association, said at a recent industry conference sponsored by Beverage Digest that criticism of energy drinks was a sign of the fast-growing category’s new prominence and a “hyper-vigilance” in the US about health.The ABA is looking to “ratchet up” its support of energy drinks next year, Ms Neely said, after years of focusing most of its efforts on fending off soda taxes across the US. “We are very aggressive,” Ms Neely said. “You have to kill legislation that is being introduced at the state and local level.”Energy drinks such as Monster and 5-Hour Energy have been implicated in several deaths that were reported to the US Food and Drug Administration in recent years. The health regulator revealed the reports last month.Shares of Monster Beverage have been hit amid fears over the reaction from consumers and worries that the industry will face stricter regulations.Monster has defended the safety of its products, dismissing accusations that its energy drinks put consumers at risk.According to a new report from Consumer Edge Research, 20 per cent of 1,500 consumers surveyed in recent weeks have stopped drinking Monster and 7 per cent of those consumers said they have turned to other beverages because of the recent reports.Monster’s drinks contain up to 10 times the amount of caffeine used in regular sodas made by companies such as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. However, beverage lobbyists argue that the caffeine content is similar to that of coffee brewed in shops.“Are you going to start banning people from going to Starbucks or banning people from going to the coffee house next door, because there is more caffeine in those products?” Ms Neely said.In response to inquiries from lawmakers, the FDA has promised to investigate links between caffeine and other stimulants that are included in energy drinks. So far no safety risks have been found, the FDA said in November.Michael Taylor, the FDA’s deputy commissioner on foods, told the Financial Times that the regulator was “taking a very hard look” at the effects of mixing caffeine with other stimulants and that it was taking reports linking the products to deaths seriously.“We need to get to the bottom of the public health issue behind those reports,” Mr Taylor said.Energy drinks face looser regulations than traditional beverages because they classify themselves as supplements. Mr Taylor acknowledged that the distinction between beverages and liquid supplements is blurry and said the FDA would provide clear guidance on this in the next few months.
366;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-12-21T17:35:59Z;Instagram and a big photo opportunity;Advertisers are eager to use the Facebook-owned app;"If marketers had their way, Instagram, the popular photo-sharing app, would be filled with Insta-ads.Dazzled by Instagram's explosive growth and the opportunity to exploit images to promote brands, marketers are eager to infiltrate the Facebook-owned app. They also are salivating at the prospect for Instagram to help them connect with consumers on mobile devices, which dominate a growing share of people’s time but lack a proven ad model.But marketers will need to tread carefully given the brouhaha set off this week when Instagram first announced then later backtracked on changes to its terms of service and privacy policy that would have granted advertisers rights to use the photos and data of users.Instagram, which lets people jazz up photos with artsy filters and share them with friends, faced protests from users and celebrities like reality star Kim Kardashian, who ranks as the app's most popular user with more than 5.7m followers. “I really loved Instagram. ;-( I need to review this new policy. I don’t think it’s fair,” read a message she posted to her 16.9m Twitter followers on Tuesday.By late Thursday, Instagram founder Kevin Systrom said in a blog post that the service was reverting to its original policies but would alert users to policy changes once advertising plans had been developed.Indeed, Mr Systrom reminded users amid the flurry of criticism that Instagram was created to become moneymaking business and that advertising is a strategy to do so.While Instagram has yet to sell ads, 60 per cent of the world’s top 100 brands already operate Instagram accounts and regularly post original or user-submitted photos, according to a new study from research firm Simply Measured.“Anytime you can show your product or brand naturally in use or being enjoyed – so the spontaneous photo of a handsome jock drinking a soda or of a good looking family driving their new car – is marketer’s gold,” says Thomas Gensemer, managing partner of Blue State Digital, the WPP-owned digital marketing firm.Starbucks, for instance, ranks among the top brands on Instagram with 1m followers and regularly posts artistic pictures that showcase its love for all-things coffee. The photos typically solicit tens of thousands of “likes” and hundreds of comments. A recent black-and-white photo displayed a French coffee press next to an open book and a mug decorated with the words “peace. love. coffee.” the caption read: “Relax and enjoy the moment, we’re almost there. #metime #ChristmasBlend.”“What we love about Instagram, for example, is that these networks use authentic or curated images that really give us an ability to build our brand, connect with our customers in a way that’s completely unique for Starbucks,” Adam Brotman, chief digital officer at Starbucks, said during an investor conference earlier this month.Other marketers already are tapping Instagram to crowd-source images for their marketing campaigns. A recent promotion for Taco Bell’s Doritos Locos Taco, which is made with the nacho cheese-flavoured chip, entered users into a contest if they took Instagram photos of the taco. A subsequent TV commercial featured a montage of the Instagram photos. (Taco Bell informed users that, by submitting the photos, they were granting Taco Bell rights to the images.)Marketers’ interest in Instagram could help jump-start Facebook's overall advertising business, after the social network agreed earlier this year to pay $730m for the app. Facebook has struggled to convince marketers of the value of its advertising and meanwhile has faced challenges making money on its popular mobile application. Advertising company WPP, for instance, said its clients this year would spend just $300m of the $400m they had budgeted for Facebook.As Instagram rolls out its ad business, it will face the perennial problem plaguing social networks of convincing marketers to pay for services they previously tapped at no cost. “That is a really challenging nut to crack for social media,” said Sarah Hofstetter, president of Dentsu's 360i digital marketing firm.“Brands are struggling to understand why they pay for something they previously got for free.”Instagram also is likely to run up against steep competition from other social networks that focus on images, such as Pinterest and Flickr. Instagram now has 100m about users, nearly four times the 27m it had in April. But its debacle this week shows that there’s no guarantee that Instagram will remain a leader in the category among users and advertisers eager to reach them, ad executives said.Sean Muzzy, chief executive of WPP’s digital ad firm Neo@Ogivly North America, said “Who is going to win in that whole thing is still pretty wide open.”"
367;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-12-21T03:28:55Z;China: cafe culture threatens tea houses;;"“Not for all the tea in China,” is a handy way to express extreme unwillingness to do something in the English language – because China is synonymous with tea.But the way China is latching onto coffee culture these days, China’s relationship with tea may never be the same again.According to a report published this week by Mintel, a retail consultancy, the number of coffee houses in China has nearly doubled in the last five years to over 31,000.Over the same period, the number of Chinese tea houses rose by only 4 per cent to 50,000. Yes, there are still more tea houses than coffee shops. But the bad news is that their clientele are often elderly, which may not bode well for the future.“Tea houses have targeted higher-end consumers with expensive teas, food and service, but lack differentiation, and there are few successful brands to meet the challenge posed by the rise of the café chains,” says Mintel, which predicts continuing slow growth of tea houses though also the emergence of tea house chains targeted at younger, lower-income consumers.Even worse for the tea houses is the fact that popular coffee chains like Starbucks have branched out into selling tea drinks in China, where people adore coffee culture but do not much like the taste of coffee itself.“Many cafés sell both tea and coffee, competing for custom from younger and lower income consumers who might respond well to a middle-market tea house chain,” the report says. The risk is that, in the end, it may be hard to tell the difference as both sell each other’s products.Nearly a quarter of Chinese consumers chose to buy tea drinks even in coffee shops, Mintel says. And a quick glance at the menu of any Starbucks in China will show that many of the other drinks have not much coffee in them either; they tend to be more like milkshakes than espressos.“Not for all the tea in China” should work as an expression of utter bloody-mindedness for quite a while yet. China may like its Starbucks – but not necessarily for the coffee.Related reading

368;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-12-17T20:22:30Z;Ritz drawn into corporate tax controversy;;The Ritz hotel in London’s Piccadilly became the latest company to come under scrutiny over its tax affairs, after it emerged it had paid no corporation tax for 17 years.But the company insisted on Monday that it was “a reputable and law-abiding business and pays the taxes required by UK law”, adding that it had paid no dividends since 1995.The BBC’s Panorama programme investigated the accounts of the hotel, which was bought by Ellerman Investments, a private company owned by Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay, in 1995. It found that the Ritz was a profitable business but had not been required to pay corporation tax as a result of applying a series of tax reliefs.Stephen Boxall, managing director of the Ritz, said: “Since the hotel was acquired in 1995, in excess of £50m has been spent on refurbishment, whilst maintaining the standards of excellence and quality. These costs are lawfully off-settable against trading profits.”The company said “a meticulous and complete refurbishment” of the hotel, where room prices range between £780 and £10,200 a night, began in 1995 and took 15 years to complete.The Ritz is the latest business to see its corporate tax affairs come under the spotlight, in a sign of the growing focus on the part of MPs, media and trade unions over the contribution made by business to the public finances. It has also been the focus for protesters as it, along with Fortnum & Mason, was attacked in a demonstration against government cuts in March 2011.The mounting controversy over corporation tax has intensified after a committee of MPs last month accused multinationals including Starbucks of “manipulating” their accounts to minimise tax payments. Starbucks, which had faced calls for a consumer boycott, earlier this month bowed to pressure by volunteering to pay tax, even though its history of losses meant payments were not required.Some of the continuing backlash against Starbucks on social media was highlighted on Sunday when negative comments on Twitter were displayed on an interactive display at the Natural History Museum, where Starbucks is sponsoring an ice rink. Starbucks said a malfunction of a content filtering system was to blame.The Barclay brothers, who also own The Daily Telegraph, told the BBC they had nothing to do with the running of the UK companies since they retired to Monaco more than 20 years ago.The BBC also highlighted a long-running battle by Littlewoods, the retail group owned by the Barclay brothers, to reclaim £1bn in compound interest from HM Revenue & Customs after excess value added tax payments spanning more than 30 years. Aidan Barclay, Sir David’s son who manages the UK businesses, told the BBC it would be a “dereliction” of the duties of the directors not to pursue repayments which were properly due from HMRC.

After the announcement on Monday morning, Caribou shares leapt to $16.The group has nearly $29m of cash and no debt.Mr Becht said in a statement: “Caribou has a fantastic brand and unique culture, and fits perfectly with [Joh A Benckiser’s] investment philosophy of investing in premium and unique brands in attractive growth categories like coffee.”Caribou, which aspires to create the same cosy store atmosphere as other high-end coffee chains, reported a net profit of $36m last year on sales of $326m.In June, Joh A Benckiser agreed to acquire Peet’s, a chain with a devoted following of “Peetniks”, for nearly $1bn.While the majority of Peet’s 200-plus stores are in California, with others in Oregon, Washington state, Illinois and Massachusetts, it has little overlap with Caribou, whose 610 stores are mostly in the Midwest and southeast.Peet’s also has a large packaged coffee business.Joh A Benckiser in June also acquired a stake of about 12 per cent in DE Master Blenders 1753, an Amsterdam-based coffee and tea company whose brands include Douwe Egberts.The group also owns a minority stake in Reckitt Benckiser – a consumer products maker where Mr Becht won plaudits as chief executive – as well as Coty, the perfume maker, and Labelux, a luxury goods group whose brands include Jimmy Choo and Bally.Competition in the US coffee business is intensifying. Earlier this month Starbucks announced that it would open 1,500 new coffee shops in its home market over the next five years.The group already has more than 11,000 US stores and the plan will expand its presence beyond the level that triggered financial troubles and a spate of closures four years ago.Last month Starbucks spent $620m acquiring Teavana, a tea retailer it will use to build a bigger presence in the Middle East, China and India.
370;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Prince of Wales defends tax status;;Clarence House has defended the Prince of Wales’ financial arrangements after antimonarchy campaigners accused the Duchy of Cornwall of using “a highly questionable interpretation” of its legal status to avoid corporation tax.Republic, which campaigns for an elected head of state, said it had written to HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) asking it to investigate and “take the necessary steps to ensure that the Duchy is paying corporation tax in line with normal practice for corporate entities.”But Clarence House said on Saturday there was no legal basis for the Duchy to pay corporation tax as the Duchy was a trust set up to generate income for Princes of Wales. It said: ``The Prince voluntarily pays income tax on income generated by the Duchy, so there is no legal requirement to pay corporation tax and to do so would result in double taxation.’’.Republic based its criticisms on a November 2011 tribunal ruling on a dispute over whether the Duchy was required, as a public authority, to conduct an environmental assessment of an oyster farm. Republic said that the tribunal’s finding that the Duchy was a “body or other legal person” meant it had “its own tax obligations”.But the findings of the tribunal , which said the Duchy’s historical context was “complicated and possibly unique”, do not provide any clear-cut support for this view. It found against the Duchy on the grounds it was a public authority. The ruling said the Duchy’s modern role was “carrying out the public function or service of providing an income for the undertaking of an extremely important constitutional role for the UK.”Republic’s move came in the wake of intense public interest in corporate tax after the Public Accounts Committee criticised Starbucks, Google and Amazon over their tax arrangements earlier this month.Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic said: At a time when the country is under unprecedented economic stress it is unacceptable that the heir to the throne is avoiding his tax obligations in this way.”He added: “As with Starbucks and Google there is a moral obligation to pay a fair rate of tax.”The Duchy was established in 1337 to provide an income for the eldest living son of the Monarch, by a charter stipulating that he would be entitled to it income, but not to the capital, thereby preserving the estate for his successors. It is a landed estate, mostly in the south west of England, comprising 53,628 hectares.
371;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Roche pressed to refund UK;;Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, is coming under pressure to reimburse £500m paid by the government for stockpiles of its blockbuster Tamiflu as debate intensifies over the drug’s efficacy.A group of MPs led by David Davis has called on Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, to launch an inquiry into wasteful spending on drugs, medical devices and implants not supported by full clinical trial data.The action follows a long-running spat over the release of the full results of tests of Tamiflu by Roche, its manufacturer, to the Cochrane collaboration, a network of independent academics who assess the efficacy and safety of medicines.In a campaign supported by the British Medical Journal, the researchers have called for comprehensive release of data and pointed out that US regulators authorised a narrow range of uses for the drug than in the UK, where Roche claims Tamiflu can reduce complications of flu, including bronchitis and pneumonia.In a letter on Wednesday to Ms Hodge, Mr Davis wrote: “Roche has conducted over 123 clinical trials [of Tamiflu], of which at least 60 per cent remain unpublished …Without all the clinical trial data, we cannot draw firm conclusions, but it surely cannot be right for a pharmaceutical company to receive £500m of taxpayers’ money if it withholds information about its own products.”The involvement of Mr Davis, himself a former chairman of the public accounts committee, will trigger concern at Roche, since the former Tory leadership contender is a renowned campaigner with a shrewd understanding of the media.If the case is taken up by Ms Hodge, it would be even more problematic. She has established a reputation as a scourge of multinationals, most recently in her reports on the tax affairs of multinational companies, including Starbucks, Amazon and Google. It is understood Ms Hodge is considering the letter from MPs very seriously.Roche said: “We stand behind the robustness and integrity of our data supporting the efficacy and safety of Tamiflu.“Numerous clinical trials and real-life medical experiences have clearly demonstrated the clinically meaningful benefit for patients one year of age and older, for both the treatment and prevention of influenza. Roche has made full clinical study data available to health authorities around the world required for their review as part of the licensing process.”The company stressed that published analysis by independent researchers had already supported its claims for Tamiflu, but that “in order to reach an amicable resolution” it planned to create an advisory board of outside experts to review all Tamiflu data.The European Medicines Agency recently said that it planned to release in anonymised form all “raw data” on the effects in individual patients in all clinical trials of drugs on which it had made a decision.
372;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-12-12T18:48:05Z;Taking a tax lead from Starbucks;Dear Sir, Flush with the Christmas spirit, I am writing to offer you more income tax ...;"Starbucks has volunteered to pay an extra £20m in UK tax after the furore over its minimal contributions in recent years.To HMRC
Dear Sir or Madam,
I am writing to offer you some more income tax. Flush with the Christmas spirit and buoyed by the remarkable example set by those noted philanthropists at Starbucks, I want to pay some extra tax to which you are not actually entitled. After all, we are all in this together.I am not doing this because I have to, but as part of my deep covenant with the British taxpayer and because I admire your creative approach to revenue raising. As you know, until now I have employed the services of an accountant who has advised me on permitted deductions and exemptions. I now realise that although these were entirely legal, it wasn’t very community-minded of me and that playing by the rules that you set is not how a good citizen behaves.A good citizen should realise that just because you set the rules does not mean that you can be trusted to make them well. It was my responsibility to aim off for your incompetence and not take advantage of your famous generosity.My decision has nothing to do with threats from UK Uncut to occupy my house next Saturday, though I do hope that if they go ahead with their threat, they will be good enough to take off their shoes, as we’ve just bought a new rug for the lounge.I know the top line of my return suggested that I had a good 2012, and that I am on the record as telling my friends that it was a “bonzer” year for bonuses. But, as you will have seen, that figure did not take account of important deductibles. Most significantly, it neglected to take into account the difference between your UK accounting rules and our own BOFP (Back of a Fag Packet) standard, which adds in costs for tax purposes that are not listed under the operating profits.For example, there are the rights and patent payments that I make to my parents for the use of their surname. This surname has been a very valuable brand benefit to me in my career, not least because there are several other people here called Robert and it therefore offers my employers the assurance of quality they would lose if they chose another Robert without the hallmark of my surname. As the tax code shows, this payment is entirely reasonable. Six per cent of earnings is standard for my sister and all my cousins, and a pittance in return for all the intellectual property invested in me by my folks. I have also borrowed money from my wife who charges an interest rate that would make Wonga blush.There were other issues. Although I did return an operating profit on my year there were serious losses in some of my business investments, notably the Cheltenham Gold Cup, the St Leger and the 1,000 Guineas. These investments, part of a failed strategy to grow the business, have been realised in recent years.But I am aware of my ethical as well as legal responsibility to the country so am offering this extra sum because of my deep-rooted sense of citizenship and community. I also like the voluntary principle enshrined in this approach and would like to continue it in future.I want you to know that I am coming forward out of my love for this country and not because I have been playing the system in any way. Let me stress that I do not fear that you will make a better fist of my assessment the second time around. There is, after all, little evidence to support that suggestion.I ask nothing in return but would be ever so thrilled if you could perhaps nudge protesters in the direction of that puffed-up bloke at number 43. I think he was on a reality TV show once so I’m sure there would be some media interest.Yours dutifully.…Wintour guestThe rumour mill has it that Anna Wintour, the famously steely editor of Vogue, is being lined up as the next US ambassador to London.“What’s all this about the embassy moving to Battersea? The only thing in Battersea is a dogs’ home and a power station that doesn’t work.”“Yes, it’s next to those. But there’s also a Shell station. It’s called Nine Elms; a very edgy, up and coming area.”“Let me see the designs. No. The cladding doesn’t work. And Nine Elms? No glamour.

373;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;China slowdown fails to dent Costa;;Slower growth in China failed to dent overall gains at Costa, as the coffee chain helped buoy third-quarter revenues at Whitbread.The FTSE 100 company said like-for-like sales growth from its 200 stores in China – a big focus for coffee makers’ expansion – fell from 19 per cent in the first half, but was still “comfortably in double digits” during the 13 weeks to the end of November.Costa on Tuesday reported a 7.1 per cent increase in overall like-for-like sales boosted by caffeine-hungry Christmas shoppers and, some analysts suggested, the woes of its US-based rival Starbucks.“It is difficult to define the impact of [the Starbucks tax issues] into the figures, but we remain the UK taxman’s favourite coffee shop …Starbucks has taken a bit of a knock,” said Andy Harrison, Whitbread chief executive.Seattle-based Starbucks’ 760-strong portfolio of UK stores has become a lightning rod for criticism since Reuters revealed in October that the coffee shop chain had paid no UK corporation tax in the past three years.Last week, Starbucks bowed to public pressure and pledged to pay £10m in UK corporate tax in each of the next two years.In its most recent financial year, Whitbread paid £84.4m of UK corporation tax, with Costa’s share some £18m of that.“Costa’s performance is likely to have received a boost from the negative publicity around Starbucks’ tax affairs, although it has consistently reported this level of like-for-like sales growth over the past 18 months,” said Simon French, analyst at Panmure Gordon.At Whitbread’s Premier Inn business, it’s biggest division by revenues, like-for-like sales rose 2.5 per cent as budget-conscious travellers continued to opt for the group’s midpriced hotel rooms.However, a 0.7 per cent increase in revenue per room – a key industry sales measure known as revpar – was less than half the 1.5 per cent expected by analysts and down from 1.9 per cent in the first half. That was led by a revpar decline of 0.9 per cent in London, as the local hotel market settled in the aftermath of the Olympic Games.The company said it would build 4,500 new rooms during the full year in a bid to boost capacity from 50,000 rooms to 65,000 by 2016, and increase national market share from 6 to 10 per cent.The group’s restaurant unit, which operates the Beefeater and Brewers Fayre chains, reported sales up 1.9 per cent compared with last year, but again slower than the 3.4 per cent growth reported in the first half.Whitbread shares rose by 60p, or 2.5 per cent, to close at £24.88 on Tuesday.
374;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks shows need for tax change;The world the principle envisages could not generate the profits the principle seeks to tax;"Starbucks has agreed to pay more in tax to the British Treasury. That might be a response to my recent column on the deficiencies of international corporate taxation, but I doubt it. The consumer’s purse is more powerful than the columnist’s pen.In that article I favoured reform based on a simple apportionment of total profit reflecting the scale of operation in different countries. But many correspondents rushed to the defence of the status quo in international corporate taxation, under which the principal basis of deciding where profits are earned is the “arm’s length principle”. The principle is described in a 371-page document published by the OECD.The arm’s length principle came into being when global business was far less extensive than today. The normal pattern of multinational business was vertical integration of the supply chain. If a weaver in England owned a wool producer in Australia, then the profits could be fairly and simply divided by reference to the profitability of independent English weavers and Australian wool producers.So today we ask the hypothetical question: “Suppose the different geographical operations of a global corporation were independent businesses, what would then be the profitability of each of the independent businesses?” It is only necessary to ask this question of Starbucks to see why the arm’s length principle can never work.The entire rationale of Starbucks is that its different operations are not independent businesses. Starbucks is a global brand and those who enter its coffee shops know that they can expect a similar experience whether the outlet is in Birmingham, Beijing or Buenos Aires. Starbucks sources globally and shares experience worldwide on everything from shop layout to preparation of the coffee.And that is why Starbucks is profitable. It is easy to set up a coffee shop, and both economic theory and the experience of people who run coffee shops confirm the profitability of an undifferentiated commodity in a competitive market with free entry is low. The hypothetical world which the arm’s length principle envisages is one which could not generate the profits which the principle attempts to tax.So where do the profits that Starbucks earns through its global reach arise? From everywhere it operates, and from nowhere in particular. That is the lacuna which this company, like many others, has utilised to claim that a material share of its returns accrues to a Netherlands corporation that provides licences and receives royalties. But whatever the answer to the question “in what jurisdiction did the profits from the company’s scale and scope arise?” may be, that answer is not “in the Netherlands”.Can you really visualise an independent business that has never bought a bean of coffee, talked to a customer or pulled an espresso, but has established a global brand and expertise in the operation of coffee shops which it sells to independent operators around the world? Not only could the hypothetical world of the arm’s length principle not produce much in the way of taxable profit; it could never exist.Perhaps Starbucks is just a hard case, an exception to a rule that generally works well. But Starbucks, not the vertically integrated wool weaver, is typical of modern multinational business. The problems that arise in attributing its profits to jurisdictions are essentially the same as the problems encountered in attributing to particular jurisdictions the profits of Google or Vodafone, of banks and pharmaceuticals groups, and of most other companies whose low tax payments are controversial.If there were few economies of scale and scope in operating business multinationally, there would be few multinational businesses. But there are many. These businesses find it hard to match the operating costs of the best local providers – no Starbucks barista will work as hard as a dedicated owner-proprietor of a coffee shop. Without the economies of scale and scope they derive from global operations, there would be little profit for governments to tax.The OECD asserts that the practical difficulties of the arm’s length principle are outweighed by its theoretical soundness. The reality is that these practical difficulties arise from its theoretical weakness.johnkay@johnkay.com"
375;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-12-11T14:52:34Z;Chancellor’s Bigg Northern Rock bonus;;"The great party city of Newcastle needs little excuse for a celebration. But payouts to Northern Rock customers should still help fuel festivities. For Geordie jeunesse doree, this means traipsing between pubs in the historic Bigg Market area clad in finery of hypothermia-defying skimpiness.The first reason to cry “howay the lads!” is financial. The worst assets of the troubled lender were hived off into a state-owned “bad bank” after nationalisation in 2008. So the government is liable to repay £270m in interest on loans that were badly documented. Many recipients must live in the bank’s northeastern heartland.Sadly, compensation will generally be delivered through a deduction of about £1,800 from each loan balance. No fat cheque, then. But lower interest charges will mean more money to spend on something else. Like fun.The second reason to crack open a Newcastle Brown is Schadenfreude. The northeast has been particularly badly hit by the downturn. The austerity policies of George Osborne have added to the woes of the region, which depends heavily on public sector employment. The chancellor has tried to avoid debt-raising economic stimuli. But the compliance cock-up at Northern Rock has forced him into delivering a small one, willy-nilly.Drinkers in Bigg Market pubs would probably agree it couldn’t have happened to a nicer bloke.Announcing your bank will be fined $1.9bn for, among other things, laundering the profits of the Sinaloa drugs cartel is one of the trickier tasks facing the ambitious chief executive. Stuart Gulliver of HSBC appeared to both accept blame and shrug it off on Tuesday. He said the bank was still responsible for its compliance failures in the noughties (self-evidently: no responsibility, no fines). But he added that HSBC was “fundamentally different” and “under new senior leadership” (in other words: it wasn’t me, guv).Mr Gulliver has been shaking up HSBC, dispensing with a federated structure that gave country bosses the freedom to play by lax local rules. But it would be impossible to dispel that discredited culture in just two years.Nor is senior leadership quite as freshly minted as Mr Gulliver claims. His previous job in investment banking insulates him from Mexican lapses. But chairman Douglas Flint was finance director from 1995 to 2010, and thus had broad responsibility for risk.However, the fingerpost erected by Mr Gulliver labelled “they went thattaway” points more damningly to the dust trail of Lord Green, who has left the bank. US regulators found money laundering compliance was weakest between 2006 and 2010, when Lord Green was group chairman. He is now a trade minister. His utility on marketing trips to the US looks questionable. On his watch, HSBC promoted the kind of cross-border capital flows no one should boast about.Mr Gulliver has meanwhile yielded a hostage to fortune in suggesting HSBC now has “the highest standards” of compliance. Big banks have a habit of breeding leftfield challenges to such assumptions.A couple is Christmas shopping.
Woman: Fancy a coffee at Starbucks?
M: No way. They avoid tax, supposedly.
W: Costa, then?
M: Too crowded. Costa paid £18m in corporation tax last year. For fiscally responsible consumers like us, that’s a bigger lure than a triple-choc mochaccino with sprinkles. Costa’s third-quarter sales are up 7 per cent.
W: My feet hurt. Why don’t we go home and order our presents online instead?
M: You can’t use Amazon. It minimises UK tax by routing transactions through a lower-tax jurisdiction.
W: I could find other suppliers on Google.
M: Same problem. And you can’t use your iPad either.
W: Why?
M: I smashed it. To save you from yourself. Apple sells globally but pays less than 2 per cent of its tax outside the US.
W: OK. We’ll go home. We’ll conduct a line-by-line analysis of retailers’ results. Then we’ll come back tomorrow and only buy from shops with a strong record of corporation tax payments.
M: Good plan.
W: Anyway, we need to get ready for dinner at Auntie Pat’s.
M: Are you crazy? We’ve no idea of her tax status. For all we know, she could be routing her profits from the flower shop to a secret account in Grand Cayman via a front company in Jersey.

376;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-12-10T17:33:43Z;Politicians miss the point of business;The purpose of the sector is not corporate social responsibility;For all the toxicity of the March Budget, the coalition government’s fortunes actually began to sour two months earlier. It was bonus season in the City and Stephen Hester was in line for almost £1m for leading the reconstruction of the Royal Bank of Scotland. Such private enrichment at a bank rescued by taxpayers proved incendiary. Cowed by angry voters and the prospect of a parliamentary vote on the issue, the government declined to back Mr Hester as he was hounded into waiving his bonus. This was despite his success in easing taxpayers’ exposure to toxic assets, and his willingness to do it for less than market pay. Soon after, ministers gave in to pressure to relieve his predecessor, Fred Goodwin, of his knighthood.Suddenly, a government whose stomach for big and unpopular decisions impressed even those who cursed them began to look like slaves to the news cycle. Its strategic discipline has not wholly recovered, as Starbucks, Amazon, Facebook and other major companies are learning. Ministers could have confined their response to the revelations of these firms’ entirely legal tax-minimising schemes by tightening the law. Instead, they reached for moral exhortation, inadvertently providing official cover for protest groups such as UK Uncut.Starbucks’ decision to capitulate by volunteering £20m of tax is not merely absurd but dangerous. Imagine an economy in which businesses decide their tax bill by gauging the popular pressure on them. Revenues would be impossible for the Treasury to predict. Companies with a public face, such as a chain of coffee shops, would be harassed into munificence while those doing obscure business-to-business trade go ignored. The basic fiduciary duty that companies owe to their shareholders’ economic interests would be lost.Danny Alexander, the chief secretary to the Treasury, says that taxation should not be treated like “the church plate going around on a Sunday morning” but that is where ministerial hectoring threatens to take us. The government is not even the worst offender among the political class. For Margaret Hodge, the Labour chair of the parliamentary public accounts committee, the Starbucks decision was proof that “naming and shaming works”. That a senior MP takes such chest-beating pride in so insidious a precedent is its own commentary on her profession.Politicians are often accused of lacking practical experience of business. The reality is worse than that. They are beginning to lose their grasp of the very point of business. In his early years as Conservative leader, David Cameron suggested that companies had a moral duty to do good rather than merely observe the law. In perhaps the most fatuous line he has ever uttered, he wondered why shops sell “half-price Chocolate Oranges at its checkouts instead of real oranges”.Labour has its own variety of thoughtless do-goodery. Ed Miliband, the party leader, sometimes gives the impression that he regards enterprise as all very well, as long as it does not result in too much money being made. Rather than just demanding legislation for a higher minimum wage – an entirely respectable idea – he is imploring companies to pay a “living wage” and threatening to expose those that do not.There are first principles that politicians must relearn. Business exists to make a profit within the law. It contributes to society by employing people and producing goods and services, not by attempting the modish fad of “corporate social responsibility”. Unchecked, its thirst for profit can inflict harm on society and cause extraordinary economic inequity, which is why government must subject it to the formal trammels of regulation and taxation. If politicians would rather evangelise than legislate, they have chosen the wrong career.There is another reality that is being obscured by the moral excitement of the moment. A large part of the UK’s appeal as a place to do business is its reputation for predictable and responsible government backed by one of the world’s great legal systems. It matters, therefore, if politicians behave arbitrarily. It matters if the head of the Financial Services Authority announces that much of the business he regulates is “socially useless”, as if such a notion were measurable or at all relevant. It matters if mobs are indulged rather than defied. British politicians chuckled last month when they read about a French minister threatening to sequester a foreign-owned industrial plant to avoid job losses there. But such reckless political caprice is seeping in to the UK.Not all politicians are equally guilty. Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor so often caricatured as a leftwinger, is a rigorous thinker who restrains his Labour colleagues’ urge to treat business as a branch of social work. George Osborne, the chancellor, was never much taken with Mr Cameron’s chocolate orange phase. But these grown-ups need to stand more assertively against the mob, and against irresponsible members of their own trade. It is not as if the UK’s elites have done so well at running the country that they can try their hand at moral and aesthetic questions too.
377;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;JPMorgan nears £500m bonus tax deal;;JPMorgan is nearing a settlement with the UK government in which the US bank and its employees could pay close to £500m in back taxes that were avoided through the use of an offshore trust for bonus payments.The Wall Street bank is in the final phase of winding up the Jersey-based arrangement and has asked more than 2,000 current and former employees to contribute to the settlement. Individuals who choose not to participate voluntarily could face a more expensive tax bill once their trust assets are liquidated.The case comes at a sensitive time for relations between UK tax authorities and foreign companies operating in Britain. Starbucks on Thursday agreed to pay a £20m tax “donation” following a public outcry over its payment of only £8.4m in UK corporation tax over a 14-year period.Trust schemes typically offer twin tax breaks by allowing companies and their employees to avoid paying, respectively, employer’s national insurance contributions and income taxes. The trust holds bonus payments, which cannot be repatriated without triggering a tax payment. But employees can take interest-free loans from the trust on an unsecured basis.Such schemes are being closed following the introduction of new legislation last year to outlaw employee benefit trusts. JPMorgan’s Jersey trust had previously operated with the full knowledge and authorisation of UK tax authorities.It is unclear how much money is currently in JPMorgan’s trust scheme, which was established 20 years ago. Senior executives involved in the scheme in recent years estimated the amount at between £2bn and £9bn. Assuming a standard 40 per cent tax liability and 12.5 per cent rate for national insurance contributions, that would suggest a tax bill of at least £1bn. However, the settlement is understood to be closer to half that amount.JPMorgan declined to comment on specifics but said: “Our employee trust has always been transparent …and its independent trustee has consistently paid taxes in accordance with UK tax law. In addition to taxes paid by the trust, JPMorgan has paid, on average, more than £1bn of [UK] corporation and payroll taxes …annually over the past decade.” The UK Treasury declined to comment.JPMorgan is not unique in using trust arrangements to pay bonuses. Glasgow Rangers football club recently won a court case with UK tax authorities over its use of employee benefit trusts.However, the bank’s scheme is thought to be one of the biggest. It was also unusual in being structured for several years as a so-called family benefit trust, bankers said. This arrangement allows assets to be passed to heirs without triggering inheritance tax.All senior bankers at the group were eligible for participation in the scheme, though US citizens were barred due to US tax laws.Participants in the scheme said JPMorgan had given them until Friday to volunteer to pay tax at a rate of their choosing in a “blind auction” that would be used to establish an average contribution rate. If the auction fails to generate enough money to pay the settlement, participants who bid below the overall average would be excluded from the agreement and face a 52 per cent tax liability when the trust’s assets are liquidated and repatriated. Several participants said they had volunteered to pay tax at a rate of 40 per cent.JPMorgan itself is understood to be on the hook itself for employer’s national insurance payments as part of the settlement.
378;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-12-07T19:36:40Z;Starbucks ground down;The coffee chain felt the force of spreading public anger over corporate tax avoidance;The British public poured an extra shot of people power into their morning lattes this week. Starbucks, the global coffee chain, bowed to months of public pressure by pledging £20m to the national coffers over the next two years, following 14 years in which its tax payments could charitably be described as “super skinny”.“We’ve listened to our customers,” said Kris Engskov, managing director of Starbucks UK and a former aide to President Bill Clinton. He insisted this was not an admission that the group had dodged its tax obligations but a reflection of the “soul” of a company that likes to do the right thing by the communities in which it operates.It was, however, an admission that the Seattle-based company – led by scrupulously image-conscious chief executive Howard Schultz – had finally grasped the enormity of the tax furore and resulting public relations crisis.And it was a message that spreads far wider than Starbucks and the UK. Britain is hardly alone in being saddled with a swollen deficit. And, as in other nations where welfare benefits and jobs are being cut, voters’ attention is turning towards the taxes paid by the rich and powerful.Activism against tax avoidance is on the rise across Europe. Protest groups, such as UK Uncut – which plans to demonstrate at Starbucks stores this weekend, despite its climbdown – are drawing attention to corporate tax avoidance. In France and Finland, campaigners are seeking to block companies that use tax havens from public procurement projects. Even in Greece, where the public has traditionally taken a relaxed approach to tax obligations, there are signs of rising anger.Starbucks’ highly visible stores – almost 800 in the UK – and vaunted do-gooding have made it an obvious lightning rod for public resentment. But online retailer Amazon and Google, the search engine, have also come under fire around the world for tax avoidance in recent months. The list of multinationals that employ legions of lawyers and accountants to ensure their bills are kept as light as the rules of the countries in which they operate is a long one.The complex arrangements used by US groups General Electric and Apple propelled them into the headlines. In September, a US Senate committee accused technology groups Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard of using “loopholes and gimmicks” to avoid taxes. US groups using tax havens are braced for a possible crackdown.Starbucks has proved a soft target. Founded in 1971, it makes much of its general championing of the less fortunate. In his book, Onward, Mr Schultz spins a homely tale of the company he first took charge of in 1987 and the big hearts inside it: the barista who donated a kidney to a customer, for example, and another who bought a poor fellow worker a cow.That image jarred with the revelation from Reuters in October that the company had paid just £8.6m in UK corporation tax – maybe one or two week’s takings in the country – since opening its first British store on London’s King’s Road in 1998. The chief executive himself earned a total of just over $16m last year.The baiting has not ended with this week’s decision by Starbucks (operating income at group level last fiscal year: $2bn) to make an “above and beyond” payment of £20m over two years to Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs, the UK tax authority.Tax experts and some MPs have criticised the gesture as inadequate, while activists attacked it as an admission of guilt.But on Thursday Margaret Hodge, the MP who has led criticism of the group, said it was a step in the right direction. “It is a brilliant endorsement of public action …People voted with their feet and I think Starbucks has been hit by that, have reacted to that, and that is a good thing.”The payment, Starbucks was at pains to stress, was about “relevance” rather than reputation, and categorically not an admission of guilt, according to Michelle Gass, president of its business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.“I think, if you look at the history of Starbucks, we always look for opportunities where we can go above and beyond,” she said in an interview at an investor meeting in New York this week. “And this is one based on what we’ve heard from stakeholders, from our customers, [where] we can make a difference.”The decision to make a difference was not a swift one, however, underlining the company’s failure to grasp the depth of public feeling.In the days after the reports of its “tax-lite” bill surfaced, executives appeared to be thin on the ground. Ms Gass has explained this was because they were concentrating on taking the message to baristas – “partners”, in Starbucks-speak – to enable them explain to customers.A week or so of silence was followed by a flurry of activity, culminating in an open letter from Mr Schultz on the company’s UK website, “setting the record straight” on “misconceptions” about tax and profitability.Troy Alstead, chief financial officer, was last month hauled before a UK parliamentary committee that last week issued a scathing verdict on the company’s “outrageous” behaviour. Yet even as the mud flew this week, Starbucks was heading for more flak by withdrawing (following consultation with its non-unionised workers) lunch breaks and certain maternity benefits.In its defence, Starbucks says it has made positive changes to its benefits package, too, including an apprenticeship scheme.Speaking to the London Chamber of Commerce on Thursday, where he announced the £20m tax payment, Mr Engskov, managing director for the UK operation, admitted to tardiness. “The emotion of the issue has taken us a bit by surprise,” he said.The company’s first line of attack had been defence: we may be big but, shucks, we just aren’t making any money. Starbucks says it made losses in all but three of the years it has been operating in the UK, a period in which it generated £3bn of sales. And Mr Alstead says that a quarter of its 600 UK-owned stores are running at a loss, a result in large part of sky-high rents. This is perhaps the result of what the company admits was a rather ill-judged property strategy.…But critics charge that Starbucks’ UK business made a loss only because of a strategy in which it made payments to other parts of the multinational group.The main focus was on the royalty fees paid to its European headquarters in the Netherlands for store design, trademark protection and the use of the global brand, while a mark-up on the coffee beans bought through an affiliate in Switzerland and interest payments to the US – which served to increase the company’s overall tax rate – had a relatively modest impact.By contrast, UK-based Costa Coffee, a rival chain, faces comparable UK costs and made an operating margin of 14.3 per cent in the UK last fiscal year.By saying it would pay up this week, Starbucks is addressing these criticisms but potentially opening itself – and others – to a new one: that tax is set not simply by statute but by companies, or even by the mob.Mr Alstead insists decisions on bills are “very much” made by tax authorities. “We are choosing to go above and beyond that to some extent because of our sincere interest to respond to our customers, who don’t understand, and are very concerned …That is not a message that people should choose how much tax they pay, by any means.”Yet this is precisely what Starbucks is doing: opting to pay higher corporation tax in the UK than required by law.For the next two years, its royalties, coffee purchases and intercompany charges will be exempt from tax deductions. It will pay “a significant” amount of corporation tax in these years, estimated at about £10m a year, regardless of whether or not it is profitable – an unprecedented act and an unusual take on capitalism.Starbucks’ decision barely registered on the US stock market where it is listed this week, with investors more interested in its sales and plans for new stores elsewhere in the world. Nor was there a broader impact in the US, where corporation tax is still not the live issue it is in the UK. The AFSCME, a union pension fund, has expressed concern that murky tax policies are storing up big risks for companies – but in the past two years its attempts to force shareholder votes on tax issues have been thwarted by several businesses.The chain has been coy about the effect of the furore surrounding its tax policies on trading at stores in recent months, but points to “remarkable” customer loyalty. Certainly, on Thursday morning the voices in Starbucks in the London neighbourhood of Islington, once a leftwing stronghold, were broadly sympathetic.“It’s a to-do about nothing,” says Gerry McConnell, a Canadian in London for a mining conference. “Companies have a responsibility to shareholders to structure their financing arrangements to the best advantage. It’s a fiduciary duty.”Similarly unmoved is Nikola Novakovic, a former banker. “Everyone is getting squeezed,” he shrugs. “I’m unemployed so I’m not worrying about all the things going on.”Even the more public-spirited coffee drinkers are in two minds. Down the road in Euphorium Bakery, Louise Barrett, a fundraiser, says it is “kind of shocking” that a small business has to contribute to the UK economy but Starbucks does not.The twist, however, is that 168 of the UK’s Starbucks stores are small businesses run by franchisees who have bought into the system.Boycotting the group, Ms Barrett says, can hurt them more than the corporate. “It’s not black and white.”
379;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-12-07T18:46:16Z;Stop banging the vending machine;Tax has a moral dimension that tends to affect people more than companies, writes Tim Harford;‘Starbucks has caved in to public pressure and pledged to pay £10m in UK corporate tax in each of the next two years even if it makes a loss following calls to boycott the coffee chain over its “immoral” tax practices.’ – Financial TimesSeems like the “tax shaming” campaign worked, then.I suppose so, if you think that the amount of tax the government collects should be determined by public relations campaigns on all sides. I’m not sure how sustainable that is likely to be – or indeed how well public protest is likely to work against, say, a multinational provider of industrial detergents or rat poison. Not everybody has a consumer-facing business to worry about.“Tax shaming” has worked. Don’t deny it.Has it really worked? It’s worked for the politicians and campaigners who have described the low corporation tax paid by some multinationals as an “insult”. But while politics deals in insults and shame, corporations don’t, by and large. And I have no idea why anyone goes to Starbucks, but I can assure you it isn’t because of their noble decision to bung the taxman a few extra quid. These campaigns may chivvy a few companies for a few years but this is no way to run a tax system.Fine. What’s your alternative?Why not just abolish corporation tax? We could collect the same revenue using other taxes. Closing the loophole that lets Amazon and others ship free of value added tax from the Channel Islands will prove to be a good start.You’re just going to let the fat cats have their way, then?Hang on. Which fat cats? All tax is ultimately paid by individuals. You can tax individuals by taking a slice of their income. Or you can tax them more indirectly, and one way to do that is to tax the corporations whose shares individuals ultimately own. The question is this: do we have any reason to believe that taxing the individuals who own pieces of profitable corporations is a particularly sensible way to raise money?It’s progressive.It’s hard to be sure of that, but let’s assume you are right. We could also be progressive using income tax, and that would include taxing dividend income as though it was any other kind of income.Isn’t it easier to tax profits and dividends separately, rather than load the whole bill on to dividends?I think that Starbucks and all the other companies accused of perfectly legal corporate tax avoidance are rather proving the point there. Profit is a really slippery concept. Remember the old saying from Hollywood, advising people not to work in exchange for a slice of a film’s ultimate profits: “A percentage of net profits is a percentage of nothing.” Profits are easily manipulated by multinational companies and a number that is easily manipulated is probably not the kind of number we should be trying to tax much. There are easier ways to tax the rich.But corporation tax has an advantage: some of the people who pay it are foreigners who own shares in British companies.Oh, OK. I see. Is it a good idea to tax foreigners now? I thought we gave up on taxing Americans in 1783.This is different. We’re not trying to tax all Americans.No, only the ones who invest in the UK. I get it, I get it.So you’re saying that tax simply shouldn’t be a moral issue. It’s all about the letter of the law?No, although getting the law right wouldn’t hurt. Tax is, in part, a moral issue. It’s just that morality is something that tugs at individuals, not companies. We all need to do our bit and pay our taxes, and one reason that the moral component is important is that many individuals with modest means would find it easy to cheat on their taxes by the simple technique of lying. HM Revenue & Customs is too busy to find many of them, and so a big weapon against small-scale tax cheating is moral persuasion.One rule for the companies, one rule for the little people?I’m one of the little people, too. I think it’s important that we pay our taxes and I think it’s important that the rich pay a larger share than others. But that’s nothing to do with Starbucks. And to think that a multinational corporation has insulted you is a category error. It’s like thinking a coin-operated machine has stolen money from you. We need to stop banging the vending machine in fury and figure out a better way.tim.harford@ft.com
380;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-12-07T18:07:08Z;Tory MPs fear Starbucks tax ‘precedent’;;The unparalleled decision by Starbucks to volunteer £20m of cash to the taxman after a wave of public pressure has prompted unease among many Conservative MPs who fear it could set a dangerous precedent.The move by the Seattle-based coffee chain, if accepted by HM Revenue & Customs, would mean an annual £10m payment for two years even if the company makes a loss in the UK.In Westminster, there was faint disbelief at the arbitrary way that Starbucks had put forward its quasi-donation to the Exchequer.Bill Cash, a veteran Tory backbencher, described the voluntary contribution as “a farce”, warning that the “ill-informed” discussion over tax could lead to a form of “democratic anarchy”. Mr Cash, who argued that tax should not be a moral issue, warned that public “bullying” of Starbucks was a symptom of Britain heading into “very strange territory”.His colleague Jacob Rees-Mogg, MP for northeast Somerset, said companies had a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of their shareholders to pay the tax required by law – and no more.In the case of Starbucks, given its high street presence and the risk of reputational damage, it made sense to pay the £20m as a form of “advertising”, he argued. But that did not mean others should follow suit, he added.Despite the payment, the coffee chain remains under fire, with UK Uncut, the activist group, planning 40 demonstrations around the country on Saturday. Hannah Pearce, a protester, criticised the “desperate” move by Starbucks, saying that offering to pay tax “if and when it suits” did not stop a company being a tax avoider.Tax experts were also sceptical, with Judith Freedman, tax law professor at the University of Oxford, describing the proposal as “totally incoherent”.“Tax is by definition a compulsory payment,” she said, “so whatever Starbucks is offering to pay is either not tax at all or it is an admission that not enough tax was paid.”Dan Neidle, a partner at Clifford Chance, the law firm, said: “To generate a large amount of tax at once, you probably need to do something quite artificial and unusual.”But other Tory MPs welcomed the Starbucks payment, including Peter Luff, former defence minister, who said it was time for the government to bear down on other multinationals.“It is time we devised a permanent solution,” he said.And Margot James, the MP for Stourbridge, said the news demonstrated the power of public opinion. “I think other companies will come under pressure – Vodafone, Amazon – and so they should. It’s outrageous that they have such vast revenues in this market and pay such a derisory rate of tax,” she said.
381;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-12-07T02:39:56Z;KFC in China: it’s not just the economy;;"Yum Brands, operator of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, gave a robust defense of its business in China on Thursday, saying the surprise four per cent contraction it expects to see in its fourth quarter sales there is just a blip.The company, which spent the last two decades conquering the Chinese fast food scene, blamed the sales stumble on the slowdown in the Chinese economy. Yet in a country where the fight for stomach share is fierce and diners are as picky as their tastes are fickle, there are reasons to think that Yum’s China woes go beyond the catch-all of weaker consumer spending.After all, other groups, including McDonald’s and Starbucks, have continued to see sales grow in China. (McDonald’s saw Q3 like-for-like sales in China increase 3.6 per cent while Starbucks’ LFL Q3 sales in China and the Asia Pacific region were up 12 per cent. Elsewhere, Prada on Thursday reported a 43.6 per cent jump in sales from Greater China (mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau) for the nine months to the end of October.)Of course, that is not to say that growth in Chinese consumer spending has not shown signs of slowing: Mulberry, Burberry, and Chow Tai Fook are among those that have blamed faltering demand in China for their weak earnings in recent months.But what the differences in performances suggest is that Chinese consumers have become much more discerning when it comes to parting with their renminbi – be it for a handbag or for food.On this front, KFC might do well to have a trawl through diners’ comments on Weibo – a Twitter-like service in China.From Reuters:Interviews with diners in Shanghai and Beijing, and a review of comments on Sina Weibo – China’s equivalent to Twitter – show many diners are unhappy with KFC’s half a dozen or so price increases in recent years, as well as changes in the local menu.The new products “are horrible, not as good as before,” said Queen Hu, 24, a consultant at accounting firm PwC. She used to eat frequently at KFC when she was in college, but has since cut back to about two to three times a year.And then there are the toxic chicken accusations.Late last month, Chinese media accused Su Hai Group, one of the chicken suppliers to KFC (Yum’s flagship brand in China with 3,700 outlets), of feeding toxic chemicals to chickens to accelerate their growth cycle from 100 days to a mere 45.The report, which has been dismissed as “untrue” by Yum, struck a nerve with consumers – who have been rattled by an endless series of food safety scandals in recent years. So paranoid are consumers in China about possible food contamination that a lucrative cottage industry has developed in Shenzhen in southern China, where people make daily crossings into Hong Kong to stock up on everything from baby formula to soy sauce for resale in the mainland (HK is seen to have more stringent regulatory standards and a powerful consumer watchdog).As Yifeng Mao, the head of equity research at Goldpebble Research, noted in this blog post, KFC has been able to command a hefty premium on its offerings because of the perceived safeness of its food:KFC foods occupy the premium market segment, meaning that it is somewhere in the range of double to triple the prices of local restaurants with similar menu offerings. For example, a chicken thigh and a chicken wing are about RMB 8.5 and RMB 4 at KFC, but only RMB 4 and RMB 3 at Country Style Cooking Restaurant Chain (NYSE: CCSC), a KFC knock-off. KFC’s claim to the premium segment lies in its environment – it’s clean, spacious, well-lit and, at least by Chinese restaurant standards, well appointed.But luxury comes with a price tag. An average meal there costs about RMB 25 (~$4) per head, placing KFC in the premium fast-food segment of the industry, not in consumer staple but discretionary spending category. Given the pleasant dine-in atmosphere and nutritious and safe image it has created, locals are happy to pay for it. But all this could change especially as the economy is cooling down.And check out this chart compiled by Mao, summarising the findings of an informal survey conducted by China’s three leading internet sites on their views of KFC in the wake of the toxic chicken furor.Tainted poultry aside, could Yum and its KFC brand simply be a victim of its own success?Yum, now the biggest foreign restaurant chain in China, has grown at a neck-breaking pace in recent years. It will have opened 800 new stores in the country by the end of the year and plans to open another 700 next year. How much fried chicken – however finger lickin’ good they might be – can one really eat?As Starbucks has discovered with its business in the US, at some point, sales are just going to get cannibalised by the new store openings (Remember that Starbucks opening a Starbucks in a Starbucks toilet story in The Onion?).And then, there is the competition. Along with rising wages and food costs and more cautious consumers, Yum now also has to contend with intensifying competition from both Western and local fast food chains.Burger King has recently announced plans to open 1,000 new stores in China over the next five to seven years.Meanwhile, thanks in part to an influx of venture capital and private equity funds in recent years, names such as Ajisen, a Japanese noodle chain; Kung Fu, which sells Chinese comfort food; Banana Leaf, a Thai curry chain and Da Niang Dumpling are increasingly giving their western counterparts a run for their Big Macs and fried chickens.Analysts think KFC still has room to grow in China. As Mao noted, for every million people in China there are only 3.5 YUM restaurants, compared with 58 in the U.S.Yum’s improbable rise to becoming the top dog in the Chinese restaurant scene might have made it the subject of many business case studies. But to stay there, it will need to find a new secret recipe to woo China’s ever more discerning diners.Related reading:

382;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks to pay £20m UK corporate tax;;Starbucks has caved in to public pressure and pledged to pay £10m in UK corporate tax in each of the next two years even if it makes a loss following calls to boycott the coffee chain over its “immoral” tax practices.The decision sets the Seattle-based chain on a potential collision course with investors as the tax payment will come from its parent group. Its plan is yet to be accepted by the UK tax authorities, which were not consulted in advance, and it sends a troubling signal to other companies under attack over their UK taxes, including Amazon and Google.Kris Engskov, managing director of Starbucks in the UK, described the pledge as “an unprecedented commitment”. He insisted, however, that it would have no affect on its relationship with other countries.The pledge followed weeks of intense criticism of the company’s tax arrangements by customers, the media and MPs after it emerged it had paid just £8.6m corporation tax in the 14 years it has been in the UK.Labour called on other companies to follow Starbucks’ lead. Richard Harrington, a Tory MP, articulated widespread unease at the unilateral move. Treating tax as “a charitable donation” was not the solution, he said, and would set an unfortunate precedent.“The system should be that companies can’t avoid tax by devices such as cross-charging from country to country and transfer pricing,” he said. “It is nice for Starbucks to do this as a gesture but the truth is that avoiding tax by these methods should be stopped.”Starbucks said it would not claim tax deductions for royalties, coffee purchases, interest on intercompany loans, or capital allowances, and would not carry forward tax losses. It said the resulting payments would be above those required by the law.Amazon and Google declined to comment when asked if they would consider a similar move. Nell Minow of GMI Ratings, a governance research group, said there was “a huge difference” between Starbucks and the two online groups.“Starbucks is physically present in a way Google and Amazon are not. That puts them in a more vulnerable position,” she said. “It’s a branding issue. You sell coffee to people that they don’t really need, so you can’t afford to look bad.”Download the FT’s latest ebook on Amazon, another multinational that has come under fire over tax in the UKOne US investor who owns Starbucks shares said other shareholders might see the payment as a cost, but noted: “It may be a rational economic decision over the long-term if it heads off something more draconian in the future, or if there are questionable underlying practices.”Mr Engskov said Starbucks took the step after listening to customers, but declined to comment on how calls for a boycott had affected trade.At a bruising hearing last month, MPs accused Starbucks of using intercompany payments to avoid taxes. The company said it incurred heavy losses in the UK because of high rental costs.Mr Engskov said that “by any measure, the UK remains the most competitive espresso market in the world and we have not performed to our expectations over the many years we’ve been in business here”.The government’s formal position is that corporation tax while “not a voluntary tax” is a private matter for individual companies as long as they stay within the law. Earlier this year, however, David Cameron criticised tax avoidance schemes used by celebrities such as comedian Jimmy Carr.“I certainly am committed to doing all we can to look at all the options to make sure companies pay their taxes properly,” the prime minister told the Commons this week. “On some occasions I myself have made one or two remarks about this that were seen as rather controversial.”Mr Cameron is under pressure from Labour to change reporting requirements to oblige listed companies to declare their contribution to the Exchequer in their annual reports in a “clear and easy to understand” single figure.Mr Engskov said the company would consider extending its commitment beyond 2013 and 2014 if it was still not generating substantial profits. He said the decisions were “the right things to do”, adding that doing the right thing did not only mean doing what was right by shareholders.He added that the company had been taken by surprise by the “emotion of the issue” about tax, having always organised its tax affairs according to the letter of the law.
383;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-12-06T20:59:06Z;Law, not populism, should set company tax;;The decision of Starbucks UK to shell out £10m in corporation tax in 2013 and 2014 is a big victory for campaigners who believe multinationals dodge paying their fair share. Unfortunately, it also looks like a defeat for common sense.The frothy coffee vendor has been bullied into making arbitrary payments when its accounts suggest it may be genuinely unprofitable. The message to foreign corporations is that they should not expect to be treated fairly in the UK.Starbucks has handled the furore poorly, apart from a creditable performance by chief financial officer Troy Alstead in front of MPs. As a result, few in the UK believe that so prominent a brand can have genuinely tolerated 15 years of losses here. Suspicions have been increased by complex transfer pricing arrangements.Over the past three years, the multinational has extracted a royalty of about £25m a year from the UK unit, plus £3m-£6m in loan interest. The total has always been less than an annual pre-tax loss of £32m-£52m. Transfer pricing would thus save Starbucks little or no corporation tax unless a third, unquantified element – a mark-up on coffee beans purchased from a Swiss affiliate – amounted to £3m-£22m, thereby creating a profit.It appears the premium is at the very low end of that range. The result – barring transfer pricing wheezes Starbucks has kept entirely secret – is that the business has made losses or been marginally profitable over the period, even before transfers.The £10m the group proposes to pay HM Revenue & Customs is not based on likely real liabilities in 2013 or 2014. Instead, it is the result of applying the corporation tax rate to the total for transfers in 2011, which yields a figure of about £7m. That has been rounded up to £10m (a sum originally suggested by the Lex column) because double figures are presumably more likely to get UK Uncut off the back of Kris Engskov, managing director of Starbucks UK.His capitulation is understandable. The coffee chain is a softer target for campaigners than Amazon or Google, which have also been criticised for minimalist UK tax payments. First, it does not enjoy the same near-monopoly in its market, making any boycott convenient for right-on consumers. Second, it has physical premises that demonstrators plan to target.Amazon UK, whose sales are undergoing a seasonal surge, has more of a case to answer on UK tax. The priority of the US parent is expansion, rather than big profits. However, if you applied a group pre-tax profit margin of 2 per cent to 2011 UK sales of £3.35bn, you would get a profit of £67m and a corporation tax liability of £17m. Last year, Amazon, whose UK transactions are handled in Luxembourg, where corporate tax rates are lower, paid £1.8m in UK company tax. Tax campaigners have previously targeted UK-based groups Barclays, Vodafone and Top Shop. It is regrettable that all three businesses currently caught in their cross hairs, partly as a result of an investigation by MPs, are from the US.Americans could easily impute motives of xenophobia to the campaign, just as some Britons did this year when US regulators levied fines on UK banks.

384;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-12-06T20:40:14Z;Blackstone to buy Dutch trust group;;Some might call it a contrarian bet. At a time when the level of tax paid by multinationals is coming under greater global scrutiny, Blackstone Group is paying €675m to buy a Dutch trust administration firm that in part helps companies minimise their tax bills.In the latest private equity investment in a consolidating market, Blackstone is buying Amsterdam-based Intertrust Group, which is owned by Dutch investor Waterland Private Equity Investments.The world’s biggest private firm by assets is expected to complete the purchase “in the coming months”, David de Buck, chief executive of Intertrust, said in a statement posted on the company’s website Monday.Intertrust, which employs 1,100 people in more than 20 countries, provides commercial, legal, tax and administrative services to corporations and high net worth individuals, it says on its website. The administrator does not advise companies on tax and financial strategies but rather implements them, said a person familiar with the matter.For example, at their clients’ request, it sets up intermediary holding companies in tax-friendly jurisdictions. Multinationals may decide to set up subsidiaries in certain countries to avoid double taxation when repatriating profits from overseas.Officials at Blackstone confirmed the planned acquisition and declined to comment beyond Intertrust’s statement.Blackstone is joining other leveraged buyout firms including Washington-based The Carlyle Group and London-based Doughty Hanson & Co. in investing in the fund and corporate administration business, highlighting increased private equity interest.The shift comes as large multinationals including Starbucks fend off a public backlash in some countries for their tax arrangements. The private equity industry itself became a focus for criticism during the recent US election campaign over the level of tax it pays.Stephen Schwarzman, Blackstone chief executive, has also been a fierce critic of attempts to reform a tax break that allows the industry to treat its fees for successful investment management as a capital gain, rather than normal income that is taxed at a far higher rate.Like the other US listed private equity groups, Blackstone is structured as a partnership for tax purposes, issuing special units that lack many of the ownership rights of shares in a typical limited liability company.The trust administration market is fragmented and prone to further consolidation as larger players swallow smaller operators unable to cope with increased regulation and as corporations demand global platforms.In June, Intertrust purchased Walkers Management Services, based in George Town, Cayman Islands, boosting its presence there, as well as in Delaware, Dublin, Hong Kong and the British Virgin Islands, the company said in a June 14 statement.In other private equity activity in the sector, IK Investment Partners, a London-based buyout firm, bought Hong Kong-based Offshore Incorporations in march 2011 from Carlyle, with the intention to merge it with Vistra Group, a European fund administrator it already owned.The previous year, Doughty Hanson purchased Equity Trust for €350m before merging it with its portfolio company TMF Group. Intertrust, which was founded in 1952, was acquired by Waterland in January 2010 from Fortis Bank Nederland and Bank Generale Luxembourg..
385;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks pays up to avoid boycott;;Starbucks’ groundbreaking decision to volunteer higher tax payments in the UK was a response to a “loud and clear” message from customers that they expected a bigger contribution to the Treasury.US investors were likely to accept the logic behind the move, according to Nell Minow of GMI Ratings, a US governance research group. “[Starbucks are] avoiding a boycott. It’s just a cost of doing business.”She added, “It’s not unusual for a company to pay a fine and admit no guilt. In fact, it’s more the practice because it looks like they’re being generous rather than being pitchforked into it.”But Starbucks’ decision angered activists, who questioned whether it would defuse public pressure.UK Uncut, a grass roots group that targets companies it accuses of tax-dodging, said it would go ahead with plans to occupy 40 Starbucks stores across the country at the weekend to highlight the impact of government cuts.UK Uncut said, “Offering to pay some tax, if and when it suits you, doesn’t stop you being a tax dodger. Today’s announcement is just a desperate attempt to deflect public pressure.”Tax specialists voiced doubts about the effectiveness of the move, which has not yet been accepted by Revenue & Customs. Unlike the US, where the Treasury was able to receive $7.7m in voluntary contributions over the past year, there is no clear mechanism for the UK Treasury to receive voluntary payments.In a statement, the Revenue said: “Corporation Tax is not a voluntary tax and parliament sets out the rules and rates for businesses to follow. The public expects businesses to pay their fair share and HMRC will challenge, through the courts if necessary, any structures or tax payments that do not comply with the UK tax law.”Heather Self of Pinsent Masons, a law firm, said: “It sets an odd precedent for a company to pay more than the right amount of tax.”John Whiting of the Chartered Institute of Taxation said the difficulties of paying more than the required amount of tax had been demonstrated during a row over avoidance by MPs with second homes a few years ago when MPs offered to pay extra capital gains tax.By volunteering the payments, Starbucks has not accepted the “transfer pricing” arrangements it used for intercompany ­payments within the group were too aggressive as a tax management strategy. The company said its decision on the figure of £10m a year for at least 2013 and 2014 was arrived at by rounding up its deductions and applying the relevant rate.It said it would not be claiming deductions for sister company ­royalties, coffee, interest on intercompany loans, capital allowances or for losses it carried forward for two years or until it made a profit.The intercompany transfer pricing payments have been central to the criticisms aimed at Starbucks in recent weeks.Critics highlighted the ­royalty payments it made to its Netherlands operation, which left the UK business reporting regular losses and paying just £8.6m in corporate tax since 1998, despite £3bn of sales.Starbucks’ decision barely registered in the stock market, where the company’s shares rose 5.7 per cent on Thursday as analysts released positive reports on the company following a meeting with investors in New York on Wednesday.On Thursday Starbucks reiterated that its lack of profitability in the UK was because of high rents and “competitive pressures”.Advisers said other companies would be closely watching the impact of Starbucks’ move, although Ms Minow said she expected Amazon and Google – two other companies criticised by MPs – to ride the controversy out.However James Henderson, chief executive of Bell Pottinger, a public relations firm, said no business should assume that the spike of interest in the amount of tax companies pay would blow over.
386;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Yum still has a taste for China;;Executives at Yum Brands, the operator of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, on Thursday defended the company’s recent stumbles in China and promised a return to faster sales growth next year.“I’m very confident we’re going to have solid same-store sales growth,” David Novak, Yum’s chief executive, said at the company’s annual investor conference in New York. “I believe in our China business model as much today, if not more, than I ever have.”Shares of Yum fell more than 10 per cent last week when the company warned that its fourth-quarter same-store sales in China would decline 4 per cent year-on-year, marking the first quarterly fall since 2009.With $1bn in operating income this year, China accounts for about half of Yum’s profits and revenues. It is the country’s leading western restaurant company by sales and number of restaurants.Analysts have questioned why the performance has suffered so dramatically even as China’s economy, which has slowed, appears to have stabilised. Yum has blamed weakened consumer spending, but other groups, such as Starbucks, have continued to see growing sales in China.Mr Novak acknowledged that Yum had overestimated its ability to maintain its torrid pace of growth in China, where 2011 same-store sales rose nearly 20 per cent from the prior year. This year sales will rise by 6 per cent, and Yum predicts sales could continue to be sluggish during the first half of 2013 before picking back up in the second half.“It’s simply a function of China getting to be a whole lot bigger,” said Pat Grismer, Yum’s chief financial officer. “With a bigger base, you’re going to grow more slowly.”Yum said that it was facing higher rents and wage costs at its restaurants in China’s biggest cities, pressuring its margins. In light of that, it would take a more “considered” approach to rolling out restaurants in what it calls “tier one” cities while accelerating the pace of development in smaller cities and rural areas.Yum remains optimistic about its China business because of Beijing’s strategy of driving economic growth via domestic consumption rather than through exports and government investment.Weiwei Chen, chief financial officer of Yum’s China business, said that the government’s plan to double per capita income in China was expected to bring 600m people into the consumer class, ramping up potential demand for its fried chicken and pizza.Shares of Yum rose 1.6 per cent to close at $66.92 on Thursday.
387;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
388;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-12-05T20:04:23Z;Osborne more Boy George than rapper;;George Osborne could reinvent himself as a rapper if politics loses its appeal. Easily as posh as hip-hop DJ Tim Westwood, he sprinkled his Budget – sorry “ Autumn Statement” – with shout-outs to his posse (the MPs for Hereford, Burnley and Thurrock). And he laid claim to business as the home turf of the Tories with all the knuckle-headed bombast of 50 Cent.Giving back to his homies, the chancellor splashed out with tax cuts like P Diddy dispensing Dom Pérignon to a thirsty entourage. The blingiest giveaway was cutting corporation tax by 1 percentage point to 21 per cent in 2014. That makes the UK tax system more competitive than those of rival economies.It is just a pity that rival economies remain more competitive than the UK, whose continuing stagnation was confirmed by lowered growth forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility.Corporation tax is paid out of profits, after all. A lower rate is irrelevant if you are losing money. That may not bother Starbucks. But it is a problem for domestic companies that lack the frothy coffee chain’s rococo transfer pricing set-up.Mr Osborne also talked up the soljaz on the street, if the small businesses who are the backbone of our nation may be described thus. First, the ceiling for 100 per cent capital allowances on machinery purchases will rise tenfold to £250,000. That will help Midlands manufacturers, if any remain.Second, rate relief will be extended for another year, bringing joy to independent retailers clinging on in our blighted high streets. Third, in response to tenacious lobbying, shares quoted on Aim may become eligible for inclusion in ISAs. Small companies investors would be able to lose their money more tax-efficiently than ever before.Having laid claim to the business ‘hood, G-Dawg, as one is tempted to call him, was free to pursue his beef with its most disrespected inhabitants: the banks. He fractionally raised the percentage levy on balance sheets first imposed in 2011. This was no drive-by tax hike. The move was expected and will keep the contribution from banks, whose balance sheets are shrinking like their profits, at the target level of £2.5bn.With procyclical regulation rampant, balance sheets will continue to shrink. So we can expect the bank levy to go on rising in percentage terms. Curious that the UK, whose only real comparative advantage is in financial services, should hamper the sector more than the US and eurozone competitors.Perhaps Mr Osborne, motivated by the British sense of fair play, has some form of golfing handicap in mind.Restricting tax-free pension contributions to £40,000 a year was another put-down to the City, on whose trading floors and company boards the bulk of high earners lurk. Small entrepreneurs aiming to shelter proceeds from a business sale will be among those collaterally damaged. For these toilers, life is currently a case of Stay Middling And Retire Disappointed rather than Get Rich Or Die Tryin’.A £77m clampdown on tax avoidance will meanwhile have zero affect on such prominent tax minimalists as Starbucks, Amazon and Google. A joint initiative with the French and Germans to curb abuses of transfer pricing rules is more likely to bear fruit. The chancellor is right to pursue this. But value-shifting UK multinationals as-yet unmolested by Margaret Hodge, MP and tax vigilante, would be inconvenienced alongside American cousins.As an art form, rap is loud, gestural but lacking in substance. That was the problem with Mr Osborne’s Autumn Statement too.The economy is flatlining, public debt remains untamed and the chancellor has no stimulatory plan beyond an aspiration for pension funds to finance infrastructure projects.The alignment of the Conservatives to business – unclear in the first days of the coalition – is no longer in doubt. But the faith of business in the Conservatives is wearing thin. To critics who have always doubted Mr Osborne could become an economic heavyweight, he still resembles Boy George more than 50 Cent.
389;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks says it will pay more UK tax;;Starbucks will pay extra tax in the UK under a deal aimed at defusing accusations of tax avoidance, though it denies its previous payments were too low and insists it has followed the law.Ahead of a deal with the tax authorities due to be announced on Thursday, Troy Alstead, its chief financial officer, said that Starbucks recognised that complying with the UK law “isn’t enough right now”.“So the changes you’ll hear about – that will come in more depth – are about recognising that we need to do more than [what’s] required today,” he told the Financial Times at an investor meeting in New York.Starbucks was one of the multinationals, alongside Amazon and Google, accused of “immoral” tax avoidance in a highly critical report from a committee of British lawmakers this week.The US coffee chain has been shaken by a wave of public criticism, calls for a boycott of its UK stores, and plans by a campaign group to occupy some of them.Asked if Starbucks was concerned about reputational damage, Michelle Gass, head of Starbucks in Europe, said: “We’re listening. I guess I would say we are listening and we are responding.”She said the tax furore had not affected its view about the UK as an attractive destination for investment.Starbucks’ talks with the tax authorities have centred on two so-called inter-company payments: a tax deduction it receives for a royalty charge paid to its Netherlands business, and a mark-up on coffee bought by its UK operation.The executives declined to give details of the deal or comment on whether it would result in a one-off payment or a permanent rise in Starbucks’s UK tax bill.Sky News first reported that it would result in payments of between £5m and £10m in corporation tax for the current financial year.Download the FT’s latest ebook and join the authors for a live chat on Thursday 6 December 1500-1600 GMT (1000-1100 New York time)Mr Alstead stressed that while inter-company payments had become the centre of attention, the company would have paid very little tax even without them because it is not profitable in the UK.At a bruising hearing last month, British lawmakers dismissed Starbucks’ explanation that it had incurred heavy losses in Britain because mistakes in its property strategy had left it facing unsustainably high rental costs.Mr Alstead said: “I’m firmly saying, as loudly as I can, we’ve done everything not only to the letter of the law, but to the spirit.”Despite the company’s decision to bow to public pressure, Mr Alstead said tax bills should be determined by tax laws and not at the discretion of companies.“I think it’s very much the tax authorities . . . We are choosing to go above and beyond that to some extent because of our sincere interest to respond to our customers, who don’t understand, and are very concerned.”
390;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;Tax to be levied on £40bn in Swiss banks;;George Osborne snapped shut four tax loopholes on Wednesday, as part of a renewed drive to reduce evasion and avoidance that is expected to increase revenues by £2bn to £22bn a year.The centrepiece of the chancellor’s crackdown was a deal to levy UK tax on an estimated £40bn of secret Swiss bank accounts, which Mr Osborne billed as “the largest tax evasion settlement in UK history”.It is expected to bring in more than £5bn over the next six years – although the Office for Budget Responsibility described this as “highly uncertain” because of the lack of information about the value of the assets held by Britons in Switzerland.Mr Osborne said he also wanted to ensure that multinational companies paid “their proper share of taxes” through enhanced enforcement, and an international effort to prevent “artificial transfers of profits to tax havens”.A proposal to use the public procurement process to deter avoidance by companies involved in tendering for public contracts will be consulted on by the Cabinet Office and HM Revenue & Customs.The chancellor’s comments came in the wake of a highly critical report by the Public Accounts Committee which accused multinationals – such as Starbucks, Amazon and Google – of “immoral” tax avoidance.Starbucks, which has said its low corporation tax payments are the result of losses rather than avoidance, was reported by Sky News to be close to a deal with the Revenue that would result in payments of between £5m and £10m in corporation tax for the current financial year.However, the OBR warned that the £2bn expected to be generated through an extra £77m investment in Revenue enforcement could be affected by other spending cuts at the tax authority. The Revenue is expanding its “affluent” unit to investigate taxpayers with more than £1m in assets and expects to be able to generate an extra 1,600 cases, and detect at least 200 more cases of offshore evasion.About £200m is expected to be safeguarded by closing down three corporation tax avoidance schemes involving financial products, and by combating the abuse of patent royalties by individuals.But the Treasury said it had dropped a proposal to prevent senior interim managers being paid through personal service companies – a plan drawn up in the wake of a row over off-payroll payments for civil servants earlier in the year. It said it had decided not to proceed because new restrictions on the public sector were “sufficient to prevent the loss through disguised employment in this way”.
391;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-12-05T18:38:24Z;FT ebook Q&A: The Amazon Economy;;The FT’s latest ebook is about Amazon and its voracious expansion from online book retailer into technological giant.Is the company a force for good? Can it justify its current stock price? Why does Amazon compete with the companies it provides services to? Will Amazon agree to pay more tax in the UK as Starbucks just agreed to do?Thanks to everyone who took part in the Q&A. If you have further questions, please post them to Twitter using #FTAmazon. Barney Jopson, the FT’s US retail correspondent, and Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson, global media editor, will answer them here as soon as possible.If you would like to buy a copy of the FT’s ebook The Amazon Economy, visit: www.ft.com/ebook@Barneyjopson: Amazon has announced today that it’s opening its first digital bookstore in Brazil (including 13,000 Portuguese-language titles) – another reminder, as if it were needed, that Amazon is quite literally expanding in all directions. Into new countries and into new business categories. A couple of questions that don’t have clear answers are whether this makes sense and whether it’s sustainable. It’s had a full ecommerce business in China for a while (and has no doubt invested a lot of money there), but it remains a small player if you look at its market share. The more it’s doing, the greater the risk of over-stretching or losing focus. Because Amazon doesn’t talk about its long-term plans, it’s hard to know whether these kind of moves are canny opportunism, or part of a big vision.@Edgecliffe: What is clear, though, is that Amazon’s sheer size is attracting more attention from competition authorities. Much like Apple, Facebook and Google, it is pushing traditional boundaries and playing a huge role in changing the markets with which it intersects. Many of the companies affected by the rise of these giant technology companies now feel that regulators need to change the way they used to measure market power – Apple’s iTunes is one reason why Universal Music felt able to bid for EMI and Amazon’s Kindle store is a force behind the merger of Random House and Penguin (the book publisher owned, like the FT, by Pearson). The European Commission and the Department of Justice gave short shrift to the Apple argument in the Universal/EMI deal – it will be interesting to see what weight they attach to Amazon’s influence in reviewing the Random House/Penguin deal.Any signs that the breadth of its vertical integration will invite antitrust scrutiny, in US or Europe? #FTAmazon@Barneyjopson: Following on from Andrew’s comments on the mixed messages from regulators, I think it’s worth noting one difference between the US and Europe. In the US the focus of anti-trust regulators is often on harm to consumers. And if the prices of books, for example, are coming down, that’s not deemed to be harming consumers. It’s helping them. In Europe consumers also matter, of course, but regulators also pay attention to potential harm to competitors. Publishers are certainly concerned about Amazon, their biggest distributor, becoming a publisher. But there’s no sign of European regulators going after Amazon. Instead they’ve taken the same approach to ebooks as the US Department of Justice.@Edgecliffe: There is also no sign that Amazon is restricting supply. Quite the opposite, in fact: a Bain & Company report last month found that Amazon’s catalogue of book titles grew nine-fold from 2.3m in 2005 to more than 20m in 2012@linamkhan: If Amazon is “becoming as important as a utility” do you think it should be regulated as one? #FTAmazon@Barneyjopson: Whether Amazon – or part of Amazon – should be regulated is I think a debate that needs to be had. I’m aware of no precedent for regulating a pure retail business, but it’s the parts of Amazon that provide services to other businesses that raise questions about the dependency relationships and systemic risks building up around them. Its cloud computing business – where Amazon loves to champion just how many businesses depend on it – is a leading example. Think about similar utility or so-called “network” businesses: power companies, stock exchanges, credit card processors. They all reached a level of importance that triggered debates on regulation. Amazon, I think, hates this idea.@Edgecliffe: As an add to Barney’s regulatory answer, can I offer this: Regulators are sending pretty mixed messages about Amazon. On the one hand, the company’s size is attracting more scrutiny from authorities from Washington to Brussels, but then in the one market where Amazon is arguably most dominant – ebooks – the US Department of Justice sued five publishers and Apple, (a smaller competitor in ebooks) over their pricing. Regulators tend to intervene when they fear companies will use their market power to raise prices: Amazon’s great defence – to date, at least – has been its ability to show that it typically pushes down the prices that consumers pay.Will Amazon agree to pay more tax in the UK as Starbucks just agreed to do?@Barneyjopson: While Starbucks has bowed to pressure, there’s no sign of Amazon doing that. In fact, since one of their executives angered UK lawmakers by not answering most of their questions on its tax position, the company has been silent. Why? They rarely respond in public to criticism. The question here is whether the issue is so important they cannot afford to ignore it. If it starts to affect sales I think that would get their attention. But while a Starbucks coffee is for many people a discretionary purchase – or at least they have other choices – one of Amazon’s successes is making itself an integral part of people’s shopping lives through its convenience. So perhaps it’s insulated itself against consumer boycotts.
392;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-12-04T23:29:26Z;MPs to investigate tax system;;A committee of MPs is poised to carry out an inquiry into Britain’s tax system which will probe its competitiveness and whether it is vulnerable to tax avoidance.The Treasury committee, chaired by Andrew Tyrie, will call for evidence within days and probably begin hearings in the new year.George Mudie, a member of the committee, hinted at the plan at a subcommittee where he said the group would soon examine companies that “do not seem to pay their fair share of tax in this country”.Yet the hearings will probably strike a different tone from the inquiry by the public accounts committee where MPs grilled executives from Google, Starbucks and Amazon – all under the spotlight for their low tax rates.Some members of the Treasury committee are understood to have been irritated by the PAC inquiry, complaining that the committee, chaired by Labour’s Margaret Hodge, had overstepped its strict remit of analysing National Audit Office reports.One Treasury committee member said it would look at broader issues of tax policy – including, but not limited to, tax avoidance. The remit would include the entire “purpose of tax policy”, he said.The inquiry comes at a sensitive time for HM Revenue & Customs which has been criticised for its willingness to strike deals with large companies and its failure to pursue legal actions against those dodging tax.The PAC report, published on Monday, accused HMRC of being “way too lenient” with global corporations, warning that it was “failing to meet the legitimate public expectations from the tax system”. The report urged the government to become more assertive in confronting corporate tax avoidance.Mr Tyrie, a Conservative MP, has criticised the tax system for being “riddled with anomalies” and elements of “incoherence” which mean that companies and individuals are not all on a level playing field.He said, in a speech in May, the government had to focus on achieving a tax policy that would encourage, rather than hinder, economic growth. “Despite some progress on corporation tax, on both rates and simplification, Britain has lost significant ground to its competitors over the last decade,” he said.The government had been influenced by “powerful vested interest groups” which benefited from various reliefs, rates and distortions and did not want to see any changes.Mr Tyrie warned about the government’s plans for a general anti-abuse rule (GAAR), a law that comes into force next year, aimed at ending highly artificial avoidance schemes.He said the idea could involve “huge” administrative cost and questioned its “irreversibility”.“Were it possible to introduce a GAAR for a limited period, perhaps supported by a sunset clause, I would be less wary of it,” he said.HMRC officials and creators of tax avoidance schemes will appear at a PAC hearing on Thursday.Oxford university academics, in a report commissioned by the National Audit Office, said attempts to identify “individual or corporate villains” engaged in tax avoidance could backfire.“Even if public naming and shaming influences a few taxpayers in the public eye to impose their own voluntary constraints, it will not necessarily affect the worst avoiders, and may even encourage some non-compliance from those who feel that ‘everyone is at it’,” the report said.The Oxford university Centre for Business Taxation said it was important to differentiate between avoidance and a company using the international tax system to its advantage. Citing Starbucks and Facebook as examples it said “the fact that there is a high turnover but no taxable profit is not in itself an indicator that the taxpayer is behaving in an unreasonable way”.
393;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-12-04T15:28:43Z;Water companies claim high ground on tax;;Should the UK’s leading water companies be grouped with a range of multinational companies that have been criticised for paying little or no corporation tax on earnings made in Britain?Simon Hughes, MP for Bermondsey and deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, thinks so.At a parliamentary meeting on Monday, Mr Hughes repeated his attack on some companies in the sector for building up multibillion-pound levels of debt while paying little or no corporation tax.Sir Ian Byatt, former director-general of water industry watchdog Ofwat, has also specifically attacked Thames Water in recent weeks for rewarding its private equity owners at the expense of customers. He argues alongside Mr Hughes that over-generous dividend payments and stretched debt levels at Thames have unfairly left its customers to face £80 increases in bills to fund the £4.1bn construction costs for the so-called Thames Super Sewer, which aims to prevent regular sewage overflows into the Thames.At face value, Thames’s cause was not helped on Monday by the release of interim results that showed it taking a tax credit of £15m towards post-tax profits that fell from £146m to £128m while net debt edged up from £7.8bn to £8.1bn. Pre-tax profits were down from £146m to £113m.But Stuart Siddall, chief financial officer at Thames, is unapologetic over the tax affairs at Britain’s biggest water company by turnover.“We get compared to Google or Amazon or Starbucks,” he says. “But we are spending £1bn a year improving pipes and infrastructure improvements.”Thames, privatised in 1989 and owned by German utility RWE until its sale to a consortium led by Australian investment group Macquarie in 2006, has seen its net debt levels gradually rise since then. Its financial leverage compared with its asset base rose to 78 per cent at the end of September.But Mr Siddall argues that the increase in indebtedness is a fair route to achieving the financing for £5bn of capital spending required by Thames during its five-year investment plan that runs to 2014 and was agreed with Ofwat.Thames, along with a number of its peers, has enjoyed sharp falls in corporate tax bills. But the water companies argue that arrangements made with Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs to offset large capital spending commitments against profits are an uncontroversial deferral rather than avoidance of tax.All water companies, along with other enterprises with large levels of deferred tax liabilities, though, are now benefiting from a reduction in corporation tax from 26 per cent to 24 per cent this year, which is allowing them to book exceptional credits.“As corporation tax drops, every 1 percentage fall leads to a deferred liability drop of £40m,” said Mr Siddall.Tony Wray, chief executive of Severn Trent, said last week that his company remained clearly committed to paying its fair share of corporation tax though it too was benefiting from reductions in its deferred tax liability because of recent cuts.Mr Wray argues the sector is inevitably committed to seeking both equity and debt finance in the foreseeable future.“There’s a huge amount to invest over the next 25-30 years which is unlikely to be raised through taxation or the front-loading of customer bills,” says Mr Wray. “It makes sense to raise finance in the marketplace and smooth out the cost to customers over time.”Steve Mogford, chief executive of United Utilities, which serves northwest England, concurs that consumers have been generally well served by the current model in spite of rewards claimed by equity and debt investors.“If you look to what sums have been invested by both listed and private equity business, more than twice as much money has gone into water and waste water industry over the last 20 years than has been taken out of it,” he says. “One hundred billion pounds is what the sector has invested since privatisation.”In the meantime, improvements to the sector have helped tackle Britain’s former tag of being the “dirty man of Europe”, says Mr Mogford. “The Mersey river now has salmon in it – not tinned salmon, by the way.”However, Mr Hughes remains unconvinced.“Thames Water and other highly indebted water companies may claim that capital allowances are the legitimate way in which they pay no taxes,” he says.“The reality is that these companies have raised billions in recent years in order to pay off the debts of their private equity owners, and the interest payments on that debt has wiped away hundreds of millions of taxable profits.“Water rate payers and the public will find it very difficult to understand why they should pay for this. We are demanding that the water industry pays its fair share.”
394;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Osborne talks tough on big tax avoiders;;George Osborne stepped up his attack on tax dodging on Monday after MPs rounded on Starbucks and other multinational companies accused of aggressive tax avoidance.The chancellor said the Treasury was “coming after” tax avoiders, adding that it was “not right that wealthy people or multinational companies avoid the taxes that are due”.The comments came as Mr Osborne announced plans for a clampdown on tax avoidance aimed at raising £10bn, while MPs on the public accounts committee issued a blistering report condemning multinationals’ tax practices as “an insult” to British companies and individuals.But despite the harsh rhetoric, there are so far no signs of a reversal in the government’s commitment to promoting tax competitiveness as a way to attract foreign investment to the UK. “If we make our taxes less competitive that will just mean more companies stay out of Britain,” he told the BBC on Sunday.Some businesses are privately fearful that the uproar over corporate tax planning will lead to a backlash that would make the British tax system more burdensome. But the Treasury’s pledge to tackle multinationals that shift profits to low tax countries has so far been calibrated to avoid undermining its stated policy of making the UK the most competitive tax regime in the industrialised world.As well as allocating more funds to HM Revenue & Customs to enforce existing rules, Mr Osborne has promised to promote reform of international tax standards for multinationals when Britain leads the G7 next year.Alex Henderson, tax partner at PwC, the professional services group, said: “Extra resources for HMRC is positive news. It should mean HMRC is better placed to ensure businesses apply the tax rules correctly and help companies themselves know better where they stand.”What it did: Starbucks has paid just £8.6m of tax since 1998, despite racking up £3bn of sales and building a 31 per cent market shareThe criticism: Much of the money it earns is transferred as royalty payments to a sister company in the Netherlands, leaving the UK division to report lossesThe defence: Starbucks’ royalty payments were set at an arms-length price. Its low tax payments resulted not from avoidance but from unsustainably high rental costs on its ‘high-priced, long-lease prime real estate sites’Business groups have reacted cautiously to the uproar. Simon Walker, director-general of the Institute of Directors, said: “It is very frustrating for many companies who pay large tax bills that some multinationals are able to avoid doing so. The solution must be simplifying the tax system, not simply hectoring from Westminster.”The Treasury has watched the unfolding debate with frustration, as MPs and media have criticised the tax authority for apparent laxness resulting in billions of pounds of allegedly uncollected tax. David Gauke, Treasury minister, has said some of the criticism betrays a lack of understanding about how corporation tax works and “belittle the good work that HMRC does, in an extremely difficult task”.MPs on the public accounts committee on Monday aimed their fire on the Revenue’s apparently business-friendly approach to tax administration, saying it needed “a change of mindset” to become more aggressive in policing the tax system. The Treasury has defended the Revenue’s approach, saying its “high risk” corporate programme brought in £9.2bn between 2006 and 2011. For most businesses, however, the Treasury says “ultimately the most effective system is one that is based on trust and responsibility”.The government faces a difficult presentational challenge in trying to defuse public anger over multinationals’ tax planning at the same time as using the tax system as a lever to lure foreign companies to set up in Britain. Mr Gauke said last month: “If there is a perception that big business does not pay its fair share, that will make it all the harder for those of us advocating a competitive tax system.”Downing Street said on Monday the government would not name and shame tax-avoiding companies, despite David Cameron, prime minister, having spoken out in June against tax avoidance by Jimmy Carr as “morally wrong”.“An important part of our tax system is taxpayer confidentiality. We would not want to do anything to undermine that,” said a Downing Street spokeswoman.
395;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-12-03T20:25:49Z;Tax and Starbucks – the latte show;Lack of UK profitability should be top concern for shareholders;The baying mob is in full throat, its rage directed at multinationals such as Starbucks, which have cut or eliminated their UK tax bills. Ignore the fact that these companies are using legal means to control costs, as they have a responsibility to do, and that plenty of UK companies manage their transfer pricing in the same way elsewhere. With a deficit to pay off, it suits politicians to target US-based tax avoiders.Should shareholders be worried? The Treasury will spend an extra £77m over the next two years on anti-avoidance activity and expects that to bring in £2bn per year in additional tax. Not a bad return on its investment. For its part, Starbucks is considering changes to its UK tax arrangements.That will require turning the £33m pre-tax loss that it generated in the UK last year into a profit. The easy step would be to cut the 6 per cent royalty that it pays to its European headquarters. In 2011 that was £24m. Cutting intra-company loans would also help.But there are much bigger issues. At group level, Starbucks’ cost of sales is 40 per cent of revenues. In the UK, the figure is double that – a very big gap, assuming that further tax dodges are not involved. The company says UK property is more expensive, eating up an extra 15 percentage points of revenues, but that does not explain the whole gap. Likewise, pricier coffee beans could explain some, but not all, of the difference.Costa, a mainly UK-based rival, does much better. It does not have the same buying power as Starbucks but still made an operating margin of 11.5 per cent in the first half of the year. If Starbucks could do the same, it would make a UK operating profit of £46m and pay £10m of tax. Everyone would be happy. It is the lack of profitability in the UK, rather than UK politicians, that should concern Starbucks shareholders as they sip their lattes.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
396;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-12-03T20:03:21Z;The best reform of corporation tax would be its abolition;Companies are taking advantage of the iniquities of the tax system, writes Michael Devereux;George Osborne is expected to announce a “£10bn tax dodging clampdown” in his Autumn Statement on Wednesday. That follows weeks of growing anger in some quarters at the tax affairs of multinational companies. But even before the debate about corporation tax payments, or the lack of, by Starbucks, it would have been more surprising if the chancellor had been silent on this issue. It is hard to recall a Budget in recent times that did not include an intention to clamp down on tax avoidance.Most people would accept that tax avoidance schemes designed to exploit defects in legal drafting are abusive and should be closed. But the broader problem is the structure of the international tax system. And that is something that Mr Osborne has limited power to change.The system that has grown up over the past century imperfectly allocates taxing rights to national governments and is full of contradictions as to where different forms of income are taxed. That gives companies opportunities to choose the form and location of both their activity and their profit.It also creates a dichotomy for governments, seen clearly in the UK. On the one hand, the government is desperate to stimulate economic activity. Reducing the corporation tax rate to 22 per cent is an attempt to do so by competing for the activity of mobile global companies. On the other, the government would also like to generate tax revenue from mobile activities. If it is increasingly concerned about the latter, what policies are available?One, apparently favoured by the Public Accounts Committee, is naming and shaming. This works best for household names, such as Starbucks and Amazon, which may suffer from consumer boycotts – but it hardly seems fair to target them because they are well known. Nor does it seem fair to shame companies that are meeting their legal obligations, even if they are taking advantage of the iniquities of the international tax system. Naming and shaming can also undermine the integrity of the tax system – if people are told that others are not paying their fair share of tax, they may be less likely to comply themselves.A second approach could be to provide greater resources to HM Revenue & Customs. That might be welcome, but it doesn’t address the underlying problem, which lies in the law, not in its enforcement.What about patching up the system with more anti-avoidance rules?Comparison has been made with the German system that limits relief on interest deductibility for heavily-indebted companies. The UK has introduced a worldwide debt cap, but has been reluctant to go further on the grounds that its relatively generous treatment of interest gives the UK a competitive advantage. But encouraging UK companies to load up with debt is a dubious way of reconciling collecting tax revenue with maintaining a competitive position. Yet tightening these rules would not, in any case, address the issues identified by the Public Accounts Committee.Other options for unilateral action are limited by existing international agreements – both bilateral double taxation agreements and EU obligations. For example, it might be tempting to tax royalty payments made by a UK company to a sister company elsewhere. But existing treaties prohibit withholding taxes on royalties within the EU.If there are no easy fixes in anti-avoidance rules, is there a prospect of fundamental reform? Unfortunately, it does not seem likely. The leading contender for reform is a proposal that has been discussed for more than 10 years for a common consolidated corporate tax base. Companies would calculate only their EU-wide profit, and would not need to divide profit between member states. But the proposal, which would anyway not deal with profit outside the EU and has other disadvantages, shows little sign of being implemented, not least because of UK opposition.There is one other possibility: that corporation tax may simply wither as governments compete to reduce rates, without finding the political will to reach a better long-term solution to the allocation of international profit. Given the costs to society created by existing corporation taxes, this would at least constitute an improvement.The writer is director of the Centre for Business Taxation at Oxford university
397;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;Multinationals face pressure on tax;;George Osborne will move to strengthen HM Revenue & Customs’ ability to challenge multinationals on Monday, as MPs launched a blistering attack on companies that minimise their tax bills.The announcement forms part of the “£10bn crackdown on tax dodging” billed for the chancellor’s Autumn Statement on Wednesday.Mr Osborne has earmarked funds to help HMRC speed up its scrutiny of “transfer pricing” arrangements to ensure multinationals do not shift profits out of the UK to lower tax jurisdictions.These funds, together with extra resources aimed at tackling wealthy and offshore evasion, amount to £77m for each of the next two years and are expected to bring in an extra £2bn a year.Margaret Hodge, the Labour chair of the all-party public accounts committee, welcomed the extra money but said the government should also consider naming and shaming tax avoiders and use its large buying power to exert pressure on companies that avoid tax.Ms Hodge said she had already stopped going to Starbucks and buying from Amazon but had found not using Google more difficult.“In the last year, we took over £6bn less in corporation tax. It is almost becoming a voluntary tax that companies can choose to pay and that’s wrong,” she told the BBC’s Today programme on Monday.Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat chief secretary to the Treasury, said he was not sure about naming and shaming companies because of taxpayer confidentiality.He said he continued to use Amazon but thought companies were coming under increasing consumer pressure over their tax affairs.“We inherited an economy that’s in a mess and a tax system that’s too shot full of holes,” he told Radio 4’s Today programme, adding the announcement of extra funds could help bring in about £2bn more in tax a year.Mr Osborne said it was “unacceptable” for a minority of taxpayers to avoid paying their fair share. “We are determined to tackle this problem and HMRC are making good progress, but we are giving them additional tools to bring in more.”The move came as a report from a cross-party committee called for “a change in mindset” by HMRC, which it said needed to become more aggressive in policing and prosecuting businesses that paid too little tax.The MPs said in their report they were “not sufficiently convinced” by HMRC’s assertion that it was pursuing all the tax due by big businesses. They expressed scepticism after it denied it was lenient with big business and said it was well resourced, with 1,200 staff dealing with the 770 largest businesses.The criticisms highlight the challenge facing Mr Osborne in addressing avoidance while marketing Britain as “open for business”. The chancellor has joined counterparts in Germany and France in arguing that changes to tax rules, such as reforms to the treatment of e-commerce companies, must be made internationally.He will say on Monday that he wants to put reform of corporation tax at the top of the agenda during Britain’s chairmanship of the G7/8 next year.MPs on the public accounts committee accused companies of “using the letter of tax laws both nationally and internationally to immorally minimise their tax obligations”.They said: “We are concerned that multinationals have an unfair competitive advantage over British businesses, which have no choice but to pay their corporation tax.”The committee said there was “public anger and frustration” because of an impression that HMRC took action against ordinary people and small or domestic businesses but was lenient towards big groups.MPs described evidence from Starbucks, Amazon, Google and HMRC as “unconvincing and in some cases evasive”. Ms Hodge said the “inescapable conclusion” was that multinationals were moving offshore profits that were clearly generated from economic activity in the UK. The companies all said they were operating within the rules.The committee concluded that “to all intents and purposes” Amazon had the majority of its economic activity in the UK, rather than in Luxembourg, but paid virtually no corporation tax in the UK. Google told MPs its underlying economic activity arose from the innovative software technology generated by the US company but the MPs said it had “undermined its own argument” because it remitted non-US profits not to the US but Bermuda.Mr Osborne is also moving ahead with plans to demand more tax information from the Crown Dependencies, building on the UK’s automatic tax exchange agreement with the US, under its foreign account tax compliance act.
398;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-12-03T13:04:11Z;Time for GMG to sell Auto Trader stake;Sale would give Guardian Media a nest egg an ostrich would envy;The Guardian and Auto Trader resemble a social worker and a second-hand car dealer handcuffed together as someone’s cruel idea of a joke.The holding company of the politically-correct newspaper has a stake of just over 50 per cent in the used motors marketplace, in whose milieu cyclists are despised and Jeremy Clarkson is a thought leader. Apax, co-owner of Auto Trader, is reputedly keen to buy. Isn’t it time for Guardian Media Group to sell?Fundamental incompatibility aside, a disposal would give GMG a nest egg an ostrich would envy. The stake is valued at around £600m by the City. Profitable Auto Trader is “the only old media business to have become a big success digitally by cannibalising its print version”, says media analyst Lorna Tilbian of Numis. In contrast, The Guardian, while hot as mustard on social justice, is a bit vague on the need to make a profit. For example, it gives away its journalism for free on the web.GMG hopes to narrow operating losses that stood at £44.2m last year to single figures in four years. The group aims to cut costs and somehow increase digital revenues. That strategy is likely to fail, depleting the hefty reserves of The Scott Trust, guarantor of the newspaper’s financial and editorial independence.The argument for GMG to sell now, rather than later, is that Auto Trader’s value looks set to fall. Its margins are vulnerable to competition from rivals such as driving.co.uk, a Times venture fronted by the denim-straining Mr Clarkson.It would be in the interests of media plurality for the group to take the money. The Guardian should meanwhile risk the wrath of entitlement-bloated internet trolls and erect a paywall. But there is perhaps an implicit contradiction in expecting a middle-class socialist to pursue financial self-interest with any vigour.Clampdown defrothedOnline shopping supposedly hit a pre-Christmas peak on Monday, with sales close to £500m, according to Experian. Plenty of the total will go through the UK website of Amazon, one of three US multinationals whose minimalist approach to paying UK corporation tax has prompted George Osborne to announce £77m in extra spending on anti-avoidance.The laws which allowed Amazon to pay just £1.8m in local corporation tax in 2011 date back to the 19th century, according to John Whiting of the Chartered Institute of Taxation. They established the principle that a tax charge occurred in the country where a sale was made. As a result, British consumers transact online with Amazon’s subsidiary in lightly-taxed Luxembourg, not the UK offshoot that picks and packs their Christmas gifts.Thanks to a similar set-up, Google, a big vendor of advertising services to British business, paid UK corporation tax of just £6m in 2011. Its billing subsidiary is based in Ireland, another low-tax regime.The “clampdown” announced by the Treasury Monday will have zero impact on online operators such as Amazon and Google, says Michael Devereux of Oxford University. Nations would need to renegotiate their tax treaties to close the loophole.An aggressive stance might extract more tax from high street retailers such as Starbucks, though. Inter-group transfers approved by HM Revenue & Customs are responsible for the bulk, and perhaps even the totality, of UK losses that exempt the group from corporation tax. The embarrassed coffee vendor already appears willing to reduce these transfers.Handsome strangerWhen an organisation is in trouble, the solution is often deemed to be an externally-hired boss. For example, specialist engineer Lamprell has hired James Moffat of Texan contractor KBR Group, as its new chief executive.The assumption embodied by such appointments is that if internal candidates were any good, the business would not be in a pickle. That certainly rings true for Lamprell. This year the group has issued profit warnings at a rate to rival Sally Bercow’s output of actionable tweets. The problems have ranged from a shortage of oil rig components to hold-ups in the construction of wind farm service vessels. Management has had a poor record in spotting these coming. The top tier of executives has stepped down.The challenge facing Mr Moffat when he starts in March will be to create lines of reporting better than those that let his predecessor down. The market will not know definitively whether he has succeeded. A hiatus in profits warnings could reflect an absence of bad luck rather than shrewd evasive action. But investors in a stock that has fallen three quarters since May would welcome any stabilisation in the business.jonathan.guthrie@ft.com
399;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Osborne vows £10bn tax-dodging purge;;George Osborne will on Monday set out plans for a “£10bn tax dodging clampdown”, as he struggles to control the deficit and contain a growing outcry over the tax treatment of multinationals, including Starbucks.His promise to tackle “unacceptable” tax avoidance in this week’s Autumn Statement follows an admission that his deficit reduction strategy is off course: “It’s clearly taking longer to deal with Britain’s debts,” the chancellor said.Mr Osborne’s comment adds fuel to speculation that the coalition will not hit its target of cutting debt as a share of national income by 2015/16, and that public spending cuts may have to be extended by another year until 2018.The bleak fiscal backdrop has fuelled the political controversy over the tax contribution made by multinational companies, with MPs on Monday branding some practices as “immoral”.The Commons public accounts committee described the evidence it heard from Starbucks, Amazon and Google– along with that of HM Revenue & Customs officials – as “unconvincing and in some cases evasive”.The MPs accused the companies of “using the letter of tax laws both nationally and internationally to immorally minimise their tax obligations”.They called for a “change in mindset” at the Revenue so that it became more aggressive in policing and prosecuting companies that paid too little tax.In anticipation of an expected public backlash following the report, Starbucks said it was “in discussions” with the tax authorities about its tax arrangements.The coffee chain said that as part of its efforts to build public trust “we are looking at our tax approach in the UK”. It said it had listened to employee and customer feedback over revelations it had paid just £8.5m of corporation tax since 1998.Mr Osborne will give HMRC an extra £77m a year to focus on enforcement on multinationals, the wealthy and offshore evasion, particularly speeding up work on transfer pricing arrangements, where companies can shift profits out of the UK to lower tax jurisdictions.FT writers lift the lid on the technological giant that has grown from online book business into overlord of a corporate eco-systemHe claims this will eventually build up to raise £2bn a year, while a separate deal with Switzerland would raise more than £5bn of previously uncollected taxes from Swiss bank accounts over the next six years.Mr Osborne says that the cumulative total raised by the two initiatives is about £10bn, although only the Swiss deal has been officially scored by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, which produces economic forecasts.In a further recognition of public disquiet about the allocation of pain in Mr Osborne’s deficit reduction plan, the chancellor confirmed the rich would pay more in his Autumn Statement, to offset a squeeze on benefit payments next year.
400;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Starbucks in talks over UK tax bill;;Starbucks is “in discussions” with Revenue & Customs about its tax arrangements, as it prepares to bow to public pressure over allegations of avoidance.The coffee chain said that as part of its effort to build public trust “we are looking at our tax approach in the UK. The company has been in discussions with HMRC for some time and is also in talks with the Treasury.”It said it had listened to feedback from customers and employees and understood that “to maintain and further build public trust we need to do more”.The move is an attempt to draw a line under the damaging controversy surrounding Starbucks paying just £8.5m of corporation tax since 1998.It comes ahead of a protest planned by UK Uncut, a grassroots pressure group, against Starbucks next weekend. It has announced a “day of action” turning coffee shops into homeless shelters, crèches and refuges in an attempt to suggest that public spending cuts would not be necessary if the company paid more tax.The talks are likely to focus on the tax deduction – currently 4.7 per cent – received by Starbucks for the 6 per cent royalty charge paid to the Netherlands for design, trademark protection and the value of the global brand.The discussions may also focus on the 20 per cent gross mark-up on coffee sold to the UK operation, although this will have a much smaller effect on taxable profits.Starbucks also pays interest to its parent company at a rate of 4.9 per cent under an inter-company loan but this arrangement does not cut the company’s tax bill as the US has a higher corporate tax rate than Britain.To maintain and further build public trust we need to do moreThe move comes after a bruising evidence session at the House of Commons in which MPs dismissed Starbucks’ explanation that it had incurred heavy losses in Britain because of bad mistakes in its property strategy that left it with facing unsustainably high rental costs.The company said its low corporate tax payments had “nothing” to do with tax avoidance and it paid a “higher tax rate than just about any other multinational around the world”.Starbucks said it would release details later in the week. It said: “Starbucks is committed to the UK for the long term and we have invested more than £200m in our UK business over the past 12 years. Starbucks has complied with all the tax laws in this country but has regretfully not been as profitable as we would have liked.
401;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;Big companies set to divulge tax details;;Big companies are set to divulge more details of their tax affairs as they try to fend off pressure over aggressive tax planning from MPs, investors and the media, according to a leading firm of advisers.KPMG, the professional services firm, said there had been a “sea change in mood” towards tax disclosures after intense public criticism of the low corporate tax payments of some multinationals. Jane McCormick, head of tax, said: “There is a feeling of inevitability about a move to greater transparency”.More information could lead to a better understanding of the tax system, which might defuse anger in cases where low rates were not a result of aggressive tax plans, according to KPMG.“The risk is that, without this transparency, the current debate may turn into a witch-hunt, deterring businesses from investing in the UK,” Ms McCormick said.MPs on the public accounts committee are due to publish a report on Monday with recommendations arising from a session in which they grilled executives from Starbucks, Amazon and Google.Ms McCormick said the risk of being “hauled in front of the PAC” was under discussion with potential inward investors.Giving out more tax information could defuse pressure for disclosure laws, she said. Most companies surveyed were opposed to the idea of legislation requiring detailed tax disclosures. But one in four companies said EU proposals requiring extractive industries to disclose details of tax payments should be broadened to other businesses.KPMG said it expected tax reports to become a feature of annual reports, in the same way as corporate social responsibility statements have become the norm. Already, companies were preparing explanations about what taxes they paid and where they paid them in case they were asked at annual meetings or by MPs or journalists.Ms McCormick said: “Some people are already doing it. Others are preparing to do it. Others are still thinking about it. It is definitely a trend.”Six out of 10 businesses supported a general anti-abuse rule – set to be introduced next year – according to a KPMG survey of 57 of the UK’s largest businesses. But they criticised its draft form, which they said was likely to catch legitimate tax planning and commercial transactions.In recent months, businesses have been exhorted to become more transparent and communicate their tax strategies by a number of legal, tax and PR advisers. In February David Gauke, Treasury minister, called on businesses to “open yourselves to greater scrutiny”, saying engagement and transparency would help address “myths and confusion” in tax.
402;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-11-25T16:59:41Z;Palo Alto and back again;;After landing in Palo Alto, my only thought was: I forgot my sunglasses. At 5am in rainy Seattle, the idea of sunglasses had seemed absurd and yet here I was just a few hours later chastising myself for being forgetful.I was in the San Francisco Bay area as part of the venture capital (VC) trip I helped to organise for the Foster School’s Entrepreneur and Venture Capital Club. As I have written about before, the goal of the trip was to meet Silicon Valley venture capitalists and entrepreneurs to learn about the how the industry differed from Seattle.After slogging through traffic on Highway 101, the group of 18 students arrived at Bay Partners to meet Neal Dempsey. He had a wealth of knowledge about the industry, how it has changed over time and career advice for anyone interested in working in venture capital. Neal also told us some great stories, including stumbling across a young entrepreneur in the 1990s named Howard Schultz, the chairman and chief executive of Starbucks.Next we went on the Matrix Partners, which is one of the best-performing firms in the world. We met two partners there who had started in the VC business about four or five years ago. It was really interesting comparing their knowledge and advice with that of Neal, who had worked in Silicon Valley for more than 20 years. Their energy and passion for the work was clearly evident. And they gave us a great lunch.After meeting two venture capital firms, we wanted to get the other perspective: the entrepreneurs. PJ Gunsagar, the chief executive of Kidaptive, a new “edu-tainment” start-up, explained the thrills and spills of start-ups. His experience, particularly his film work in India, was illuminating and shows how far entrepreneurs will go to get a competitive advantage. After listening to him, I think working internationally is going to be increasingly important to smaller companies as they look to compete with more established players, whether that be Pixar and Disney or Google and Amazon.Like our other visits, PJ gave us great insights into what makes good venture capitalists, and the work that start-ups must do to utilise them fully. This included regularly engaging with their investors, rather than just at board meetings or during fund raising. It was a great perspective and one that start-ups would do well to emulate.Overall, the trip was a great success. We met very successful venture capitalists and entrepreneurs and got a sense of how Silicon Valley differs from Seattle. One of the major differences is the huge amount of money in Silicon Valley. According to the National Venture Capital Association, over 50 per cent of the money invested in start-up deals in the first quarter of 2012 were in California. The second largest amount (just 11 per cent) was invested in Massachusetts. As a result, valuations are really a function of what other people are willing to pay rather than how much the company might actually be worth. In smaller markets, valuations can be more “accurate,” since there is less competition driving up prices.Another lesson is that it is very difficult to get into venture capital coming straight from business school. Some people work as associates in firms, but — according to the people we met — they are unlikely to move directly into the partner positions. Instead, venture capitalists leave the industry and are successful elsewhere, usually via start-up companies where they acquire operating knowledge.All in all, it was a great trip. I am sure that future students will be able to build on this first step and will continue to build stronger relationships between the Foster School and Silicon Valley.One other thing I have learned: I will not need my sunglasses for a few more months. The weather forecast for Seattle predicts rain for the next few weeks.

Some deals are only offered because companies know the majority of customers won’t take them up. Starbucks, for example, has long offered a “short” cappuccino without listing it on its menu. It’s a less expensive drink, enjoyed by that rare intersection of people who know about coffee yet visit Starbucks. If the company was forced to advertise this secret cappuccino, it might not offer the product at all. It’s the same with utility groups, phone companies and banks: a keenly-priced product designed to win over the cognoscenti might vanish if the company was forced to sign everyone up for it.So you think the “lowest tariff” rule is a bad idea?I am genuinely not sure whether it will lower prices or not. I am quite sure it will be a crowd pleaser. My phone provider, Orange, has been reassuring me for years that I was on the cheapest tariff available given my pattern of usage. When I called them recently to ask why the phone bill was so damn high, they promptly informed me that I could be on a tariff at one-third of the cost.How did they square that circle?More of a loophole than a circle, I should say. The sales assistant sounded delighted with himself. If Mr Davey could also make that sort of thing a flogging offence, I’d be overjoyed, even if it doesn’t lower average prices – which it may well not.Although it suggests that companies are good at finding loopholes.They are. There are always cashback deals, loyalty cards, “sign up, get free loft insulation” and all the rest.But you still seem to think that prices will fall?Probably. If prices are easier to understand then competitive pressures should be more intense. Companies may try to target the same margins as before but they might fail, if customers see who’s offering the best deals.And they can’t figure out the best deals now?Indeed not. A few years ago, the economists Chris Wilson and Catherine Waddams Price studied 250 customers trying to switch electricity suppliers with the aim of securing a better deal. A quarter of them made themselves worse off, and the majority failed to spot the best deal. (One genius had the option of saving £150 a year but managed to make himself worse off than if he hadn’t switched.) Ofgem, the energy regulator, recently reached a similar conclusion. So there is good reason to believe energy markets would work better if things were simpler.Will four price tariffs still be too complex? Or, alternatively, too crude to accommodate genuine business reasons for price variations?The economist Eugenio Miravete once studied the behaviour of customers faced with a choice of two tariffs and a single phone provider, and concluded customers were usually successful at finding the best deal. I suspect four price tariffs will be more tricky, especially when multiplied by the number of companies: customers will still have to ponder 15 or 20 different possibilities. And there’s another problem: we don’t understand our energy usage patterns. Even if our chosen company puts us on its most appropriate deal, it will be hard to figure out whether we should switch providers.Is there an alternative?The behavioural economist Richard Thaler has been advocating a system of “smart disclosure”, whereby energy companies would have to supply users with a computer file of their recent usage in a standard format. Customers could then upload that file to a price-comparison website and be told which company would offer the best price given their own energy patterns.Couldn’t we just have computerised smart meters that constantly seek out the best deal?I suspect that day is not far off. There is a catch, though: the easier customers find it to seek out the very cheapest price, the more quickly energy companies will find out that they’re being outcompeted, and the easier they will find it to raise prices in a cosy tacit cartel. Not all markets work well.tim.harford@ft.com
404;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-11-21T19:44:11Z;Green defends Arcadia’s tax set-up;;Sir Philip Green has defended his retail empire’s tax arrangements, as he announced a 25 per cent increase in underlying pre-tax profit at Arcadia Group.Arcadia had paid £2.3bn in taxes since he acquired the group 10 years ago for £840m, he said. This included £591m of corporation tax, compared with £50m in the five years before his ownership.Multinationals’ tax affairs have come under increasing scrutiny, while Sir Philip has in the past been in the spotlight because his wife, paid a £1.2bn dividend from his British business empire in 2005 and the ultimate owner of the conglomerate, is resident in Monaco.Amazon, Google and Starbucks were this month accused of aggressive tax avoidance by MPs.The retail billionaire said it was assumed “because this is a company not owned by someone who lives here, that means the rules are totally different”.“Everybody is characterised in the same box,” said Sir Philip. “We have run this business properly.”The group employed about 45,000 people directly, and many more indirectly, he added, while its wage bill was just short of £500m. Sir Philip said he had invested £1bn in the business since 2002, and cut bank debt from £1.3bn to £300m in seven years.“We didn’t take this business offshore. This wasn’t a business that was moved,” he said. “When we decided not to live in the UK in 1998, we didn’t even know how to spell Arcadia. I’m a retailer not a clairvoyant.”He hoped revealing tax figures for the past 10 years, including £300m in national insurance and £1.3bn in rates, would put the matter to bed “once and for all”.“[This is] a great British success story,” he said. “Let’s get out of the UK doom and gloom [that] you have got to be apologetic for being successful.”He refused to comment on the tax arrangements of other multinationals, but is thought to favour equal tax treatment for all companies.Arcadia increased pre-tax profit before exceptional items from £133.1m to £166.9m in the year to August 25. Total sales were flat at £2.68bn. Sales from UK stores open at least a year fell 3.2 per cent year on year in a “very challenging” market, but online sales rose 22 per cent.Sir Philip said the group, whose brands are available in 112 countries, wanted to “conquer America properly” and was eyeing China.He raised the prospect of acquisitions. “Is there one more big deal? Who knows. We want to have a seat [at the table] if there is consolidation in this sector.He backed calls for a new method of setting business rates, currently based on the September RPI.
405;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-11-21T13:06:18Z;Politicians can only do so much;It is hard to crack down on corporate tax without other countries doing the same;During angry hearings into the behaviour of three top US companies last week, an exasperated Margaret Hodge, chair of the UK House of Commons public accounts committee, told representatives of Starbucks, Amazon and Google: “We’re not accusing you of being illegal. We are accusing you of being immoral.”The topic of the hearings was an old one: companies’ use of cross-border royalty payments, transfer pricing and siting of regional headquarters to lower their corporation tax payments.Ms Hodge’s outburst raised another old question: can politicians bully companies into doing something that the politicians think is right but which the law does not require?A celebrated example was President John Kennedy’s attack on US steel groups more than 50 years ago. The companies, led by US Steel, had raised their prices after a union wage settlement that Kennedy hoped would result in employers holding back. Their failure to do so led to Kennedy’s reported remark that all businessmen were “sons of bitches”.His press conference in April 1962 provided a lesson in political pressure. Kennedy said: “We are confronted with grave crises in Berlin and southeast Asia . . . We are asking reservists to leave their homes and families for months on end, and servicemen to risk their lives – and four were killed in the last two days in Vietnam.”He said the steel price increase would raise defence costs, as well as “increase the cost of homes, autos, appliances and most other items for every American family”. It would also raise the price of machinery and tools to US businesses and farms.He added that the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission were “examining the significance of this action in a free, competitive economy”.Finally, in a reference to his inauguration address, he said: “Some time ago I asked each American to consider what he would do for his country and I asked the steel companies. In the last 24 hours we had their answer.” The steel bosses rescinded the increases.What did the Kennedy assault consist of? An appeal to the national interest, a reference to the sacrifices of ordinary people and businesses, and a veiled threat of legal action.In her assault on the tax practices of the US companies, Ms Hodge attempted to do the same. She is no John Kennedy. Her grandstanding, and frequent interruption of answers to questions that she had asked, meant that her, and her committee’s, interrogation fell a few briefs short of forensic.However, it did raise the heat on multinational companies’ tax practices. David Cameron, the prime minister, had already said he was not happy with them and that the tax authorities needed to look into it.Any discussion of what politicians can do to change companies’ behaviour does beg the question of whether they should – especially as the tax practices of the three US companies are, as they kept pointing out to the committee, entirely legal.The answer, in this case, is yes. UK-headquartered companies have argued that having to pay higher taxes than their foreign competitors’ British operations puts them at an unfair disadvantage – and they are surely right.The best solution would be a change in the law, But, as Vince Cable, the UK business secretary, admitted in a BBC interview this week, it is hard to crack down on company tax arrangements without other countries doing the same.When the law is helpless, politicians have a right, and a duty, to reflect public feeling. They have done so, around the world, on bankers’ pay, with limited success.Faced with such pressure, companies make a calculation. The threat of regulatory or legal action might lead some to change their behaviour. But these threats often come to nothing. (Kennedy’s didn’t.)A consumer boycott might change their practices, but there is little history of any of these making a dent in company profits.Companies might decide the bad publicity is not worth the trouble, but in the case of sophisticated tax arrangements, it almost certainly is.Companies will opt for practices seen as socially responsible where they do not cost too much, or when they save money (such as cutting down on environmentally damaging packaging).Politicians can only do so much. As James Hoopes of Babson College has pointed out, in the 18 months after Kennedy’s devastating criticism, US Steel quietly raised its prices.michael.skapinker@ft.com
406;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Make corporate tax rules fair for all;Multinationals are being given vast subsidies, write Nicholas Shaxson and Sol Picciotto;It is time for a new approach to international tax. Multinationals ranging from General Electric in the US, Amazon in France and Starbucks in the UK are being attacked for tax avoidance. Separately, in recent hearings, UK members of parliament pilloried various companies for using tax havens, for “manipulating” their accounts to cut their tax bills and for engaging in “immoral” activity. MPs peppered their questions with phrases such as “it beggars belief” and “I don’t know what you take us for.”Most striking about these exchanges and reports is that – beyond asserting that they have not broken any laws – the companies seem unable to defend their actions. This is because they cannot.The international tax system in effect provides vast subsidies for multinationals, helping them outcompete local rivals on a factor – tax – that has nothing to do with economic productivity. They free-ride on tax-funded benefits – roads, educated workforces, reliable courts – provided by the countries where they do business, while others pay for those benefits. This distortion is inefficient and unproductive, and corrupts the very fabric of markets.The world’s tax rules have not kept pace with profound changes in the global economy. Instead of treating multinationals as the integrated companies they are, the rules seek to disaggregate them into collections of separate entities. Broadly, this encourages companies to cut tax bills via two related types of hocus-pocus.First, they locate holding companies and assets (such as the company’s brand or other intellectual property rights) in tax havens, then attribute large profits to those entities. Second, they engage in “transfer pricing”, where the parts of the multinational trade with each other across borders at prices designed to suit their tax objectives. These techniques can be combined so that, to put it crudely, a tax-haven entity might buy a widget or service cheap from another part of the multinational elsewhere, and sell it dear, realising untaxed profits offshore. The UK subsidiary buys it dear from the tax haven entity but then sells it on (to a UK retailer, say) at the same high price, realising no profits. Hey presto! A big tax bill disappears. Nobody, anywhere, produced a better widget or service.Fortunately, a far better system is available: unitary tax. Instead of taxing multinationals according to the legal forms that their tax advisers conjure up, they are taxed according to the genuine economic substance of what they do and where they do it. Each company submits to the tax authorities of each country where it does business a “combined report” providing consolidated accounts for the whole global group, ignoring all internal transfers. The report specifies the group’s physical assets, workforce and sales and the overall profits are then divided up among jurisdictions according to a formula weighing these three factors. This system would benefit everyone, particularly developing countries.Tax experts have long argued that this approach is better. It is proved, too: most US states already use it successfully for state taxes. The EU’s proposal for a common consolidated corporate tax base goes a long way towards this, though its geographical focus should be expanded to require a worldwide combined report. It is possible to move towards unitary taxation without widespread international co-ordination, though that would certainly help.The OECD, whose fiscal committee is the steward of the international tax system, has refused even to investigate this alternative, preferring to try and patch up the present system. India, Brazil and China are creating their own widely divergent rules, though all claim to comply with the OECD’s so-called consensus standard. The result is a system of ever-growing complexity, which will create increasing conflicts and expose multinationals to double taxation and rising public obloquy.George Osborne, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, and his German counterpart Wolfgang Schäuble have said they will engage with the OECD to tackle the problems in international tax. If the initiative ends up merely tinkering with the “arm’s-length” method, they will fail. Citizens should demand a new and serious approach.The writers are the respective authors of ‘Regulating Global Corporate Capitalism’ and ‘Treasure Islands’
407;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-11-18T17:43:52Z;Starbucks’ tea takeover is a grande of guff;The ubiquitous coffee chain cannot be forgiven for the way it grinds out its message;I don’t blame Starbucks for paying no tax in the UK. I don’t blame it for selling pint-sized cardboard cups of hottish milk into which a tiny bit of coffee and quite a lot of syrup have been squirted. I don’t even blame it for making every high street identical and obliterating thousands of independent cafés.The first is the fault of the tax authorities for allowing transfer pricing wizards to run rings around them. The second is our fault for having such dodgy taste in drinks. And as for the third, the other day at one of the few surviving greasy spoons, I had a coffee that was so exceptionally revolting it left me longing for a Starbucks flat white.What I do blame the company for is much more serious. It is something that goes right to the top. The problem is its way with words.Last week, Starbucks said it was going to buy Teavana, a company that owns a few hundred tea shops. The general idea is to do for tea – a sector the company says is worth $40bn – what Starbucks did for coffee some 30 years ago.To convey this simple message the company has put out an 800-word announcement that I can only describe as a best-in-class, enhanced, elevated reading experience.Because space is short and I don’t want to dwell on what you know already, I’m not going to explain what is wrong with the multiple “delivers” and “enhances” and “leveraging core competencies” and the protestations of passion that make up much of the statement. These are small transgressions. Or “tall” transgressions, to use Starbucks’ inflated tongue.Instead I want to go for the linguistic “grandes”, the first of which is the stated reason for the acquisition: to “enhance the consumer tea experience”. I drink about eight cups of tea a day, but I don’t think I’ve ever had anything I’d call a consumer tea experience, and I’m not at all sure I want one.Unfortunately, skipping the experience isn’t an option. In one short release, six different experiences are rammed down our throats. As well as the enhanced tea experience, there is a “new retail experience”, an “elevated tea experience” and a “rich ecosystem of experiences”.But most extravagant of all, and from the mouth of chief executive Howard Schultz comes “the romance and theater of the retail experience that is the heart and soul of Starbucks heritage, will create a differentiated customer experience …that delivers immediate value to shareholders”.As a sentence, this counts as a “venti” with extra gingerbread. There is a lot of it. It’s sickly and devoid of nutrients so makes you feel queasy and unhealthy after you’ve swallowed it.It also leaves me quite mystified: when customers pop into Starbucks for a morning coffee surely they don’t want romance or theatre, let alone hearts or souls. Just good coffee, served quickly in a congenial place. As for “delivering immediate value to shareholders”, in the 24 hours after the deal was announced on Wednesday, the value of the company fell by about $1bn.Mr Schultz’s mealy mouthful is matched by another from the head of Teavana, Andrew Mack, who starts by asserting his company’s “deep tea expertise” and “passion for the category”, before offering his own variation on the deal’s merits. We “believe we can deliver an elevated tea experience”, he says and then explains that selling out means it “will be able to truly fulfil our mission of bringing premium tea to millions of people on a global platform”. Which global platform is that? Are we on it now? Is it what used to be called the globe, which before that was called the world?Whatever it is, it’s spinning as the platforms and experiences crash into each other and, before you know it, he’s talking about an “elevated platform of tea experience”.Mr Mack finishes in the time-honoured way by expressing delight to be joining the Starbucks “family”. Yet for once this has some shred of truth to it: from the way the two CEOs talk, they must be related already.As indeed must be Jeff Hansberry, who is to run the new subsidiary and who has the terrific title: president, channel development and emerging brands. According to him the deal will “create a rich ecosystem of experiences with shared values …and a differentiated health and wellness offering in the marketplace”.This guy is made for the job. If you take out every weasel word, all that’s left is “a of with and in the”, which I think I rather prefer.lucy.kellaway@ft.com

410;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks bags Teavana tea chain;;Starbucks, the US coffee chain, is adding more tea to its menu by spending $620m to acquire Teavana, a tea retailer it will use to build a bigger presence in the Middle East, China and India.The deal, announced on Wednesday, gives Starbucks an existing network of over 300 Teavana tea stores – mostly in US shopping malls – and the option of selling Teavana products in Starbucks stores, where it currently sells Tazo tea.Troy Alstead, its chief financial officer, told the Financial Times: “The opportunity is absolutely in India and China, but I’ve seen opportunities all over the world.”He said tea’s association with “health and wellness” was a big selling point, adding that the global tea market was already worth $40bn.Starbucks has more than 500 coffee shops in China and last month opened its first in India, but in both countries it is seeking to attract customers in cultures where tea-drinking has deeper roots.The same is true across the Middle East, where Teavana recently opened a store in Kuwait in partnership with Alshaya, Starbucks’ existing joint venture partner. Teavana is preparing to open another store in Abu Dhabi.Mr Alstead said Teavana’s existing 249 stores in the US were evidence of “latent interest” in tea among consumers in coffee-guzzling American coming to the surface.Howard Schultz, Starbucks chief executive, said in a statement: “The Teavana acquisition now positions us to disrupt and lead, just as we did with espresso starting three decades ago.”When news of a deal leaked on Wednesday afternoon, Teavana shares surged and settled up 52 per cent at $15.45.Starbucks is offering to buy the group for $15.50 per share and said the owners of 70 per cent of Teavana stock had already approved the takeover.
411;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;OECD warned on new tax rules;;New international standards are being drawn up that will stop multinationals from artificially shifting profits to tax havens, in a sign of mounting pressure over aggressive tax planning.But the planned overhaul of the rules on “transfer pricing” that divide profits between countries is not the answer to governments’ growing concern over the erosion of the tax base, business representatives told the OECD at its Paris base on Wednesday. The organisation sets international tax guidelines.The plan to stop companies putting brands, patents and other intangibles in tax havens where they had no real business would have a limited impact if companies responded by moving the management of the intangibles to the tax havens, they said.Will Morris, chairman of the tax committee of the Business and Industry Advisory Committee, which represents business at the OECD, said governments should consider other options, such as imposing withholding taxes on royalty payments.But he supported action against the movement of intangibles to tax havens based on “mere legal signatures or funding flows without any other substance”. While legal, it offended economic theory and damaged the reputation of business, he said. “Business realises that there is a problem with intangibles.”Politicians around the world are increasingly alarmed by aggressive tax planning by some multinationals that erode the tax base and push profits into low tax countries. Political anger flared in Britain on Monday when MPs accused Google, Amazon and Starbucks of “immoral” behaviour.A US Senate committee attacked the use of “loopholes and gimmicks”by multinationals in September. George Osborne and Wolfgang Schäuble, finance ministers of the UK and Germany, last week threw their weight behind an OECD initiative to tackle profit shifting by plugging gaps in international rules.The changes discussed in the two-and-a-half day public consultation in Paris, which form part of the broader initiative against profit shifting, would put greater emphasis on a test of where intangibles were managed and exploited.Business advisers called for modifications to the draft guidelines, which it said were too focused on curbing abuses, risking the creation of more uncertainty, more double taxation and more disputes.Pascal Saint Amans, the OECD’s top tax official, said the consultation had “been constructive although there are still significant differences. Intangibles are clearly a key area of concern where transfer pricing rules must be clarified to avoid abuses and localisation intellectual property in low tax jurisdictions.”He added: “We need rules which will provide certainty while better linking rights to tax and economic activity.”In a written submission, Michael Durst, a former senior official at the US Internal Revenue Service, predicted “fierce political resistance” to the OECD’s efforts to tighten the rules. He said the draft was a serious attempt “to control what has become an epidemic of intangibles-related income shifting to low and zero-tax countries”.The OECD is also under pressure to find a balance between the demands of industrialised countries, where intellectual property is created and funded, and developing countries with big markets and low-cost labour forces, which are demanding a bigger share of tax revenues.Developing countries, particularly India, have expressed frustration with existing transfer pricing rules, which “tend only to take care of interest of only developed countries” [sic], the Indian government told the UN in March.
412;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-11-13T04:16:35Z;Starbucks UK withstands the siege of Troy;It is the fault of governments if multinationals pay low corporation taxes in other markets;Heartfelt thanks go to Troy Alstead, chief financial officer of Starbucks, for showing up to an interrogation from MPs on the group’s UK tax set-up.Parliamentarians enjoy publicly pillorying business people, and their pleasure is doubled if the victim is American. The story pretty well writes itself for us media hangers-on if a US multinational can be represented as a cynical tax dodger.This is easiest if you make liberal use of the attribution “Mr Alstead admitted”. However, the picture that emerged was more subtle. Starbucks does attempt to exploit national tax differences. But at the same time, the group would probably like to have higher liabilities in the UK, reflecting greater commercial success.The European holding company of the coffee giant charges Starbucks UK a licence fee. The deduction, combined with other royalties, was £25.7m in 2010-11, the bulk of a £28.8m operating loss.UK dividends would be paid after corporation tax of 24 per cent if Starbucks UK made money. The licence fee bears only light Dutch tax, making it a cheaper way to extract returns in that situation. However, the fee’s level as a percentage of turnover – currently 4.7 per cent – is agreed with the UK’s Inland Revenue in line with what other tax authorities allow. So if the margins of Starbucks UK improve, Starbucks Europe cannot simply raise the fee to shield profits from UK tax.The reality is that Starbucks is doing poorly in the UK. Local rival Costa Coffee is running (coffee) rings round it. And if some multinationals pay low levels of corporation tax in the UK and other markets, it is the fault of governments, not businesses. They talk up multilateral crackdowns on avoidance while individually trying to lure footloose company registrations with loopholes and low headline rates.ByebuDebt restructurings, like family get-togethers, are incomplete without a blazing row. The plate-smashing has already started at Hibu, publisher of Yellow Pages. Holders of £65m in debt issued in 2006 are threatening to wind the company up, forestalling a revamp of £2.2bn of borrowings made in 2009.The outcome will depend on leverage of the tactical rather than financial kind. Repayment of the 2006 debt was due last week and holders have so far declined to agree to waivers sought by Hibu. But a liquidation of the group, which has more than £100m in cash, would probably pay out less than if the business continued its decline as a trading business. Moreover, the publisher may be able to rejig its debt via a scheme of arrangement that treated all creditors equally and required the approval of just three-quarters of them.Loans to Hibu, whose directories are being superseded by the internet, trade at about 20 per cent of their nominal value. One compromise would be for ‘06ers to receive new debt worth slightly more than this through a debt restructuring, and ‘09ers fractionally less. Both groups would swap the bulk of their debt holdings for equity, as Lombard predicted in May.It seems unlikely that these new shares would wind up worth any more than Hibu’s quoted stock. The group has this year warned three times that the old shares may be worthless. Most investors reached that conclusion in 2011.Tsar turnLombard has received another misdirected internal memo penned by legendary City PR man Piers Fisher of agency Botham Fisher, as follows:Re: Upholding professional standards.“Dear subordinates, you have doubtless seen the worrying Times story concerning RLM Finsbury.

413;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-11-12T21:25:58Z;US groups grilled over low tax payments;;"MPs have accused three US multinationals of “manipulating” their accounts to minimise the corporate tax they paid in Britain.In highly charged exchanges with the public accounts committee, senior executives from Starbucks, Amazon and Google insisted they paid tax on all the economic activity that took place in Britain.The hearing comes in the wake of intense media scrutiny of the low corporate tax bills of some foreign-owned multinationals.Margaret Hodge, chair of the committee, told Andrew Cecil, director of public policy at Amazon: “You pay no tax here and that really riles us.”Google
Matt Brittin, Google’s vice-president of northern Europe, appeared the most confident and relaxed of the three executives as he admitted the internet group operates in Ireland and Bermuda because of their attractive tax rates. “It’s a complicated system, but we comply with the law.” he said, adding that it was Google’s job to “manage costs efficiently to offer fair value to shareholders”. Ms Hodge curtly responded: “We’re not accusing you of being illegal, we are accusing you of being immoral.”Starbucks
Troy Alstead, Starbucks chief financial officer, had a hard time trying to convince the committee that the coffee chain did not make money in the UK. He said Starbucks had only made a profit once in the 15 years it had been operating in the UK and denied he was lying to shareholders about it. “I assure you we are not making money,” he told the MPs. “We’re not at all pleased about our financial performance here. We have had profitability challenges, but nothing to do with tax avoidance.” Mr Alsted added that, on a global scale, Starbucks was an “extremely high taxpayer”.Amazon
Andrew Cecil, Amazon’s director of public policy, was attacked by MPs for being “totally evasive” and repeatedly saying he would come back at a later date with information requested by the committee. Labour’s Nick Smith described his failure to answer questions about the company’s structure as “pathetic”. Fiona Mactaggart, also of Labour, accused Amazon of deliberately structuring its UK arm as if it was just warehousing. “Frankly we think that you manipulate your profits.”According to the parent company’s annual report, net sales earned in the UK represented 11 to 15 per cent of total net sales of $48.1bn.He responded by saying Amazon paid corporation tax, as well as having paid more than £100m in payroll taxes and tens of millions of pounds in business rates in the past five years. The argument drew an angry response from Ms Hodge, who said the company was competing unfairly with book shops.Amazon also drew anger when Mr Cecil repeatedly said he would have to come back at a later date with information requested by the committee. Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said his assertion that the company “had never broken out” revenue figures on a country basis was “quite insulting to everyone’s intelligence”.Mr Cecil said European revenues were €9.1bn, on which it paid taxes of €8m and made a profit after tax of €20m. He said sales on the amazon.co.uk website – and in all other European countries – were actually made by its European business, which is based in Luxembourg and employs 500 people. Amazon’s UK business, which employs about 15,000 people, operates as a service provider.Starbucks struggled to get across its message to MPs that its lack of profitability was because of mistakes in the early phase of its expansion, which left it paying “unsustainably high” rents on its coffee shops, rather than tax avoidance. Ms Hodge said: “It just doesn’t ring true.”She said: “In Switzerland you [made] 20 per cent profits on every coffee bean bought in the UK, on which you only pay 12 per cent tax; you have not been able to explain the 6 per cent royalty [paid to the Netherlands] in any meaningful way; you charge for loans to your own wholly owned subsidiaries at least 2 per cent above the going rate. It seems to us you are exporting profits to minimise your tax.”Troy Alstead, chief finance officer, said: “We are never aggressive in avoiding tax. We do not have tax havens in place – that is just not how we do business.”Mr Alstead insisted that Starbucks was not seeking to mislead investors or tax authorities. He said royalties paid by the British operation were “absolutely not” stashed away in a tax haven but were paid to the Netherlands and the US, where they were subject to a combined tax rate of approximately 16 per cent.Matt Brittin, who heads Google’s northern European operations, justified the company’s tax payments by pointing to the complicated algorithms behind its advertising sales. He said the company had 17,000 engineers in California building and inventing the technology. “That is how we create the economic value.”British revenues would be very different if the technology had been invented in the UK, he said. “I wish we had invented Google in Cambridge but we didn’t.”"
414;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-11-12T15:08:38Z;Starbucks, Google and Amazon quizzed by MPs over UK tax;;Matt Brittin, chief executive officer of Google UK, Troy Alstead, Starbucks global chief financial officer, and Andrew Cecil, Amazon’s director of public policy have been questioned by MPs on why they pay so little corporation tax in the UK. For background, see our news story:18:04: Hodge says British prime minister not happy, business secretary has branded all three companies a disgrace and wants their response.18:03: All three company executives believe OECD guidelines on how a branch of a multinational on the internet should be reviewed.17:59: MP says the British consumer feels misled. They are left feeling “this is a bit smelly”. Alstead says he is “very sorry about that”.17:54: Ethics. MPs want to know if the three companies discuss internally how consumer power and value of their brand is influenced by ethical behaviour of their companies. No one really answering the question straight – vague stuff about supporting freedom of speech on web.17:50: Onto general questions. Hodge’s question is straight and simple: Why do you manipulate your accounts to get away with not paying corporation tax in the UK? She now sounds like she’s talking to naughty children hiding sweets and not telling the truth about it.17:45: Brittin asked about foreign income in Google’s SEC filings and he says, again, he doesn’t have the figures to hand. Another sigh from the panel.17:41: MPs trying to argue advertising revenue of Google is paid in different countries. Brittin says much more complicated and tries to, sort of, explain. MPs aren’t listening to his answer anyway.17:32: Brittin plugs the amount of investment it has made in start-ups in the UK which it says is one of the leading markets in the world in terms of ecommerce.17:29: MP asks: is your tagline “Do no evil”?17:23: Finally, the bombshell question is asked: if Google has to pay a higher rate of tax on its profits, will it leave the UK, and where will it go? Brittin just says Google is “multinational” – not exactly an answer.17:20: Some MPs on the panel now looking very bored, biting their nails and picking lint off their clothesPhrase of the day: “I am not a tax expert”17:16: Hodge says odd that Brittin doesn’t know anything about tax when the hearing is about tax.17:13: For readers – here is Amazon’s UK sales from annual report:Net sales earned in Germany, Japan, and United Kingdom each represented 11% to 15% of net sales in 2011 and 2010. Net sales $48bn17:12: Hodge: “We aren’t accusing you of being illegal, we are accusing you of being immoral”17:09: Brittin so far is giving the most direct, clear answers of the three – Hodge acknowledges this.17:03: Finally up is Matt Brittin, chief excecutive officer of Google who introduces himself as “vice-president of the wetter countries of Europe.”17:00:Cecil will not answer whether Amazon being investigated in China or US. Hodge is asking same question over and over. Cecil won’t answer.16:57: Now MPs want to know what VAT they pay when they buy an electrical item. Is this a pre-Christmas shopping panel or a hearing?16:53: Bizarre that Cecil claims not to know UK revenues.16:50: Hodge accuses Cecil of not having any answers to the questions and says she has to order someone to come who can give proper answers, to proper questions. Says Cecil is pretending not to know the answers. Laughter erupts.16:45: Cecil says he needs a calculator to work out what tax Amazon pays in Luxembourg. That doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence in how the bookseller works out its tax. Cecil also can’t answer question about who owns the Luxembourg holding company. MPs outraged that Cecil doesn’t know structure of his own company.1640: Hodge accuses Amazon and Starbucks of paying people minimum wage… and has a mini-outburst. MP mentions Fifty Shades of Grey – it had to feature today somehow!16:38: Hodge again saying entire economic activity is in the UK and yet it pays no tax. “That really riles us. It riles us.”16:34: Cecil looks completely bewildered by the question: “Does Amazon own the book in Luxembourg or the UK?” He doesn’t know how to answer and just stares at the MPs.16:33: Amazon using that word again: “pan-european business”…16:30: Cecil stuttering a bit to explain to MPs why Amazon has a co.uk address but doesn’t pay tax here. They just will not give up.16:21: Andrew Cecil says there are more than 500 people working in Amazon’s European HQ in Luxembourg and there are 15,000 employees in the UK with plans to hire 10,000 more.16:19: Hodge saying she has to pay UK Royal Mail postage, which must mean the company is in the UK. She is a regular purchaser and her packages all have a UK stamp on them, so how can it not be UK? “When did any book I purchased get to Luxembourg” she asks Andrew Cecil of Amazon.Next up is Amazon. Hodge laughing about how Amazon.co.uk writes to her with offers almost everyday. She is trying to show it is a UK company she is buying books from.16:16: Alstead says: “We are never aggressive in avoiding tax.” Hodge is very cross that Alstead hasn’t answered any questions and is exporting “our” tax.This is one for the archive: MP says:“We in Britain are very concerned about fair play and we have embraced Starbucks because of its fair trade and ethics.”16:12: Alstead says a cup of coffee costs 20 per cent more in the US than in the UK. That explains a lot.16:09: An economics lesson from Alstead – MP asks if he can charge whatever he wants for coffee. “No, customers wouldn’t have it that way,” Alstead answers.16:05: Alstead looks in desperate need of a macchiato16:02: Alstead says Starbucks went too fast a few years ago expanding in the UK, and those are now the stores being closed.15:53: Why did Starbucks move £50m from cash to equity? Alstead says there was an inter-company loan from Starbucks US injected into the UK division at a 4.49 per cent interest rate – higher than anyone else. Hodge says the only explanation can be to get money out of the UK and avoid paying tax.15:52: Alstead says 25o people work in the Netherlands, including the “roaster”.15:51: The MPs seem to be asking the same question over and over and can’t think of a new one to ask. Alstead answering, almost bored.15:47: Alstead refutes suggestion that Starbucks charges excessively for roasting the coffee in Amsterdam.15:45: Strong words from MPs: “You’re either running the business very badly or there is some fiddle going on.”15:45: Alstead extols the “Starbucks System” but says the company hasn’t been successful in a handful of countries.15:42: Alsted asked if the value created by Starbucks in Switzerland or the Netherlands and not the UK.15:37: Alstead calmly answering Hodge, even though she is getting very excited about the questioning.15:35: Hodge accuses him of manipulating profits out of the UK into tax havens. The first charge, is that Starbucks charges for intellectual property. Hodge says she is a coffee addict but can’t tell the difference between a Starbucks or Caffe Nero coffee – but she can tell the difference between MacDonalds and KFC. So what’s the great intellectual property?Alstead says investors are skeptical about Starbucks ability to turn stores around immediately, but they are “very clear on the losses”.15:25: Margaret Hodge, chair of the PAC starts with Starbucks’ global chief financial officer asking about the losses it filed in the UK. Asks how Starbucks reconciles profits.15:28: Hodge exasperated with Starbucks and asks if it is lying to shareholders.15:29: Hodge still insisting “odd” that Starbucks files losses in the UK and promotes person in charge.Alstead says not at all pleased about financial performance. Hodge won’t let up on fact that Starbucks losing money in the UK.
415;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-11-11T18:35:00Z;MPs to grill companies over tax strategy;;Senior executives from Google UK, Starbucks and Amazon are set to face tough questions from MPs over their tax strategies in a parliamentary inquiry that is likely to spearhead a broader policy debate.Before Monday’s grilling by the public accounts committee, MPs of all parties voiced concern over tax avoidance after intense scrutiny by the media of the low corporate tax bills of some foreign-owned multinationals. Pressure is also being exerted by campaign groups such as UK Uncut, which has announced plans to target Starbucks stores in December, and the Tax Justice Network.The Treasury complains that some media coverage “betrays a lack of understanding as to how corporation tax works”. However, policy experts are exploring options for politicians if the controversy continues to rage.Lord Myners, the former City minister, and Margaret Hodge, who chairs the PAC, said at the weekend the Treasury should look into a sales tax as a way of raising extra revenue from global companies.This idea is favoured by some economists but would need to be adopted internationally, particularly as value added tax is the only turnover tax allowed under EU rules. Those rules would also impede another idea being floated – reintroducing withholding taxes on royalty payments out of Britain.The European Commission has offered its own solution – a common tax system across Europe for businesses, using a formula to apportion tax revenues to member states – that would reduce the scope for shifting profits to low tax jurisdictions.Some states are expected to adopt a modified version, but the UK is unwilling to relinquish control over its tax system by taking part.The EU also has a mandate to put pressure on member states that encourage corporate tax avoidance through “harmful tax competition”. Some policies adopted by Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Ireland are privately criticised by other member states. But the UK might be reluctant to call for a crackdown, given its flagship policy of increasing competitiveness to attract companies to Britain.The main focus of the drive to address international tax avoidance is the Paris-based OECD, a group of countries whose aim is to promote stable economic growth, which oversees global tax rules.Britain last week joined forces with Germany in backing an OECD initiative against profit shifting, highlighting that the Treasury can do little about international tax issues on its own – unlike many other corporate tax issues.When, for example, the Observer newspaper reported on Sunday that three of Britain’s biggest water companies paid little or no tax on their profits, highlighting the role played by capital allowances and interest deductions – both levers of government policy.The OECD will launch a public consultation on Monday on one of the most important aspects of “transfer pricing” – the rules determining how taxable profits are split between countries, many of which have struggled to keep pace with changing business practices.It is also looking at the taxation of ecommerce businesses, which present particular problems because they can sell to British consumers without any taxable economic activity taking place in Britain.Experts on international tax policy warn that devising effective remedies for international tax avoidance will be extremely hard. But if businesses cannot come up with a justification for their low tax bills that satisfies the public, there will be a growing demand for policy changes.David Gauke, a Treasury minister, said last week: “If there is a perception that big business does not pay its fair share, that will make it all the harder for those of us advocating a competitive tax system.”Recruitment agencies exploiting a loophole to cut the tax bills of temporary workers are bracing themselves for a crackdown in December’s autumn statement.Labour is set to draw attention to the estimated £650m cost of the loophole as part of its attempt in a Commons debate on Monday to force George Osborne, the chancellor, to postpone a 3p fuel duty rise planned for January.Officials have become increasingly concerned about the growing use of schemes that convert an element of a worker’s pay into tax-free expenses. In many cases the employer takes the bulk of the saving, with little benefit to the worker.Staffline, a recruitment company that has long campaigned against the practice, said it expected the loophole to be closed on December 5. Andy Hogarth, chief executive, said: “It gives an unfair advantage to the unscrupulous firms that use these schemes to cheat the tax man and exploit vulnerable workers”.Ed Balls, shadow chancellor, on Friday called for a clampdown on the “growing problem” of some employment agencies forcing workers to become employees of an umbrella company and falsely inflating their travel and food expense claims.The Labour government considered changing the rules in 2008 but opted for a greater focus on compliance with existing rules.
416;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Osborne to act on corporate tax avoidance;;George Osborne signalled a crackdown on multinationals that use aggressive tactics to cut their tax bills on Monday, in a sign of the pressure on politicians to tackle corporate tax avoidance.The chancellor’s intervention at the G20 meeting of world leaders came as senior officials at HM Revenue & Customs faced a grilling from MPs over what they described as “a failure to get to grips” with tax avoidance.In a joint statement with Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister, at the G20 in Mexico, Mr Osborne called for concerted co-operation to close gaps in international tax standards, which were failing to keep up with changes such as the development of e-commerce. “As a result, some multinational businesses are able to shift the taxation of their profits away from the jurisdictions where they are being generated, thus minimising their tax payments compared to smaller, less international companies.”Margaret Hodge, chair of the public accounts committee, accused HMRC of failing to put enough effort into making big companies pay their fair share, while small businesses were hassled over bills. She said: “There is a mood of anger out there.”MPs asked repeatedly why companies such as Starbucks were allowed to deduct royalty payments to other countries against tax. Richard Bacon, an MP, said the explanations did not seem credible to members of the public. “It smells. It doesn’t smell of coffee. It smells bad.”Lin Homer, HMRC chief executive, said she was unable to comment on specific cases but said multinationals could choose where they put their headquarters and outlets and were taxed where they carried out economic activity, not where customers were located.MPs expressed scepticism over the “mixed message” put out over enforcement by HMRC at a time when the government was trying to make the UK a more competitive destination for multinationals. Ms Homer said HMRC’s priority was to collect the tax that was due and they had not been told to “go easy” on big business.The Treasury said Britain’s call for international action against profit shifting “goes hand in hand” with its commitment to having the most competitive corporate tax system in the G20. Mr Osborne said: “We want competitive taxes that say Britain is open for business and that attract global companies to invest in and bring jobs to our country, but we also want global companies to pay those taxes. The best way to achieve that is through international action that ensures strong standards, without pricing ourselves out of the global market.”Germany and Britain called on the G20 to back work by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on tackling “base erosion and profit shifting”. Its work was spurred by political concern from a number of countries about the very low foreign tax rates paid by multinationals, such as Google, which located their intellectual property in low-tax countries.Ms Homer said big companies were eschewing “egregious” tax structures. She said the UK was considered to be a “leading” jurisdiction at implementing international transfer pricing rules but added that many finance ministers recognised that countries offering low tax rates presented a challenge. The government thought it important to work with other countries to stay ahead of companies that were “gaming the system”.HMRC said it had 65 transfer pricing experts among nearly 3,000 officials focusing on big business. Companies’ share of the tax “gap” – the difference between the tax paid and the tax owed – had fallen from 18 per cent to 13 per cent since 2004-5, while tax payments, as a proportion of total revenues, had stayed constant at 8-9 per cent.
417;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-11-04T16:43:01Z;HMRC to face MPs over multinationals’ tax;;"When top Revenue officials appear before MPs on Monday to discuss their latest accounts, they are likely to come under renewed pressure over the tax affairs of some of the highest profile multinationals operating in Britain.In recent weeks, Starbucks, Google, Amazon, Facebook and eBay have been the focus of intense scrutiny after it emerged that they paid corporate tax of, at most, a few million pounds despite clocking up sales from British consumers worth hundred of millions, or even billions, of pounds.Consternation is being voiced at the highest levels of British politics. When asked to condemn the behaviour of certain multinationals as “morally wrong”, David Cameron replied that he was “not happy with the current situation” and he wanted governments to tackle the problem of companies not paying the appropriate amount of tax.The tax officials – who are barred from discussing specific companies – can say little to assuage the MPs’ anger but there is evidence that they, too, are concerned about the tax payments of foreign-owned companies.Over the past five years, HMRC has raised £4.7bn from investigations into multinationals’ “transfer pricing”, the intra-group payments for goods and services that can shift profits to low tax countries. Foreign-owned companies represent 44 per cent of the tax that HMRC believes might be underpaid by large companies.Some, if not all, the companies in the political spotlight have already been under investigation. Starbucks, which says its low tax bills are a result of low profitability rather than avoidance, says HMRC negotiated the tax deduction for its 6 per cent royalty fee – paid to its European headquarters for the use of its brand and business processes – down to 4.7 per cent.Amazon, which is fighting a $1.5bn transfer pricing dispute in the US, has told investors that the UK, along with several other countries, may be examining its returns from 2003 onwards.It is no coincidence that attention is being focused on US multinationals. A quirk in their tax code, known as the “check the box” rule,– incentivises them to avoid foreign tax and pile up earnings in tax havens.In addition, HMRC has particular problems in taxing digital companies. They do not necessarily need a UK presence to make sales in Britain; the UK can only tax economic activity that takes place in Britain. Although Google employs 2,000 people in the UK, it, like Facebook, makes its European sales out of Ireland.Amazon’s digital sales are downloaded from Luxembourg, which is also the destination for fees paid by sellers of eBay’s auction site in Britain.As a result British consumers are far more important to these companies than their UK accounts suggest: the parent companies’ annual reports show that Amazon attributed . . . made between £3.3bn and £4.5bn of revenues to the UK in 2011; eBay attributed £790m of revenues to Britain.There is scope for argument over tax payments where an internet company delivers physical goods. Amazon is dependent on its warehouses up and down Britain. HMRC can argue that these operations are responsible for a substantial share of the profit associated with British sales because consumers value speedy delivery."
418;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Verismo true to Starbucks coffee;;An Espresso machine is only as peripheral to personal tech as a printer – both help me through my computing day – and the current vogue for pod-based machines reminds me of the printing peripherals business model.The coffee makers are sold cheaply, the same as printers, and money is made on the coffee pods, just like the ink and toner cartridges. Starbucks is the latest entrant with its $199 (£149) Verismo 580 machine and I have been testing it and tasting the results.I was initially surprised at how large this was compared to a trend in rival Nespresso machines to take up a smaller footprint on the kitchen counter. But the fairly narrow frontage of the Verismo means it should still fit in alongside all your other kitchen gadgets – this one slid in between a food mixer and toaster oven. Its large size also gives its water tank at the rear a full litre of capacity.There is an even larger model – the $399 (£349) V-585 – that adds a temperature variation control button, automatic cleaning, an LED display, an internal water filtration system, larger spent-pod container and a four-litre capacity water tank. Even with the 580, I was able to fit a large Starbucks mug under the spout.One space advantage of the Verismo is that it is a dual-purpose machine, so you can dispose of an existing drip-coffee maker, as this one has pods for both brewed coffee and espressos. It also has milk pods, so no need for a separate frothing machine either or the mess of steam and milk that can be created with machines that have wands that fire steam into a milk jug.However, I found there were compromises here on the taste. I prefer the taste of fresh, frothed low-fat milk and the pods tasted like powdered milk to me, despite Starbucks’ description of them as “fresh natural milk from the dairy” with the water extracted “using an innovative, gentle process”.The method is similar to other pod machines. Turning the machine on, it takes about 15 seconds to warm up – although I found the temperature of initial drinks made to be rather luke warm. You then lift the handle on the machine, insert the pod, close the handle and press the button for the type of drink you want. The pods are pierced and the pressure forces water through them, producing the espresso, regular coffee or ready-frothed powdered milk through the spout.Using the Espresso Roast pods and fresh milk, which I frothed with my separate Nespresso Aeroccino machine (Starbucks is offering a similar device for $60 ), I was able to make an acceptable latte, tasting almost the same as one I experience in Starbuck’s stores.In terms of a pure espresso, I did a blind tasting with a friend who is an espresso nut, comparing Starbucks with one produced by my Nespresso, using one of its Roma pods – probably its most popular blend.He found the crema on top of the Roma espresso to be thick, golden and creamy, while the Starbucks one was thin and dissipated quickly. He thought the overall taste was richer and stronger as well, confirming my own feelings about the differences between the two.We tried the House Blend pods for their drip-coffee taste as well, finding them perfectly acceptable and up to Starbucks standards.Buying vanilla syrup, caramel sauce, mocha sauce and hot cocoa mix from a Starbucks’ store will allow you to make an almost complete range of hot Starbucks drinks, including Caramel Macchiato, Vanilla Latte, Caffe Mocha and Hot Cocoa.While there is a decent selection of brewed coffee pods available – five, including Pike Place and the Christmas Blend – there are only three espresso blends, compared with a dozen or more with Nespresso.In terms of cost, I worked out a latte to my favoured strength and size was about $3 worth of pods. Starbucks says it should cost less than $2, but perhaps this is based on a single-shot tall latte.In summary, I would not buy the Verismo if I expected to make a better espresso at home – my Nespresso machine does a much better job, costing about the same for the machine, with cheaper pods and more choice of coffee blends.But if you are a Starbucks fan, the Verismo can make close approximations of your favourite drinks at home – as long as you use fresh milk and not the pods – for a little less than what you would pay in the store. The brewed coffee is also up to Starbucks standards and its pods give the machine a useful dual functionality.
419;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Starbucks – perking up;The coffee chain is ubiquitous but it keeps growing;"The third quarter was when sales growth at big American companies was supposed to slump. Starbucks was not informed.In its earnings report on Thursday evening, same-store sales at US shops – which make up three-quarters of total revenue – were up 6 per cent, holding the pace of the quarter before. Total revenues were up 11 per cent, helped by new openings in the US. (There is clearly no more room in America for more Starbucks outlets; the only possible explanation is that they are building new shops in the seating areas of old ones) Another contributor was continued rapid growth in consumer products sales. Shares rose 7 per cent in late trading.Yes, there are soft spots. The European operation is shrinking slightly and running at a loss. That may leave room for clever tax planning, but it does not reflect well on a company with global ambitions. Impressive growth in Asia comes off of a tiny base and high margins there are falling as the company invests in China. Consumer product sales growth is indeed impressive but is decelerating fast despite, again, a less-than-huge base.After so many big companies, from IBM to McDonald’s, have produced uninspiring results, any company that keeps up growth will be cheered, regardless of how that growth is distributed across regions or businesses. Starbucks coffee is expensive, but Americans remain stubbornly willing to pay up for it. Until that changes, the shares will command a premium, too.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
420;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-11-01T22:59:27Z;Sandy set to distort US spending;;Hurricane Sandy’s impact is likely to distort spending patterns on the US east coast as the end-of-year shopping season begins, analysts said, while retailers reported better than forecast October sales growth.With damage assessment continuing and clean-up work beginning slowly, Tom Clarke, a director in the retail practice at AlixPartners, said some households would probably end up spending less on luxuries ahead of Christmas.“You’ll see a shift in spending. Folks will take discretionary income and funnel it to rebuilding and re-establishing the basics, and away from fashion and accessory items, more whimsical purchases,” he said.Home Depot and Lowe’s, two home improvement retailers that consumers will turn to for building materials and white goods, had positioned supplies in advance of the storm so they could quickly replenish stores along its path.November is a crucial month for retailers with the biggest shopping day, Black Friday, coming on the day after Thanksgiving.Ken Perkins of Retail Metrics, a research group, said storm disruption was likely to reduce national retail sales growth in November by 1 to 2 percentage points.However, retailers that reported monthly sales figures for October Thursday made scant reference to the storm.Like-for-like sales excluding drug stores rose 4.7 per cent from the same month last year, according to Thomson Reuters, better than the consensus forecast of a 4.3 per cent rise.Although sales at Target, the mass market discounter, fell short of expectations, the numbers overall continued a pattern of strong consumer spending that has defied persistent economic uncertainty.“The expectation was that many retailers were going to come out and use the storm as an excuse to clear the decks in terms of [sales] expectations and nobody did that,” said Stacey Widlitz of SW Retail Advisors. “I think most retailers don’t know the true impact of the storm yet.”Some retailers are likely to be left with some excess holiday inventory, which could result in price markdowns that are good for shoppers but bad for profitability.However, Macy’s, which reopened its Manhattan flagship store on Wednesday, raised its forecast for sales growth in the second half of 2012 Thursday to about 4 per cent from 3.7 per cent.But he added: “The plans for supporting holiday [sales] were far enough along. Most folks are not waiting for a lot of merchandise to still get here from overseas.”
421;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-11-01T21:28:15Z;Industrials lead Wall Street higher;;Industrial companies led Wall Street higher on Thursday as positive manufacturing data and fresh stimulus measures from China helped to boost US equities.The benchmark S&P 500 rose 1.1 per cent to 1,427.59 as investors looked to put the weather-related shutdown of the US market on Monday and Tuesday behind them.The S&P 500 industrials index advanced 1.8 per cent to put it among the top rising sector groups in the week’s second trading session. Investors welcomed a survey of US manufacturing activity that showed production in the sector increased in October at a faster pace than expected.That report from the Institute for Supply Management came after the day started with news that China’s central bank pumped $60bn into the world’s second-largest economy this week to support infrastructure investments. Meanwhile, manufacturing data out of China also suggested reason for investor optimism after an important survey said activity in October rose to a four-month high.Masco Corp, the maker of home improvement and building products, rose 6.9 per cent to $16.13. Cummins, the diesel engine manufacturer, moved 5.5 per cent to $98.75 and Joy Global, the maker of mining equipment, gained 5.7 per cent to $66.03.“Broadening manufacturing is one of the pillars of economic growth, along with advancing corporate confidence, which still remains a head wind,” said Doug Cote, chief market strategist at ING Investment Management. “But the market’s attention right now is on the strong US manufacturing number, which bodes well for the next quarter of corporate earnings.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved 1 per cent higher to 13,232.62. Caterpillar, the earthmoving equipment maker, rose 3.4 per cent to $87.65.US equities were also bolstered by two pieces of labour market data, ahead of Friday’s important non-farm payrolls report. The labour department said first-time claims for unemployment insurance fell to 363,000, ahead of market forecasts. Meanwhile, private sector payroll processor ADP said 158,00 jobs were created in October, up from 88,000 a month earlier.Mr Cote said: “The focus is now squarely on Friday’s jobs report, which has serious implications on the course of the upcoming presidential election.”LinkedIn shares closed 0.1 per cent lower to $106.85, but it was set to open higher after rising more than 5.7 per cent in after-market trading. The business networking site reported third-quarter results ahead of the analyst forecasts.Starbucks, the coffee chain, finished 1.6 per cent higher to $46.62. The company was also set to open higher on Friday as it reported robust earnings and was up more than 6 per cent in after-market trading.Troy Alstead, Starbucks chief financial officer, said the storm would not have a meaningful impact on its results for the current quarter, noting that most of its stores had reopened and some had become sources of power and sustenance for people affected.The upbeat sentiment among investors on Thursday also helped to lower Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, the CBOE Vix index. The measure of implied volatility on S&P 500 options contracts has climbed as US equities have retreated since touching their highest point of the year in September. But the Vix was 10.3 per cent lower to 16.7 on Thursday.CBOE Holdings gained 4 per cent to $30.66 as the US derivatives exchange operator said trading volumes in Vix futures reached record levels in October.Technology sector stocks on the S&P 500 rose 1.8 per cent as chipmaker and micro communications companies saw gains. JDS Uniphase Corp, the fibre optics manufacturer, climbed 8 per cent to $10.48. Micron Technology, the semiconductor maker, rose 6.6 per cent to $5.78. Intel Corp, the chipmaker, moved 2.9 per cent higher to $22.26.The Nasdaq Composite index rose 1.4 per cent to 3,020.06. Shares in Apple, the heaviest weighted stock on the Nasdaq, gained 0.2 per cent to $596.54.Visa, the global payments company, moved 3.7 per cent higher to $143.88 after it reported a day earlier that net income almost doubled in its latest quarter. Rival MasterCard also reported robust results on Wednesday and advanced 1.7 per cent to $468.69 as US consumer spending boosted both card groups.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index was among the top rising sectors and advanced 1.3 per cent. Fresh consumer and retail data showed that same store sales in October rose 2.7 per cent in line with estimates, according to Thomson Reuters.Abercrombie & Fitch, the retailer that targets teenage consumers, was 8.7 per cent higher to $33.23. Fossil, the watchmaker and leather goods retailer, gained 7.8 per cent to $93.88.
422;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Think twice before tweeting;Communication through social media is increasingly easy – but so is making a mistake;"Millions are in uproar in #Cairo. Rumor they heard our new spring collection is now available . . .” read the message posted on the Kenneth Cole Twitter page.Last year that tweet to promote the fashion brand’s spring collection caused controversy when it made light of the protests under way in Egypt. Social media faux-pas are far from rare. However, this was not an error by an inexperienced intern, but by the chairman and chief creative officer himself, Kenneth Cole. The company soon apologised but it had already earned its place in online lists of “Epic Twitter Fails”. It was definitely a case of a business leader tweeting first and thinking second.Communicating from the hip is not restricted to trigger-happy tweeters. Today the average executive has a growing array of digital options to communicate with their organisation, clients and other audiences. Senior executives who once had time to ponder a reply feel under pressure to bec­ome adept at rapid digital communication, from dealing with emails to responding to tweets. Moreover, they are more likely to be dealing with these communications in the back of a taxi or in the queue at Starbucks rather than in their own office.Andrew Branch, a cultural sociologist at the School of Arts and Digital Industries at the University of East London, says that while digital tools have enabled rapid and mobile communication, they have also facilitated a state of “perpetual nowness”, in which executives feel every business communication must be processed and responded to straight away. “We’re digital beings now, instead of analogue ones. By this, I mean our communication is inclined to replicate the positive and negative aspects of digital culture: we act fast but this is not always conducive to critical, reflective thinking,” he says.But “digital sloppiness” is not only the result of executives acting before thinking something through. Few people have not experienced the tone of an email, text message or tweet being misunderstood or misconstrued. “As a sociologist, I’m interested in the social world, in which people enter into dialogue in varied ways, not just through digital channels. Analogue communication in this sense is much more receptive to nuanced dialogue – I’ve yet to find an adequate digital replacement for a raised eyebrow, furrowed brow or smile,” adds Mr Branch.The problem for executives is not just the speediness demanded by electronic communication, but the num­ber of platforms on which brands and businesses need to get their messages out fast. Online campaigns, Facebook brand pages and viral videos must be conceived, created and delivered in hours or days just to keep pace.● Stop, look, edit: Just because your BlackBerry or iPhone can receive email instantly does not mean you must reply instantly. Ensure you read an email through properly – and your own response – before you hit “send”.● Don’t publish a message or content just for the sake of it. “We’re awash with content so make sure anything you add is useful,” says digital content consultant Sharon Tanton.● If you are struggling to spot any typos in your report, important letter or presentation, get someone else to check it.● Know when meaning is more important than detail. It is usually better – despite some exceptions – for a brand or business to respond to a customer complaint on Twitter rapidly than wait for the tweet to be checked to be word-perfect. But a comment from the chief executive
on the company blog should be checked before it is published.That creates greater pressure for diligence in a rapid production process. Not only that, but some of the “digital natives” – who have grown up with the web and electronic communications – who are writing, designing and creating marketing campaigns, may not have the training of their predecessors. A digital native may be self-taught in artwork skills, whereas his or her predecessor probably had been to art school; similarly, a digital native may be less familiar with media law than a trained journalist.Lisa Kay, creative director of New York digital agency Last Exit, has a background in traditional graphic des­ign and was hired because the agency wanted its output to be “pixel-perfect”.She argues that some parts of the marketing and design industry are suffering from not learning the fundamentals, such as typography or page layout. “I see a lot of ‘get it done and get it out the door’ mentality going on, with a lack of attention to detail,” she says. Speed of response matters, but lack of diligence can dent the reputation of a brand. “If it looks sloppy, it makes even a luxury client look less luxurious,” says Ms Kay.Will King is founder and CEO of King Of Shaves, the UK-based razor and shaving gel company. A prolific user of social media, Mr King sees Twitter as an important brand-building tool. While there is no excuse for spelling mistakes, he says, it is important to be quick when responding to social media enquiries.“Speed of reply can be really im­pressive, especially when it comes from the CEO or brand spokesperson. [But] imagine you will be ‘marked’ on the quality of your response, especially if you are a senior person,” he cautions.Mr King – who tweets as @kingofshaves – advises fellow executives: “Don’t just tweet about how great you or your product may be, but get interesting, relevant, thought provoking content out there.” He adds not to tweet when “socially relaxed”, and actively to avoid any negativity and potential defamation.Organisations of all sizes increasingly feel the need to create and publish content on more digital platforms, from Twitter to blogs. Valuable Content is a UK-based consultancy that helps professional service firms create, write and share marketing content. Creative director Sharon Tanton says that if content “is ill-thought through, or shoddy, or pushy, your reputation will suffer. Rushing to produce ‘stuff’ . . . can be damaging”.Ms Tanton has co-authored a book with colleague Sonja Jefferson, Valuable Content Marketing, to help small businesses produce better digital content. She recommends a “Stop, look, edit” protocol to put some distance between the writing and publishing, although she concedes there is some flexibility depending on the format.Christian Payne, a UK-based digital storyteller, trading on­line as Documentally, coach­es organisations in how to communicate online, with clients including Kodak, the UNHCR and Vodafone. A prolific blogger, he chronicles an assignment in multimedia by uploading photos and videos, blogging, tweeting, posting data and audio blogging. “If attention to detail slips, it is not the fault of the tools. It’s the person using the tools who chooses how much attention they ap­ply to certain communications,” Mr Payne says. He argues that in some contexts meaning is more important than grammar: “It’s enough for me that the content communicates the meaning and context.”In the rush to communicate digitally, meaning may trump spelling but executives should also stop to think bef­ore hitting “send” and remind themselves that a sloppily produced report, presentation or blog post can detract from the message.“Even a sales report should look palatable to get your point across,” says Ms Kay, “but the stuff I see that people often create in PowerPoint presentations posted online makes me want to cry”."
423;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-10-30T17:26:32Z;Google and Starbucks face tax questions;;Google and Starbucks will be subjected to parliamentary scrutiny over their tax affairs for the first time on Monday with the public accounts committee set to demand that the two US corporate giants give evidence.Members of the influential committee agreed on Monday evening to call in the two companies to give evidence at a session into Revenue & Customs where inspectors will be asked about their contributions to the exchequer.“We want to ask them for an opportunity to explain why they don’t pay proper levels of tax in the UK,” Margaret Hodge, who chairs the committee, told the Financial Times.The move marks a cranking up of the political pressure on large international conglomerates over the amount of tax they pay in this country, after months of revelations about low tax rates enjoyed by some groups.David Cameron last week told the Commons that large international companies paying low tax rates in the UK faced investigations by Revenue & Customs.The prime minister had been asked by Ms Hodge during the weekly prime minister’s questions why he had criticised comedian Jimmy Carr for avoiding £3.3m of tax – when large companies were avoiding much larger sums.“Apple, Google, Facebook, eBay and Starbucks have avoided nearly £900m. Will the prime minister now take this opportunity to condemn their behaviour as morally wrong?” she asked.Mr Cameron replied that he was “not happy with the current situation” and he wanted governments to tackle the problem of companies not paying the appropriate amount of tax.The Revenue does not disclose which companies it is investigating because this would breach “customer confidentiality”. “But we make sure that multinationals pay the right tax to the UK in accordance with UK tax law,” it saidThe Revenue estimates that tax avoidance costs the UK £5bn a year. It says it is “alive to the risk” that multinationals structure their affairs to avoid tax, although it points to anti-avoidance rules and its deployment of specialist tax professionals to ensure companies comply with the rules.Tax experts says that the taxation of digital companies poses a policy dilemma across the world because they do not need a significant presence in a country to provide it with services.Google’s British corporate tax bill has attracted attention because it is low given the company’s sales, which are largely charged to its European headquarters in Ireland. It pays a royalty for the use of the company’s search and advertising technologies, which has the result of shifting earnings to Bermuda, via the Netherlands, according to a Bloomberg investigation in 2010.Google UK reported turnover of £396m for 2011, on which it made a £24m loss after incurring a cost of £51.45m relating to shares given to employees. It reported a tax charge of £3.5m.In a statement, Google said: “We make a substantial contribution to the UK economy through local, payroll and corporate taxes. We also employ over 2,000 people, help hundreds of thousands of businesses to grow online and invest millions supporting new tech businesses in east London. We comply with all the tax rules in the UK.”Starbucks’ tax affairs aroused attention two weeks ago when Reuters reported that the coffee shop chain paid just £8.6m in the UK in corporate tax since 1998 and reported losses in years when it told investors that its UK operation was profitable.The company has denied it has avoided tax, blaming its low corporate tax payments on its lack of profitability. It also defended its payment of a royalty to its European headquarters in Amsterdam, which provides operational expertise, store design and services related to intellectual property.Starbucks said on Tuesday night it had received the invitation to appear before the committee but was unable to comment further.Howard Schultz, chief executive, has previously said the company would comply with any government inquiry “with transparency and respect”.
424;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-10-29T15:47:34Z;NY big business shuts as small opens doors;;On a typical Monday morning a cavalcade of taxis and trucks thunders up Eighth Avenue through Manhattan’s Chelsea district, but as the rain ahead of hurricane Sandy thickened, the traffic on the road thinned.That made at least one aspect of Sean Ames’s life easier, as his short journey from the Gem Hotel on one side of the road to the Chelsea Gourmet Deli on the other was even quicker than normal.As the boutique hotel’s general manager, he had come to buy yet another crate of mineral water, this one for staff who had stayed overnight at the hotel and were likely to do the same again tonight as the subway remained closed.“We began to call our folks in when the [Metropolitan Transportation Authority] said it would suspend the service,” he said.People continued to move around the streets of Chelsea – a downtown district popular with young people and the gay community – but most were outside their normal routines having been told by their employers to stay at home.Big consumer businesses such as Starbucks and Whole Foods had also closed their doors for the day but smaller stores, cafés and restaurants remained open, although many were showing more apprehension than contingency planning.At Gristedes, a New York supermarket chain, Anita Drain, the store manager, said they had opened as normal as 6am but that plans for the rest of the day were unclear. “We’re waiting for word from head office.”With half a dozen customers moving through the checkout lines, people were buying “anything they can get their hands on” she said. “We just got some bread, which is good. But it’s only Pepperidge Farm so far.” Other supplies were arriving patchily.Murray’s Bagels, which had got its regular delivery of fresh-cut fruit salads in the morning, was planning to stay open until 11am. “But it depends on the weather,” said one staffer. “We gotta get home.”At the Venus Restaurant Diner, a group of six Japanese tourists were sipping breakfast coffee and wondering how to spend their day, doubting that they’d find any stores to shop in and concerned they would not find any restaurants open for dinner.Looking up to the rolling news coverage on the diner’s flat-panel screen, Keisu Kihara, the group’s leader, said: “If you look at the TV it’s scary, but it doesn’t seem so bad so far here.”With more hope than conviction, one of his friends asked: “Isn’t this all an overreaction?”At the Gem Hotel, Mr Ames, who was brandishing his own cup of fresh coffee, said: “Some [guests] have stepped out to get a beverage. Most are just hunkered down.”He had tested the hotel’s back-up power generators, corralled its flashlights, and tied down or removed anything on its roof that could be blown away.Supplying him with his crate of water was Jay Kim, owner of the Chelsea Gourmet Deli, who had slept overnight at the Eighth Avenue store rather than return to his home in Queens and risk getting stranded.All his one-gallon bottles of water had been snapped up long ago, he said, leaving only the smaller bottles. “The money I make is more because people are stocking up. But it’s not that busy.”He had not laid out the usual kaleidoscope of flowers for sale outside his store, but otherwise he was not overly prepared, or concerned. “We’ll stay open as long as we can. Until outside becomes crazy,” he said. “I don’t know. We’ll just have to see.”

Will the prime minister now take this opportunity to condemn their behaviour as morally wrong?”Mr Cameron replied that there was an “international problem” of how governments could ensure companies paid the appropriate amount of tax.“I’m not happy with the current situation, the HMRC needs to look at it very carefully,” he said. “We need to make sure that we are encouraging these businesses to invest in our country, as they are doing, but they should be paying fair taxes as well.”Mr Cameron’s comments come amid wider pressure in Westminster and beyond on companies to pay more tax. “People expect major companies that are household names to pay their fair share of tax,” said Pat McFadden, a Labour member of the Treasury select committee.Later, the prime minister’s spokeswoman said the issue was something that the prime minister felt strongly about: “HMRC are looking into it,” she said.However, the HMRC said that it could not disclose which companies it was investigating or not because it was bound by “customer confidentiality”.“For legal reasons we cannot comment on the tax affairs of individual businesses, but we make sure that multinationals pay the right tax to the UK in accordance with UK tax law,” it said.Meanwhile, Peter Lockhart, national officer for the PCS union, warned that the revenue had lost many staff amid budget cuts. “There is a fairly high attrition rate in HMRC and I think that’s connected with aspects of staff morale,” he told the Treasury committee on Wednesday.Starbucks, the latest name to find itself in the tax avoidance spotlight, told the FT this week that its low corporate tax in the UK was because of overexpansion.Troy Alstead, finance chief of the global coffee chain, revealed that HMRC had “heavily scrutinised” a 6 per cent royalty payment to its regional headquarters in the Netherlands, which reduced its taxable income. However, he said this charge was normal for a multinational retailers with overseas headquarters.

But this looks to be resolved shortly.David Cameron on Wednesday raised the political temperature over tax avoidance further as he warned large international companies paying low tax rates in the UK that they faced investigations by HM Revenue and Customs.Mr Cameron was asked about the issue by Margaret Hodge, chair of the PAC, during the weekly prime minister’s questions in the Commons.“Jimmy Carr avoided £3.3m of tax last year and the prime minister said that was morally wrong,” said the Labour MP. “Apple, Google, Facebook, eBay and Starbucks have avoided nearly £900m.

428;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-10-24T13:37:27Z;Cameron sees good news keeping coming;PM tells parliament ‘more good news’ on the economy is imminent;David Cameron told the House of Commons on Wednesday that “more good news” on the economy was imminent, raising expectations that Thursday’s gross domestic product figures will show Britain has pulled out of recession.The prime minister’s spokesman denied the comments were a “hint” ahead of official economic data, saying that Mr Cameron was instead referring more broadly to the idea that the economy was “healing and rebalancing”.The GDP figures are released to key members of the government 24 hours before their official publication.Mr Cameron pointed out during prime minister’s questions at midday that the employment figures had improved. “The good news will keep coming,” he said. “It is the Conservatives getting behind growth and jobs.”Labour said the prime minister was clearly hinting at the Thursday GDP data, with one aide saying “it’s not only shambolic but wrong”.The GDP figure, which covers July to September, is likely to have been boosted by the Olympic Games.Economists have predicted a reading of 0.7 per cent growth, meaning the UK would be out of recession. However, the figure will have been flattered by comparisons with the previous quarter, which was hit by bad weather and an extra bank holiday.Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, warned in a speech on Tuesday that the “zigzag pattern of quarterly growth rates of GDP” were likely to continue. He added economic output was still “barely higher than two years ago”.There is some hope in the government that improving economic data could draw a line under the sometimes chaotic events of recent days, which have seen the resignation of Andrew Mitchell, the chief whip and confusion over the coalition’s energy policy.Mr Cameron also told the Commons during PMQs that he was “not happy” with the UK tax arrangements of Starbucks and other international companies.The prime minister was asked about the issue by Margaret Hodge, chair of the public accounts committee, who said: “Jimmy Carr avoided £3.3m of tax last year and the prime minister said that was morally wrong. Apple, Google, Facebook, eBay and Starbucks have avoided nearly £900m. Will the prime minister now take this opportunity to condemn their behaviour as morally wrong?”Mr Cameron told her it was an “international problem” of how governments could ensure companies paid the appropriate amount of tax.“I’m not happy with the current situation, the HMRC needs to look at it, we need to make sure these companies are investing in our country,” he said.The Commons appearance also saw the prime minister insist that he would not be “pushed” into giving prisoners the right to vote, despite a European Court of Human Rights judgment.The ECHR has ruled that the current blanket ban on prisoners’ votes is unlawful but Mr Cameron told the Commons: “No one should be in any doubt, prisoners are not getting the vote under this government.”Downing Street had earlier denied the government was preparing to introduce a bill that would allow some to vote, but said: “We are still considering how best to proceed.”Yet Mr Cameron’s position was undermined when Dominic Grieve, the attorney-general, told the justice committee on Wednesday morning that the UK may have to change its policy to fulfil its international obligations.The UK could suffer damage to its reputation if it failed to abide by a European Court ruling saying prisoners must get the vote, Mr Grieve said. It would be seen as “a move away from our strict adherence to human rights laws”, he added.
429;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;Starbucks finance chief denies tax claims;;"Starbucks has admitted a quarter of its 600 UK-owned stores are running at a loss, in a rebuttal of accusations of tax avoidance, blaming its low corporate tax payments on overexpansion.In an interview with the Financial Times, Troy Alstead, chief financial officer of the global coffee chain, said: “I look forward to the day when we pay a lot more tax … we have had a long history, unfortunately and in the early days, of aggressive expansion. We did a little bit of a land grab and we made a lot of mistakes.”Starbucks, which champions fair trade practices as far afield as Latin America and Africa, has come under fire from MPs and suffered threat of boycott from its own customers after Reuters published an investigation into its tax affairs last week.It showed one of the world’s most ubiquitous coffee shops has paid just £8.6m in the UK in corporate tax since 1998 and reported losses in years when it told investors that its UK operation was profitable.Mr Alstead justified the differing accounts of Starbucks’ profitability by pointing to differences in the US and UK accounting rules. Even using the US measure, which excludes royalty and interest payments, operating margins had been low and reached just 6 per cent in 2007, its most profitable year, he said.He revealed that the UK tax authority had “heavily scrutinised” a 6 per cent royalty payment to its regional headquarters in the Netherlands which reduced its taxable income, and triggered allegations of tax avoidance. HMRC had restricted the tax deduction to 4.7 per cent of sales since 2003, he added.He defended the royalty charge, which he said was comparable to other multinational retailers with overseas headquarters. Starbucks’ UK operations would have had to spend more on operational expertise, store design and intellectual property if they were not supplied from the Dutch operation, he said, arguing that it was “irrelevant to the UK” whether the royalty was paid to Amsterdam or the US. He also declined to reveal details of how the Dutch operation was taxed.Mr Alstead said the current controversy would have no impact on its dealings with the UK tax authorities, saying there was “nothing new” that they would have learnt.Mr Alstead said that, with hindsight, the company should have been more vigorous in responding to reports that it avoided tax. “I have been very angry in the last week not because there is scrutiny, but because it has been so misrepresented and inaccurately reported.”In a damage limitation exercise, Michelle Gass, president of Europe, the Middle East and Africa for Starbucks, said the company’s field team had been visiting stores to explain the situation personally to staff.“It’s not like every single customer coming in the door is asking about this, but for those that are, they are prepared with answers,” she said.Mr Alstead portrayed a litany of mismanagement and poor execution in the UK business, which is home to 4 per cent per cent of Starbucks’ 17,650 stores worldwide.The first was taking out property leases that were “way too expensive and that we will never make money on” on British high streets. Property costs eat up 25 per cent of UK turnover, compared with 9 per cent in the US and 12 per cent in Japan.He said the proportion of UK stores losing money every month was larger than anywhere in the world. Compounding this, even stores where leases were more appropriate, operational mismanagement was eroding any profit. The way UK stores are managed, Mr Alstead said, lags behind the US, China and Latin America “where we have just been better operators”.Howard Schultz, the Starbucks founder, president and chief executive, will make an unprecedented online public statement in the UK on Wednesday – 10 days after an investigation into Starbucks’ tax affairs first hit the headlines, writes Louise Lucas.In his classic folksy style, the message on the coffee chain’s UK website will drill home a clear message: “We have never avoided paying taxes in the UK; we play by the rules in everywhere; and the (convoluted, to outsiders) European structure is a red herring. In short: we are good guys, trust us.”But Mr Schultz also acknowledged that the tax reports “may have left [some of you] with the wrong impression of Starbucks’ commitment to the UK”.To answer those, his open letter explains how different reporting requirements mean “there have been past instances when we have communicated to shareholders that the UK has been profitable, albeit a small profit, while at the same time in the UK we had no taxable income to report, and thus no corporate income taxes to pay.“Our low profitability in the UK is completely unrelated to any kind of licence fees or intercompany payments, it is unfortunately due to a number of historical operating and cost challenges, which we are working hard to change.”"
430;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-10-22T17:58:46Z;Who looks down on whom?;It’s not always easy to know where one stands in today’s Britain;“In the next 10 years we will have to continue to make changes which will make the whole of this country a genuinely classless society.” – John Major, prime minister, 1990Some hope. Britain seems more than ever stuck in a world of “plebs”, “snobs” and “chavs”. The resignation of Andrew Mitchell, government chief whip, who swore at Downing Street policemen in disputed terms, plus the fuss over George Osborne, the chancellor, for riding in a first-class train carriage with a standard-class ticket suggests the country has not travelled far.Mr Mitchell, nicknamed “Thrasher”, seemed to step straight from the boys’ weeklies whose public school characters, such as Billy Bunter, fascinated working-class readers for much of the 20th century. Mr Mitchell’s alma mater was Rugby, which he shared with Flashman – the fictional bully who is the cartoonists’ choice for depicting David Cameron, the Old Etonian prime minister.But class, for all its pervasive influence, is not the root of the Conservative-led coalition’s problems. After all, Boris Johnson, the Eton-educated London mayor, is the most popular politician in Britain. The government’s main problem is lack of competence, which is magnified when people think it is acting like a bunch of arrogant “toffs”.The puzzling thing is: why is Britain still so obsessed with status, when most people now fall within the loosely defined “middle class”? The answer may lie in the subtle confusions that wider education and prosperity have brought.Lord Prescott, the former Labour deputy prime minister, is frequently misquoted as having said “we’re all middle class now”. What he actually said, in a radio interview in 1996, is more revealing. He said, “I’m middle class”, but then clarified that he was “a working-class man with working-class values” living a middle-class “style of life” as a result of being a member of parliament.Many people find themselves coping with similar complexities. Life is not so simple as in the famous 1966 sketch by John Cleese, Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett, in which each stands in class and height order. Cleese: “I look down on him (Barker) because I am upper class.” Barker: “I look up to him (Cleese) because he is upper class, but I look down on him (Corbett) because he is lower class.” Corbett: “I know my place.”Today, few people, including the toffs, are sure of their place.Awash with coffeeHow much more coffee can we drink? Notebook is staggered by the relentless march of the coffee shop. There are more than 15,000 in the UK, forecast to reach 18,000 by 2015. No wonder there is controversy over Starbucks allegedly not paying its fair share of tax.Yet this coffee fetish should not seem so surprising, because we have been here before: a coffee house boom swept England in the 17th and 18th centuries. London alone had around 550, historians believe.Unlike today’s shops, where solitary sippers use the free WiFi to tap silently at computer screens, the point was to talk and listen to strangers. Paying a penny for a refillable cup, you could debate politics, science or the latest play for hours. They survived through the republic, restoration, the plague and fire of London and Charles II’s effort to suppress them.The first stocks and shares were traded in Jonathan’s coffee house by the Royal Exchange, while Britain’s insurance industry began at Lloyd’s on Lombard Street. Journals such as The Tatler and The Spectator thrived in them. If only Starbucks could spawn such creativity, perhaps people would be more forgiving.Incredibly curiousEdinburgh marketing chiefs have been criticised by council leaders for proposing to promote Scotland’s capital as “Incredinburgh” – too twee, they said. Then Suffolk’s tourism heads were attacked by MPs for wanting to brand it “the curious county”, which sounded too much like “the weird county”.As silly slogans go, Notebook quite likes the Suffolk one, though I am not sure how a county can exhibit curiosity. It is too late to turn the tide on fatuous rebranding exercises. Ever since the success of “I love New York” in the 1970s, councils have found sloganising irresistible.Glasgow had a hit with “Glasgow’s Miles Better” in the 1980s. The wags’ response – Edinburgh’s Slightly Superior – seems unbeatable.brian.groom@ft.com
431;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T03:31:47+0000;India leaves foreign investors unamused;Walmart faces chorus of disapproval in efforts to invest;India has been treated over the past few days to a slightly comical corporate drama, in which a foreign multinational is for once accused not of bribery, poisoning the water supply or selling worm-infested fast food, but of secretly attempting to invest.The supposed villain of the piece is Walmart, the world’s biggest retailer, now under examination by the central bank over an allegation that it “clandestinely and illegally invested” $100m in a supermarket venture that should have been closed to foreign investors.India’s suspicion of foreign capital goes back to colonial times, and those who question the unwelcoming official attitude to Walmart and Tesco are briskly reminded by Indian commentators of the commercial depredations of the British East India Company.Yet the Walmart controversy – for the record, the company says it is in “complete compliance” with the country’s byzantine foreign investment laws – has more to do with dysfunction and protectionism in the modern Indian economy than with any historical baggage.Like other developing economies, India desperately needs investment in infrastructure and business. Its retail and distribution sectors in particular are grotesquely inefficient and wasteful, with farm produce routinely rotting before it reaches the often dark and grimy premises in which 98 per cent of groceries are sold.India is also a poor country with a current account deficit to finance. That was one of the reasons, along with the fear of a sovereign downgrade by credit rating agencies, for the recent burst of economic reforms announced by the government of Manmohan Singh.These reforms included cuts in the fuel subsidies that have swollen the budget and current account deficits, and permission for foreign investors to own up to 51 per cent of supermarkets and department stores.From the howls of protest that could be heard all the way to Bentonville, Arkansas (where Walmart has its headquarters), one would have thought that Mr Singh’s government had condoned a massacre of Indian children rather than offered Walmart, Tesco and Carrefour the chance to invest hundreds of millions of dollars of their own money in a risky attempt to run a profitable business in India.Those protesting the loudest against the purportedly wicked foreign investors include the country’s 50m small shopkeepers, the high-margin middlemen who supply them and the opposition politicians who rely on their support. Walmart’s Indian rivals may be working behind the scenes, too: who leaked the documents showing Walmart’s complex arrangements with its local partner, Bharti Enterprises?Indian opponents of foreign investment found an ally in Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel economics laureate, who harshly criticised Walmart’s labour and business practices in interviews with the local media during a visit to India, and suggested the country did not need such investors because its own entrepreneurs were “globally-savvy” and had “a lot of wealth”.Indian investors, unfortunately, have been putting much of this wealth to work outside India, heading abroad to buy everything from hotels to coal mines and car companies, in part because they find their domestic business climate almost as daunting as foreigners do. They know this to be a market where the government has imposed retrospective taxes on investors and where managers have been attacked and occasionally kidnapped or killed by angry employees.Big retailers face a further discouragement: even in more developed foreign markets such as China, with relatively rich consumers and modern transport infrastructure, it has proved difficult for supermarkets to turn a profit.Yet still the big brands keep coming to India. Last week, Starbucks, the Seattle-based global coffee chain, opened its first outlet in the country– a large café in Mumbai. Ikea, the Swedish home furnishing retailer, has applied to open shops in the country, taking advantage of rules allowing full foreign ownership of “single-brand” retail outlets.In time, Indians may have reason to thank deep-pocketed foreign multinationals such as Walmart. These companies, after all, are sufficiently dazzled by the potential profits to be made from 1.2bn consumers in the future that they are willing to overlook the immediate and very substantial obstacles and give the country a try.
432;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-10-22T07:21:55Z;Tata milestone goes almost unmarked;;The Tata Group is old school, especially by Indian standards. In a country where the company bosses often live flashy lifestyles and make extravagant purchases, chairman Ratan Tata (pictured) is a paragon of modesty.So it was perhaps unsurprising that the group made little noise about its most recent milestone – in the fiscal year that ended in March, Tata became the first Indian company to cross the $100bn in revenues mark. So little, in fact, that it was weeks before the Indian media noticed.Most other Indian businesses would have issued an exclamation point-laden press release while executives made the rounds on the country’s cheerleading TV networks.Instead, Tata opted for a quiet amendment to the second paragraph of the company’s profile on its website. So quiet, in fact, that it wasn’t picked up by India’s normally-excitable media – for whom the opening of a Starbucks in Mumbai over the weekend was headline news.A Tata spokeswoman, when asked about the milestone, was similarly nonchalant: “It’s been up on the website for some time… the journalists must not have read our profile for a while.” When they did, they saw there was a story.The website had been amended, she said, “in the last few weeks” but she couldn’t say exactly when.Typically Tata.
433;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-10-22T05:34:16Z;China’s coffee industry is starting to stir;Nestlé and Starbucks are converting a nation of tea drinkers;Coffee in China used to be tarred with the same brush as capitalism. But as capitalism has caught on in China, so has coffee: the mainland market for retail packaged coffee has grown at a compound rate of 18 per cent a year since 2007, and could rise another 75 per cent to Rmb16bn ($2.5bn) by 2017, according to research firm Mintel.It must be the marketing coup of all time: the transformation of China from a tea leaf nation to a country of coffee drinkers – in spite of the fact that most Chinese still abhor the taste of the bitter brew. Western coffeehouse chains are stumbling over each other to open up in China, and Starbucks – which has a shop on every major street in China’s biggest cities – expects the mainland to be its second largest global market by 2014.Nestlé, the food group, already sells two out of three cups of soluble coffee on the mainland. Last week, the Swiss company chose China to release its nine-month global sales– announcing organic growth in emerging markets of 11.7 per cent for the first nine months year on year, compared with 2.4 per cent in developed markets and a full-year global forecast of 5-6 per cent.Nestlé China’s food and beverage sales have risen by a 16 per cent compound annual growth rate since 2008, and coffee sales have grown faster than that, says Roland Decorvet, head of Nestlé China. With China’s per capita coffee consumption only four cups per year compared with 400 in Japan, the potential is obvious, he says. “Contrary to what you might expect, the biggest instant coffee cultures in the world are all tea cultures” like Japan and the UK.So how did Nestlé and Starbucks persuade the Chinese to buy a product the taste of which they dislike? “The short answer is that when the Chinese drink Nescafé, they are not drinking coffee but a sweet concoction of water, milk powder and sugar,” says Torsten Stocker, partner at Monitor Group consultants.“Coffee is an alien taste for the Chinese,” says Rebecca Lian, head of Nestlé R&D in China. “They don’t like the bitter taste because it reminds them of traditional Chinese medicine.”Black coffee may not be a hit but coffee drinks are. Starbucks, one of the most successful western brands in China, has adjusted its products to deal with the Chinese distaste for coffee. “There is very little pure coffee sold at Starbucks,” says Shaun Rein of China Market Research in Shanghai. Many mainland Starbucks customers prefer milkshake-type drinks, teas, juices and localised flavours like the green tea latte. Chinese go to Starbucks for the culture, not the coffee.In China, Starbucks is a dine-in, not a take-out destination. Customers are invited to linger, log into the free WiFi and use its coffee houses the same way that earlier generations used tea houses: to socialise and do business.Xu Lu, general manager of the Cocoa & Coffee Division of China Tea Co, says she felt “drunk” when she tasted her first cup of coffee. Now she thinks more people are “enjoying the coffee in Starbucks, as well as the culture”.But when Nestlé recently changed the recipe for Nescafé in China for the first time in 15 years, it made Nescafé taste less like coffee, rather than more. The end result was a drink with a texture and consistency closer to chocolate milk. Mr Decorvet says Nestlé does not believe in “food neo-colonialism”. “Why should we tell the world what coffee should taste like?” he asks.Coffee drinks are more and more popular all the time in China – as long as they do not taste too much like coffee.Additional reporting by Yan Zhang
434;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-10-21T19:28:40Z;McDonald’s – cause for indigestion;Latest disappointing results could see investors going elsewhere to satisfy their appetite;"Investors aren’t lovin’ it, but they aren’t absolutely hating it either. In the third quarter, McDonald’s served up its second consecutive set of disappointing results and warned of more pressure to come. Net income dropped 3 per cent to $1.5bn from the same period a year ago, while revenues slipped only marginally to $7.15bn. That follows a 4 per cent year-on-year drop in net profit and flat revenues in the second quarter.With more than two-thirds of its revenue coming from outside the US, McDonald’s has been hit by the faltering global economy. Meanwhile, competition is heating up at home as Burger King, Wendy’s and Taco Bell, owned by YUM! Brands, are luring customers by rolling out some of the same strategies that have helped McDonald’s to prosper. Burger King now serves chicken wraps alongside Triple Whoppers, and “premium blend coffee” is poured at some Wendy’s outlets. And the cost of commodities is high.With all of that to swallow, some indigestion from the McStellar stock performance of recent years is no surprise. McDonald’s shares topped $100 in January, more than double their 2008 low. This year’s rumblings have siphoned off 12 per cent, including Friday’s 4 per cent decline. At $89, McDonald’s trades at 17 times this year’s earnings. That is below Starbucks (26 times) and YUM! (21 times), which have higher projected growth rates, but still no value meal.McDonald’s has some leeway, particularly in uncertain times, as it is viewed as big and stable. (Shares in younger and scrappier Chipotle Mexican Grill, for instance, fell 15 per cent on Friday on warnings of slowing traffic; they are down almost 30 per cent in 2012.) The world’s largest restaurant chain also carries a dividend yield of more than 3 per cent. But any more bad news and more McDonald’s investors might just get hungry and start looking elsewhere to satisfy their appetite for stability.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
435;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Private equity – in the line of fire;Banker bashing spreads to sector despite public companies often doing the same thing;Five years on from the financial crisis and banker bashing remains fair game. The lack of support for Britain’s lenders in the face of often fraudulent class action claims, for example, would be unforgivable in normal times. Today heads turn the other way. Hedge funds, on the other hand, are mostly left in peace. Last week’s news of 41-year-old Greg Coffey’s retirement from Moore Capital Management met with almost no resentment, in spite of his huge rewards. But there is no such luck for private equity, an industry increasingly portrayed alongside the banks as one of the bad guys.Why the bad rap? After all, private equity had little to do with the credit crisis, nor did it need recourse to public funds. To be sure it can be brutally short-termist and overpaid but so are hedge funds. Private equity’s performance record is similar to hedge funds too (although much harder to measure accurately). There are a few crackingly good funds but, over most periods, average returns are more or less in line with public equity benchmarks, as financial theory would expect.At the very least the court of public opinion should be consistent when thinking about private equity. That is not to say criticism of the likes of presidential challenger Mitt Romney’s Bain Capital is misguided. Performance is hugely reliant on leverage (debt funding accounts for a third of returns, reckons the Center for Entrepreneurial and Financial Studies and Capital Dynamics), which drives managers to cut costs aggressively. And the industry pays itself in a way that minimises taxes.But public companies often do the same thing. They employ debt to boost returns on equity, minimise tax (hello, Starbucks) , and, when run well, manage headcount aggressively. Bad listed companies do not reinvest in their business just as good private ones know the value of spending to grow. And active shareholders and boards can hold managers to account just as well as private owners. Save the bashing for the real bad guys.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
436;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-10-20T12:49:01Z;Starbucks in India: full of beans;;"In few countries would the opening of a coffee shop be treated as headline news, but that’s exactly the treatment Starbucks’ 4,500 square foot flagship Indian store in Mumbai received on Friday.Throngs of journalists converged on the restored heritage building owned by the company’s local 50:50 partner, the Tata Group, to mark the entrance of the Seattle-based coffeehouse into the traditionally tea-drinking subcontinent.Television reporters sipped imaginary coffee from empty mugs as they filed live reports, anchors announced breaking news reports as they cut away to billionaire chief executive Howard Schultz’s press conference, while workers readied a stage in front of the building that houses the store for an event later that night.India’s coffee and café culture is in the early stages of its development – the total café market is estimated at $230m a year and is dominated by the Bangalore-based Café Coffee Day, which has more than 1,300 stores across India. But Technopak, a New Delhi-based consultancy, estimates that the market will grow around 13 to 14 per cent a year for the next five years to be valued at around $410m by 2017.“The size of this market is one of the largest in the world for Starbucks, so we’re coming here with a very large appetite in terms of overall growth and investment,” said Schultz, though he did not go into detail on the company’s growth strategy.Schultz said that while the store was designed to make a statement, pricing was designed to be accessible to a broad spectrum of Indians: a short cappuccino will cost Rs95 ($1.78), while a venti caramel frappachino will set you back Rs200.He said comparisons with China, in which Starbucks has around 700 mainland stores, weren’t quite apt.“We’ve been in China for 13 years, we have 700 stores on the mainland, and around 1,000 including Hong Kong and Taiwan – we’ve invested years of doing business there, and unlike India, there we had to educate the consumers,” he said. “The wind is at our back in India… the awareness of Starbucks is higher here than any other market that we’ve never entered.”Despite the Indian government having recently opened up single-brand retail to foreign direct investment – and Starbucks having been looking to tap the market since 2006 – Schultz said the company would still only have entered with the Tata Group, in part because of its reputation and its capabilities with infrastructure, a tricky proposition in India, and food.To that end, the 42-item food menu has been designed with India-specific dishes, like a cardamom flavoured croissant, a chicken tikka panini, and a tandoori paneer roll. Schultz said that while coffee would be the main reason patrons came to Starbucks, it was clear that food was important to the Indian consumer.“We anticipate that the percentage of revenues from food will be higher in India than perhaps anywhere else in the world,” he said.In the next week, Starbucks plans to open two smaller stores in an upmarket Mumbai mall and the Tata-owned Taj Mahal Palace Hotel.Related reading:

437;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
438;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Starbucks at risk of a roasting over tax;;Starbucks faces a “brand catastrophe” as protesters prepare to target the coffee chain over its tax affairs, according to a respected market research company.YouGov said on Friday that consumers’ perceptions had deteriorated each day since Reuters published an investigation showing the company paid just £8.6m in corporate tax since it opened in Britain in 1998.Sarah Murphy, director of YouGov’s BrandIndex, said: “In the current climate the public have a fairly low tolerance for anything that smacks of corporate greed. While it is still too early to tell what the long term impact of this will be, on the current trajectory Starbucks could be heading for a brand catastrophe.”But even as Starbucks joined the ranks of Amazon, Facebook and Google as the focus of public dissatisfaction over the fairness of the tax system, doubts emerged over whether the company aggressively avoided tax at all.Michael Devereux, of the Oxford University Centre for Business Taxation, said the tax arrangements detailed by Reuters would not, by themselves, account for the reported losses in recent years. “The extent to which this is aggressive is questionable.”The company is being unfairly demonised, according to Jeffrey Young, managing director of Allegra Strategies, a consultancy that publishes research on the coffee shop market. “I am fed up with uninformed people making unfounded claims.”He said the company had genuinely made losses because its aggressive expansion at the start of the last decade left it struggling to cover rental costs. The problem dated back to a bidding war with Coffee Republic for prime sites. By contrast, Costa, a rival chain, paid lower rents after adopting a more sophisticated property strategy.Now the company has a chance to turn the business around, after closing non-performing stores, changing its business model and adding 20-25 new outlets a year. Mr Young said: “There is no reason why it cannot be profitable. It attracts close to 1m customers a day.”But there are still unanswered questions about why Starbucks repeatedly told analysts it viewed the UK operations as profitable. Starbucks said the definition of profitability it used when addressing shareholders excluded royalties or interest payments, in compliance with SEC filing requirements which it followed as a US-based corporation. But in the UK, complying with local tax laws, profitability is calculated after interest costs and royalties.Concern is primarily focused on the 6 per cent royalty and license fee payments for using the brand and processes. This fee, which reduces taxable income in the UK, is paid to its European headquarters in Amsterdam. Critics point out that in 2007, the company would have been profitable were it not for this payment. Charging for services provided by operations in low tax countries is one of the main ways in which multinationals can shift profits to low tax jurisdictions.The central question is whether a 6 per cent charge is excessive. HMRC would be unable to challenge the payment of royalties to another European country where the brand was owned and managed, provided there was a genuine business in that country.Several tax experts told the Financial Times that it was likely to be near the top end of the range of reasonable figures, but would have been backed by studies showing that consumers were prepared to pay a premium for Starbucks coffee. HMRC would also have scrutinised intra-group payments for roasting and buying coffee but there would be limited scope for shifting profits, given the ready availability of comparable data.Another common method of reducing tax bills is by exploiting Britain’s relatively generous rules on interest deductions – although the interest charges appear relatively modest in the case of Starbucks’ UK operations which paid £2m to group companies last year. Ahead of the last election, the Conservative party proposed tightening the rules on interest deductibility but retreated after businesses said it would damage competitiveness.Revenue & Customs rejects criticism that it gives multinationals an easy ride. It is investigating foreign-owned companies for almost half of all taxes that it believes might be underpaid by large businesses, according to statistics released through a Freedom of Information request. HMRC says it is “alive to the risk” that multinationals structure their affairs so that UK profits are not taxed here.Even so, big companies often pay no corporation tax. In 2005–06, a quarter of the 700 largest businesses in the UK paid nothing, mostly because of current or historic tax losses. Small domestic companies have less opportunity to exploit tax rules. Jason Collins of Pinsent Masons, a law firm, said: “Generally speaking a foreign-owned company will have a great deal more opportunity to do tax planning than a domestic company.”Anger over profit shifting is prompting some countries to call for a radical revision of international tax rules. But the UK response has been to reform the system and cut rates in the hope of encouraging multinationals to centralise regional management services in Britain.Public anger over tax planning by multinationals is likely to escalate. But the backlash could risk damaging the reputation of the UK as a place to invest. Chris Sanger, global director of tax policy at Ernst & Young said: “We need to be able to convince companies that this positive pro-growth strategy is here to stay.”
439;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks and tax;Public anger might better be directed at the system;For a company that likes to present a laid-back and neighbourly image to the world, few predicaments could be more dissonant than the one in which Starbucks now finds itself.The British arm of the Seattle-based coffee shop chain has for the past week been battling charges of aggressive and antisocial tax avoidance. Quite whether it has done anything abusive to achieve its all but invisible liability to UK corporation tax is a question that is still being debated. Starbucks itself insists that it has not and that the problem lies in its unprofitable business model.But the row illustrates yet again the extent to which public attitudes to tax avoidance have hardened. It is perhaps too soon to know whether Starbucks will join the likes of Top Shop in becoming a target for the public sit-ins and boycotts organised by bodies such as UK Uncut, the tax pressure group. The kerfuffle may swiftly blow over – not least because Starbucks may yet establish its innocence. But the charges have already done damage to its brand.There is nothing wrong with high-profile public shaming as a weapon in the armoury against the exploitation of loopholes. Consumer-facing businesses that depend on public goodwill to make sales should expect to pay a price if they forfeit it. As austerity has hit, so paying conspicuously little tax has risen up the list of public niggles.But public anger might equally be directed at the tax system itself, especially the way it treats multinationals. Current practice has turned tax into a largely voluntary gesture for such businesses. It is all too easy to shuffle income off to low-tax jurisdictions through intra-group debt financing and the transfer pricing of intangibles such as intellectual property.Rather than relying on the taxman and the public to police the fuzzy boundary between legitimate tax avoidance and illegal evasion, a more rational method of linking the tax multinationals pay to real economic activity must be found. The EU has been considering the adoption of a system of “formulary apportionment” by which multinationals’ tax bases would be divvied up according to where they do business. This agenda, which needs a group of states to join forces, should be keenly pursued.A fairer system would have many virtues. Not only would it lift the taint of suspicion from multinationals such as Starbucks which pay little or no tax. It might also help to win the British public round to the austerity on which the country has embarked.
440;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T03:31:47+0000;Starbucks out to woo tea-loving Indians;;Starbucks, the Seattle-based global coffee chain, opened its first store in India on Friday, as it began its foray into the nascent café culture of the traditionally tea-drinking subcontinent.The 4,500ft store – far larger than many Starbucks shops around the world – is located in a restored heritage building owned by Starbucks’ Indian partner, the Tata group, in the heart of Mumbai’s commercial district.Howard Schultz, Starbucks chief executive, said the chain had been keen to enter the Indian market since 2006, but had taken years to find the right joint venture partner.The Indian government decided last year that it would permit so-called single-brand retailers – such as Starbucks and Ikea – to set up shop in India on their own. However, by then, Starbucks had already set up its partnership with Tata, which is also one of India’s largest coffee growers.Mr Schultz said he did not believe the delay would harm Starbucks’ prospects in the Indian market, given the excitement over its long-anticipated arrival.Mr Schultz’s presence in Mumbai ahead of the store’s opening was treated by India’s media as an event of national significance. Television reporters sipped imaginary coffee from empty mugs as they filed reports on the countdown to the launch.India is still in the early stages of its café culture. It is dominated by the Bangalore-based Café Coffee Day, which has more than 1,300 stores across India. According to Technopak, a New Delhi-based consultancy, total café market revenues are $230m a year – but it forecasts that the market will grow 13-14 per cent a year for the next five years to be valued at about $410m by 2017.In a market known for its extreme price sensitivity, Starbucks has chosen a price point designed to be accessible to a broad spectrum of Indians – a short cappuccino will cost Rs95 ($1.77), while a venti caramel frappuccino will cost Rs200.Like other global restaurant chains operating in India, Starbucks is also making concessions to the Indian palate.Along with its more typical muffins and sandwiches, Starbucks’ 42-item food menu for India will include such items as a cardamom-flavoured croissant, a chicken tikka panini and a tandoori paneer roll.The opening of the flagship store will be followed by the opening of two smaller stores in Mumbai next week, one in the Tata-owned five-star Taj Mahal Hotel, and another in an upmarket shopping mall. In January, Starbucks said its aim was to open 50 stores in India by the end of the year.
441;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks faces boycott calls over tax affairs;;Starbucks was facing calls for a consumer boycott last night as MPs prepared to investigate claims it has paid just a few million pounds in corporation tax since bringing its coffee shops to the UK 14 years ago.As a campaign against the company gathered pace on social media, politicians and union leaders were among those urging people to avoid its 735 UK stores.Stephen Williams, a Liberal Democrat MP, said “consumer power” would force Starbucks “to come clean about their tax avoidance activities”.“Consumer boycotts have a long tradition in the area of coffee and sugar going right back to 18th century Quaker led campaigns in Bristol against the slave trade,” he said. “Think before you drink and maybe we’ll get this company to act responsibly.”According to a Reuters investigation the retailer has paid £8.6m in corporation tax since it opened in the UK in 1998 and has not paid any since 2009. The company has made UK sales of £1.2bn in the past three years but declared no profit despite having described the British business as “profitable” to investors and analysts.Starbucks hit back on Wednesday, arguing that corporation tax represented just a fraction of its UK tax burden.‘We noticed that you filed the super-skinny, no-caff tax return indicating that you have no tax liability’Kris Engskov, UK managing director of Starbucks, said the company had in the past three years “paid over £160 million in various taxes including National Insurance contribution for our 8,500 UK employees, and business rates”.He added: “The truth of the matter is, the one tax that has been debated in the media, corporation tax, is based on the profits we make in this country – and regrettably we are not yet as profitable as we’d like to be.”MPs are set to question tax officials about multinationals’ tax planning next month when senior Revenue & Customs officials give evidence to the Commons public accounts committee. Margaret Hodge, who chairs the committee, said HMRC had “questions to answer” about Starbucks’ tax affairs.MPs on the Treasury subcommittee are also due to question HMRC officials and George Mudie, its chairman, said he planned to ask them about Starbucks.HMRC said last week that it deployed specialist tax professionals to ensure that multinationals complied with the rules.Heather Self of Pinsent Masons, a law firm said the controversy over the tax paid by multinationals did not justify a change in the law but underlined the need for proper enforcement. “HMRC needs the skills the assess the information it is being presented with.”Efforts by HMRC to crack down on tax avoidance are set to come under scrutiny on Thursday when it publishes it latest figures for the “tax gap”, the difference between what it collects and what it ought to collect. The tax gap is expected to increase because of the rise in VAT.
442;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-10-17T18:26:18Z;Starbucks makes a mochary of tax law;The chain has found itself in hot water even though it has followed the rules;Starbucks is facing criticism in the UK for paying practically no corporation tax in the country. The coffee chain paid just £8.6m over the last 14 years and nothing in the last three through legal tax minimisation techniques like moving its revenue into other lower tax countries.Hello, and welcome to HM Revenue and Customs. My name is Brad and I’ll be your taxista for the day. I apologise for the wait but there’s only six of us in the team.No problem.I just wanted to walk through your tax filing because we’ve detected a couple of anomalies. So we noticed that you filed the super-skinny, no-caff tax return indicating that you have no tax liability.That’s rightBut your CEO has declared the UK business a great success. In 2007 your COO said profits there were grande venti super triple caff with added millionaire shortbread. I have to say that we’re noticing the millionaires in your company but there’s a shortage of bread being paid to the HMRC.Well you have to remember that grande venti super triple caff is our description of something that’s very small – often non-existent.I thought your small products were called tall.Yes, but our super-small are called grande venti.Now don’t try it on sir, I’ve been in your shops and grande and venti are bigger than tall.In drinks yes, but in profits it’s the opposite. Grande is our smallest profit. Grande venti is a loss.How can you declare a loss in recent years on your turnover?We have a lot of expenses that have to be paid.Yes, I noticed for example that you purchase all your coffee beans through a trading arm in Lausanne.We have a deep commitment to fair trade and demand that our products are ethically sourced through low-tax domiciles. We ensure a significant slice of the revenue goes back to poor traders in Switzerland. In fact we take this so seriously that we might extend this principle to other coffee capitals in Luxembourg, the British Virgin Islands, and the Turks and Caicos.Can you remind me of the name of this ethically priced trading arm?Er, I’m not sure I recall.Could it be the Starbucks Trading Company by any chance?You know, that might be right. Completely slipped my mind.It seems expensive. Don’t you want a more economic option.If you want the best you have to pay for it. It’s why we believe our coffee has that rich flavour with none of the bitter aftertaste you get with high corporation tax beverages.I see. Perhaps we can turn to these crippling loans you have to service.Yeah, the interest is killing us.So I see. Is it really Libor plus 4 per cent? McDonald’s pays below Libor and KFC is plus 2 per cent.Yeah, we’re on the triple grande loan scheme.I thought grande was small.In profits yes, but on loans no.So who do you borrow from?They call themselves Starbucks.Why don’t you go somewhere with a better rate.Well, we’ve built up a relationship with them over time.I see, now what about these intellectual property rights royalties you pay to this company, er Starbucks Coffee EMEA BV.Yes, they very generously allow us to use their logo and branding but they really screw us in royalty fees. Listen we don’t write the laws. We just work within them like lots of other multinationals.Yes but you seem extra grande good at it. Well, there’s no wrongdoing but we’re going to be keeping our eye on you. Now just before you leave, would you mind filling in a customer satisfaction survey for us. Please rate your tax office experience on a scale of one to five with one being very dissatisfied and five very satisfied.I’d have to give it a five.Thanks very much. Can I interest you in one of our loyalty cards?I’ll pass, thanks…May-day callThe Home Secretary Theresa May has inflamed Americans by refusing to extradite Gary McKinnon, the self-confessed computer hacker, who hacked into the Pentagon and Nasa systems.

443;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-10-16T20:00:06Z;Costa seeks expansion in China;;Costa, the Whitbread-owned coffee shop chain, is to more than double production at its London roastery to sate the growing demand for cappuccinos in China.In a reversal of the 19th century trade that saw “clipper” ships sail east to bring tea back to Britain, the present day coffee business is roasting more coffee at its UK plant and exporting it around the world. It is now building a third roasting unit to supply its outlets in China, which are projected to more than double in number to 500 by 2016.“Most of our expansion, outside the UK, is being driven by China,” says Christopher Rogers, Costa’s chief executive, adding that the company has also even introduced a green tea latte to suit local tastes.“Customers order it in takeaway cups even if they stay in the store, so they can walk round with it afterwards,” explains Mr Rogers,Costa’s China push is part of a broader offensive by coffee companies to capture market share in the largely tea-drinking nation.Last year, Starbucks said it had plans to triple its number of stores there to more than 1,500 by 2015.Costa sources its coffee beans from Africa, South America and Asia, but uses its London roastery to process all of the coffee for its overseas shops – apart from those in India.Mr Rogers explains that in India it is more cost effective to build a small local roastery than to go through the bureaucracy of importing roasted coffee.The Lambeth-based roastery – which stores its beans under a railway line, and emits a burnt toast-like smell over much of southwest London – produces about 7,500 tonnes of ground coffee a year, a figure that Whitbread forecasts will rise by 10,000 tonnes with the addition of the new roaster.Costa’s five-year plan – which it is midway through implementing – is to double its presence to 3,500 stores by mid-2016. Of these, 2,000 will be in the UK. It also plans to install another 3,000 Costa Express coffee machines by mid-2015. Last year, Costa paid £59.5m for Coffee Nation, which had 900 coffee vending machines, boosting its presence in places such as petrol stations and travel hubs.Last year, Costa reported a 24 per cent increase in sales to £819.3m – compared with single-digit revenue increases for Whitbread’s hotels and restaurants divisions – buoyed by 332 new openings, more than half of which were in the UK.It overtook Starbucks as the biggest coffee chain in the UK by number of stores two years ago. However, it is international growth – and a strong presence in Asia – that has made it the crown jewel of Whitbread, analysts say.At present, coffee drinking in China remains low. Last year, the head of the Beijing Coffee Industry Association said China’s average coffee consumption was three cups a person a year, against a global average of 240 cups.But, since 2007, coffee shop sales in China have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 30 per cent, according to research by Mintel, boosted by young urbanites who view the drink as an aspirational product.Whitbread, which also has Costa stores in eastern Europe, the Middle East and India, says its Chinese business will break even this financial year.When Andy Harrison, Whitbread’s chief executive, appointed Mr Rogers, then the group’s finance director, to head the rapidly expanding coffee chain it stirred up analyst chatter of a demerger of Costa.Mr Rogers insists Costa will remain part of Whitbread, though.“We have no plans to go anywhere . . . we will stay part of Whitbread,” he says. “We benefit from Whitbread’s scale: we’re in 26 countries around the world.”And the benefit of Costa’s international trade is not all one way. Mr Rogers reveals that the jute coffee sacks used to transport Costa’s beans are returned – and recycled as carpet underlay in Whitbread’s Premier Inns.
444;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-10-15T17:09:41Z;Social media boosts YouGov;;Polling company YouGov has reaped the benefits from an increased focus on social media, reporting a jump in sales in its full-year results.YouGov’s new social media analysis tool, SoMA – which lets companies see what impact their brand has on Facebook and Twitter – played an important part in recent contract wins, according to Stephan Shakespeare, the group’s chief executive.New clients included ITV in the UK and Starbucks in the US, where revenues jumped 21 per cent to £19.2m, after the group overcame teething troubles following recent acquisitions. Across the group, revenues rose 4 per cent to £58.1m in the year to July 31.Revenues in YouGov’s core UK market rose 15 per cent to £15.7m, with operating margins remaining steady at 24 per cent. “We have a dominant brand here,” said Mr Shakespeare. But he added: “We have a long way to go to match that brand in terms of market research share.”Performance at the group’s struggling German division continued to improve, with a threefold jump in operating margin to 7 per cent.“It’s the first time that [Germany was] in line with expectations,” said Mr Shakespeare. “We have cut back on the unprofitable parts [and] we are now in the position of talking about growth.” Revenue in the division fell by almost a fifth to £9.4m, however, after YouGov disposed of one business and closed another.Mr Shakespeare said that the group will continue to focus on global expansion, with new markets in Brazil, Russia and China a priority.Any move into these markets will not necessarily involve a physical presence in the countries, according to the chief executive. “We don’t need a physical footprint to deliver data,” said Mr Shakespeare. “We’re talking here about upping our operational abilities, rather than some massive expansion.”YouGov already produces research in 30 countries.The group announced a dividend for the first time, paying out 0.5p per share. Earnings per share rose a third to 0.4p, while profit before tax across the group was flat at £0.4m.Shares in the group edged down 1.9 per cent to 77p on Monday.FT CommentYouGov has big plans. Its potential push into Brazilian, Chinese and Russian markets, coupled with its nifty social media tool, means that YouGov is well-positioned for future growth. Its shares, however, might struggle to keep up. These solid results cap off a successful year for the polling group, which has lifted its share price 75 per cent since January. Success has a price, however, and a full-year 2013 price/earnings ratio of 15.7 means YouGov no longer looks cheap, especially compared with French rival Ipsos, on a forward p/e of 11.
445;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Everyone wants a piece of the pie… or mooncake?;;When many people think of a mid-autumn festival, they immediately picture the moon or a mooncake. While most Chinese believe that the moon is at its most beautiful at this time of year, they will be unable to explain why the mooncake is of significance.Whether you enjoy eating this Chinese delicacy or not, it is a necessity for any mid-autumn festival.There are many myths and stories related to the festival, such as the moon goddess and her rabbit, as well as a peasant uprising against the Mongols in the 1200s. The true significance of the holiday is that it is a time for family reunion. The circular shape of the mooncake, compliments the holiday by representing family, unity and happiness.A traditional mooncake is filled with lotus paste (similar to peanut butter but the paste is instead made from lotus seeds) and one to four bright yellow, salt-preserved egg yolks (representing the moon).Mooncakes are a tradition that has been passed down through the generations – no questions asked.I’d like to share a few personal experiences and tid bits of knowledge to illustrate the mooncake industry further and the importance of the tradition:If we had to take a conservative guess as to the size of the mooncake industry, we estimate that there are 1.4bn people in China divided bysix people per household (grandparents, parents and child). Among the 230m households in China, we assume that only 40 per cent of households consume mooncakes. Of those households that consume mooncakes, we assume they consume on average one box of mooncakes which costs 100RMB ($13). Taking these rough and conservative estimates into account, we arrive at the conclusion that the mooncake industry in China is worth $1.5bn.The mooncake has become synonymous with the mid-autumn festival and because of its favourable meaning many businesses take advantage of the festival and its mooncakes to build good will with their valued customers.Demand for these Chinese pastries is so high that aside from traditional bakeries, luxury hotels and restaurants, Starbucks, Dairy Queen, Haagen-Dazs, Dunkin Donuts, Godiva, Nokia and even Christian Dior have their own mooncake labels.However, mooncakes are known to be high in sugar content and in cholesterol. Consuming a single mooncake will cost your body 800 calories. Therefore, while the trend remains to give mooncakes during the festival, more and more people are giving up eating mooncakes for health and fitness reasons.When such an important tradition and industry are at stake, many alternatives will arise. I am pleased to inform you that many Chinese jewellery stores now offer solid gold and silver collectable mooncakes in their product lines… and of course they are all sold out the instant they hit the market!
446;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-10-05T15:58:10Z;Mideast poses ad minefield for westerners;;Ikea’s widely criticised airbrushing women out of the Saudi Arabian edition of its furniture catalogue is the latest in a cascade of cultural controversies and missteps involving western brands in the Middle East.Big consumer-goods companies from Samsung to Starbucks have struggled to strike the right tone in the region, where a single social or religious faux pas can sabotage access to a retail market worth hundreds of billions of dollars.As the political upheaval sweeping the Middle East makes foreign companies’ task harder still, many are struggling to balance the need to follow local norms with the risk of provoking criticism back home for kowtowing to oppressive practices.“It’s an extremely difficult position for a global brand to be in,” says Adil Khan, regional chief executive of advertising group Saatchi & Saatchi in Dubai. “On the one hand they have their value system as a global brand, but then on the other they have to be aware of local market sensitivities.”The airbrushing out of women from several images in Ikea’s Saudi catalogue has drawn scorn from around the world, including ministers in its egalitarian home nation of Sweden. The country’s trade minister, Ewa Björling, complained: “You can’t remove or airbrush women from reality.”Inter Ikea Systems, which runs the global franchise network of Ikea stores, said that it took “full responsibility for the mistakes made”. It expressed regret and said that it was reviewing its processes, as did Ikea Group, another company in the complicated Ikea structure that produces the catalogues.Ikea is one of many companies to have adapted its marketing to suit local tastes, a step that regional advertising executives say was in some cases probably overzealous.But with no formal government guidelines, international companies rely on local partners to avoid cultural sensitivities that vary dramatically across the Middle East. And given the room for confusion between the most conservative attitudes in Saudi Arabia and the most liberal in Lebanon, companies are unwilling to take risks.The Middle East has seen its fair share of contentious advertising campaigns – although the publicity has not always turned out badly for retailers, writes Camilla Hall in Dubai.● A Coca-Cola advertisement riled the religious establishment in Saudi Arabia in 2002 because of its focus on a young man and woman flirting over a Coke bottle. The same year, Coke released another ad where a young man writes his number in the condensation of the bottle and passes it to the woman. The company has faced such complications in the Middle East due to a decades-long political boycott that is has a dedicated part of its website to tackle Middle East rumours.● In 2006 Wonderbra launched an ad playing on a concept of censorship in the Middle East where a model in her underwear had black marker pen scrawled across her chest. The campaign ruffled feathers in the United Arab Emirates but received wide attention that may have provided a boost for the brand.● Burger King promotional videos were posted online in 2010 playing on stereotypes of two American women and two young Gulf men. “Y’all must be loaded,” one girl says. One of the men replies in broken English: “We have oil wells in our back yard OK and once a week businessmen come to us and we pump the oil by hand.” A prominent Saudi blogger wrote at the time: “Although the commercial is not offending – not to me, anyway – I don’t think Saudis should be thrilled about it. The TV ad simply reinforces some of the most negative stereotypes about us.”● One executive told of a bizarre instance in Saudi Arabia, in which billboards of La Vache qui Rit soft cheese were torn down after people took offence to the cow’s earrings, which were made of the triangular cheese.“When you don’t really understand you can kind of overdo it” in terms of self-censorship, says Dani Richa, chairman and chief executive of advertising company Impact BBDO Group, part of Omnicom, in Dubai. “But if a market is important enough for you to make an investment it’s important enough to do something specific for that market.”Advertising executives in the region identify the obvious cultural minefields as pork, alcohol, tobacco, sex, religion, politics, gambling and poking fun at the local population.Other sensitivities include consuming food or drink with the wrong hand and certain hyperbolic words which, in Arabic, are used only for religious purposes. When it comes to Saudi Arabia, the list is stricter, with women’s faces off limits and the approach to baring skin more delicate, says Tarek Miknas, chief executive of Fortune Promoseven, L’Oréal’s agency in the region.Some of the biggest international brands have chosen to adapt to secure a foothold in Saudi Arabia, where Booz & Co estimates the local retail market at $84.8bn. When Starbucks opened its doors in the kingdom, which practices a conservative form of Sunni Islam, the US coffee chain suffered a backlash for changing its green female mermaid logo to one with a crown in the water.But over time, the company has fully penetrated the market, with stores in Saudi Arabia’s biggest cities as well as in some of Islam’s holiest cities such as Mecca and Medina.While cultural sensitivities prompt companies to take advice across the region, Saudi Arabia is the most problematic.“A lot [of companies] just gave up using pictures of humans, you tend to just get pictures of products with a slushy slogan,” said one Riyadh resident of the billboards across the city. “They pixelate the pictures of humans so you can tell it’s a human being holding a drink but it’s blurred.”Alongside Starbucks, other food and beverage chains such as McDonald's and Burger King have adhered to Saudi Arabia’s strict gender separation rules. Family sections for married couples and women are divided from a section for single men. Religious police, known as the Mutawwa in Arabic or the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, stake out restaurants and malls, approaching anyone they suspect to be breaking the norms on segregation.An advertising agency created an advert in 2009 for Samsung, without its permission, in which Jesus Christ was shown taking photos of a group of nuns. The South Korean company was forced to deny that it commissioned the ad after Christians in Lebanon rallied against the work.But, with the risks associated with getting it wrong well known, most companies are trying to be as careful as possible, says Kamal Dimachkie, executive regional managing director of Leo Burnett, the advertising agency, in Dubai.“Brands are like people, they’re capable of making gaffes,” says Mr Dimachkie. “But they will err on the side of caution rather than take any unwarranted risk with their expression.”Additional reporting by Richard Milne

448;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Starbucks suffers delay in India rollout;;Starbucks is suffering delays in its plans to roll out dozens of stores in India, a blow to the coffee retailer’s drive to reduce reliance on its US base through aggressive expansion in emerging markets.In January, the company announced an $80m, 50-50 joint venture with India’s Tata conglomerate, and suggested the partners could launch as many as 50 stores in India by the end of 2012, with the first in September.Starbucks is seeking to open 400 new stores in Asia, including 200 in China, this year, as a counterweight to sluggish sales in Europe.However, the coffee retailer said on Friday that India’s first Starbucks, set for a heritage building in Mumbai, would not open until the end of October, while New Delhi store openings would be delayed until early 2013.“It’s not so much about the number of stores that we open”, John Culver, president of Starbucks in China and the Asia-Pacific region, told reporters in Mumbai. “With the population of over 1bn here, and with the emergence of a coffee house culture, we see this as a very big market over the long term.”In spite of the delay, Mr Culver insisted Starbucks remained on course in India’s nascent $200m coffee market, which is growing about 25 per cent a year.While India’s coffee house culture is still in the early stages, Starbucks already faces a tough local competitor in Café Coffee Day, which is partly owned by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and has more than 1,300 outlets across the country.Raghav Gupta, a principal at Booz & Co, said Starbucks would appeal to a more affluent clientele than the price-sensitive local chain.“The Starbucks customer is going to be different from the CCD core customer, who is a college-going kid who does not want to spend more than Rs75 sitting on a date for two hours,” Mr Gupta said. “The Starbucks customer is going to be a young professional who is happy to spend Rs150-Rs200.”But CCD, run by entrepreneur V.G. Siddhartha, who cites Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz as his inspiration, will make life tough for the US-based chain, simply because he has managed to site his stores in the most prime locations in a country with a severe shortage of attractive commercial real estate.Starbucks offered no explanation for the delays but Mr Gupta said the company could be facing “operational issues” in terms of supply chain and permissions.The delays suggest Starbucks will face difficulties trying to repeat in India the aggressive rollout it managed in China, where it has opened more than 600 stores since 1999.India’s first Starbucks will open in a restored colonial-era building already owned by the Tata group in the prestigious Horniman Circle, and will offer a food menu adapted to local tastes.“It is blending a lot of local flavours, and some of the items you see will really surprise the local consumers,” Avani Davda, the CEO of the joint venture, said. “It is an elaborate menu, with one unique dish in each local area.”
449;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:08:53+0000;Facebook gift service to sell real goods;;Facebook has launched a gift service that allows users to send real stuffed animals and cupcakes to friends, pushing the social network on to Amazon’s online retail territory as it ramps up its search for new income streams.Facebook has established varying revenue-sharing agreements with each of the retailers it is partnering with to sell the gifts, including Starbucks.The new service marks the social network’s first official foray into dealing in physical goods. Until now it has restricted its commerce activities to gaming and digital goods such as music and movies.The commerce strategy was announced on the same day that privacy advocates asked US regulators to investigate how Facebook is using data about users’ retail purchases to improve its advertising products.The Center for Digital Democracy and the Electronic Privacy Information Center sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission, calling on it investigate whether Facebook’s data-sharing agreement with Datalogix, which tracks purchases through loyalty cards, violates the settlement agreement the FTC struck with the social network over its privacy practices.“Facebook asserts that the shared information is hashed and thus anonymous. But the commission has stated that ‘hashing is vastly overrated as an “anonymisation” technique’,” the letter said. “It is critical that the FTC police the adequacy of these practices.”Weaving Facebook’s social data, like the regular reminders it sends to users about friends’ birthdays, into the commerce experience combined with the knowledge of preferences expressed through “likes” could give the social network a competitive edge if it manages to build the gift service significantly.“It’s this all-in-one experience that’s just a few clicks,” said Jed Williams, an analyst with BIA/Kelsey. “That potentially is disruptive and very compelling because of how efficient it is. Amazon has built its kingdom on efficiency.”Facebook cannot compete against Amazon’s shipping and distribution infrastructure. It is also missing one crucial element of user data to make the service work: peoples’ physical addresses.When users order a gift, a Facebook message gets sent to the friend, asking them to fill in their physical address.Facebook launched the service on Thursday with a handful of products, including cupcakes and Starbucks gift cards, but it has plans to expand to a range of goods including chocolates, socks, miniature dinosaurs and even ice cream.In the past, Facebook offered a service that charged users to send virtual cakes or cards to friends on their birthdays or special events but it discontinued that several years ago.“Real friends. Real gifts,” is the tagline it is using to promote the new feature.The service is enabled by technology that Facebook acquired when it bought Karma, a social gifting start-up, on the same day as its initial public offering in May.

I am in my second year at the Guanghua School of Management. I live off campus in Zhongguancun, China’s answer to Silicon Valley, which is located a short 15 minute walk from the campus within Peking University. On my walk to school, I pass the headquarters of Sina (home to China’s Twitter), New Oriental (NYSE listed Chinese educational company) and Microsoft. But what I look forward to most of all is passing the street vendors who sell a variety of Chinese breakfast foods.I follow the scent of sizzling meat and eggs over to a vendor selling a variety of “jian bing” (Chinese pita bread) at a cost of Y4 or 75 US cents. I suddenly realise how much I’ve missed the affordability of food in Beijing. Located conveniently next to the vendor is a Starbucks. I make a quick stop and it costs me Y35.First things first: I arrive at school and I already have my week’s worth of work cut out for me:Summer flashback:One week ago – I was in New York City, attending my god sister’s wedding, visiting family and friends as well as catching up with ex-colleagues.Two weeks ago – I was in Barcelona, absorbing the cultural sights dominated by Gaudi architecture and sampling the endless variety of Catalan tapas and other culinary delicacies.Three to 11 weeks ago – I was in Hong Kong, wrapping up my eight-week internship with the human resources department for Morgan Stanley in Asia.

451;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-09-24T14:42:30Z;Traders rethink single-serve coffee boost;;For the past few years, George Clooney has been the patron saint of the coffee industry.The popularity of Nespresso, which the Hollywood actor promotes, and other single-cup premium coffee brands has powered growth in the hot drinks market, and the invention of the capsule has helped boost the profitability of companies such as Nestlé, the world’s largest food company.Yet, even as Starbucks becomes the latest to move into the coffee capsule market, soft commodities traders and investors are no longer enthusing about single-serve: they have calculated that the boom might not deliver the uplift in prices they had hoped for. The growing consensus among industry experts is that the expansion of single-serve technology will, in fact, hurt demand for beans, possibly damping prices as greater efficiency means less coffee usage.In the past, only a few cups were drunk out of a whole pot of coffee, but single-cup capsules have almost eliminated wastage.“A lot of coffee used to be consumed by the sink,” jokes Paul Fisher, an industry veteran who runs consultancy Fisher Waterhouse in New York. Experts believe single-serve capsules and pods could cut demand for the high quality arabica coffee beans loved by espresso afficionados, by as much as 5 per cent.The changing demand patterns, thanks to new brewing technology, is compounding the impact of the economic crisis on coffee drinking in developed countries such as Italy, the country that popularised the espresso.Coffee consumption per capita in Switzerland, one of the countries in which Nespresso is more popular, last year totalled 8.2 kilograms, down 11 per cent from 9.2kg in 2008, according to the London-based International Coffee Organization, a body that groups producing and consuming nations.The wholesale price of arabica coffee beans in New York, the market benchmark, has fallen more than 40 per cent in the past year to $1.75 per pound. The drop is a far cry from 2011, when arabica coffee prices hit a 34-year high in March last year of $3.089 amid fears of a shortage. Since then, higher supply and weaker demand have driven down the market.The industry had expected a boost to arabica prices from the single-cup revolution because the capsules and pods tend to use the highest quality coffee.Still, the coffee market is hoping that after an initial decline, the single capsules could boost demand as they are expected to bring in new consumers drawn to the convenience. In Europe capsule sales are growing strongly. In Germany, for example, coffee consumed via capsules has been growing more than 30 per cent a year for the past five years.Kona Haque, agricultural commodities analyst at Macquarie in London, says: “In the short term it’s negative but single serve coffee sales are rising sharply, which is positive in the long term.”Other technological developments point to less bean usage. For example, “brewing optimisation” has allowed consumers to get the same number of cups of coffee sold in Spain from Dutch coffee roaster Douwe Egberts’ coffee packs, even if the size of the pack has shrunk from 250g to 200g.The changes in demand are forcing traders, analysts and executives to rethink how they analyse the market. Traditionally, coffee prices have been dictated by supply analysis – production increases and decreases and the “shocks” caused by adverse weather or disease. Demand was seen rising steadily in line with population and income growth.Keith Flury, commodities analyst at Rabobank in London, says that supply factors are still very important, but “demand has started to shift prices” too.The drop in arabica coffee consumption due to the arrival of the single-cup technology is one such demand-side factor. Another is the shift from the high quality bean arabica to the lower quality counterpart robusta, which is used in cheaper blends and instant coffee.The fall in disposable incomes in the west due to the effects of the financial crisis and the rise of coffee drinking, and especially instant granules, in developing countries has lifted robusta demand and the price.Macquarie calculates that about 5m-7m bags have shifted from arabica to robusta over the past season, or about 4 to 5 per cent of the world’s total coffee production of about 132m bags. As demand has shifted, so has the price difference between robusta and the more expensive arabica, which has collapsed from $1.90 per pound last year to as low as 55 cents in 2012.Robusta prices have rallied this year, and are more than 20 per cent higher from this year’s low in January. Ms Haque says the market has woken up and smelt the demand for robusta. “It’s not just anecdotal, we now have the stats to underline the trend,” she says.
452;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-09-20T04:01:16Z;Coffee capsule wars to heat up;;The coffee capsule wars are set to heat up on Thursday when Starbucks, the US coffee chain, rolls out its inaugural machines to compete head-on with Nestlé’s Nespressos.Coffee capsules are a rare bright spot in the global food and drink industry.By apeing the business model of printers and razors, manufacturers hope owners of the machines will become captive buyers, tied into buying their premium-priced single serve coffee pods.However, that and estimated profit margins of 20-30 per cent have attracted a host of imitators.The 50 or so systems now available have left Nestlé staunchly defending its turf, enlisting actor George Clooney to front its ad campaign while teams of patent lawyers take action against copycats.Starbucks’ Verismo machines, making espresso-based coffee drinks such as lattes, will initially go on sale in the US, Canada, France, Germany, Austria and the UK.The chain already sells its own capsule coffee in the US, where it sold 100m of its K-cup packs within two months of launch in November last year.“This is one of our biggest bets in the coming year,” said Michelle Gass, president of Starbucks for Europe, Middle East and Africa.“We are putting lots of resources behind it for the launch.” The so-called premium single serve market grew 143 per cent last year, she added.The machines, made by Germany’s Krüger, will go on sale in the UK for £149 and €149 in Europe. In the US they will sell at $199. The pods will sell at £5.99, €4.99 and $11.95 for a pack of 12.Yet while the market for coffee capsules, worth $6.6bn in retail value according to data agency Euromonitor, continues to grow faster than beans, grinds and instant, there are signs the froth may be coming off.Green Mountain Coffee Roasters of the US, which sells the single cup brewers that use – among others – Starbucks’ coffee capsules, has seen growth decelerate sharply in the past year. In the third quarter, net sales increased 21 per cent year-on-year compared with a 64 per cent jump over the same period in 2010.Green Mountain’s shares, which have been on a declining trajectory, were hit last autumn when Starbucks first announced plans to launch the Verismo machine. The Keurig-branded devices made by Green Mountain are low pressure that produce only brewed coffee.Ms Gass said Starbucks had been examining the market for several years, searching for the right partner and technology. Unusually, the capsules can contain milk – which rehydrates in the pod, thus creating what Ms Gass called a natural taste and allowing owners to make a whole range of coffees in the home.The machines will be rolled out across other markets in Europe after the initial launch. “We have been keeping our partner Krüger busy,” said Ms Gass.
453;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-09-19T18:11:47Z;Smartphones have not yet digested payments;Apple’s view is that consumers still prefer to pay with cards or cash;Are smartphones about to swallow the payments business? Two events this week have given sharply contradictory answers.The first was the $3.25bn valuation put on Square, a Silicon Valley payments start-up, by the company’s latest round of fundraising. This represents a huge bet, given that Square is a business with annualised revenues of only about $200m that is battling with the giants of the banking, retail and mobile industries.A very different message is given in the design of Apple’s Passbook, launched on Wednesday. A new feature in the latest version of the iOS mobile operating system, Passbook has many of the features of what has come to be known as a ‘digital wallet’: you can use it to store virtual loyalty cards, discount coupons, gift cards, tickets – many of the things, in fact, that clutter up physical wallets.The main functionality missing from Apple’s phone, however, is a way to make a payment. While Google plunged into this business some time ago with its own mobile payment service, Apple’s bet is that consumers still prefer to pay with a card or hard cash.In one sense, Apple and Square are not as far apart as they may seem. Both are aiming at the same outcome: helping merchants forge closer relationships with their customers, up to and including facilitating actual transactions. But, as always with new technologies that rely on sweeping changes in consumer behaviour before they can reach their full potential, getting the timing right is everything.To see Square as purely a payments company would be a mistake. At the current rate, it is handling $8bn of payments a year – not a bad start, although barely a pinprick in the greater scheme of things. It would be a foolhardy strategy to compete head-on against giants of the payments industry, which reap small margins on massive volumes of transactions. But the fact that Visa is a shareholder in Square is an indication that their businesses are complimentary, not competitive. Square pays a large slice of the fees it levies on payments over to the credit card companies.In fact, payment is the wedge that Square is using to pry open a bigger market. It gets a foot in the door with the small merchants who are its main customers by making it easy to collect credit card payments, Its deeper appeal, though, rests on the data and analytical tools it gives them to understand their customers better. Its smartphone app also acts as a digital wallet, giving merchants a way to tie in customers through loyalty programmes, discounts and special offers.Digital wallets, in fact, could eventually supply one of the main answers to the conundrum facing the internet and media industries as their users switch en masse to mobile: how to make money in a medium where traditional forms of advertising don’t work?Eventually, with a wealth of information about actual purchases, married to the data collected from its mobile app, Square may be in a position to direct highly targeted advertising and offers to its users.Others see the same potential to use mobile payments as a way of creating closer relationships between merchants and consumers, all the way to stimulating transactions. Eventbrite, an online ticket marketplace, has added a payment system to let its customers make sales, creating a mobile box office to round out its service.Apple’s bet with Passbook, meanwhile, is that there is much that can be done with mobile apps to draw consumers and merchants closer to a transaction, but handling an actual payment is not yet part of the mix.Technology standards are still in flux and surveys point to high levels of consumer concern about the privacy and security risks from making a payment simply by waving a smartphone.There is also the payment industry’s unavoidable chicken-and-egg problem: how to get customers to try out a payment system that most merchants have yet to adopt, and vice versa. This is the biggest single problem faced by Square, whose payment app is designed to let a consumer make a purchase in a store without even pulling out a phone. The company scored a coup last month when it secured a deal with – and investment from – Starbucks. But Starbucks will not be enabling the full Square payment experience in its stores.Not that Apple is sitting on its hands. In an EasyPay experiment earlier this year, it began letting visitors to its stores buy by phone: first download an app, then point your iPhone’s camera at the bar code and just walk out with your purchase. As with many other aspects of the retail business, the Apple Store could be the place to go for a real glimpse of the future.Richard Waters is the FT’s West Coast managing editor
454;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-09-18T22:38:20Z;Square – upwardly mobile;Ambitious payments service hampered by high fees and big tech rivals;Howard Schultz, Starbucks’ boss, has called mobile payments “the fastest growing opportunity we’ve ever seen in terms of customer acceptance”. That explains why the coffee shop chain is investing in Square, the company led by Jack Dorsey (the co-founder of Twitter) that aims to become the default “wallet” service for mobile payments. The latest round of financing, to which Starbucks contributed, shows how high expectations for the business have become. The fundraising – $200m – values Square at $3.25bn.Various companies play roles in the payment processing chain. Square makes a plastic card reader that enables the start of the process to occur over smartphones and iPads as well as software for initiating payments with the wave of a phone. Charging a 2.75 per cent transaction fee, Square claims to be processing $8bn in payments on an annualised basis. To put that in context, Visa processed nearly $4tn of payments in the last year.If Square can drive its volumes to say, 1 per cent of Visa’s level, or $40bn five years from now, it would make $1bn in annual revenue. Visa-like margins of 60 per cent would mean net profit of some $225m, suggesting that the latest investors paid a reasonable 14 times future earnings. But that is unlikely. The majority of the 2.75 per cent fee goes straight back to credit card companies. Unless the business has extraordinarily low operating and marketing costs, it is hard to see how Square makes much money, even when it is processing five times today’s volumes.Clearly, Square needs to achieve enough scale to negotiate better terms with credit card companies. And, with companies including Google and PayPal mobilising with their own wallets, competition on share and fees will be fierce. Like all big opportunities, it will attract big opportunists.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
455;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;‘Mobile wallet’ company valued at $3bn;;A technology company racing to become the default “wallet” on mobile devices has been valued $3.25bn in its latest fundraising, confirming its status as one of Silicon Valley’s hottest start-ups.Square, a San Francisco mobile payments company started and led by Jack Dorsey, the co-founder of Twitter, has raised $200m in new funding, said people familiar with the deal.The company will use the money to focus on international expansion as it seeks to secure its technology as the default “mobile wallet”, facing fierce competition from large global companies which are also searching for ways to turn consumers’ smartphones into all-purpose payment systems.Square now processes $8bn in payments annually, compared with $1bn one year ago. Its workforce has grown to more than 400 employees, up from 150 last year.The company was founded in 2009 after an artist friend of Mr Dorsey’s complained of losing a $3,000 sale because he could not accept a credit card. Square’s original product is a one-inch square plastic credit card reader that plugs into the jack of an iPhone or Android phone. Square provides the reader for free, then charges a 2.75 per cent transaction fee.Small business owners and sole entrepreneurs, from hairdressers to therapists to dog walkers, have adopted the technology. Both US presidential candidates are using it at rallies to capture election donations on the spot, rather than waiting to solicit supporters via email at a later date. Friends in California even use it socially to settle bills at restaurants and pubs.Square has since developed a payment system for small retailers that uses an iPad in place of a cash register to process payments directly via customers’ cell phones.The current financing round was led by an unconventional group of investors: Citi Ventures, and arm of the global financial services company, Rizvi Traverse Management, a private equity firm, and Starbucks.In August, Starbucks began replacing all of the credit and debit transaction systems in its 7,000 US coffee shops with Square’s technology, a landmark deal for the start-up.One of Square’s biggest competitors is PayPal, the payment arm of ecommerce site eBay. PayPal released its triangular plug-in credit card reader this year and signed a deal with Discover, giving 7m merchants that accept that credit card ability to also accept PayPal payments.The latest round brings Square’s total fundraising to $341m. Previous investors have included Sequoia Capital and Visa, which made a combined $27.5m investment. Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Tiger Technology Global Management invested $100m last year, along with $3m from Sir Richard Branson.

Both Walmart and Starbucks in the US, for example, recently announced mobile wallet plans.Visa and Samsung, meanwhile, showcased technology at the London Olympic Games, which allowed customers to pay for food and goods with mobile phones.Juniper Research predicts that mobile payments could reach $1.7tn by 2017 – or about 4 per cent of all global retail transactions.“A lot of start-ups in these areas, such as Square, are making a lot of noise. But people don’t know that we are already providing security for more than 800m customers on our platforms,” Mr Piou said.Gemalto provides security software for Barclays’ mobile and online banking services in the UK. It also provides security for Chase, one of the big four US banks, and América Móvil, one of Latin America’s biggest mobile operators.“Our products are in most consumers’ pockets in one way or another,” said Mr Piou.Gemalto, which has a market valuation of more than €5.2bn, was previously known as a maker of Sim cards, but has diversified over the past few years to provide security software for other uses.This year, for example, the company won a contract with the UK’s Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency to provide the next generation of digitised drivers’ licences.Revenues were up 7 per cent at €1.016bn, while pre-tax profits rose 17.5 per cent to €107.5m. Earnings per share were €1.09.Shares in Gemalto, which have nearly doubled in value over the past year, rose a further 6.6 per cent to €63.37 in early afternoon trading.
457;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-08-24T16:48:15Z;US set to trump European growth;Nick Louth shifts his focus away from troubled eurozone;In last month’s column I outlined how I was trying to insulate my portfolio from eurozone woes. I have continued that process by a gradual shift towards US growth stocks and away from those with a European bias. Though the full ramifications of a eurozone disaster are hard to predict in detail, I expect that they will provide the impetus for some fundamental changes in the way the world does business, particularly in banking.We are already seeing governments question the role of banks, and encourage building societies and non-banks to get more involved in oiling the wheels of the economy. Peer-to-peer lenders are becoming more established.One of the most promising areas is in transactions via smartphone, one which I expect to take off faster in both North America and Asia than in Europe. Walmart and Starbucks both recently announced moves to make it easier to pay by phone, a process that could eventually see fewer people use cash.In one sense I am already riding this trend, with a very profitable holding in Apple, which has shaken off the disappointment of recording a mere 20 per cent rise in annual earnings per share (EPS) in its last quarterly results in July. The shares have now climbed to an all-time high, up 60 per cent this year, but still only trading at 10 times its fiscal 2012 forecasts, net of the $117bn cash on the balance sheet.Apple is now over 15 per cent of my portfolio, the highest I’ve ever had in a single company. Out of natural caution I’m reluctant to add to it. However, another US company seems even better placed to ride the rise of the smartphone transaction, and that is PayPal. Already established as the default method of e-commerce payment, PayPal expects mobile phone payments to rise from $4bn last year to $10bn this.PayPal is owned by eBay, a huge and profitable business in its own right. I have owned a tiny stake in eBay for a while, but have recently added to that. The shares are up 67 per cent this year, and trade at 17 times this year’s analysts’ EPS estimates. However, seeing annual earnings have risen by an average of 25 per cent over the past five years, that isn’t much of a growth premium.Already established as the default method of e-commerce payment, PayPal expects mobile phone payments to rise from $4bn last year to $10bn thisI have also been looking for another US company, with a simple-to- understand business rollout which offers the same benefits as Domino’s Pizza UK, one of my most profitable holdings. The obvious choice would be Domino’s US parent, but that is now such a mature company that its growth metrics aren’t particularly exciting.What I am looking for is established growth, customer excitement, but only a modest national coverage across the US. As Domino’s has demonstrated here, growth based on continually adding new stores has powerful economies of scale for distribution, margins and cash generation. It is a much more powerful driver to EPS than same-store sales, which are subject to the vagaries of the economy and have finite limits.One company I am considering is Panera Bread, a café/restaurant in which freshly-baked artisan bread is the unique selling point. Panera is notching up 25-30 per cent annual EPS rises, and trades at 27 times earnings. Initial investors from the 2007 IPO would have made a 260 per cent return in five years. Now, this is clearly a more expensive firm than eBay, and it operates in a crowded marketplace, but I may yet be tempted.Nick Louth is an active private investor, writing about his own investments.

458;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-08-24T15:02:15Z;Female MBA students score low on ethics test;;When Roger Steare, corporate philosopher in residence at Cass Business School in the UK, analysed results from female MBA students worldwide who had taken his MoralDNA personality test, he expected them to score highly on questions regarding care for others. The test is designed to reveal people’s moral values and the way they prefer to make decisions about what is right. However, female MBA students scored statistically lower than women in other professions. The MBA participants also scored statistically lower on questions regarding their obedience of others, in comparison to their counterparts.“The one that’s most surprising is the [first one] as generally women score higher than average on issues of care,” he says. “The ethics of obedience results is not such a surprise as leaders in business tend to be less likely to be compliant.” And this is not necessarily a negative result, he adds. For the last 50 years, there has been a lot of work done on theories about people’s need to conform with others, using past dictatorships to show how wrong this approach can be.But with regards to the ethics of care, Prof Steare believes the lack of consideration among female MBA students has to change. “To run a business, you have to be customer-centric and care about the colleagues and environment you are operating in,” he says. “Some people think you can’t have a successful business and care about others but that’s not true…Research shows that a high level of care does create success in the long run.” He cites companies listed in a study called Firms of Endearment as good examples of this: Starbucks, the coffee chain, Patagonia, the clothing company and BMW, the car manufacturer.Despite his concern, Prof Steare can see how these results may have transpired. Ultimately, he blames business schools for not giving enough importance to ethical considerations. “Schools aren’t doing enough to prepare business leaders to make decisions with empathy as well as logic,” he says. “[They] need to spend more time on anthropology…Success is not just about profit and loss accounts.”His view is reinforced by the results from male MBA students who also score statistically lower on ethics of care and obedience - even lower than female MBA participants in fact.The MoralDNA test was co-designed by Roger Steare and Pavlos Stamboulides. So far more than 80,000 people from over 200 countries have participated.
459;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-08-17T15:35:15Z;Mobile payments – wallet wars;US retailers enter the ruthless winner-takes-all market;"Retail is a ruthless business. So if staunch competitors such as Walmart and Target are banding together, it is worth noting. Along with more than a dozen other merchants, they have teamed up on a mobile wallet service. This is the latest move in the global shift towards paying for purchases with mobile devices instead of plastic cards or cash. Mobile transactions will rise to $600bn by 2016 from $172bn now, Gartner estimates.The land grab has already attracted Google, which offers a service called “Wallet,” as well as mobile providers AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile, which back a venture called Isis. Last week, Starbucks announced a partnership with Square, a mobile payments start-up, and this week Dunkin’ Donuts launched its own mobile pay app.Walmart and the like claim they are in the best position to get a wallet service going. They know better than anyone else what their customers already buy – and they want to keep that advantage. No merchant wants to lose control of information about its customers’ spending patterns. Google, for example, plans to use Wallet as a platform for special offers and coupons – that is, advertising. The retailers like that idea, but would rather not share the proceeds.Then there are costs. Might having their own application help merchants dodge some of the tolls embedded in payment processing?It is hard to predict which service will dominate; the battle lines are not yet fully drawn. But it has all the markings of a winner-take-all market. The simplest, safest, most widely accepted application will attract the lion’s share of users. Apple’s proposed acquisition of AuthenTec, which makes fingerprint sensors, potentially paves the way to using iPhones as mobile wallets. Even in its infancy, mobile payments are looking ruthlessly competitive.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
460;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-08-17T14:54:10Z;More companies join mobile payments rush;Household names get behind smartphone projects;"With Wal-Mart and Starbucks both announcing plans in the past week to make it easier for customers to pay using smartphones, the mobile payments market is finally moving into the mainstream.The bold prediction by PayPal that by 2016 people would no longer need to take their traditional leather wallet with them on shopping excursions seems less futuristic as big household names get behind mobile wallet projects.It is not just retailers who are looking to claim the increasingly crowded market for mobile payments. Google Wallet launched in the US last year, while three of the big US telecoms operators, Verizon, T-Mobile USA and AT&T are developing a service known as Isis.Elsewhere, Ebay’s PayPal unit, has also launched an app that allows users to pay for items with their mobile phones across a number of stores in the UK and Barclays has launched Pingit, a mobile-to-mobile money transfer service earlier this year.The Mobile Money Network has a payment app that can be used in stores such as Carphone Warehouse, Thorntons and HMV and the UK’s biggest operators are planning their own wallet service, nicknamed Project Oscar.Visa has also invested heavily in mobile payments services and predicts that by 2020 over half of all the payments it processes will come from mobiles.The danger is that consumers will be left confused by these competing offerings and stick to more familiar options such as credit and debit cards, or cash.“The market won’t sustain more than a a few of these services and so there will have to be a big shakeout,” says Steve Ledford, partner at Novantas, the US-based management consulting company.“It is a safe bet that nine out of 10 of these will fail. The more difficult thing is knowing which ones,” he said.One of the reasons for so many different offerings for mobile payments is that a number of factions are vying to control the mobile customer relationship. Banks do not want to lose their role as a primary handler of payments. The mobile operators want to make money from their close relationship with mobile handset owners, and retailers want to avoid being charged heavy fees for using a new payment mechanism.When Wal-Mart and its peers announced they are building their own mobile payment system, they said part of the reason for doing so was “eliminating unnecessary costs to all stakeholders”.All of them would like access to the details about consumers’ shopping habits that can be gleaned by monitoring mobile payments – what are people buying, where and at what time.The danger, say some industry analysts, is that the proliferation of competing and incompatible mobile payment systems will confuse consumers. Significantly the US-based Electronic Transactions Association formed a Mobile Payments Committee last week in a effort to oordinate the wide range of mobile payment inititives underway, establish standards and prevent fragmentation in an effort to c.The committee consists of the big four US mobile operators, Verizon, whose Federal Relations Director chairs the group; AT&T; T-Mobile USA; and Sprint which partnered with Google to launch the Google Wallet using NFC (near field communications) technology.Among the others involved in the initiative are Google, Wells Fargo, Paypal, and Isis. Credit card companies,including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and Capitol One, have also signed on.“All the three main parties – banks, retailers and mobile operators – are all having a go at this. There is now an initiative from all of them,” said Fred Huet, analyst at Greenwich Consulting.It is still hard to tell whether any of the mobile wallet services are gaining real traction, with scant data available publicly. Visa, which was looking to showcase contactless payments at the London Olympics said about 15 per cent of all payments under £20 were made using a contactless card or mobile phone.However, an IT failure that prevented tills at Wembley Stadium from taking Visa credit or debit card payments during one of the Olympics matches may have undermined Visa’s attempts to showcase the new technology during the games.PayPal, meanwhile, said it was expecting to process $10bn in payments made on mobile devices this year, up from $4bn last year.However, overall, usage levels are still low. Starbucks has seen perhaps one of the biggest successes in this area, with more than 1m people a week using Starbucks’ mobile application to pay for their coffees. But this is still less than 2 per cent of the over 60m weekly transactions at the coffee shop chain.“We haven’t seen any of the wallets really take off yet. Someone getting a little bit of traction can can go a long way at this point,” said Hank Israel, partner at Novantas.Clunky customer service and difficulties setting up mobile payments accounts are turning many customers off, says Mr Huet. “Barclays Pingit is a good idea, for example, but installing it is too complicated and has stopped people adopting it,” he says.Nevertheless, if those involved in developing mobile payments can strike the right balance and develop services that consumers find convenient and easy, and above all else is secure, the potential is enormous. Juniper Research predicts that mobile payments could reach $1,700bn by 2017 - or about 4 per cent of all global retail transactions."
461;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:08:53+0000;Large US retailers to create mobile wallet;;A group of the largest US retailers, including Walmart, Target and Best Buy, on Wednesday announced plans to create a joint mobile wallet service, adding yet another competitor to the already crowded market for mobile phone payment services.Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX), the joint company formed by more than a dozen retailers, will compete with initiatives such as Google Wallet and Isis, which is backed by mobile operators AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile. Last week Starbucks also announced a partnership with mobile payment start-up Square.Mobile phone operators, retailers, banks and technology companies are all competing to run mobile phone payment services, which each group keen to be the one to control the direct relationship to the customer. Retailers are also concerned they will be stung by hefty transaction fees if another group, such as banks or mobile operators, controls the payment network.“MCX will leverage mobile technology to give consumers a faster and more convenient shopping experience while eliminating unnecessary costs for all stakeholders,” said Mike Cook, corporate vice-president at Walmart.Gartner, the research company expects the number of mobile transactions to increase to $600bn by 2016, up from $172bn this year. Yet the multiple different wallet services risk leaving consumers confused.The Merchant Customer Exchange is a rare collaboration between the Walmart, Target and Best Buy. No launch date was given for the service and the company has yet to hire a chief executive, but development of the mobile application is under way. The application will be available to virtually any smartphone. There was no detail on what payment technology the system would use.Like many of its competitors, MCX will combine payment services with customised offers delivered to users through their smartphone.
462;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-08-08T17:10:13Z;Starbucks brings Square to the mainstream;;Square, the mobile payments start-up, took a big step towards the mainstream when Starbucks announced it would use its smartphone technology and other services to replace transaction systems in its US coffee shops.As mobile devices assume a more central role in consumers’ lives, systems that let people pay with them are becoming a key technology battleground in retail, where Square competes against eBay’s PayPal, the Google Wallet, and others.Starbucks will also invest $25m in Square, which was created by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. In addition, Howard Schultz, Starbucks’ chief executive, will join Square’s board.Under the deal, Square will also process all Starbucks transactions done with credit and debit cards - but not cash - as well as letting consumers pay by waving a Square app on their phones in front of a barcode reader at store counters.Starbucks has let customers pay using a different mobile payments system and its own app for the past 18 months and Mr Schultz said its popularity had grown faster than any other Starbucks innovation.Consumers use it for 1m transactions a week, he said, although that equates to less than 2 per cent of its 60m weekly transactions around the world. Starbucks has 7,000 coffee shops in the US.For Square, the deal promises to draw more consumers into its network, enabling it to promote to them some of the other 75,000 businesses in its directory that take Square payments.Mr Dorsey told reporters in New York: “This is definitely a pioneering deal for us. It really validates the technology.”In a letter posted on the Square website, he wrote: “When Starbucks builds the Square directory into their apps and in-store digital network, it gives Square new visibility, driving more customers to opt-in to Square.”He said Square planned to use part of the $25m investment from Starbucks to expand outside the US.Square, which was founded in 2009, rose to prominence with small devices that, when plugged into a smartphone, allow the phone to take credit card payments.Its services have helped a number of smaller businesses take credit card payments without having to invest in expensive till systems.Starbucks will pay a fee to Square for its systems, but the two companies would not disclose details.While analysts predict that mobile phones will become a key way of making payments, replacing many cash transactions, no single mobile payments technology has emerged as a standard.Asked about PayPal and the Google Wallet, Mr Schultz said: “What we found with Square was an approach to the customer that was quite different. This is not a bolt-on strategy. This is the only thing they do.”
463;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:48Z;The FT 400 Top Financial Advisers;Best in class: we present the leading US professionals, listed by state or territory, and provide the research methodology;"The Financial Times 400 is intended to provide a snapshot of the best financial advisers for the investors who use them.We assess these advisers based on what investors care about and we use a quantifiable, objective methodology.The Financial Times and Ignites Research, the FT’s sister company, contacted the largest US brokerages in autumn 2019 to obtain practice information and data for their top advisers across the US.We asked for information on advisers with more than 10 years’ experience and that had $300m or more in assets under management. Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."
464;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;The partnership of coffee and tech;;Coffee and techies go together like donuts and policemen, one the voracious consumer of the other. They have named programming languages after the stuff. And so the alliance between Starbucks and Jack Dorsey’s Square mobile payments start-up seems quite natural.Starbucks has never been shy of experimenting with technology, having been one of the first US coffee shop chains to offer customers free wi-fi access. Starbucks also has its own mobile app, which allows customers to pay for their coffees using a phone. Although these mobile payments are still just a tiny fraction of overall revenues, it is considered one of the most successful mobile payments systems in use so far. Starbucks even recruits from the tech world, having brought in ecommerce entrepreneur Adam Brotman, in 2009 to oversee its digital developments.But is there a danger that the coder-coffee continuum is becoming cozy to the point of representing a conflict of interest? Jack Dorsey is, after all, already an investor in another coffee company, San Francisco’s Sightglass Coffee. It is a single shop, not quite the empire Starbucks controls, but became an early adopter of Square technology following Dorsey’s investment.Another, slightly more uncomfortable series of links is with Visa, which also invested in Square last year and has a seat on the advisory board. Visa recently stopped Visa payments from being made in a number of Scandinavian countries using iZettle, Square’s Swedish rival. No clear reason has emerged for this. But it all feels, well, a little bit cozy.
465;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-07-31T18:25:13Z;Coupon cut hits Coach in US market;;Coach shares tumbled 18 per cent as meagre sales growth in North America signalled more caution among US consumers and tougher competition from rivals in the market for handbags and accessories.The US handbag brand said like-for-like sales in North America rose just 1.7 per cent from a year ago in the past quarter, much worse than Wall Street forecasts that it would come close to repeating the previous quarter’s 6.7 per cent growth.Analysts had been watching for signs of weakness in China, where Hugo Boss, the German fashion group, said on Tuesday that its sales growth had dropped sharply amid a slowdown in Chinese economic growth.But while Coach’s China business grew steadily, its US troubles came as a shock to the market, even though businesses selling more mundane products – such as Starbucks – reported a deterioration in consumer spending in June.Stacey Widlitz of SW Retail Advisors described Coach’s North American sales as “pretty ugly”. The company’s shares fell 18.1 per cent to $49.60, their lowest level in nearly a year.Part of their weakness stemmed from a decision to stop offering discount coupons at Coach outlet and factory stores, a move that turned off consumers still eager for bargains against the backdrop of a tepid US economic recovery.Ms Widlitz said: “They went away from coupons and were so confident they could get more [profit] margin. And guess what? The consumer told them: ‘You’re wrong’.”She said Coach had fallen into the same trap as JC Penney, the US department store, which posted a 19 per cent fall in quarterly sales earlier this year after replacing its array of discounts with a more steady pricing policy.“Consumers need a reason, an excuse, to feel OK about spending money on things you might not need,” Ms Widlitz said. Coach reinstated its coupons later in the past quarter.In China, Coach said it had recorded “double-digit” sales growth at stores open at least a year, while revenues rose nearly 60 per cent thanks to the opening of new stores.Claus-Dietrich Lahrs, chief executive of Hugo Boss, said Chinese consumers were feeling “kind of insecure” as his company reported quarterly sales growth of 1 per cent in China.Hugo Boss shares fell 5.5 per cent to €82.03, hit by a profit forecast that was lower than market expectations.In North America, Michael Binetti, an analyst at UBS, said Coach’s performance reflected intensified price competition from the likes of Michael Kors and Kate Spade, rather than broader economic worries.“There has been very good market growth for the category, but the competitive dynamics have obviously got more challenging,” he said.While it did not provide a figure for the quarter, Coach said the overall market for women’s handbags and accessories in North America grew by 10 per cent in the past 12 months.
466;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-07-27T21:32:41Z;US equities rise sharply after GDP data;;Amazon’s share price leapt upward even though the company’s second-quarter net income dropped 96 per cent from last year, as the broader market hit its highest point since early May.Amazon stock gained 7.9 per cent to $237.32 to ensure a weekly rise of 4 per cent, while the S&P 500 traded 1.9 per cent higher at 1,385.97.The benchmark index recorded a gain of 1.7 per cent on the week. The broader market traded in negative territory for three consecutive sessions earlier in the week due to concerns over Spanish borrowing costs and disappointing quarterly results.Amazon’s growth was dragged down by sluggish European demand and profit margins were compressed due to new investment in warehouses to enhance delivery efficiency, in spite of the company’s solid fundamental business.Meanwhile, analysts remained cautious on the outlook for the online retailing industry.Lloyd Walmsley, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said: “We reiterate our buy rating on shares of Amazon but lower our price target to $265 to reflect our estimate revisions and multiple compression in the e-commerce group.”Mr Walmsley added that the increased competition from traditional retailers could bring about pricing pressure while Amazon’s ongoing investments in areas such as web services would reduce its operating margin expansion.Other online retailers also moved up on Friday. Ebay, the online marketplace, gained 3.3 per cent to $45.22. Groupon, the daily deal site, increased 14.8 per cent to $7.59.Expedia, the internet travel website, surged 20.1 per cent to $54.90 on revenue growth that was boosted by hotel bookings.US equities extended their gains on Friday after GDP data were in line with expectation and fears over the eurozone eased.But Justin Walters, co-founder of Bespoke investment group, said the market would remain volatile.“Over this five-week period, the index has now had three multi-day rallies and three multi-day declines of roughly four per cent,” he said.“If this pattern holds,” he added “the S&P 500 would rally another two per cent from here and then pull back once again.“Fortunately, the index hasn’t had any technical breakdowns throughout this period of ups and downs. The index has managed to close above its 50-day moving average up to now in July and every single sector is currently above its 50-day moving average.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.5 per cent to 13,075.66 with a weekly gain of 2 per cent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite increased 2.2 per cent to 2,958.09, and has increased 1.1 per cent over the week.Technology stocks caught the attention of investors in a week in which Apple and Facebook unveiled their quarterly results.Shares in Facebook, which had disappointed investors with its slow revenue growth, continued to head down.The stock dropped 11.7 per cent to $23.70, triggering regulatory restrictions on short selling that will stay in place until Monday. The price fell more than 10 per cent in after-hours trading on Thursday.The social networking website has lost 37.6 per cent since its debut at $38 a share in May.Brian Nowak, analyst at Nomura, said Facebook’s focus on investing in mobile and social advertising were important for generating revenues.But the company’s weak quarterly results had also reflected the challenges of growing its business. “We are therefore reducing our 2012 and 2013 revenue estimates by two per cent and four per cent.”S&P Capital IQ lowered its 12-month target price for Facebook to $25.Zynga, an online game maker that sells its products through the Facebook platform, decreased 2.8 per cent to $3.09. Shares in the company slumped 35.7 per cent on the week after weak quarterly results.Apple, the most heavily weighted stock on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite, fell 3.1 per cent over the week to $585.16 after the iPad and iPhone maker reported worse-than-expected quarterly results.In a move that promises to bolster the company’s intellectual-property defences Apple reached a $356m deal to acquire AuthenTec, a maker of fingerprint sensors, which surged 68.1 per cent to $8.42 over the week.The S&P 500 information technology index, however, was the second-worst performer on the week behind materials. Both indices dropped 0.9 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively.Defensive sectors, such as the telecommunications index, led gains, rising 3.9 per cent over the past five days.Merck & Co added 3.9 per cent to $45.10 on the week although the healthcare company reported an 11 per cent drop in second-quarter earnings.Starbucks also closed 8.6 per cent down at $47.47. The share remained weak after losing 10 per cent in after-hours trading on Thursday as the coffee retailer lowered its full-year guidance.
467;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-07-27T16:36:39Z;Softening demand hits US consumer groups;;US consumer companies are feeling the burden of slowing economic growth, with softening demand cutting into sales at companies such as McDonald’s and Starbucks this week.McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain by revenues, reported a rare decline in its quarterly profits and said that after several years of promoting higher-end menu items it would refocus on value. The company warned that the slowdown in the US, combined with austerity measures in Europe and a cooling Chinese economy, were changing dining habits, with more people choosing to eat at home.“It is really starting to constrain consumer behaviour,” said Peter Bensen, chief financial officer of McDonald’s, on Monday. “In several of the markets there [Europe], the eating out market is just simply declining and people are staying at home. And the magnitude of the issues in Europe are having ripple effects around the world.”Starbucks said on Thursday store traffic was down in June and July amid a weakening consumer environment. The company’s share price fell sharply after it lowered its earnings guidance.The disappointing corporate performances come as US consumers are pulling back on spending. On Friday, government figures showed US economic growth slowed to an annualised rate of 1.5 per cent, held back by weak consumption.Executives have begun to accept the protracted economic doldrums. Last week, Muhtar Kent, chief executive of Coca-Cola, said the macroeconomic environment was “increasingly unpredictable” and that companies needed to recognise that the normal ups and downs of the business cycle are a thing of the past.
468;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:08:53+0000;Peet’s Coffee in near-$1bn buyout by Benckiser;All-cash deal to take private the US chain;Peet’s Coffee & Tea, a US chain that claims a devoted following of “Peetniks”, is to be acquired for nearly $1bn by Joh A Benckiser, a German family holding company chaired by Bart Becht.The bet on coffee is the most significant move by Mr Becht since a failed $10.7bn bid by Coty– a perfume company also owned by Joh A Benckiser – to acquire Avon, the cosmetics group.Joh A Benckiser will take Peet’s private in an all-cash deal announced on Monday at $73.50 a share – 29 per cent above the stock’s Friday close – valuing the coffee company at $974m. Peet’s does not have any debt.Earlier this month, Joh A Benckiser acquired a stake of around 12 per cent in DE Master Blenders 1753, an Amsterdam-based coffee and tea company that listed on the stock market in June after being spun off from Sara Lee. Its brands include Douwe Egberts.Mr Becht, who was lauded by investors when chief executive of Reckitt Benckiser, a UK household products group, said the Peet’s deal was consistent with Joh A Benckiser’s strategy of investing in companies with “strong, premier-quality brands”.Joh A Benckiser owns 15.7 per cent of Reckitt Benckiser as well as the whole of Coty and Labelux, a luxury goods group whose brands include Jimmy Choo, Bally and Belstaff.Sales of Peet’s packaged coffee in supermarkets and other retail stores accounted for $157m in revenue last year – 42 per cent of the company’s total – but made a higher contribution to its profits due to the lower overheads of packaged coffee distribution.Peet’s, which is based in the San Francisco Bay area, has also been looking to enter the fast-growing market for single-serve coffee capsules.While Joh A Benckiser will own most of Peet’s after the transaction, BDT Capital, a Chicago investment bank that advised the European group on the deal, will also take a small stake of undisclosed size.Joh A Benckiser does not intend to alter Peet’s management or strategy and is not looking to combine it with DE Master Blenders or exploit any potential operational synergies, said a person close to the company.Peet’s opened four new coffee shops in 2011 and five this year, taking its total count to 201, with the majority in California and others in Oregon, Washington state, Illinois and Massachusetts.Morgan Stanley advised Joh A Benckiser and Citigroup advised Peet’s.Additional reporting by David Gelles in New York
469;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Chow Tai Fook: still sparkling;The jeweller is expanding faster than Starbucks in China;When a jewellery chain expands faster than Starbucks in China, should investors be braced for a less-than-glittering finale? Or is this simply another example of the breadth of products that China’s emerging consumers are only beginning to realise they cannot live without?Chow Tai Fook, the world’s largest jeweller by market capitalisation, is opening roughly a store every two days in China, Starbucks has been launching one every four, on average. By 2015, this will give Starbucks more than 1,500 stores, Chow Tai Fook already has almost that many, is in more than 300 cities and plans to expand at its current rate for at least the next two years. Whew! For those who believe Chinese consumerism will be a fast-forward version of western markets’ progress, this makes sense.In addition to getting used to paying near-western prices for fancy coffee, the Chinese are still only just getting into diamond engagement rings. About a third of couples buy them, compared with about four-fifths of westerners. Chow Tai Fook – relatively well-known and relatively affordable – is well positioned to capture growth.Numbers suggest it is benefiting so far: sales and profits rose more than three-fifths in the year to end-March. Its Chinese same-store sales growth, at 32 per cent, is half as good again as that of Starbucks.All very impressive. But since listing in December, investors have applied scepticism: shares are off almost two-fifths. It was too pricey on listing, at about 23 times expected earnings for the financial year just gone. Now, it trades at 14 times next year’s numbers.With inflation easing, the risk is that some hedge driven purchasing of gold and gem-set jewellery will fall. Still, shares gained more than 6 per cent on Wednesday’s results, suggesting investors are happy to bet that the shine hasn’t come off yet.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
470;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-06-26T17:23:13Z;Coke is latest to put faith in India;;"That’s two in a row. Coca-Cola, the world’s largest soft drinks maker, announced on Tuesday a total investment of $5bn in India by 2020, just days after Ikea, the Swedish furniture retailer, reaffirmed its long-term commitment to an economically beleaguered country in need of some good news.Coke’s commitment – which adds $3bn to $2bn already earmarked – is a reminder that India’s huge market, rising incomes and favourable demographics remain attractive, in spite of serial failure by the government to enact pro-growth reforms and a slew of negative economic data.Amitabh Mall, director of the Boston Consulting Group in Mumbai, said global players need long-term strategies in what can be an unpredictable market.“India’s consumption is projected to go up from $1tn today to $3.6tn 2020. So the fundamental potential is there in India, and players will have to invest for the long-term.”Coke and Ikea are far from the only multinationals investing right now – Starbucks, for example, is set to open in Mumbai in October. Analysts hope the recent string of announcements will help resurrect a shelved plan to allow foreign companies to buy control of Indian “multibrand” retailers (such as supermarkets).That would go some way to restoring confidence in the government’s ability to forge ahead on a number of other reforms, such as slashing diesel subsidies and introducing a goods and services tax.Related reading:

471;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-06-21T19:00:12Z;Starbucks in LatAm: selling ice to Eskimos?;;"An American company trying to sell coffee to Latin America sounds like somebody selling ice to Eskimos or taking coal to Newcastle. Not least because the region produces most of the beans consumed worldwide.Yet that is exactly what Starbucks is looking to do. This week, the Seattle-based coffee chain announced plans to ramp up its expansion in LatAm. The group said it wants to open ”several hundred” stores in Brazil in the next five years, to add to the 38 it currently owns, and open more than 300 new stores in Argentina and Mexico by 2015.But will the region’s caffeine seekers bite?At first glance, the plan seems just downright foolhardy. True, Brazilians are one of world’s biggest consumers of coffee, averaging about 5.87 kilos a person in 2010, according to the International Coffee Organization. (The US, by contrast, averaged about 4.11kg per person).But unlike the US, where coffee culture is still pretty much an 8oz paper cup “to go” experience, in Brazil, the culture remains very much a European one, where people jostle for a place at the bar counter at local padarias and mom and pop cafés.The country also happens to be the world’s biggest coffee grower – it produced 43.5m 60kg bags of coffee beans last year.So what makes Starbucks think an American company can sell coffee grown by Latin Americans back to Latin America – and at a substantially marked up price no less? At Starbucks in the Pátio Higienópolis shopping centre, for example, it will cost you R$6.80 ($3.40) for a small 300ml latte and R$9.40 for a 500ml large one.In a nutshell: soft couches and easy-listening music, says Cliff Burrows, president of Starbucks US and the Americas.“Starbucks is not just about selling coffee,” he told beyondbrics. ”It’s really about an experience – a place where you can come and meet with friends.”On this, Burrows has a point. From its inception, Starbucks has been as much about having a place to hang out as it is about coffee. As in the US before Starbucks came along, there are few places in Latin America where one can just sit with a book or a laptop and while the day away.And then, there is the taste factor. As a beyondbrics colleague and old Brazil hand testifies, an awful lot of coffee in Brazil is pretty much undrinkable:“São Paulo is an Italian city so the coffee there has always been good, often very good espresso. But any Paulista will tell you the coffee in Rio, for example, is dreadful – watery and sugary. For years Brazil only grew low-grade robusta for making instant coffee. Arabica beans are quite a recent thing. Great tasting coffee is something a lot of Brazilians are only starting to find out about.”Indeed, history appears to be on Starbucks’ side when it comes to changing local coffee drinking habits.When Starbucks opened its first store in Paris in 2004, few thought the chain would last a week in a city known for its café culture. (Think Jean Paul Sartre, Les Deux Magots and Boulevard St Germain.) American coffee – known as “jus de chaussettes”, or sock juice – is viewed with disdain.Yet that Starbucks on Avenue de l’Opera thrived. Others quickly followed and there are now 68 stores in France.Having lived in Paris on and off for four years, this beyondbrics writer and coffee aficionado can attest to the low quality of coffee served in most of the city’s bistros and cafés. To cut cost, many use the cheapest grade. And the result is coffee that burns a hole in your stomach. Starbucks might be no Monmouth in London but the lattes are drinkable (most of the time).Another reason Starbucks worked in Europe and can work in Latin America is brand recognition.In Brazil, Starbucks is very much marketed as an aspirational brand. A Starbucks brew is seen as a premium product in a country where the minimum wage is R$622 a month.“Our client profile in Brazil is younger than in the US,” says Burrows. “They are young people, who have travelled and are educated and who are aware of the brands from their travels.”And people who do go to Starbucks see it as a treat.The most popular beverages are not espressos but lattes, cappuccinos and a drink called frappuccino de brigadeiro, which turns the taste of a traditional Brazilian chocolate dessert into a drink, says Burrows.Burrows says Starbucks’ performance thus far in LatAm has been encouraging, with both Brazil and Mexico (it’s biggest market in LatAm at the moment with 342 stores) reporting “strong growth”.Anecdotal evidence from beyondbric’s network of correspondents in LatAm seems to back up this assertion.From Adam Thomson in Mexico City:“I see new Starbucks stores opening up everywhere in the capital. The most recent was on the Luis Cabrera Square in Mexico City’s trendy Roma district. And they are selling to middlle-class Mexicans, who are buying lattes in bulk.”Jude Webber in Buenos Aires:“There are increasing numbers of Starbucks and they are full.”And Joe Leahy in Sao Paulo:“Starbucks is popular here as is McDs, in spite of Brazil’s excellent local padarias, which serve great coffees and burgers.”It is no easy task to sell ice to an Eskimo, but who says it can’t be done?Related reading:

472;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-06-19T11:15:16Z;Whitbread’s Costa conundrum;Any demerger of the outperforming coffee group will be expensive;And relax. Walgreens’ purchase of a 45 per cent stake in Alliance Boots for $6.5bn in cash and shares should be a cause for qualified relief among private equity executives. Most of all for partners at KKR, the big US-based private equity firm that owns a large chunk of the European pharmacies and drugs wholesaling group.The buyout in April 2007 was made as the credit cycle began to crest. Ever since, Alliance Boots has been the subject of gloomy predictions among financiers about the difficulty of rolling over net debt – about £7bn at the last count – or finding an exit in a tough market for M&A and private equity-backed flotations.As it is, the deal with Walgreens lacks the brute bragging rights of a full cash sale at a steep price. The US drugstore chain, which boasts 8,000 outlets, is hedging its bets by buying a chunky stake now with the option to acquire the rest of the shares in three years.KKR is reputedly fired up at the synergies the merged entity should be able to reap, not least as the world’s largest buyer of prescription medicines. Walgreens and Alliance Boots are a snug fit. But the private equity firm may be making a virtue out of the necessity of taking part of its payment in shares, albeit that the bulk would be in cash.The earnings multiple for the initial stake sale to Walgreens is below that for the original buyout, made at a total price of £12.2bn including debt. But a full combination at an enterprise value for Alliance Boots of about £17bn would yield a return of about 2.7 times on KKR’s slice of the £3.9bn equity investment that went into Alliance Boots in 2007.That would be a much better outcome than Cassandras have been prophesying. The realisation of bubble era buyouts, of which Alliance Boots was the most ambitious involving a UK group, may thus prove less hideous than feared.Wishful thinking makes us selectively deaf. “Don’t extrapolate from a Q1 trading statement,” beseeched Whitbread chief executive Andy Harrison on Tuesday. Ears stuffed with cotton wool and humming lustily, bulls piled in anyhow, pushing the shares up 6.4 per cent.Their exuberance was understandable if not excusable, given the claggy trading conditions impeding other consumer businesses. In contrast, Whitbread, these days specialising in cheap hotels and strong coffee, glides along several feet above the mud. Sales to May 31 were up 14 per cent year-on-year, with caffeine pedlar Costa producing a storming like-for-like sales increase of 8.4 per cent.Whitbread is thriving because competition, like the coffee of rivals, is weak. Starbucks, a powerful brand in its home US market, finds the going tougher in Europe. And in UK hotels, Whitbread’s Premier Inn budget hotel brand has benefited from the travails of Travelodge, which has been struggling with a heavy debt burden.In its success, Whitbread is sowing the seeds of its own dissolution. To commit the lesser sin of extrapolating ahead from a long-term record, Costa, celebrating its 41st consecutive quarter of sales growth, could easily end up dwarfing Premier Inn.But background pressure for a demerger may only prove irresistible if performance flags. No sign of that yet, with shares trading on a forward earnings multiple of 13.5 times. That is pricier than the real risk of a pedestrian future should permit.It would be one small step for Mankind, but one great leap for the Isle of Man. Excalibur Almaz, a company based on the island, plans to take tourists on space trips lasting from six to eight months at an average price of £100m. And you thought season tickets on Southeastern trains were expensive. Not that there may be any more leg room on the space flights. The capsule is the size of a skip. And equally comfortable, one suspects. Like most of Excalibur Almaz’s hardware, it is ex-Soviet.The island, best-known for its tailless cats and tax exiles, is already big in the space industry, apparently. We must have failed to notice all those unmanned missions to Saturn, launched from a sheep field just outside Douglas.Anyway, Excalibur Almaz’s rockets, bought in from an established Russian space company, would blast off from Kazakhstan, where the skies are clearer and expertise greater.Thankfully Professor Colin Pillinger, the Open University’s tame wookie, is not supplying the technology. When his Beagle 2 probe added to Mars’ complement of craters in 2003 he likened space travel to playing interplanetary snooker. That is talk to rattle even the bravest billionaire space cadet.
473;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-06-13T18:48:42Z;Facebook ads;Investors want to see accelerating growth in revenue;Facebook won’t to lose a popularity contest without a fight. Slumping shares make the company look unlikeable. It has fought back with a study, completed with ComScore, on whether a brand’s presence on Facebook affects buying habits.The headline results look good. ComScore monitored the online activity, and credit/debit/loyalty card purchases, of several thousand volunteers. Two study groups, consisting of those who were exposed to Facebook messages from Starbucks and Target, were compared with unexposed control groups. Over a month, the Starbucks study group was 38 per cent more likely to make a purchase than the control group. The difference was 21 per cent at Target.So far so good, but check the fine print. The results look less striking when the absolute frequency of purchases is considered: 2.1 per cent of subjects bought something at Starbucks, for example, versus 1.5 of controls (part of the problem is that cash transactions were not counted). Assuming big enough base, a small difference could be significant, of course. But more importantly, the Starbucks and Target subjects were not exposed to paid ads but to messages originating in the companies’ Facebook pages and spread through the pages of brand “fans” and their “friends.” This is not how Facebook makes money – not directly. A third study, of those exposed to paid Facebook ads from a large retailer, showed only a 16 per cent increase in in-store purchases – 1.5 per cent of those exposed made in-store purchases, versus 1.3 per cent of controls.Naturally, no study can truly substitute for what investors most want to see: accelerating growth in advertising revenue, on a per user basis. That has been flat for two quarters worldwide and decelerating in the US. This popularity contest can only be won with profits.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
474;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-06-08T14:01:40Z;Letter from Lex: the pain in Spain;More eurozone worries and high-tech gadgets;For Spain, it is the best of times and the worst of times. As its gifted footballers enter the Euro 2012 championships as hot favourites, the prime minister’s refusal to ask for cash to fund its ailing banks is damaging the country. Of course it is not the only eurozone member in trouble due to its banks. Cyprus’ banks are so deeply enmeshed in the Greek economy that the Mediterranean island is in a mess almost as bad as Greece itself.As the eurozone continues to make itself increasingly irrelevant, the world’s powerhouse economies are sending mixed signals. In the US the good data are just about outweighing the bad. In China this week’s surprise interest rate cut confirmed that its economy is slowing – although it is not yet a hard lending as policy makers still have scope to loosen policy further. If investors needed another reason to revisit bullish assumptions about China, they need only look at the world’s largest coal port, where lacklustre demand has driven stockpiles to levels last exceeded in late 2008.Elsewhere it was about high- and low-tech. Nintendo investors were underwhelmed by the unveiling of its new Wii U console and MiiVerse social network. Taiwanese computer maker Acer also introduced a new range of products, but the company appears to be slightly confused about exactly what consumers want. Meanwhile Microsoft has aggravated the advertising industry by making “do not track” the default setting on its next generation web browser. In the lower tech world, Starbucks announced a partnership with DVD vending machine operator Coinstar while two document storage companies – Iron Mountain and Recall – sent signals that the business is getting tougher.Next week looks like it will be a continuation of A Tale of Two Cities – Berlin and Madrid.John Casey, Lex Publisher
475;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-06-08T06:00:10Z;Twitter bots are boosting brands – survey;;Could some corporate twitter feeds – shock and horror – not be as popular with real people as they appear? New research published on Friday by a professor at Milan’s IULM University suggests that may well be the case, writes Eric Sylvers in Milan.Marco Camisani Calzolari, a professor of corporate communications and digital languages, has examined the Twitter followers of 39 companies with major consumer brands, including DellOutlet, Starbucks, and Blackberry, and tried to determine which followers are likely humans and which are likely bots, or fake accounts.Mr Camisani Calzolari’s research suggests that, of the 39 companies he looked at, eight had more followers who were probably bots rather than human and four – DellOutlet, WholeFoods, IKEA ITALIA and Treccani, an Italian encyclopaedia – had almost half of their followers as probable bots.In the case of DellOutlet, 46 per cent of the followers looked at were considered probable bots while 30 per cent were likely human, 11 per cent were protected Twitter accounts that could not be analysed and 13 per cent were too close to call.“We don’t control who follows any of our Twitter accounts and we don’t artificially increase the number of followers,” said Richard Binhammer (@RichardatDell), Dell’s Social Media Relations manager at the company’s headquarters in Round Rock, Texas.“In fact, paying third parties to undertake such action is contrary to our policy. While there are some tools that claim to identify bots, they are not 100 percent accurate. The only action we could take is to ‘block’ a follower. We certainly would not want to risk ‘blocking’ a potential customer. Our focus is on relationships and engagements with customers.”The research considered a selection of major consumer brands with at least 10,000 Twitter followers. An algorithm randomly selected 10,000 followers from each of the 39 feeds and then used more than 20 criteria to decide if the follow was more likely to be a person or a bot.An account received points for being probably human if it had, among other things: a name, image, biography, at least 30 followers, had written more than 50 posts, used punctuation in posts, had used a phone to log in to Twitter, had used the Twitter website to post a tweet and had at least one tweet that had been retweeted. In each case, if the answer was no then the account got a point for being probably a bot.Of the large international brands in the study, Starbucks at 7 per cent had the lowest ratio of probable bots. Other Twitter feeds with a low number of followers who are probably bots included SamsungMobile, PlayStation, CocaCola, BlackBerry and Pepsi.“The research shows that the number of followers is no longer a valid indicator of the popularity of a Twitter user,” said Mr Camisani Calzolari. “Many of the companies included in the research have delegated their public relations activities on social networks to web agencies that in some cases have taken short cuts in order to demonstrate to companies, who are oblivious, that their activities have been successful by generating lots of new users.”
476;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-06-06T19:10:38Z;Coinstar: think outside the box;Partnership with Starbucks is ripe with possibility;If you didn’t know what Coinstar of the US did, you’d be snapping up the shares with both hands. Look at the numbers: over the past three years, revenue and operating profits have grown at an average rate of 42 and 35 per cent, respectively. Cash return on assets is approaching 20 per cent. At the current price, the shares have a double-digit free cash flow yield.But far the biggest and fastest-growing part of Coinstar’s business is operating DVD vending machines. These “Redboxes” sit near the entrances of big retail shops – Walmart, Walgreen’s, 7-Eleven – offering low-cost movie and game rentals with the swipe of a card. It is extraordinary that, in the age of streaming video, a DVD retail scheme is growing sales like the next new thing – nearly 40 per cent in the first quarter, faster than the same period last year. Yes, given the disappearance of the video store, there was a temporary gap to fill. But the DVD business has to fall into terminal decline sometime – right? The fact that Coinstar entered a streaming video joint venture with Verizon does not inspire confidence in the core business.All of which makes this week’s announcement intriguing. Coinstar will partner with Starbucks to place single-cup coffee vending machines in retail shops under the “Seattle’s best” brand. Coffee seems unlikely to be displaced by a digital alternative, and that a company as big as Starbucks, and as laser-focused on expanding out-of-store sales, would partner with Coinstar rather than go it alone speaks to the value of Coinstar’s skill and market position in self-service. The shares rose 4 per cent on the news. The big question, of course, is what else can be profitably put in a self-service kiosk: Coinstar is experimenting with photos and electronics. But how about flowers or ties or umbrellas as in Japan? Sometimes you have to think outside the box.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
477;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-06-05T20:59:35Z;Wall Street higher as investors look to central bank action;;Fastenal, the construction supplier, saw its shares tumble on Tuesday as the company that sells key industrial components to some of the world’s largest economies reported that its business slowed in May.Shares in Fastenal closed 9.8 per cent lower at $39.15 after it said that daily sales in May were up 13.1 per cent from the same time a year ago.Michael Jaffe, an equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ, said that figure amounted to a deceleration from the past couple of years, when same-day growth exceeded 20 per cent in many cases.Mr Jaffe added that economic uncertainties would pose a challenge in coming periods for Fastenal, but demand in its primary markets such as the US, China and Mexico was “solid”.Despite the losses on Tuesday, shares in Fastenal are still up nearly 25 per cent over the past year.Overall, the S&P 500 moved higher for the day. Activity on the index, which has given up nearly all its gains for the year after peaking in April, was muted for much of Tuesday’s trading session as investors eagerly sought signs of stimulus from the world’s central banks. But an afternoon rally helped the benchmark index gain 0.6 per cent to 1,285.50.Financial stocks, particularly the major US banks, were the best performers. The S&P 500 financials index rose 1.7 per cent as shares in Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase all recorded gains of more than 2.9 per cent.Goldman Sachs was up 1.3 per cent to $92.21 as reports suggested the US investment bank had laid off about 50 people last week.MasterCard, the global payments provider, rose 0.5 per cent in after-market trading on Tuesday as its board approved a $1.5bn share repurchase plan. MasterCard gained 2 per cent to $408.20 during the trading day, but appeared to be set to open higher on Wednesday after the announcement.Starbucks shares dropped as much as 4.2 per cent after the global coffee store chain announced the acquisition of a bakery brand for $100m.Late on Monday, Starbucks said it would acquire San Francisco-based Bay Bread and its La Boulange bakery brand. The coffee retailer said it planned to use the bakery’s pastry line to improve its food offerings in its stores around the world. It also wants to grow the number of La Boulange units from 19 in the coming years.The news, however, fell flat on investors, who had sent shares higher a day earlier on speculation that there might be an announcement involving Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, the large US coffee retailer, which has been a target of short sellers in recent months.“Needless to say, we have overarching concerns of distraction from the core coffee platform and damage to the existing customer experience, similar to concerns from other recent non-coffee initiatives,” said Jeffrey Bernstein, analyst at Barclays.Mr Bernstein added that the bakery platform acquisition was a logical next step for Starbucks but that the new business must learn to crawl before it could walk, while integration costs could affect the group’s overall performance until 2013.Starbucks shares lost 2.8 per cent to $52.41, giving back all gains from Monday. Shares in Green Mountain Coffee fell 2.3 per cent to $22.94, leaving them down 48.9 per cent since the start of the year.The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved 0.2 per cent higher to 12,127.95.Fresh economic data released on Tuesday showed that the US services sector grew slightly more in May than a month earlier. But the report from the Institute for Supply Management did little to encourage wary investors, who have encountered a slew of downbeat economic data in recent weeks.Meanwhile large manufacturing companies on the blue-chip heavy Dow edged up. Earthmoving equipment maker Caterpillar rose 0.5 per cent to $83.65, while shares in aircraft manufacturer Boeing inched ahead 0.1 per cent at $67.58.The Nasdaq Composite Index moved 0.7 per cent higher to 2,778.11. Shares in Apple, the most heavily weighted stock in the Nasdaq, lost 0.3 per cent to $562.83.Analysts at Canaccord Genuity, an investment bank, said that Apple sales remained strong even as consumers waited for a series of updated product releases later in the year.After spending the morning in positive territory, shares in Facebook were trading 3.8 per cent lower to $25.87. The social networking site has fallen more than 30 per cent since its public offering last month but received an upgrade from Scott Kessler, analyst at S&P Capital IQ. Mr Kessler changed his rating to “hold” from “sell” as he said the stock’s decline from its debut price of $38 puts it in line with its peers.FedEx, the global package delivery company, lost 1 per cent to $84.34 after it said on Monday that it planned to retire some of its large fleet of jets.
478;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Emerging Capital Partners: a Kenyan love story (with coffee);;"How does a place were “love stories were born, relationships blossomed and relaxation became an art” sound for an investment opportunity?To Emerging Capital Partners (ECP), it sounds great. The pan-African private equity company announced on Monday it has acquired a stake in Nairobi’s Java House coffee house chain, highlighting the increased appetite of PE firms for East Africa.Beyond the company’s marketing line that its a great place to meet people and start relationships, what has ECP bought?“You could say they acquired the Kenyan Starbucks,” says Bart Meijs, CFO of InReturn Capital, another PE fund active in Kenya. Java House was the first chain to introduce the successful coffeehouse model in Kenya: a “feel good” place for the upper-middle class and expat population to have coffee, lunch or dinner, with a consistent offering and quality across locations.Since its first restaurant opened in 1999, Java House has remained both a pioneer and market leader in its field, with currently 18 restaurants in portfolio. Its sales hit Sh1bn (£7.5m) last year, the result of a 30-40 per cent growth in the last five years, ECP told beyondbrics.The details of the deal were not disclosed, but Alex-Handrah Aimé, one of ECP’s managing directors on the deal, told beyondbrics the company’s deal range is between $25m and $60m. It makes ECP a top tier player in the blossoming East African PE landscape, where most deals fall in the $5m to $20m range.To continue the company’s impressive growth track, ECP says it wants to follow a “densification” strategy in Nairobi and other large Kenyan cities, much like Starbucks has done in the US. “We believe Java’s current 14 restaurants in the capital are just the tip of the iceberg,” Aimé said. “People don’t want to drive an hour to find a Java, so there’s still plenty of room to expand.”On top of that, the company sees potential in Dar es Salaam and Kampala, the rapidly growing capitals of Tanzania and Uganda. Meijs agrees that’s a good idea. “Java’s Nairobi restaurants are already well frequented, so opening new shops in Uganda and Tanzania would seem like a logical next step,” he said.Along with the investment, ECP also announced the opening of an office in Kenya, becoming the 30th PE fund to have an office in East Africa. It shows the increased attractiveness of a country that a recently as 2007 was on the brink of a civil war after post-election violence caused an estimated 1,000 deaths and left tens of thousands people displaced.Riding the waves of hope that the 2012 elections will be peaceful, private equity funds are drawn to Kenya because of its attractive growth over the last years, Meijs added. Over the last 2 years, Kenya has averaged 5 per cent GDP growth per year, an impressive achievement in an otherwise depressed world economy. Moreover, the IMF expects this growth to conitnue throughout 2012 and 2013,There were 23 Kenyan PE deals in 2011. Of the 53 private equity investors in East Africa, four-fifths of them expect to do further deals in East Africa over the next year, according to a Deloitte report.The real love story, it seems, is not that of Kenyans meeting in Java House, but that of western PE firms falling in love with Kenya.Further reading:

479;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-05-23T16:47:31Z;The digital career switchover;;"When Josh Silverman received a call last year asking if he would like to work for American Express, he was surprised.The 43-year-old technology entrepreneur’s life had always revolved around Silicon Valley start-ups. He had been chief executive of Skype and before that held a senior role at eBay. In the late 1990s he had cofounded Evite, the internet invitations company, and sold it in 2001. The thought of working for a 162-year-old blue-chip corporation was alien.“My initial reaction was confusion,” he says. “I had no background in financial services and had never worked for a Fortune 100 company. It was never my intention to work for a Fortune 100 company.”After hearing more about the job, however, Mr Silverman was in­trigued. American Express was keen to get further into the market for digital transactions and mobile payments, so customers could pay over the internet and through their mobile phones as the technology evolved. The leadership team seemed committed to changing the company and, for his part, Mr Silverman was tempted by the chance to have a big impact at a big organisation. Last June he was named president of American Express’s US Consumer Services business.Mr Silverman is among a number of technology entrepreneurs being lured to senior roles at more traditional companies. “There is a growing trend for Silicon Valley talent to move into established companies,” he explains. “In the middle of the first tech bubble, Silicon Valley was the one hiring talent from Fortune 500 companies. It was very one-way. But now we have enough Silicon Valley leaders who have run companies at enough scale to be useful for the Fortune 500 companies as well.”Rhys Grossman, at Russell Reynolds, the executive search company, says demand for chief digital officers – expert technology specialists who take senior positions at the right hand of the CEO and help to transform company strategy – has inc­reased dramatically. In Europe, search requests have risen by a third over the past two years; in the US, they have risen by a third in just the past year.Advertising companies have had chief digital officers for years as they adapted to the growth of advertising on the internet and social media. But organisations in the wider economy, from financial services to retailing, are now appointing them too. Last year New York City hired a chief digital officer – Rachel Sterne, the founder of GroundReport, an online news site, then aged 27 – to encourage more people to en­gage with the city electronically and to ensure it was offering the right social networking and other tools.The prestige of the role has increas­ed since the days when the head of digital was an adjunct to the marketing team. “A few years ago, digital roles were a couple of levels down in the organisation. Now they are rep­orting directly to the chief executive,” says Mr Grossman.This reflects the importance companies are attaching to having a digital presence, as more of their customers adopt smartphones, download apps and join social networking sites.The responsibilities of the increasingly senior role in long-established companies mean it is getting harder to find suitable recruits. “It is not enough to simply know digital, they need to know how to lead. It is as much about a big general management role as being a digital person,” says Mr Grossman.Adam Brotman, 42, who oversaw the development of Starbucks’ mobile apps and in-store media services, admits it has been a bit of an adjustment working for a much bigger company. Before his employment at the coffee chain, he was CEO of Barefoot Yoga Company, a Seattle-based ecommerce business. “[Starbucks] is the first company I have worked for that is multibillion in revenues and multinational. I had to learn to be a leader and an entrepreneur in an organisation of that size,” he says.Several European companies have recruited chief digital officers in the US because of the lack of homegrown candidates. Yell Group, the UK-based directories publisher that this week announced a loss of £1.42bn, hired 51-year-old Scott Moore, a former senior executive at Yahoo and Microsoft, as its digital chief late last year. With sales of traditional directories falling, the company also announced plans to rebrand itself as Hibu as part of its effort to transform itself into a mainly digital business. Mr Moore was behind Yell’s acquisition of Moonfruit, a UK company that helps small businesses build their own websites.There may also be a culture shock for entrepreneurs switching over from a freewheeling start-up, Mr Grossman says: “They can often look and feel very different from their traditional business colleagues . . . For cutting-edge things like social networks, the people who know those areas well tend to be younger.”But Mr Silverman says the cultural differences can be overstated. “People here wear suits and I have a big, wood-panelled office, which is nothing like I was used to. I joked that they should put a cubicle in there to make me feel more comfortable. But . . . people are [still] people,” he says.Tempting tech entrepreneurs to join established companies is the other challenge. Compared with the chance of earning immense riches from founding a successful start-up – Mark Zuckerberg was worth more than $19bn after Facebook’s float on the Nasdaq last week – a corporate salary plus bonus can seem limited. “Sometimes it does fall down on the compensation,” admits Mr Grossman. “These executives can earn a lot more doing something in the Valley.”Mr Silverman says: “This was far from the most lucrative offer I had. But at this stage in life it is about what I can brag to my grandchildren about. It’s about im­pact.”The good news for recruiters is that power can trump money. Mr Brotman and Mr Moore both had better financial options but were at­tracted by the influence that creating a role in a big company could bring. “If we are successful in executing our plans, we can do that at a huge scale,” says Mr Moore. “We have a 6,000-person salesforce that can take our products to market. It is an opportunity you don’t have in a 50-person start-up.”For Mr Brotman, the highlight so far has been the launch of free WiFi across Starbucks’ coffee shops. “I set up a Twitter search and could see that the whole country for one moment seemed to be high-fiving us for that,” he says. “Seeing hundreds of thousands of consumers commenting on it, having had that kind of impact was one of the greatest moments of my life.”"
480;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Categories: The best and worst performers;The Luxury and Fast Food sectors lead the way, with Insurance bringing up the rear in a year of contrasting fortunes for brands, writes Andrew Baxter;The BrandZ ranking goes beyond the top 100 to cover 13 different categories or sectors. In some of these categories, virtually all the brands get into the top 100. However, in others, such as apparel, very few do, so these category tables ensure that important areas of the global economy are not ignored just because individual brand values tend to be lower.With top 20s in each of the three mega-categories – technology, financial institutions and retail, and a top 15 for personal care, this means that 165 brands are covered.And how their performance varied during 2011 – with luxury and fast food both up 15 per cent to top the pile and Insurance, down 16 per cent, getting the wooden spoon. Half the categories have gone up and half have gone down. This is not too dissimilar from what was seen in 2008.Here we look at the categories one by one, with comments from Peter Walshe (PW), Millward Brown’s global BrandZ director, Nick Cooper (NC), managing director for Europe at Millward Brown Optimor, and Cristiana Pearson (CP), a director at MBO.……………………………………………………………..Luxury (up 15 per cent)CP: It is just safer at present for consumers to buy expensive products that are actually a long-term investment, as opposed to just buying lots of mid-priced items. The category is being driven by fast-growing economies as well, which has helped a lot. PW: Strong brand contribution and momentum across the sectorBrand snippetsHermèsPW: Hermès had an absolute stunning year, helped by an unsolicited takeover request from LVMH, which pushed up its share price massively. So it’s actually gone up most places, 39, and it is the second-biggest riser (in entire Top 100) in percentage terms. The brand has gained financially, certainly, but actually fundamentally, too.RolexPW: Rolex keeps having a record year every year in terms of sales.CP: It’s very highly in Luxury but I think also in its niche, which is obviously watches, it really is considered a status symbol.PradaCP: Prada skyrocketed because they’ve gone public. This means we now have a much more accurate way of identifying them.BurberryPW: Burberry is a good example of a company taking more control of its brand. It is a very interesting story as they continue to innovate very clearly online with their fashion shows and with enabling people to buy the brand, almost to democratise that brand more to a wider and newer audience. But increasingly they are taking huge care about how they come across, the way in which their online presence is felt and seen, changing it rapidly. They do a huge amount of work to make sure that that happens consistently and, at the same time, right the way across the world.Fast Food (up 15 per cent)CP: It’s that value proposition with healthier food and many options, which we saw back in the last recession.Brand snippetsMcDonald’sNC: Even though brands that are “bad for you” come up as not trusted highly by consumers, I suppose we shouldn’t say McDonald’s is bad for you because they’ve changed quite a lot, but you’ve got McDonald’s and Marlboro, which traditionally would be seen as bad for you, and they’re still not only in the overall top 10, they’re also rising. And consumers will make their own decisions about that.StarbucksPW: The Starbucks brand made a big recovery last year. They “freed the mermaid” from inside the logo, and have also been making a real thing about sustainable sourcing, which again is a point of differentiation. So it’s a brand that slightly wears its heart on its sleeve in a way that’s seen to be very positive from the consumer’s point of view. So this is a brand which has really gone back to recovering confidence in itself. And the other thing, of course, it physically has shut down unprofitable outlets and opened new ones in more profitable places, so it has the actual business basics right at the same time as the brand, so it’s really a very good story, with a bright future.CP: Starbucks also really started investing in staff training again and making sure that the customer experience is what it used to be because they went off of that for a while.Tim HortonCP: Tim Horton is another brand taking more control, they have got back some of their operations and have been focusing on their brands.Domino's PizzaMuch smaller brand, has seen brand value grow following refreshing candour about quality of products, which it has worked hard to improve following consumer surveys.Burger KingNot included in the ranking as the company has gone private and financial data are not available.Apparel (up 13 per cent)CP: Here you have two trends. First, the “fast-fashion” brands, like Zara, doing very well, and the second is taking control of your brands by moving away from the licensing model. We see Hugo Boss doing that. Calvin Klein has been doing the same, which is why it’s in the top 10 for the first time.Brand snippetsZaraCP: Zara doesn’t advertise. Instead they do is they have huge flagship shops, really nice shops, in the most expensive streets of the main cities.UniqloCP: Uniqlo has taken the same approach. In Japan it actually doesn’t have a very good brand image but outside it does, and the company hopes to have most of its revenues from outside Japan in the next four years. It has expanded hugely in China [which is] going to become the biggest Asian market very soon, and there’s some caché in China for Japanese brands.Ralph LaurenRalph Lauren had one of the biggest rises in brand value in the entire ranking, fuelled by growth in Asia.Oil & Gas (up 8 per cent)CP: Just the amount of oil discoveries and the booming demand for commodities around the world has led to huge margins. Most of them are growing except for Petrobras, which is due to the fall in the Brazilian stock market, and BP, still coming back from all its woes of a few years ago.PW: And ExxonMobil and Shell are benefiting from that. In one way, the brand differentiation between the brands is remarkably low. If you look at the personality of those three brands and BP, they’re so similar. PetroChina and Sinopec are twins, you just can’t tell the difference between them. And Petrobras is very similar to that as well, and that’s reflected in the brand contribution. So there’s an opportunity here to improve and increase the distinctness via their brands. And, arguably, as it’s getting harder to gain and retain the confidence of governments and administrators, brand is really one of the elements that could differentiate even more and therefore give a company a financial edge. But they’re still valuable corporations because they’re just so massive.Technology (up 2 per cent)This sector is covered in Ups and Downs: Facebook shines as Nokia fades awaySoft drinks (up 1 per cent)CP: The winners here are Gatorade and Red Bull, so it’s the non-carbonated soft drinks. If you look at Pepsi, for example, and a lot of these big companies, they’re trying to move at least 30 to 50 per cent of their food and beverages to healthier options, like juices, energy drinks and sport drinks especially. So the category as a whole has managed a slight increase. However, the overall market for carbonated soft drinks went down about 1 per cent in 2011.Brand snippetsGatoradePW: Gatorade’s rise in brand value is being driven by global expansion and increased availability of the brand generally, and what’s interesting is it also produces relevant flavours locally. So it’s a good example of a global brand acting locally. It’s also gone through an exercise of clarifying its portfolio, as it were, between pre-exercise drinks, during exercise drinks and post-exercise drinks, so you as a user have lots of reasons and excuses to swig your Gatorade. But also what’s been very good is the low-calorie option, so that’s tied in with health issues along with the exercise. On top of that, it is classified as what we call a rebel brand, it’s got a very distinct personality, and that’s helped it again stand out in that market.Red BullPW: Red Bull also is a bit of a rebel-type brand, but in slightly different ways. The brand is much more adventurous and rebellious, whereas Gatorade is more cheeky and fun.Financial Institutions (flat)This category is covered in Battered banks slide down the rankingsBeer (down 1 per cent)Brand snippetsBud Light and BudweiserCP: The fight between Bud Light and Budweiser continues, they keep switching places all the time, but with the US being their biggest market, there is a focus on lower calories and fighting obesity. This is the main reason Bud Light is doing better than Budweiser.BrahmaPW: Brahma is very interesting because consumers love it, it’s got a really trusted and approachable personality. It’s quite famous for its advertising in Latin America. And it’s also rated as incredibly good value by consumers. So as a result it’s the fifth highest in brand contribution. It’s a brand with a really attractive personality and it is a party-fun brand – attractive personalities are fun and stand out and you want to be with them at parties.There is more on beer brands in Bud changes image to take world stagePersonal Care (down 5 per cent)PW: Overall it’s down a little bit but there are some quite nice strong, quite old brands here, such as Colgate.Brand snippetsCliniqueClinique, the strongest performer in the category, is doing well in Asia.NaturaCP: Natura is a victim of the Brazilian stockmarket correction and currency depreciation, but the brand’s still very, very strong.AvonAvon’s share price was down 40 per cent, there were corporate governance issues, also very dependent on Latin America, so currency factors have played a part in its sharp fall in brand value. Subject of hostile bid from Coty, a big US perfume brand.Retail (down 5 per cent)CP: Retail is struggling a little bit, not surprisingly, against online competitors mainly, but there’s also this question about the balance between online and bricks and mortar.PW: And you just see the more established, bigger retailer with big infrastructures generally suffering across all those channels.NC: Margins are looking shaky, and also there’s an ongoing question about the prospects for consumer spending, both in developed and fast-growing markets. In developed markets there’s a bit of a lid on consumer spending, and even in emerging markets the picture is not clear.CP: There’s also the demographic story here in that so many more people, young people, are living alone nowadays and they just do more local, more frequent shopping, and it’s not the whole family concept where they drive out to these massive hypermarkets.PW: So when we look at the Retail sector, you’ll see the big grocers really are suffering, such as Tesco, Carrefour and Auchan. Walmart, although it’s below the category averages, hasn’t done quite as badly as some of the others. But we shouldn’t underestimate the toughness of the market.Brand snippetsCarrefourNC: Carrefour has had particular problems of its own – it has suffered from its over-reliance on hypermarkets in France, Spain, Italy and Belgium as its customers have increasingly turned to online sites for their non-food shopping – but there’s also this big, big retail fall out.CP: The demographic change has been affecting it. Additionally, their cheapest food prices are about 8.8 to 9 per cent more expensive than those of competitors, so they’re not even offering the best value.Ikea, Home DepotCP: Home improvement brands are going up as housing markets recover.Cars (down 7 per cent)CP: Another mixed bag. Some of the brands are doing quite well, others are still recovering from their recent past woes in the car industry.PW: What we’re indicating here is a story of value driven at two ends. At the lower price end, Hyundai has done very, very well this year, along with some of its competitors, which don’t make the rankings. This is partly because they’ve made their brands much more respectable and resilient, underpinned by actual and good perceptions of their engineering, again with the aid of technology. And then, of course, you’ve got brands like Audi, which are doing particularly well at the more luxury end. BMW, Mercedes-Benz, again are doing remarkably well because they are also seen as fantastic investment, fantastic value. And that’s reflected in quality brands as well, like VW. Meanwhile, Japanese brands have suffered as a result of the huge disruption caused by the earthquake and tsunami in March.Communication Providers (down 7 per cent)CP: This category is down for the first time in a while. Most of the brands are from fast-growing markets. Movistar suffered not only because of its presence in fast-growing markets, but also from its exposure to Spain.Brand snippetsVerizonCP: The only brand that really stands out is Verizon, which had a stellar year. Vodafone has a stake in them, and this was the first year that Verizon paid out a massive dividend to them, which just attests to the fact that it had a very, very good year. They are still benefitting from being the first ones on the market with the iPhone in the US.OrangeNC: O2 came out with the iPhone first. They had market leadership in the UK and have been very successful. Part of the reason for the decline in brand value is that it’s been a difficult year or so for a lot of mobile phone and phone companies because, in some ways, it’s not where the action is at the moment and they’re struggling to find a new raison d'être.MovistarCP: It’s a very good brand, but it’s going through a period of transitioning as a result of the rebranding of everything from Telefónica. It’s very difficult to rebrand your [fixed line] business when it’s associated with a monopoly, and give it the same name as an innovative mobile brand. It might cause a bit of confusion in the market for a little while.Insurance (down 16 per cent)PW: This is financial, it’s been the most horrific year for disasters, which has affected the companies’ financial performance. Brand actually plays a relatively lower part in Insurance, but could play a stronger part, and arguably should do, in order to keep that consumer and business dollar flowing into particular brands. Increasingly, it’s getting easier for consumers to switch and to buy on price.NC: Yes, without doubt the role of brand is increasing in that sector and I think the companies themselves recognise that brand is increasingly important. But it’s just been a ghastly year, and a costly one for the sector.Brand snippetsAllianzPW: Brands like Allianz are beginning to strengthen their brand hugely, beginning to take control more of their brand and align their brand and their images, but it’s a very, very slow process.Ping AnPW: Ping An has got quite a unique personality in China and is an entrepreneurial leader, along with quite distinctive advertising. So relatively it’s doing pretty well.GeicoPW: Geico is slightly down in brand value, so has performed relatively well for the sector. It is really focused on the car and property markets in the resurgent US market, and the brand has a character that it uses in its advertising, very consumer friendly.
481;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;When fortune favours the brave;;Steelite, a maker of tableware for the global hospitality industry, is doing what David Cameron, and much of the country, desperately wants British business to do: investing.The Stoke-on-Trent pottery company, which emerged from Royal Doulton three decades ago, was hit badly by the recession when demand dropped 40 per cent overnight and 130 jobs were cut.Now, not only has its staff been rebuilt to a new high of 800, re-employing many who were let go, it also plans to create 230 more jobs by building a £12m factory next to its existing site, mainly to meet US demand.Steelite is a prime example of Britain’s Battlers: companies, often unsung, that are finding ways to prosper in the most difficult business climate for a generation.In a four-day series the Financial Times will describe how many of these businesses are faring: those that are breaking into new export markets or finding pockets of profitable growth in the home market, and the obstacles they face.We start today with business investment, without which hopes of economic revival will be stillborn.UK companies are sitting on a £754bn cash pile, according to official figures. Not all of that may be available for investment in Britain – the biggest growth is in deposits held with foreign banks – but balance sheets are strong. Yet many are reluctant to spend amid uncertain prospects.Business investment is 15 per cent down on 2007 and the Office for Budget Responsibility thinks it will be flat this year, though it expects a sharp pick-up over the next four years.Individually, it may appear sensible for companies to be cautious, but the collective effect is to damp growth across the economy. Those that invest when others do not, however, can prime themselves for future expansion and steal market share from rivals.“I am in my 35th year in this business,” says Kevin Oakes, Steelite’s chief executive. “I have been through recessions in the 1980s and 1990s and we not only cut costs quickly and deeply, equally we always reinvest.”The government’s regional growth fund has pledged £2.1m towards Steelite’s expansion, but the company’s investment is not just in capacity: it has developed new products, put more sales people on the road and run maths and English classes on the shop floor.Some big companies are investing too, notably in the car industry, helped by demand in emerging markets and a flexible workforce.General Motors’ £125m investment in its new Astra at Ellesmere Port on Merseyside, announced last week, comes on top of £4bn of commitments from Jaguar Land Rover, Ford, BMW, Bentley and Toyota.InterContinental Hotels, Subway, McDonald’s, Starbucks and Marstons are among leisure chains planning expansions to create thousands of jobs. National Grid aims to spend £31bn by 2021 upgrading Britain’s electricity and gas networks.Center Parcs, the holiday village operator owned by Blackstone, the private equity group, has begun construction on a £250m village on the Duke of Bedford’s Woburn estate north of London, buoyed by strong trading and a 97 per cent occupancy rate at its four existing sites.Martin Dalby, chief executive, expects the development will add 20 per cent to Center Parcs’ £290m turnover and 25 per cent to its profits.“One of the reasons we have been successful for the past 25 years is we are forever reinvesting the profits and refreshing the product,” he says.Analysts agree that, even when growth is slow, successful companies are ones that innovate.Holiday Extras, a Kent-based airport hotel and parking provider, is investing an extra £1.3m in new technology this year and adding around 40 to its staff of 770. “If we stopped investing, the business would go backwards very quickly,” says Matthew Pack, chief executive. “The more we invest in technology and people, the more we think we can grow our market share.”Additional reporting by Chris TigheTomorrow: exporters
482;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Dunkin’ eyes assault on British waistlines;;"Dunkin’ Donuts’ sugary deep-fried confections, a US staple that has already expanded into South Korea and the Middle East, could be coming to the UK.Nigel Travis, chief executive of Dunkin’ Brands, which owns the coffee and doughnut chain as well as Baskin Robbins ice-cream parlours, on Thursday met 30 would-be franchisees in the UK.Mr Travis, himself from London, said that the UK would have to meet several criteria, including country suitability, an adequate supply chain infrastructure and the ability to find franchisees.“We think we can do the supply chain,” he told the Financial Times. “The real question goes back to, is it the right market given the competitive landscape?”Two existing US franchisees are said to be eager to expand in Britain as Baskin Robbins launches a big UK push.The rather retro ice-cream chain is being spruced up with a new design, and 80 restaurants will be opened in the UK over the next three years, creating 400 jobs.Britain’s coffee market is one of the world’s most competitive, with Starbucks of the US and locals, Costa Coffee and Caffè Nero, all battling it out alongside independents and smaller chains.That has not deterred the big companies from expanding: Starbucks is opening 300 stores over the next five years, bringing its total to more than 1,000.Dunkin’ Brands, which listed in the US last year, has more than 7,000 Dunkin’ Donuts stores in the US. Virtually all are run by franchisees, which are responsible for their own procurement; in turn, Dunkin’ charges slightly higher royalties to compensate for the fact it takes no mark-up on supplies.Dunkin’ Donuts is enjoying a boom in the US. “We think we are pretty recession-proof,” said Mr Travis."
483;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-05-03T11:55:51Z;Nestlé to open third Nespresso factory;;Nespresso, the fast-growing premium coffee brand owned by Switzerland’s Nestlé, on Thursday brushed off fears of rising competition for high-margin capsules with plans for a third factory to boost output to meet surging global demand.Nespresso, whose sales grew by about 20 per cent to SFr3.5bn last year, said it would invest SFr300m on a new plant in Romont in the Swiss canton of Freiburg.The factory will be similar to the second Nespresso plant at Avenches, built and then swiftly extended to relieve pressure on Nespresso’s original production site.“Some 25 years after creating the portioned coffee segment, the third Nespresso production centre will provide the capacity needed to sustain growth in Europe and develop our brand globally.” said Patrice Bula, Nespresso chairman.The new plant, to cost SFr300m and create more than 400 jobs, is expected to start production in the first half of 2015.Nestlé does not reveal financial data for Nespresso, other than a rounded annual sales figure. Analysts believe the business, which effectively created a new market segment around the world, is extremely profitable, with margins of more than 25 per cent.Nespresso’s success, boosted by clever advertising featuring US actor George Clooney, has however prompted growing competition, most recently form Starbucks.The US coffee group last November launched a single cup coffee system, initially in its home market but also due to be expanded to Europe.Meanwhile Nestlé, which says it has thousands of patents covering Nespresso, its capsules and “delivery systems” has increasingly turned to the courts to guard against imitators.
484;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Groupon adds finance experts to board;Attempt to lift investor confidence;Groupon is adding two finance experts to its board as the daily deals company attempts a financial makeover to win back investor confidence.Groupon’s reputation has been plagued by a series of accounting missteps and criticisms from US regulators. However, the company hopes to improve relations with investors and the Securities and Exchange Commission by shaking up its board.It named Daniel Henry, chief financial officer of American Express, and Robert Bass, vice-chairman of Deloitte, as its newest board members.Howard Schultz, chief executive of Starbucks, resigned from the Groupon board last Thursday, while Kevin Efrusy of Accel Partners, one of the company’s early venture capital backers, said he would not seek re-election when his term ends in June“There’s an element of this that feels reactive, and I’m sure many in the market will judge this as reactive,” said Jed Williams, an analyst with BIA/Kelsey.Neither Mr Schultz nor Mr Efrusy’s decision was “the result of any dispute or disagreement with the company or its board,” Groupon said on Monday.Mr Henry replaced Mr Schultz, while Mr Bass will stand for election at the annual shareholder meeting on June 19. He is due to retire from his position at Deloitte on June 2.Both will also serve on Groupon’s audit committee, bringing their “deep financial, accounting, and operational experience” to the review of the company’s finances and risks, the company said.Groupon has been in dire need of a financial revamp after it admitted in March to a “material weakness” in its internal financial controls, which forced the company to revise its fourth quarter financial results, turning what was previously stated as a $15m profit to a $15m loss.This was on the heels of the SEC forcing the company to revise its accounting methods in the months leading up to its IPO, to give a more transparent representation of its marketing costs.The events have led some investors to call for the resignation of Jason Child, Groupon’s chief financial officer. One shareholder filed a lawsuit against the company in April for “misleading” investors.Mr Williams said the shift in board representation made sense for Groupon. In its early days, “it made sense for a company to have a diverse board that could help them understand different growth strategies,” he said. Now, while Groupon still needs help with marketing and diversifying beyond its initial business, “clearly, the greater area of need is building back brand equity and investor confidence”.Groupon’s share closed down 10.6 per cent at $10.71. The shares are down 48 per cent from the company’s initial public offering in November.
485;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T02:30:15+0000;US GDP data fail to damp Wall Street;;Wall Street recorded its best week in a month and a half as Apple and Amazon surpassed expectations in their respective quarterly earnings reports.The S&P 500 climbed 1.8 per cent to 1,403.36 for the week, with the benchmark US index having reclaimed the 1,400 mark for the first time since early April.Barry Knapp, chief US equity strategist at Barclays, said: “The glow of yet another blow-out quarter from Apple offset deterioration in broad earnings trends.”Apple, the iPad and iPhone maker, rose 5.2 per cent to $603 as it said midweek that net income leapt 93 per cent to $11.6bn in its fiscal second quarter. Some market watchers had been predicting the world’s largest company by market value would lose some of its sway over US markets.But Apple’s results proved wrong those who suspected that the company’s tremendous growth rate had met its limits. The company did, however, lower forecasts for revenues in its next quarter, which analysts attributed to its product cycle as it prepared to release the next iteration of the iPhone later this year.Amazon, the world’s largest internet retailer by sales, soared on Friday after it reported much stronger than expected first-quarter revenues driven by demand for its Kindle e-reader.Shares in Amazon have risen 19.4 per cent over the week to $226.85. Much of the company’s gains took place after it said sales jumped 34 per cent to $13.2bn in the three-month period to March 31, compared with the same quarter last year.Also this week the company launched a new website called AmazonSupply.com, which aims to sell products ranging from cutting tools to lab and scientific equipment to businesses.The gains by Apple and Amazon helped the Nasdaq Composite index move 2.3 per cent higher for the week, trading at 3,069.20.But earnings results were not all positive. The earth-moving equipment maker Caterpillar lost 2.9 per cent on the week to $104.56, despite earning record profits in the quarter. Its shares declined on news that its business in China and Brazil had slowed.The Dow Jones Industrials Average, in which Caterpillar is the third heaviest weighted stock, was 1.5 per cent higher for the week, moving to 13,228.31.Other companies that disappointed analysts were H&R Block, the tax preparers, which lost 11 per cent for the week to $14.96. The company said on Thursday that its earnings came short of expectations and that it would lay off 350 employees and close about 200 stores to lower costs.H&R Block has faced increased pressure from electronic tax services from the likes of Intuit, the makers of TurboTax.Netflix, the home DVD and internet streaming company, was among the week’s biggest fallers. Shares in the company fell more than 21.1 per cent to $83.74 as investors worried over its growth prospects as the pace of new subscribers appeared to be headed for a slowdown.Starbucks, the US coffee chain, saw its shares decline 2.9 per cent to $57.43 on the week as it said same store sales fell short of estimates in its fiscal second quarter.The coffee company’s shares were struck by weakness in its European business. Global same store sales grew 7 per cent, below expectations of 8.2 per cent growth for the period.Despite revenues that rose almost 15 per cent to $3.2bn and record net income up 19 per cent to $309.9m in the quarter, shares in the company were among the weakest performers on Friday.Economic data for the week was also mixed. Housing figures on Tuesday suggested that home prices rose for the first time in 10 months and home sales picked up as well. Shares in two of the three largest listed homebuilders on the S&P 500, PulteGroup and Lennar Corp, were among the week’s best performers.Shares in the two homebuilders both made double-digit percentage gains. PulteGroup was up 20.3 per cent on the week to $10.07, while Lennar gained more than 13 per cent to $28.41.Jobless claims numbers came in higher than expected on Thursday, adding another piece of evidence to recent data that has shown a slowdown in the US labour recovery.But markets shrugged off the employment data and news of a slowdown in government spending were among the factors for first-quarter growth of the US economy to fall short of expectations. On Friday, economic growth for the three months to March 31 came in at 2.2 per cent, below expectations of an expansion of 2.7 per cent in the period.Still, the Vix index of implied volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, fell to its lowest level in two weeks. The Vix, also know as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, dropped more than 6 per cent to 16.33.
486;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;Starbucks coffee sales weak in Europe;Shares fall as sales miss estimates;Starbucks global sales growth fell short of estimates, sending the company’s stock lower in after-market trading in spite of a 19 per cent rise in profits and a lift in its full-year forecast.Net income in the three months ending April 1 rose to a record $309.9m, or 40 cents a share, from $261.6m or 34 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue climbed 14.7 per cent to $3.2bn from $2.8bn.But weakness in the coffee chain’s European stores disappointed analysts, who had forecast a 2.2 per cent rise in sales at stores open at least 13 months but instead found a 1 per cent drop. Global same-store sales rose 7 per cent, below forecasts of an 8.2 per cent gain.“The [European] macroeconomic environment is very, very difficulty and has taken a turn for the worse in the last couple months and that certainly impacts us,” said Troy Alstead, chief financial officer.But he added that he saw Europe’s troubles as “transitory” and said the company’s bid to revamp its business there is similar to the steps it took to revive its US business during the financial crisis.Meanwhile the company continued to see strong growth in Asia, with same-store sales up 18 per cent and revenue rising 32 per cent – the seventh straight quarter of sales growth above 20 per cent. In the Americas, Starbuck’s biggest region, sales rose 8.1 per cent.While other US-based companies including McDonald’s and Yum! Brands have reported slowing same-store growth in China, Mr Alstead said Starbucks had not seen similar weakness. “Traffic growth continues to grow at an incredible pace, and China still has the highest store profit of anywhere in the world,” he said.The company said it would accelerated planned openings in Asia to a net 400 new stores this year, with half located in China.Investors were disappointed by the lower-than-expected rise in same-store sales and concerns over the company’s profit margins, and Starbucks shares fell as much as 5 per cent in after-hours trading in New York.Commodity price pressures, particularly the higher cost of coffee, reduced operating income by $63.5m in the quarter and shaved 200 basis points off the company’s operating margin, which was flat at 13.5 per cent. Starbucks has raised its coffee prices in some of its 17,200 stores this year to keep pace with rising input costs.Starbucks said it expected commodity costs to add about $230m in costs pressure this year, but that most of that was already reflected in the first half of the year.Nevertheless, the company maintained its forecast that operating margin would improve by 50 to 100 basis points this year.Starbucks raised its estimate for revenue growth in 2012 to the low teens from an early target of 10 per cent, driven by same-store sales growth, a net 1,000 new stores and higher sales of packaged coffee. The company also raised its full-year earnings guidance to $1.81 to $1.84 a share from $1.78 to $1.82.
487;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”

You’re meeting investors and you’ve got explaining to do.Reality checkTalk about unlucky. Defined benefit pension schemes going through their three-yearly valuation are finding all-time low gilt yields make their liabilities look particularly (and unpleasantly) large, writes Alison Smith. Last time around, the schemes’ experience was differently horrid, as the valuations coincided with the immediate aftermath of the financial crash. But unfortunate timings do not mean companies should duck their funding responsibilities, as the Pensions Regulator makes clear today.In knocking back the argument made on behalf of employers that valuations could rely on a fantasy calculation in which gilt yields are higher and so deficits less yawning, the regulator is paying proper attention to the real world. Using any measure other than the market merely invites companies to pick numbers that suit them and then find ways of justifying them. That would be wrong even if we knew (which we don’t) how long quantitative easing will last – or indeed how to measure that policy’s contribution to the low gilt yields.Instead, the regulator intends to judge on a case-by-case basis which companies need more time to sort out deficits that could push them into insolvency. For a watchdog aiming to ensure that pensions are paid in full and on time and with the least possible recourse to the pension lifeboat, this is the right approach. Companies who care about their credibility should recognise that.Frothy fracasStarbucks baristas in the UK personalise each paper cup with the customer’s name. If Whitbread chief executive Andy Harrison ever mystery shops at his rival, he should get the title “Nemesis” written on his latte. Costa, Whitbread’s café chain, is a potent threat to Starbucks in Britain.The upstart bean grinder opened a net 175 stores here in 2011-12, taking the total to 1,392, well ahead of Starbucks’ 740. The margin edged up to 13 per cent across the whole Costa business, compared with just 6.5 per cent for Starbucks in the ragbag region known as “Emea”.Caffeine rather than competition from Costa is still more likely to keep Starbucks boss Howard Schultz awake at night. His chain has some 17,000 stores to Costa’s 2,200. But comparing the businesses still inspires day dreams among analysts of Whitbread demerging Costa from its lower-margin hotels and restaurant business. Together, they trade on forward earnings multiple of around 13.5 times, a chunky discount to Starbucks.For the moment, counter-arguments are more convincing. Whitbread is displaying managerial skill that might not survive a demerger. And the hotels can help finance a push into Asia.

489;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-04-22T23:02:16Z;Starbucks backs farmers’ loan fund;;Starbucks, the US coffee shop chain, is stumping up cash for a pioneering fund that will provide long-term loans to farmers, enabling them to produce more coffee, cocoa, bananas and other crops while securing supply for multinational buyers.Food and drink multinationals like Starbucks are increasingly focused on farmers– the root of their supply chains – as the growing middle classes around the world devour more resources, sparking fears over food security.Agri-traders such as Armajaro and food groups such as Nestlé have stepped up assistance to cocoa farmers in Ivory Coast and Ghana amid anticipation of a cocoa deficit and a desire to improve yields. This has included financial, technical and infrastructure assistance.However, the bulk of microfinance now available to subsistence farmers is directed at short-term or pre-harvest loans. This can help them buy fertilisers and other inputs, but does not help with new equipment or infrastructure.The new fund, set up by a trio including Grameen Foundation, the international arm of the Bangladeshi-based microfinancier, aims to help plug the gap. Fair-trade farmers in Latin America, where the fund will start, say more than half the $500m they need to cover their financing is for long-term loans.The fund, managed by Incofin Investment Management, aims to raise an initial $8m-$12m and reach $25m by year two. Starbucks, as anchor private investor, is putting in $1.3m. Further funding will be sought from development organisations, institutional investors and wealthy individuals, Grameen Foundation said.Ben Packard, head of responsibility at Starbucks, said that while such investments helped improve farmers’ livelihoods, private sector investment was a business decision rather than altruism. “This is not philanthropic,” he added.However, as suggested by the involvement of Fairtrade International, the non-governmental organisation, the funds will go to farmers who have already received fair-trade certification or are in the process of receiving it.Alex Counts, president and chief executive of Grameen Foundation, said lack of long-term financing presented a big challenge to subsistence farmers, who are unable to obtain conventional bank loans but want to expand.“If they could pull out an old coffee plantation and replant it with better quality, newer plants, it would pay for itself in three years. But they don’t have three-year money from any sources,” he said. “It’s riskier [for lenders] but it’s what is needed.”The fund is reckoning on a default rate of about 3 per cent and charging interest payments of 8-12 per cent, depending on the country.Investors in the fund will receive a 5 per cent nominal return, said Loïc De Cannière, managing director of Incofin. “Which is modest, we know, but combined with a high social return,” he said.
490;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;India’s IHC buys food producer Adelie;;Indian leisure company India Hospitality Corp has bought the UK’s Adelie Food Holding, a ready-made food producer, for just over $350m, as it banks on growth opportunities for quality fast food in India.IHC will take over Adelie from Duke Street Capital, the buy-out investor, which last year spent £215m to acquire the Asian noodle restaurant chain Wagamama from Lion Capital, another private equity group.The rising demand for quality fast food products among India’s growing middle class is one of the main reasons IHC acquired Adelie, said Ravi Deol, the entrepreneur who controls the Indian food group.“IHC is excited to own Adelie …with its inherent potential to grow it into a global player in this segment,” said Mr Deol.India’s food services retail market generated about $8.2bn in the year ending March 2011 and is forecast to grow more than 10 per cent annually in the next five years, according to Technopak, a retail market consultancy.Global food groups and retailers have recently been eyeing India’s consumer market because they view it as one of the world’s most promising regions for expansion.Starbucks unveiled long-awaited plans to bring its coffee shops to one of the world’s great tea-loving nations earlier this year through an $80m Indian joint venture with Tata Global Beverages.Starbucks aims to have as many as 50 stores by the end of this year and eventually to surpass its presence in China and open more than 3,000 stores.Dunkin’ Donuts, its main US competitor, has announced plans to open 80 to 100 Dunkin’ stores across India in the next five years.Analysts believe Adelie could benefit from India’s increasing development of shopping malls and the fast urbanisation triggered by the migration of many thousands of people from rural areas to cities such as Mumbai, New Delhi and Chennai.IHC’s businesses include three hotels, an airline catering operation and a collection of restaurant brands.The Mumbai-based company, which listed on London’s junior stock market in 2006, raising $103m, delisted from AIM in March because of poor volumes. Its share price plunged at the end of 2008 and the company reached a valuation as low as $20m last year.Adelie, which also owns Food Partners Group, produces high-quality take-away food products such as quiches, salads and sandwiches for many of the UK’s independent grocery retailers, coffee shop chains, contract caterers and airlines.Headquartered close to Heathrow, Europe’s busiest airport, it employs more than 3,000 people across seven manufacturing locations.Damian McNeela, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, said Adelie commanded about a fifth of the £3.7bn UK food-to-go market.The industry underwent a spate of consolidation last year, with Greencore – the market leader with 36 per cent of sales – buying sandwich-maker Uniq, and the biggest poultry provider for Tesco, run by entrepreneur Ranjit Singh Boparan, taking a controlling stake in Northern Foods.
491;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-04-11T09:39:32Z;Accepting an internship offer – a few tips;;"The moment has finally come. After months of networking, career services sessions and worrying, a company has offered you an internship.This is one of the big moments in the MBA experience. You are only in school for two years and three months of that will be spent working at a company trying to practise what you have learned. That works out to be nearly 15 per cent of your time in business school.There are a few things to think about: when, what and where.First, the timing. Many of the biggest employers come through early in the year. This is the case at Foster, where Microsoft, Amazon and Starbucks make offers early. If you get one of these offers, people are generally excited because they will be working at a great company with the possibility for long-term employment after graduation.However, there is also trepidation because of the unknown. What if these companies were not your preferred choice; what if they just made the offer first? I have spoken to a number of friends in this situation and it can be very difficult to turn down an offer. As the saying goes, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.Next, is the task. Say you get an offer focused on B2B marketing, but you want to hone your social media/B2C skills. What do you do now? Do you wait until another marketing position comes around and hope that you can land it, or do you accept the position and hope you can develop B2C skills somehow?Finally, comes the company. Maybe you want to work at a big company, but you get an early offer from a small company; maybe you want to work at a start up; maybe you want to work for a retail company but only industrial companies will speak to you. Do you double down or learn what you can over the summer?These are difficult questions and there will be different iterations for all people.Ultimately, it comes back to why you wanted to get an MBA and what you hope to learn over the course of the summer. Always knowing your end-goal can make these decisions much easier.Me? I am getting an MBA to help me get into finance, so I decided to accept my offer from a tech investment company in Seattle where I will learn about tracking portfolio performance and shareholder relations. I am sure that I made the right decision."
492;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Contest opens for £20m wave power prize;;Energy companies will be invited on Thursday to bid for a £20m prize to develop Britain’s first full-scale wave energy projects, helping to unlock a power source that ministers believe could generate up to a fifth of the UK’s energy needs.As an archipelago surrounded by choppy seas, the UK has always been seen as an obvious place to generate power from the motion of waves. But even after decades of research, no company has yet turned the idea into a money-spinner.Greg Barker, climate change minister, said the prize – to be shared by two winners this summer – could help move marine power to the next stage of development. It would pay for rows of tidal devices to be set in “array formation”, taking the country “one vital step closer” to the ambition of generating electricity from the sea.Worldwide, there are only about 80 companies developing wave and tidal devices, according to Angus McCrone, of the Bloomberg New Energy Finance research company.Of 15 wave and tidal companies considered leaders, about half are based in the UK, including Pelamis Wave Power and AWS Ocean Energy, which are both based in Scotland. Pelamis is testing a “snake” wave energy converter off the west coast of Orkney.Aviation and shipping emissions should be included in government carbon budgets, the climate watchdog has concluded, despite industry fears that such a move could make UK companies less competitive than rivals abroad, writes Pilita Clark.But the step should be taken in a way that does not add extra costs to either industry, according to the Committee on Climate Change, which advises the government on the five-year carbon budgets set to meet the UK’s legally binding target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions at least 80 per cent from 1990 levels by 2050.Shipping emission limits should be based on policies already adopted by the International Maritime Organisation, the committee said, while aviation targets should reflect the UK’s share of the cap set under the European Union’s emissions trading system.“The hope is that with a rising carbon price, that will reinforce incentives to put more efficient planes into the fleet and improve air traffic management,” said David Kennedy, CCC chief executive.The Sustainable Aviation industry group, which represents most leading UK airlines and airports, welcomed the committee’s decision not to recommend unilateral UK targets, as did the UK Chamber of Shipping.Aviation and shipping were initially left out of the carbon budgets established under the 2008 Climate Change Act, which set ceilings on emissions levels.The government is to take a decision on the committee’s advice before the end of the year.The £20m wave competition grant on offer is small compared to the £1bn carbon capture and storage contest ministers announced on Tuesday for the coal and gas industry.But it comes in what analysts say is a critical year for the fledgling wave and tidal industry, which has been struggling to produce large-scale, commercially viable projects.“Some companies are sounding confident about their devices, suggesting they are closer to commercialisation,” said Mr McCrone. “I think this could be an important year in which some companies could fail and others will prove the commercial viability of their projects.”Nevertheless, Mr Barker admitted that commercialisation could still be a decade away, leaving wave power trailing behind renewable energies such as wind, solar and biomass.However, Mr Barker argued that ultimately it had the potential to provide up to 20 per cent of UK energy by 2050 with British companies exporting technology around the world. “This has the potential to be bigger than North Sea oil because, unlike fossil fuels, the wind will never run out,” he said.The most ambitious plan to harness British sea power is the Severn tidal barrage, a scheme that is dusted down every few years by politicians but that remains a dream. The previous Labour government had offered a grant for the development of wave power but it had had no take-up from the industry.Mr Barker has launched a south-west marine energy park – linking university researchers and private companies – on the advice of Howard Schultz, chief executive of the coffee chain Starbucks.Mr Schultz advised him at a meeting with George Osborne, chancellor, that the best way to encourage business was to create “clusters” rather than cut red tape or offer tax breaks. A second marine energy park will be announced in the summer and is likely to be based in Scotland.
493;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-04-03T16:30:34Z;Whitbread finance chief to head up Costa;;Whitbread stoked analyst chatter of a demerger of Costa by appointing group finance director Christopher Rogers to head the rapidly-expanding coffee chain.Mr Rogers steps in as managing director of Costa replacing John Derkach who will become chief executive of restaurant group Tragus, the privately-held owner of UK restaurant chains including Strada and Café Rouge.Andy Harrison, chief executive of Whitbread, whose flagship brand is the budget hotel chain Premier Inn, has confronted questions of a possible break-up of the group since he took the helm in September 2010 and called it a “sensible” one to ask.Whitbread is focused on its five-year growth plan for Costa, announced last year, to double in size to 3,500 stores and 3,000 self-serve Costa Express machines. Costa overtook Starbucks as the biggest coffee chain in the UK by number of stores two years ago, but it is international growth – with 800 international stores, including a strong presence in Asia – that has made it the crown jewel of Whitbread, analysts say.However, Mr Harrison added: “Whilst Whitbread is the best owner for Costa now, you can’t say that in perpetuity and it is the board’s job to review what’s in the best interests of Whitbread shareholders.”Mr Harrison said he had approached Mr Rogers about taking up the Costa role adding that he has deep knowledge of the business.Geoff Collyer, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said investors would be relieved that the well-regarded Mr Rogers, aged 51 and once viewed as a possible successor to former chief executive Alan Parker, was staying at Whitbread.But he added that investors should not expect a demerger anytime soon. “If demerger was a near-term option, why is the MD leaving?” Mr Collyer said in a note.“We see an early demerger of Costa as potentially limiting the realisable value from the Costa growth plans for investors.”Jamie Rollo at Morgan Stanley said a demerger of Costa could be part of a three-pronged strategy to increase shareholder value, which included selling property and increasing its dividend.“Whitbread has been a good custodian, but we think Costa is now self-funding, large enough to be separately listed, sits in a peer group enjoying high multiples, and could benefit from more focus on overseas expansion,” Mr Rollo said.“Demerging would not give away value as investors could choose whether to sell their shares or not.”Deutsche Bank, Whitbread’s house broker, is forecasting a 26 per cent rise in revenues at Costa for the year to February, compared with 6 per cent growth at Premier Inn, which contributes most of Whitbread’s profits.
494;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;Taking stock of arabica coffee performance;Price fall scuppers Brazil’s plans to release stocks;"Coffee drinkers rejoice. Coffee farmers not so much.Arabica coffee, the higher quality bean loved by espresso aficionados, has been the worst-performing agricultural commodity this year, down almost 20 per cent since the start of 2012.The drop is a far cry from last year: arabica coffee prices hit a 34-year high in March 2011 amid fears of a shortage. Since then, much has changed. From a peak of $3.089 per pound nearly a year ago, prices are down roughly 40 per cent to $1.851 per pound.Inventories of high-quality beans remain low, but the threat of a shortage has vanished as Brazil is expected to see a bumper harvest this year.Brazil is the world’s largest coffee producer and the outlook for a large crop has prompted hedge funds and other speculators to bet on lower prices. Short positions started to accumulate after mid-January, when Brazilian producers started to forward sell their crop to lock in prices. With no buying support from consumers, the market went into a “technical spiral” downwards, says Rabobank, the Dutch bank that is one of the biggest lenders to the agribusiness industry.The hedge funds have accumulated the largest net short positions since 2007.While the tumble in prices might be good news for coffee drinkers – and chains such as Starbucks – it has scuppered the plans of the Brazilian government to sell its stocks.At the start of the year, Brazil, which supplies about a quarter of global coffee, said it planned on releasing its state-controlled stockpile to take advantage of the high price of arabica coffee. The announcement weighed on prices, as Brazil controls stocks equal to roughly one per cent of global supplies.Conab, Brazil’s official crop bureau, said after its last coffee auction in January, that a second auction scheduled for February had to be cancelled due to administrative problems. By the time this had been resolved, prices were already too low to sell. Conab no longer expects to clear its stocks before the 2012-13 bumper harvest in May. The coffee authorities have a stockpile from the 2009-10 crop which they bought to support prices.The Brazilian government is facing a catch 22 situation: it cannot sell its stocks because prices are too low; but with inventories dating back to as early as 2000-01, it has not much space left to buy this crop season if prices plunge further and it needs to support the country’s farmers.The stock building since 2000 has left Conab with beans more than 10 years old, and Brazilian rules will force the agency to sell the oldest stocks first. Old beans usually trade at a discount to new beans. According to Conab, its 2002-2003 stockpile totals 3.98m kg, and 1.9m kg in 2008-09. While these amounts are negligible, its 2009-10 stocks are more significant at 91m kg.The market does not expect Conab to sell soon, but the overhang is not helping sentiment. Hedge funds could still harvest more profits betting down."
495;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-03-26T02:15:13Z;A bit rash to write off cash so soon;;From Mr Ron Delnevo.Sir, Maija Palmer’s article heralding a so-called cashless future (“More flash than cash”, Analysis March 21) comes as a surprise in the week the Payments Council announced that UK cash withdrawals last year reached an all-time high.The article also fails to consider the fact that the vast majority of retailers and consumers are far better served by cash payments.The British Retail Consortium recently concluded that “cash remains king” for retailers, noting that card payments are far more expensive to process than those using cash (an average cash transaction costs 1.7p in transportation and banking costs, while credit card payments cost 37.1p). Furthermore, retailers without the global scale of Starbucks (one of the main examples in Ms Palmer’s article) do not find it as easy to subsidise the installation of expensive contactless equipment, or strike bulk deals that might somewhat reduce the heavy cost of processing debit and credit card payments.Little wonder then that Visa itself refuses to disclose the number of contactless transactions that took place over the last year, but concedes that “low acceptance levels” of contactless payments are “preventing usage from becoming an everyday habit”.Ron Delnevo, Director, Payments CouncilManaging Director, Bank MachineHatfield, Herts, UK
496;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:08:53+0000;New McDonald’s chief left with tricky task;;"When Jim Skinner took over as chief executive of McDonald’s almost eight yeas ago, the hamburger chain was in its darkest moment.The company’s chief executive, Jim Cantalupo, died of a heart attack after just 16 months in the job in April 2004. Seven months later his successor, Charlie Bell, resigned after being diagnosed with cancer, leaving the post to Mr Skinner, who was billed the “accidental CEO”.McDonald’s was also hit by negative publicity. The documentary Super Size Me was playing in cinemas, showing the world through film-maker Morgan Spurlock’s diet the dire effects of subsisting on McDonald’s.“Everything was going wrong for McDonald’s,” says Steve West, analyst at ITG Investment Research. “The restaurants were disgusting and the food was horrible. The best thing that happened to McDonald’s was Super Size Me.”McDonald’s announced on Wednesday that Mr Skinner would retire this summer, ending a 41-year career that he began as a trainee restaurant manager in Carpentersville, Illinois. The 67-year-old will be replaced by Don Thompson, who has been chief operating officer since 2010.Mr Skinner, an architect of the company’s “plan to win” strategy that has become a playbook for the fast-food industry, leaves with the reputation as a turnround artist and leaves his successor with the challenging task of maintaining the company’s momentum.Last year, McDonald’s recorded its strongest comparable store sales in the US since 2006 and plans to invest $2.9bn this year to open another 1,300 outlets, including nearly 175 in the US, 250 across Europe and 250 in China.In February, it had its 106th consecutive month of positive same-store sales growth in the US. Its stock price has soared more than 200 per cent since Mr Skinner took the top job, eclipsing $100 a share this year.“It’s been one successful product after the next,” says Peter Saleh, restaurant analyst at Telsey Advisory Group. “They changed their methodology to find out what consumers were interested in before coming to market with new products.”McDonald’s has thrived in recent years by focusing on the breakfast trade and expanding its beverages, while continuing to cater to recession-weary diners with its dollar menu. It has put pressure on rivals such as Yum! Brands, Burger King and Wendy’s, while displacing Starbucks, Smoothie King and even cereal makers in serving the breakfast market. “They’ve revolutionised the entire industry,” Mr West says.In spite of those successes, Mr Skinner’s tenure was marred by many of the controversies that have plagued McDonald’s for years and that Mr Thompson will face when he takes over. The company continues to be targeted by public health and animal rights groups for its contribution to the growing obesity epidemic and the treatment of the animals it consumes.“[Mr] Skinner’s pride was a ‘plan to win’ that largely made children’s health the loser,” says Sara Deon of Corporate Accountability International. She notes that obesity rates among children and Hispanics, on whom McDonald’s focuses much of its marketing, have risen disproportionately during Mr Skinner’s time as chief executive.“Parents and health professionals would like to see CEO Skinner take Ronald McDonald and the suite of McDonald’s predatory marketing practices into retirement with him,” she adds.Although a lot of attention has been focused on McDonald’s efforts to sell premium hamburgers and high-end coffee, Mr Skinner has worked to change its public image by replacing its playgrounds with flatscreen televisions and wireless internet, lowering the profile of Ronald McDonald, its mascot, and selling more apples and fewer French fries to children.“They’ve changed the perception of food quality, what a McDonald’s restaurant should look like and what it means to work there,” says Sara Senatore, Bernstein Research analyst, noting that the biggest changes have been in Europe. “The French used to call it ‘mal boeuf’ and people would joke about having McJobs.”Analysts say Mr Thompson’s challenge will be matching his predecessor’s success and fending off rivals that seek to replicate McDonald’s strategy.Yum! Brands, the operator of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, remains dominant in China and Asia; Wendy’s and Burger King have been improving ingredients and upmarket “better burger” chains are evolving from fad to trend status in the US, eating into McDonald’s core business.“When your stores are generating that much money, the question is how do you keep growing?” said Darren Tristano, executive vice-president of restaurant consultants Technomic.……………………………………………………………..Engineer set to take the helmIf McDonald’s is sometimes compared to a well-oiled juggernaut, it is only fitting that its next chief executive, Don Thompson, is a trained engineer, writes Alan Rappeport.The Chicago native and 22-year McDonald’s veteran began his career as an electrical engineer at Northrop Corporation, the defence contractor, and after joining the restaurant chain in 1990 worked his way up the operations side of the business.Mr Thompson has flipped burgers, turned round the troubled San Diego market, been in charge of the Midwest division and was president of McDonald’s USA.Analysts expect the transition to be relatively smooth, especially compared with the turmoil that surrounded Jim Skinner’s ascension to chief executive when tragedies struck his two predecessors.However, Mr Skinner’s retirement has come sooner than some analysts predicted and the company will now have to find a new chief operating officer to fill Mr Thompson’s role.In a 2007 interview with the Financial Times, Mr Skinner contemplated his retirement and joked that his successor would have big shoes to fill.“We have learnt through our own distress regarding potential leaders at McDonald’s [that] it’s important to have people available to do the job,” he said. “We have a lot of people who could do this job. Probably none as well as me.”Mr Thompson’s rise is a testament to his patience. Other top executives, including the company’s previous chief operating officer, decided to leave McDonald’s after losing hope that they would replace Mr Skinner.According to a report in Crains Chicago Business last year, Mr Thompson considered leaving the company early in his career, but stayed on at the advice of McDonald’s diversity chief, who urged him to switch from developing robotics and electronics to operations.When he takes over the chief executive post from Mr Skinner in June, Mr Thompson will be one of the most high profile African-American chief executives in the US.“I’m humbled to take the baton as chief executive of McDonald’s,” Mr Thompson said, adding that he would continue to modernise the company’s 33,000 restaurants and expand the menu beyond its traditional hamburgers and fries."
497;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:08:53+0000;Private equity can prove worth in debt drought;Investment capital still available to businesses that had a good credit crunch;Private equity would wither on the vine without a supply of cheap debt to help it fructify, Jeremiahs once claimed. But the asset class is proving more durable than that, judging from the €4.3bn raised by Apax Partners in the first instalment of its Apax VIII buyout fund. Last month BC Partners closed a €6.5bn European fund. Easy capital and easy returns may no longer be available. The private equity juggernaut rolls on undaunted.During the asset bubble of the noughties, the business model of private equity firms was pretty simple. Buy an undervalued business, putting up about 20 per cent of the price yourself and borrowing the rest more cheaply than trade bidders could from complicit banks. Sweat the company hard for three to five years while corporate asset prices jumped. Then sell the company at a premium, with the upside multiplying the value of the equity investment.With banks shrinking their balance sheets and share prices volatile, that old black magic no longer works. But investment capital is still available to private equity businesses that had a good credit crunch, such as Apax, whose 2007 fund is returning 4 per cent annually.One consequence of the debt crisis is that big US names such as Carlyle, Blackstone and KKR have been raising funds to invest in distressed corporate loans. Another is that the ratio of debt to equity in plain vanilla buyouts is closer to 50/50 than 80/20. Private equity houses now sometimes even put up the debt themselves, thereby joining the burgeoning shadow banking industry.If funds of the current 2012 vintage perform, captains of private equity may prove a useful point: that they can generate returns as doer-uppers of businesses, not just as free riders on the asset cycle. Who knows? Perhaps one day they may even compete on level terms with proper, horny-handed entrepreneurs, without the tail wind of tax-deductible debt finance or the inequitable enrichment of carried interest.Third Place space raceA “third place” is somewhere people mingle democratically, according to sociologists, such as a pub or barber shop. But to flexible workspace tycoon Mark Dixon it is somewhere white collar workers toil aside from the office or home. A Starbucks, or maybe a park bench. Regus, the company Mr Dixon founded, aspires to provide third places too. Anyone whose employer pays for it can use Regus business lounges in French railway stations or airports such as Schiphol.This is intelligent opportunism, reflecting the vigour of a company whose core business remains subletting office space in small chunks with services thrown in. Profits before tax and exceptionals almost doubled to £45.5m in the year to 2011. Regus’s sluggish UK birthplace contributed just 11 per cent of gross profit from its established estate, against 15 per cent from Asia Pacific and 46 per cent from the Americas.Yet the shares slipped almost 8 per cent on Tuesday. The market winced at faster than expected growth in new business centres, recalling that Regus’s US offshoot spent most of 2003 in Chapter 11 protection, following an ill-judged expansion. But Mr Dixon appears to be judging the cycle better this time. Regus has scope to ride the coat-tails of other multinationals into new markets. The shares are affordable on a forward earnings multiple of 16.7 times.Hold that thoughtThe outsourcing of 999 call handling is such an obvious way of improving public sector efficiency it is a wonder it has not been done before. The private sector has huge experience of cutting costs on inbound phone traffic. Anyone who has spent 50 minutes waiting to speak to a utility that has unexpectedly cut off their water knows that.It is axiomatic that the first point of contact should be automated. An appropriate voice message would be: “Press ‘one’ for police, ‘two’ for ambulances, ‘three’ for the fire brigade and ‘four’ for the AA, our affinity marketing partner. They really are the fourth emergency service!”Callers would then be put on hold for an extended period, during which a tinny recording of Vivaldi’s The Seasons alternated with the news that they were valued customers. Giving them the address of a self-help website would be one refinement. Here, the public would find tips for dousing a domestic blaze or effecting a citizen’s arrest.The public might not like that. But it would make little difference to business owners who long ago gave up expecting the police to respond usefully to a theft or burglary on their premises.
498;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-03-20T20:38:25Z;Finance: More flash than cash;New payment systems are raising concerns about privacy and security;It was an assignment out of a Dick Tracy cartoon strip. Last year, Lucas Scheybal challenged himself to live for two weeks in New York handling no cash or payment cards – instead using only a futuristic watch with a wireless chip.It turned out to be easy. With a swipe of the device across a special reader, he was able to buy coffee at 7-Eleven or Starbucks, meals from outlets including McDonald’s and Subway, as well as cinema tickets and even petrol. “I did survive. Gasoline and food were not a problem. It was easy getting around New York because there are 20,000 taxis that accept contactless payments,” he says.Mr Scheybal received some odd looks. His company, Laks, has only recently brought out its Watch2Pay system, and it is not yet widely used. But the idea of paying or transferring money with a single tap of a new-style bank card or a text message is increasingly common. Laks’ wrist-worn devices are among dozens of alternatives to notes, coins and traditional cards that are on trial.Google has linked up with the MasterCard payment system and US telecoms operator Sprint to bring out its Wallet service for making one-tap payments with a mobile phone. La Caixa, the Spanish retail bank, has flooded Barcelona with contactless payment cards and terminals enabling payment in any shop with a single tap of a card. From the realm of online retail, cashless consumer transactions are spreading to the street – faster than was possible while they still relied on the previous generation of cards fed into a reader and requiring a personal identification number.Nor is all this innovative activity confined to the west. Indeed, developing countries with their limited networks of traditional banks can show the most rapid take-up. In Kenya, a system of mobile payments called M-Pesa has become an alternative banking service for 15m people. According to a 2010 report from the Central Bank of Kenya, the value of transactions being carried out using M-Pesa amounted to Ks727.8bn ($8.81bn), as people use mobile phones to pay school fees, collect their salaries, shop for groceries and buy everything from beer to airline tickets.“I was joking with the governor of the Kenyan national bank that he doesn’t need to print money any more, as M-Pesa is taking over,” says Michael Joseph, the former chief executive of Safaricom, which pioneered the M-Pesa network in Kenya.A number of countries – including Turkey, Sweden, Estonia, the Philippines, South Korea and Japan – have started to discuss ending the use of cash all together. One of the most prominent campaigns has been in Sweden, where the anti-cash lobby group has high-profile support from Abba’s Björn Ulvaeus, co-writer of pop hits including “Money, Money, Money”.So is cash on the way out? If so, what are the implications for citizens, businesses and governments? And, in a world where the notion of a cashless society has long ranked alongside the paperless office as something frequently predicted but never achieved, what factors will now make it work?One reason experts believe we could be coming to a tipping point is that smartphones have made it easy not just to make but also to receive electronic payments. Gadgets and services are emerging that can turn any phone into a virtual cash till – just as accessible for small traders such as window cleaners and babysitters, who have hitherto had to operate on a cash basis, as for bigger enterprises.Square, launched last year by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, and iZettle, a Swedish start-up, have both developed card readers that can be attached to the bottom of an iPhone to take payments. Ingenico, a French provider of transaction terminals, is developing something similar.Salvation Army bell-ringers in a number of cities across the US used Square to take donations last Christmas. Earlier in the year, girl scouts in Ohio used devices made by American software company Intuit to take payments for cookies, a move that reportedly increased sales by 13 per cent.With the Pingit service, launched in the UK last month by Barclays bank, people need not even attach a device to their phone. They can send payments from mobile to mobile simply using the recipient’s phone number. “As the mobile replaces the shop payment terminal, suddenly the whole scenario changes. It is the crucial pivot for electronic payments,” says Dave Birch, director of Consult Hyperion, an electronic transactions consultancy.Cash is unhygienic, risky and inefficient, say those who yearn to escape dependence on filthy lucre in its physical form. Apart from bacteria accumulated through the handling of notes and coins by thousands of people before they are retired after a few years, one in 10 banknotes in Britain carries traces of cocaine, according to a 2011 UK police study.Large-denomination notes in particular are associated with organised crime. The UK banned the use of the €500 bill in 2010 because the country’s Serious Organised Crime Agency estimated that about 90 per cent of them were being used for purposes such as money-laundering. The Swedish bank workers’ trade union argues that counter staff would be less vulnerable to robberies if they did not have to store cash on the premises.Some economists are concerned that a move to electronic payments could dilute governments’ ability to influence the economy by controlling the money supply. “The central bank has control over the monetary system because it can produce cash. If it can’t do that, it is not obvious whether it can still influence the system,” says Andrew Scott, professor of economics at London Business School.But Jon Matonis, an e-money consultant and author of The Monetary Future blog, maintains this is a concern only if shifting to electronic payments also involves moving to a different, non-government-issued currency. Most existing payment schemes, such as Google Wallet, are linked to a regular bank account holding national currency. It makes little difference to central monetary control whether the populace uses these or physical notes and coins.Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google, recently revealed that the internet company had considered issuing its own currency, Google Bucks, but had moved away from the idea because of the complex regulations that surround such schemes.Alternative currencies are beginning to gain ground, however. For instance, Facebook credits costing 10 US cents each can be used to pay for digital items on the social networking site. They are most commonly used for buying things such as virtual tractors and shovels in games including Farmville, but a number of film studios have experimented with letting people rent films online in exchange for Facebook credits.Some retailers, such as Shoebuy.com, the online footwear store, are using Facebook credits as incentives, offering a certain number with every purchase of their goods. Facebook, which is in the process of applying for money transmitter licences across the US to legitimise the scheme, takes a 30 per cent cut on every purchase and last year generated $557m from payments.If the use of such credits continues to spread, it would be a step towards the vision of Friedrich Hayek, the Nobel prizewinning economist, who argued as far back as 1976 that companies could compete with governments to issue money.One main obstacle has been the difficulty for people to keep track of the value of multiple competing currencies. Technology is starting to solve this problem. “With an electronic wallet on a mobile phone, the cost of adding another currency collapses. You can pay in pounds or dollars, or kilowatt hours, and it is just another menu on the handset,” says Dave Birch at Consult Hyperion, a payments consultancy.Apart from anything else, there is a cost to handling cash, in terms of storing, guarding and shifting it. A 2010 report by Visa cited a European Commission estimate that the cost to society of all payment methods is the equivalent of about 2-3 per cent of Europe’s GDP, of which cash accounts for two-thirds. A 2008 study by the McKinsey consultancy estimated that in Europe €60bn-€100bn annually is spent on processing cash payments, a figure that includes the production of notes and coins, transport and security. A similar study by the Dutch central bank puts the price tag at €300 per family. A number of Dutch supermarkets are talking about moving exclusively to cashless payments by 2014, in part to get away from cash handling costs. The motivation is the same for governments.In the UK, the percentage of cash transactions has already declined from about 73 per cent of all those taking place in 1999 to just 59 per cent in 2009, according to the Payments Council, the body responsible for ensuring that the country’s payment services work. During the same period, direct transfers from accounts and debit cards have increased rapidly. The council said the decline could accelerate as mobile payments take off, and that by 2050 using cash could be a minority activity.Economists have been puzzling for decades what a move away from cash might mean for the economy and the central money supply. Governments, after all, earn money from seigniorage – the profit from issuing coins and notes rated at more than their intrinsic value. The US Treasury department, for example, received $77bn in profits from the Federal Reserve in 2011. As long as most cashless payment systems are denominated in national currencies, as they are today, they are unlikely to change the government’s control over money supply.For now, however, while electronic payments remain mainly linked to national currencies, the biggest issues are security and privacy.Consumers are worried about thieves stealing their mobile phones and gaining access to their electronic wallet. A YouGov survey last year found that 20 per cent of UK consumers were concerned about security of mobile payments. These concerns are being addressed by protecting both the phone and the payments application with pin codes. Most mobile payment services permit just £15 to be spent before requiring a security code.Privacy is harder to deal with. Proponents of electronic payments, such as Visa, argue that they increase users’ command over their finances. “If I had taken out £40 from an ATM, I might have no idea where it went. With a mobile wallet, I can ask it for information – what my balance is, what my credit line is, and get electronic receipts. I can even arrange them in a pie chart to show how I am spending my money,” says Sandra Alzetta, head of mobile business and innovation at Visa Europe. “It provides me with a feeling of control and being able to budget. Consumers get that and like it very much.”But the idea that retailers, or governments, might be similarly tracking our spending through a trail of transactions raises fears. Some governments, such as France’s, have already indicated they hope moves to electronic spending will help cut criminality. It is estimated that Italy, a heavily cash-based economy, loses more than €100bn in unpaid tax every year. Notably, one of Mario Monti’s first acts upon taking over as Italian prime minister last November was to ban cash transactions of more than €1,000.A number of companies are planning to use electronic wallets to target consumers with personalised offers. “It’s aimed at making it easier for you to pay for and save on the goods you want, while giving merchants more ways to offer coupons and loyalty programs to customers,” Google wrote in a blog posting announcing the Wallet concept last May.But Google and others are already facing controversy over how they handle consumers’ private information, and these concerns are likely to be amplified when it comes to their use of data about people’s finances. “It is a human rights issue. You can’t take away people’s transactional privacy,” says Jon Matonis, an e-money consultant and author of The Monetary Future blog. “Do we really want a future in which there are no private transactions? It is not a world I would want to live in.“If a woman wants to have a private abortion, she can only do that in cash – or if a husband wants to support an illegitimate child without his wife knowing, he has to make those payments in cash. Privacy is only possible in cash, every other form is trace­able,” he says.For this reason, many believe cash will survive as a payment method. “Whether it is for illegal activity such as the drug trade or just for buying Christmas presents, there will always be a need for something like that,” says Professor Andrew Scott of London Business School.“Just as we have seen a huge reduction in the number of coins in use, we will see a huge reduction in cash. Whether it is going to be 10 per cent or 50 per cent less than today, we don’t know. But it is unlikely to ever disappear altogether.”
499;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-03-20T10:09:01Z;Regus confident of mobile working trend;;Regus is pressing ahead with plans to open business lounges and serviced offices in railway stations, motorway service areas and airports as globalisation and better technology increase the number of workers on the move.The Luxembourg-based company, which has 1,200 offices in 94 countries, has signed deals with Shell and SNCF, the state-owned rail operator in France, as well as the Dutch train operator NS Trains and Schipol Airport in Amsterdam. It has also expanded its global footprint and expects to open a further 200 serviced offices this year, up from 139 last year, as it edges towards a target of 2,000 locations by 2014.“Coffee shops have their place but there is a lot of work that is difficult to get done and people do want somewhere quieter,” said Mark Dixon, chief executive. “It’s culture meets technology and it’s colliding with the office market.”Although Regus is expanding its offerings and its footprint to countries including Madagascar, Cambodia and Papua New Guinea, it is still heavily reliant upon its mature offices – centres that have been open for two years or more – which last year comprised about 90 per cent of total turnover. Just over 20 per cent of revenues, however, are coming from services other than offices, such as people dropping into business lounges, up from about 10 per cent four years ago.This helped the group report a 12 per cent year on year increase in 2011 revenues to £1.2bn, and a near six-fold jump in pre-tax profit to £45.5m. On an underlying basis, excluding the 2010 restructuring charges, operating profit doubled to £50.6m.The rise in profits indicated the FTSE 250 company had recovered from a poor 2010 when it took a hit from extensive restructuring in the UK and investment in overseas offices. But the shares fell 7.8 per cent to 104p as Mr Dixon warned the economic environment remained challenging.Regus, whose customers include Starbucks, TomTom, Disney and Adobe, offers ready-to-use offices for short-term rentals, as well as drop-in business lounges for mobile workers. Regus also provides meeting rooms, video communication studios, reception facilities, phone messaging and other business support services.Diluted earnings per share for the 12 months to December 31 rose from 0.2p to 4p, and the company proposed a final dividend of 2p, making a full-year payout of 2.9p , compared with the previous year’s 2.6p.Mike Allen at Panmure Gordon said: “We expect 2012 to be another year of significant growth for the company, though this will not come through in earnings per share figures given development costs.“We do not expect consensus forecasts to change materially on the back of these results,” he added.
500;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks: slow-brewed;Chain coffee shops may not travel as well as burger joints;It should be the smell of hamburgers, not coffee, motivating Howard Shultz and his team at Starbucks. Because McDonald’s has done exactly what Starbucks needs to do: take a powerful American brand and make it work on globally. So far, Starbucks has not quite proved itself up to the task.International sales contribute just over a fifth of Starbucks revenues and profits. Store count and revenue in Europe since 2009 have risen 10 per cent and 31 per cent respectively. The corresponding figures for Asia are 20 per cent and 64 per cent. Impressive numbers, but because margins are very low in Europe, and Asia is still tiny relative to the overall company, the overseas business remains stunted.At McDonald’s, margins are almost as high in Europe as in the US, and stores outside the US and Europe contribute a fifth of sales. More than half of all profits are international. Bulls will see Starbucks’ domestic bias as an opportunity for growth. But the record to date suggests that chain coffee shops may not travel as well as burger joints.There are other parts to Starbucks’ growth story. It is aggressively pushing sales of drinks served (and most often sold) outside its restaurants – including packets of instant coffee and pods for single-serving machines. The company’s goal is for these to represent half of operating profits within a decade, up from an eighth now – an ambitious target that has captured the imagination of Wall Street analysts.But where Starbucks has succeeded so well up to now is in its shops. Competing outside of them takes it on to fundamentally new, and therefore risky, terrain. Those buying Starbucks’ premium-priced shares must be sure the core business has growth ahead, and should watch Asian growth and European margins before all else.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com

On Tuesday, the benchmark index had suffered its worst day in nearly three months but had recouped all its losses and was up 0.3 per cent for the week.“We had seen a little weakness in the surveys leading up to Friday’s report and there was a bit of growing concern that we would miss the consensus number. But it came in line with expectations and the story continues to be that the economy is improving,” said Brad Sorensen, director of market research at Charles Schwab.“We are starting to see a bit of a move away from the risk on, risk off mentality that dominated last year. We still have a way to go, but the starting signs are there,” he added.Homebuilders were among the best performers, with Lennar leading the pack, adding another 3.1 per cent to its gains for the week to close at $25.45. The company was up 12.2 per cent since Monday’s open. Close behind were DR Horton, up 6.3 per cent to $15.47, and PulteGroup, up 3.7 per cent to $9.02. The homebuilders added 11.4 per cent and 8.2 per cent respectively on the week.Financials were slightly positive for the week after reports that there would be a payout for holders of credit default swaps. Markets were settled by late Thursday’s announcement that at least 85 per cent of Greek bondholders had agreed to participate in the €206bn debt exchange. JPMorgan gained 1.8 per cent to $41.03 and Citigroup rose 1.8 per cent to $34.20 on the week.The oil and gas explorer Anadarko Petroleum gained 2 per cent to $85.25 on Friday as the Texas company said it had resolved a tax dispute with an Algerian producer. That could net Anadarko up to $4.4bn over the next few years, according to a report.Overall, the benchmark US index has climbed 9.2 per cent in the year to date. US equities have now doubled from lows sustained this time three years ago, according to Tobias Levkovich, an equity strategist at Citigroup.“Panicked investors feared the onset of a new economic depression at the time, and it did not materialise. Nonetheless, the memory of that experience still has a post-traumatic-like impact on investor psyche that may take years to heal fully, as the S&P 500 had plunged almost 52 per cent in the two years leading up to that March 9 [2009] price point,” he said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1 per cent to 12,922.02, down 0.2 per cent for the week. Walmart, the world’s largest retailer by sales, climbed 0.5 per cent to $60.04 on the blue-chip heavy index on Friday.Cyclical material stocks were among the worst hit this week as fears of a slowdown in China were stoked by the country’s adjustment of its target growth rate on Monday.Aluminium maker Alcoa dropped more than 4.5 per cent for the week to finish at $9.81. Copper miner Freeport-McMoRan fell over 9.6 per cent dropping to $38.78. US Steel Corp rallied 3.6 per cent on Friday to $26.85, but was still down 2.6 per cent for the week.The Nasdaq Composite index got within 10 points of hitting 3,000 – a threshold it crossed during trading last week for the first time since the dotcom boom 11 years ago. The tech heavy index ended the week up 0.6 per cent to 2,988.64.Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, maker of the Keurig single-cup coffee system, tumbled 15.7 per cent to $52.59 on Friday after Starbucks announced plans to introduce a rival product, Verismo, late on Thursday. Shares in Starbucks gained 2.9 per cent to $51.84 on the day.“We would use any overreaction to the obvious move by Starbucks to enter automated espresso as a buying opportunity in [Green Mountain] during a period when [the company] just enjoyed incredible momentum during the holiday selling season,” said Scott Van Winkle, retail analyst at Canaccord, who reiterated the firm’s “buy” rating on Green Mountain shares.Shares in Apple climbed 0.6 per cent to $545.17, up just 0.1 per cent on the week. The consumer technology company unveiled the latest iterations of its products on Wednesday, including a third generation of its popular iPad tablet.Groupon, the e-coupon company, gained 0.5 per cent to $17.06 but was off 10.2 per cent for the week. Renren, the Chinese social networking site, rose 0.9 per cent to $5.40 on Friday after it said it had swung to a profit in its fourth quarter.First Solar, the renewable energy company, rose 5.1 per cent to $27.49 on Friday, but lost 8.4 per cent for the week. At one point, the company touched its lowest level in six years as pressure on the solar industry is driven by Chinese competition and decreased levels of government subsidies.
502;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-03-09T19:59:40Z;Rivals eye Nestlé’s captive coffee market;;"Last week two more manufacturers woke up and smelt the coffee – more precisely, the pricey coffee capsules that comprised more than SFr3.5bn (£2.4bn) in sales last year to Nestlé, the world’s biggest food company.Nestlé’s Nespresso coffee machine has been dubbed “the closest thing to a luxury brand within fast-moving consumer goods” by Jamie Isenwater, analyst at Deutsche Bank. It operates on a “locked-in” machine-and-capsule system aimed at preventing the use of a rival’s coffee. The business model results in higher sales densities at its stores than at Louis Vuitton, Mr Isenwater says.Hence the flood of followers, including supermarkets and US coffee groups. This week Starbucks and Dualit, the privately held British group known for its retro-look toasters, revealed efforts to grab more share in a market worth some $6bn.Nestlé finds this sort of imitation anything but flattering and has sought to fight it through the courts as well as highly controlled marketing and distribution.In Switzerland, it has begun legal action against a rival compatible capsule and a product introduced by a subsidiary of the country’s biggest supermarket chain, both of which sell for about half the price of branded Nespresso capsules.Separately, it has taken legal action against the US food group Sara Lee in France, Belgium and the Netherlands.Alex Gort-Barten, director of Dualit, likens Nestlé’s closed system to “me saying you could only put my bread in a Dualit toaster”.He adds: “It’s a total captive monopoly but it’s beginning to weaken around the edges because people are finding ways around the system.”Dualit, in addition to making its own capsules, plans to introduce its own brewers this year. Starbucks, which began selling capsules at the end of last year, is bringing out its Verismo machines through an alliance with privately held Krueger of Germany.“The premium single-cup segment is the fastest-growing business within the global coffee industry,” said Howard Schultz, Starbucks chairman and chief executive, presenting its coffee machines on Thursday.In the quarter century since Nespresso’s launch, Nestlé has helped to protect its money-spinner by means of an array of patents which it has staunchly defended in the courts, writes Haig Simonian.Thousands of separate patents involve both the individual coffee capsules and their composition, as well as the “delivery system” of the machines that injects steam and water into the product. While the capsules are produced by Nespresso itself, which has now invested about SFr500m ($544m) into a second plant substantially bigger than its initial, overstretched site, the machines are made by third parties.The phalanx of legal protection of Nestlé’s intellectual property has not, however, prevented mimics, with about 50 different systems on the market.Nestlé’s focus has always been on those rivals who are making capsules that fit Nespresso machines. Invariably, these have undercut the price of the latter’s own branded capsules – sometimes by as much as 50 per cent.There are three important legal challenges.In Switzerland, the Denner low-cost subsidiary of Migros – the country’s biggest supermarket chain – last year launched cut-price compatible rivals. Nestlé has won the initial legal rounds.A second challenge is from the Ethical Coffee Company, set up by a former Nespresso executive.In France, Belgium and the Netherlands, Nestlé has taken action against the Sara Lee company.Product plans form Nestlé’s most closely guarded secrets. But speculation has suggested electronic identification technology to enable future machines to recognise and function only with Nespresso-branded capsules. Nespresso has – characteristically – declined to comment.Projections from Euromonitor bear him out. The data consultancy expects the market to be worth $8.5bn in five years’ time.Austerity-hit western Europe, an unexciting market for many purveyors of consumer goods, is where the fiercest coffee wars are being staged. Everyone from supermarkets, which have launched their own versions, through to ex-Nestlé executives, are filling the shelves with copycat capsules.Ethical Coffee Company, set up by Jean-Paul Gaillard, a former head of Nespresso, expects to more than double its capsule sales to 700m this year. It is also planning its first machine – which will accept rivals’ capsules – this autumn, and to enter the UK and Belgium this year.Mr Gaillard is unfazed by his former employer’s slew of patents and lawsuits. Ethical Coffee has its own case against an unnamed respondent in France for alleged industrial espionage and reckons there are only six main patents on Nespresso capsules, half of which he considers irrelevant.“In short, we have more lawsuits against Nestlé than they have against us. We don’t infringe any of their patents whatsoever,” he said.Nestlé demurs. “As the category leader, we’ll continue to take the appropriate actions to protect the intellectual property that has driven growth and innovation for both Nespresso and the portioned coffee segment,” a spokesman said last year.“Our innovation is the result of more than 25 years of Nestlé R&D investment as well as the passion and hard work of more than 5,500 employees.”So strong is that protection, Nestlé will not even say whether the Nespresso works with rival capsules. The answer, according to non-affiliated retailers of the machines, as well as rivals such as Dualit and Ethical Coffee, is yes.Very early signs that rivals are moving slowly into Nespresso territory can be seen in its still robust but slowing sales growth. In 2006, the sixth consecutive year of sales growth in excess of 30 per cent, sales topped SFr1bn. In 2010 year-on-year sales growth came in “above 20 per cent”; last year it was “around” 20 per cent.That is still streets ahead of most other consumer products. It also translates into an additional SFr500m-SFr700m of sales each year, Deutsche Bank calculates – impressive from such a high base and more than enough to pay the legal bills."
503;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks to launch coffee maker;;Starbucks, the US coffee shop chain, will open a new front in its battle against Nestlé’s Nespresso brand by launching its own coffee maker to compete directly with machines sold by the Swiss group.The Seattle-based group said that this autumn in the US and Canada it would launch a machine branded Verismo that makes espresso-based coffee drinks such as lattes and americanos.The announcement hit the share price of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, which makes the US’s most popular existing single-cup coffee maker and currently packages Starbucks coffee for use in its machines.Green Mountain shares fell 15.2 per cent to $52.90 in after-hours trading following Starbucks’ announcement on Thursday. Starbucks shares rose 3.7 per cent to $52.25 after the market close.The Keurig-branded devices made by Green Mountain are low-pressure machines that produce only brewed coffee.But Howard Schultz, Starbucks chief executive, said: “We have long believed that the biggest prize within the segment is a high-pressure system that would give us the opportunity to deliver Starbucks-quality espresso beverages at home and at work.”Nestlé has maintained Nespresso’s growth by developing a worldwide network of boutiques and by spending on advertising to reinforce Nespresso’s premium image. Nespresso sales rose 20 per cent to more than SFr3.5bn ($3.8bn) last year.Starbucks did not say how much its machine would cost, but it said the price of capsules used with it would be “comparable” to existing single-serve coffee products in the US.It will produce the coffee makers in partnership with Krueger, a privately owned German group.
504;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-03-05T20:09:15Z;Starbucks takes coffee wars to Nespresso;;Coffee capsule wars are set to break out in Europe as Starbucks elbows in on Nespresso’s home turf.The Seattle-based coffee chain, which is already revamping its European operations to move away from identikit stores in every country, is aiming to replicate the strong sales of its own capsule coffee in the US. Analysts expect an announcement on a Europe launch as soon as this month.Starbucks sold 100m of its K-Cup packs in the US within two months of launch on November 1 last year.It said it had no announcement to make on Monday but added: “We have talked about how important the premium single cup is, not just in the US but eventually outside, in Canada and international markets.”In expanding sales of its capsules into Europe, Starbucks is taking on a marketing phenomena. Boosted by a campaign fronted by George Clooney, Nespresso product sales rose 20 per cent to more than SFr3.5bn ($3.8bn) last year, according to Switzerland’s Nestlé.Nestlé has maintained its momentum by geographic expansion, the development of worldwide boutiques and advertising reinforcing Nespresso’s premium image.The group is planning 40 more outlets in the coming year, including a flagship in London’s Regent Street to complement an earlier megastore on the Champs-Élysées in Paris.It is also taking the battle ever closer to Starbucks’ Seattle base, with plans for a San Francisco boutique. The new stores will take the network to more than 300.But Nespresso’s estimated 20-30 per cent profit margin has tempted more rivals, with some 50 systems now available.One of them, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters of the US, which sells the single cup brewers that use – among others – Starbucks’ coffee capsules, sold 4.2m of the machines in the first quarter of this fiscal year, including sales by partners. That is more than half the 6.5m brewers sold in the entire of last fiscal year.Having built a formidable barrier of patents around its capsules and the machines using them, Nestlé has turned to the courts to defend its position.In Switzerland alone, it has launched legal action against a rival compatible capsule developed by a former Nespresso executive, as well as a product launched by a subsidiary of the country’s biggest supermarket chain. Both sell for about half the price of branded Nespresso capsules. Separately, the company has taken legal action against Sara Lee in France, Belgium and the Netherlands.Part of the market expansion has come from launching new coffee blends and regular one-off specials – a strategy now being repeated by Starbucks in the US.
505;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-03-04T14:30:58Z;Silicon Valley gets more political business;;Four years ago, Dan Siroker sat behind a computer in Chicago at Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign headquarters, developing the first website testing system ever used in a presidential campaign.He wanted to see if a picture of Mr Obama giving a speech on the front page of the website or one of Obama with his wife and children, would inspire more people to sign up for the campaign’s e-mail list. After testing three photos and three videos, randomly shown to different users who visited the website, the data showed that millions more people signed up after seeing the family portrait compared with anything else.“We raised tens of millions of dollars, if not hundreds of millions, in donations by just optimising,” Mr Siroker says.After the election, Mr Siroker, now 28, went to San Francisco to start his own company called Optimizely. The company sells similar A/B testing services to businesses, from Starbucks to the Guardian newspaper. Now his political customers are signing up too – six full time staff from Obama’s campaign are using Optimizely to increase their donors and volunteers.With 10 states holding GOP primary elections on Tuesday, and the broader 2012 election season gaining momentum, candidates are looking to Silicon Valley companies like these for more than just campaign donations.Candidates, including Republican Mitt Romney and President Obama, are hiring technology companies to do for them and their campaigns what these companies are doing for businesses.“We’re looking for firms that are on the cutting edge,” says Zac Moffatt, digital director for the Romney campaign. “Some are technical companies that help us reach greater efficiency and others help us engage with broader audiences.”Mr Moffatt says the campaign is working with 20 technology start-ups and companies. Most of them did not exist before the 2008 election.Square, a mobile payment company founded in 2009 in San Francisco, is one of them. Its tiny one-inch square credit card reader can be plugged into any smartphone, so small business owners, from hair dressers to plumbers, can process credit card payments easily and cheaply.Both the Romney and Obama campaigns saw immense potential in the product for streamlining the collection of campaign donations. Instead of taking down peoples’ e-mail addresses at a rally, sending them a fundraising appeal a day later, then hoping donation are eventually sent in, now volunteers and door-to-door canvassers can swipe credit cards on the spot.SAY Media is another company Romney’s team has hired. Targeted at the Procter & Gamble’s of the world, the company specialises in delivering online advertising to the 31 per cent of the US population that no longer watches live television and thus never sees the millions of dollars of political commercials broadcast there.Advertising companies like this, which help businesses manage online video, text, or social advertising, are expected to well out of the presidential election.In 2012, candidates are expected to spend up to 15 per cent of their advertising budgets online, says Michael Beach, co-founder of Targeted Victory, a digital strategy firm in Washington DC. That is up from 0.5 per cent in 2008, he says.Large portions of that will go directly to Google and Facebook. Some will trickle down to the companies that help distribute brand messages across those and other online and social media platforms. Companies such as Buddy Media, Vitrue and Hearsay Social – all of which help big retailers and chains manage their Facebook pages – have been paid by current political candidates to help manage their social media presence.In 2004, the internet revolutionised online political donations. In 2008, Facebook was the key player in mobilising people to vote, donate, and volunteer. In the 2012 election, strategists have speculated whether mobile, social, or geo-location technology could be the defining technology trend. But Mr Moffatt and others believe this year’s theme will be one of “persuasion” – using the internet to influence people and their friends.“To us, the big game changer is that online will be a voter persuasion medium,” says Mr Beach.Facebook’s role – with its expanding web of data about 845m peoples’ relationship connections, interests and political affiliations – is likely to be critical. And that will translate to a hefty chunk of advertising revenue for Facebook to showcase to investors during its first few quarters as a public company.Mr Beach predicts that “Facebook might make more money from political advertisers in 2012 than all online advertisers did in 2008.”
506;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks to revitalise European stores;;Starbucks’ lattes could soon be available on aircraft, trains and vending machines across the UK as the coffee chain embarks on a multimillion euro revamp of its lagging European business.The overhaul of the region, led by newly minted president of Europe, Middle East and Africa, Michelle Gass, echoes the 2008 shake-up in the US when Howard Schultz returned to the company he first joined as marketing director in 1982.“In 2008 Starbucks’ US business was not in good shape and there are similarities between where that was and where our business is in this region,” said Mr Schultz, speaking on the fringes of Starbucks’ rallying-to-arms of European managers this week.While its sales and profits continue to grow, the performance of the region is trailing the overall group. Reporting segmental performance for the first time last quarter, Starbucks revealed Emea operating margins of 6.5 per cent, virtually a quarter of the Americas’ 22 per cent.However, the European push is also reminiscent of the more aggressive expansion in the US that nearly brought the company to its knees in 2008. The group is opening 300 new outlets in the UK over the next five years, from 760 now. It is also exploring ways to sell Starbucks drinks to passengers on trains and aircraft.“It’s no secret …this is the toughest part of the world to operate in given the macroeconomic challenges,” said Ms Gass. “There’s a lot of fear out there so it’s going to be tough.”Mr Schultz added that the region’s economy was under “significantly more pressure than the US”.Ms Gass’s drive to entice cash-strapped customers into stores includes slightly localised offerings, such as a new lighter espresso in France, cheaper cappuccino in Greece and a gratis second shot of espresso in lattes in the UK.But these changes, along with an accompanying promotional campaign that incorporates free drinks and an ad campaign in the UK, stand to dent margins in the short term. Mr Schultz said other “behind the counter” changes should cushion the blow. A new dimple-shaped pitcher, for example, is expected to save a quarter of a million litres of milk a year.The revamp is an admission that the region – responsible for less than a 10th of total revenues in the first quarter – dropped down the agenda when Mr Schultz and top executives concentrated on turning around the US.“From 2008-2010 my primary focus, and that of the leadership, was to strengthen and fix the US business. We unfortunately were not able at the same time to focus on this region,” said Mr Schultz.David Palmer, analyst at UBS in New York, said it also showed the strength of competition in the UK.“One reason why they put the pedal to the metal in the UK is because copycats front ran them,” he said, pointing to Whitbread’s Costa Coffee chain.“So it makes sense for them to [expand] across Europe. They are the originals, so why let someone else make business difficult for them?”He added that margin improvement in the region should also come from improved lease terms in the UK and from economies of scale. Other changes also stand to impact margins: for example, the company is looking into franchising in the UK.But Starbucks is not replicating its recharged Emea model in Asia, where China is “the most profitable in the world”, according to Mr Schultz – operating margins in the first quarter clocked in at 34.6 per cent.Asian president, John Culver, remains based in Seattle. This is despite the fact that – based on first quarter numbers – he presides over more than double the operating profit generated in Emea on half the revenues.China, like Emea, is also poised for a rapid roll-out. “We will open thousands of stores in China over the next few years,” said Mr Schultz.The company also recently launched a joint venture with Tata Global Beverages to take its coffee to tea-loving India.
507;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-02-24T15:18:18Z;Retail: Knowing your stock is the key to a busy shop;Devices that check product availability are handy for stores with high staff turnover, says Charles Batchelor;What do shoppers hate? A long search for the item they came in for followed by a lengthy queue at the till.Mobile technologies mean that retailers can tackle these problems, in the hope of increasing sales and making the shopper more likely to return.Handheld devices have long been used to ensure that warehouses and distribution centres can handle large volumes of incoming and outgoing stock.More recently, they have made inroads into inventory management in shops themselves. The arrival of the iPad and other tablet devices has given a boost to their use by store staff to communicate directly with customers.“The customer wants to navigate the store and complete the transaction quickly, while the retailer needs to take unnecessary cost out of the process,” explains Ian Snadden, European vice-president at Intermec, which supplies wired and wireless data collection systems.While other sectors have cut spending in the recession, retailers have continued to invest in customer-facing technology, he notes.“The biggest single problem facing retailers is the accuracy of their stock file,” says Alan Braithwaite, chairman of LCP Consulting and a visiting professor at Cranfield School of Management.“You might think you have got something, but in fact someone has stolen it or it is not in the right place. It is all about giving the customer accurate feedback.” For every extra percentage point of product availability, a store will increase sales by 0.2 to 0.6 per cent, he says.The range of products in many stores and rapid staff turnover, which means assistants often lack detailed product knowledge, puts a premium on mobile devices that can be used to see what is in stock.What customers should increasingly notice when they enter a shop, is a sales assistant with a handheld device who intercepts them before they reach the counter to take and process their order. Retailers such as Apple and the Starbucks coffee chain have roaming sales staff who act as “queue busters.”To help it cope with the pre-Christmas rush, Hamleys, the UK toy shop, issued staff in its main London store with an iPad, a handheld Bluetooth scanner, a wireless Pin entry device and a wireless printer.Worn in a belt round the assistant’s waist, these devices allowed staff to move through the store, handling transactions at the display where the customer had seen what they wanted.As well as helping the sales assistant locate what the customer is looking for, handheld devices allow them to show similar items, possibly prompting a more expensive or multiple purchase in additional styles or colours.Retailers and distribution centres have long used rugged handheld devices made by manufacturers such as Psion and Motorola, but the launch of the iPad and other tablets has created a device that is both fashionable and familiar to many shoppers.Unfortunately, these tablets do not connect with the Windows operating system used in back office enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.“All kinds of devices that work with Windows integrate with the back office,” says Peter Chadha, chief executive of DrPete, a technology consultancy. “But iPads have been an issue. They don’t run on Windows, so how do they integrate? This has held us back from using these devices, although that will change.”Windows 8, the next version of Microsoft’s operating system, will support the ARM low-energy microprocessors used in many mobile devices, as well as Intel. Windows 8 is also expected to have such features as a touch screen facility.Enabling tablets to talk to in-store inventory systems is expected to give a big boost to their use. “People love Apple, says Mr Chadha. “The iPad is very attractive to use in retail. It is sexy, has a long battery life and is reasonably robust. The customer and the sales person can work on it together.”Tablets are expected to prove popular in upmarket retailing, including clothes and footwear, says Mim Burt, research director in the retail team at Gartner, the IT consultancy. But they are expensive and not rugged enough for all settings. “In a high-volume grocery environment, you would have bog-standard, simple stock management hand-helds,” she says.But whether retailers opt for a basic handheld device or an upmarket tablet, they should not allow themselves to be mesmerised by technology.Offered a choice of dealing with a sales assistant, using their own mobile or an in-store screen to answer a query, even young people preferred to deal with a “real person”, found a recent Gartner survey.“It is a fallacy to say young people want to do everything on their mobile,” says Ms Burt.
508;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T03:31:47+0000;Dunkin’ Donuts in India: all about doughnuts, not coffee;;"Indians’ beloved chai seems to have received a reprieve from the international onslaught directed towards it lately: the US’s biggest retailer of coffee by the cup is gearing up to enter the Indian market but will focus on foods rather than beverages.Just three weeks after Starbucks announced its entry into Asia’s third largest economy, its chief US rival, Dunkin’ Donuts, revealed on Tuesday that it would open up its first store in New Delhi by June – a couple of months earlier than Starbucks, according to the WSJ.Dunkin’ announced its plans for India a year ago. But while many expected the more recent announcement by Starbucks to pit the rival US chains against each other yet again, the company’s Indian partner says that won’t happen.Instead of focusing on the beverage half of the business – as Dunkin’ has, to great success, in the US – Ravi Gupta, CFO for Jubilant FoodWorks, which has a 15-year contract for exclusive franchise rights in India, told beyondbrics the company would brand Dunkin’ as an all-day eatery.“Indian consumers want value and they believe that food offers more value than beverages, so we believe that if we can execute the food part well we can excite the consumers,” he said. “Also, there is a younger consumer who sees equal value for both food and beverage.”The food will be “western-centric but spicing has to be Indian”, Gupta added, with sweet and savory, hot and cold options.“Coffee might have competition but… the emphasis is on all day food where other players aren’t focusing right now,” Gupta said.Just as analysts had told beyondbrics Starbucks was smart to enter India with a trusted name like the Tata Group, they said Dunkin’ was also wise to partner locally.But instead of heritage, Dunkin’ Brands has gone for field experience and expertise: Jubilant has had great success as the exclusive operator of the Domino’s Pizza chain in India, with 439 stores nationwide as of the end of last year.Dunkin’, the 62-year-old US-based chain, operates 6,800 stores in its home market and plans to double that number by 2020. In July, shares in parent company Dunkin’ Brands leapt more than 40 per cent the day after an initial public offering that raised $423m.The companies plan to open 80 to 100 Dunkin’ stores across India in the next five years, considerably slower expansion than that planned by Starbucks and Tata, which aim to have as many as 50 stores by the end of this year and eventually to surpass Starbucks’ presence in China and open more than 3,000 stores.Despite Jubilant’s plans to brand Dunkin’ stores as restaurants rather than coffee shops, comparisons to Starbucks – and India’s local coffee shops – are inevitable.The first Starbucks store will open in Mumbai or Delhi by September. Dunkin’ will face competition from Café Coffee Day, which has more than 1,000 stores and is expanding quickly backed by a $200m investment from KKR, the New York private equity firm.It also faces the Barista chain, owned by the Italian coffee producer Lavazza. Then there’s local company Mad Over Donuts, which operates 26 stores in Delhi, Mumbai and Pune, according to the company’s website.One thing Jubilant doesn’t plan on doing is fighting the same battle Dunkin’ fought in the US: convincing customers to focus less on the donut and more on what they’re dunkin’ it in. It worked in the States. The company’s slogan went from “Time to make the donuts” to “America runs on Dunkin’” and says it is now the largest retailer of coffee by the cup.Related reading:

509;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-02-15T20:18:47Z;Companies right to say ‘we do’ to gay wedlock;Companies should take pride in being bolder than presidential candidates;"Just as Metternich is reputed to have marked Talleyrand’s death by saying “What did he mean by that?”, anything Lloyd Blankfein does is scrutinised for ulterior motives.The Goldman Sachs chief executive’s video supporting gay marriage has attracted scornful comment from those who think he is trying to deflect attention from excessive pay and the company’s
role in the global financial crisis.But Mr Blankfein is not alone: several large US companies have come out for same-sex marriage, including Nike and Starbucks.Their stance is probably braver than Mr Blankfein’s because they are consumer businesses that could be subject to boycott by opponents of gay rights. Goldman, doing its business with other companies, is less vulnerable. It is probably no accident that law firms, also less susceptible to consumer pressure, score higher than other types of business on the Corporate Equality Index sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign for gay, bisexual and transgender equality.Ford, a company that sells to the public, experienced a buffeting over the issue. In 2005, campaign groups headed by the American Family Association called for a boycott of the vehicle maker after it advertised in gay publications. Ford withdrew the advertisements but, faced with a counter-boycott from gay activists, changed its mind again. Today, Ford, which receives a 100 per cent rating from the Human Rights Campaign, has decided to keep quiet about gay marriage. The company says: “Ford has a long tradition of treating all with respect and we are very proud of our record on human rights. We believe this commitment to respect is far more important than taking a position on this public policy initiative.”Microsoft, which sells both to companies and consumers, has been through a similar struggle – and has reached the opposite conclusion.In 2005 it refused to take a position on the gay anti-discrimination bill then making its way through the Washington state legislature. After pressure from employees, it changed its mind and now also supports Washington’s same-sex marriage bill, which was this week signed into law.That companies are battling to decide what to do on the issue should be no surprise. Public opinion in the US, while increasingly sympathetic to gay marriage, is still deeply divided. A Pew Research Center study last year found that while opposition to same-sex marriage had fallen sharply since 1996, 46 per cent of Americans were still against it, with 45 per cent in favour. Presidential candidates have steered clear. Mitt Romney, the Republican contender, who ordered the issuing of same-sex marriage licences when he was Massachusetts governor, now says: “Marriage is between a man and a woman.” President Barack Obama says his position is still “evolving”.Why should companies, with a duty to shareholders to ensure the financial health of the business, stick their necks out on gay marriage, any more than they do on other issues Pew identified as deeply divisive, such as abortion or gun control?Brad Smith, Microsoft’s general counsel, says gay equality is a business issue. Its workforce needs to look like its customers. If the company’s home state of Washington didn’t offer same-sex marriage rights, able gay staff would prefer to live in one of the other states that did.I think there is a deeper reason. If you work with people every day, it doesn’t seem right that some of their partners benefit from their health and pension plans while others don’t. And once you accept that same-sex partners should have workplace equality, what justification can there be for denying them the legal blessing and protection available to married heterosexuals? Even if you had religious objections, how easy would you find it to defend them while looking one of your gay colleagues in the eye?This is not a universal view. Only a handful of countries recognise
gay marriage. Seventy-six countries outlaw homosexual sex, according
to a United Nations report that also describes appalling violence against gays around the world.That companies are prepared to be bolder than presidential candidates in turning this tide should be a matter of pride. Sometimes, after weighing up the rights of the company’s customers, shareholders and staff, you just have to do the right thing. Scepticism about Goldman Sachs is often in order. But on this issue, Mr Blankfein has done the right thing.michael.skapinker@ft.com"
510;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-02-03T22:43:28Z;Social, networked executive finds perfect company;Sheryl Sanberg has turned Mark Zuckerberg’s vision into reality, writes April Dembosky;"Sheryl Sandberg likes Counting Crows and the Dixie Chicks, When Harry Met Sally and Toy Story 3, running, and “playing with my children” according to her Facebook page. The online profile also lists her resumé of professional posts, from the US Treasury Department, to Google, to her current job as the chief operating officer at Facebook. The site does not have a section in its profile page for a person to highlight the companies she was responsible for preparing and leading to a multibillion-dollar initial public offering, nor a place to suggest a post-IPO net worth of about $2bn.When Facebook this week declared its intentions to sell stock in the public markets, attention landed on Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s 27-year old chief executive, and his own declarations of how Facebook’s “hackers” were toiling to not only connect people, but to shape better businesses, better governments, a better world.But the company’s financial success, which he said serves to enable its social mission, traces directly to Ms Sandberg, 42. After helping to build Google’s search advertising business from the ground up and seeing it through its landmark IPO to $16.6bn in annual sales in 2007, Sandberg went to Facebook in 2008 where she took the concept of social advertising from a fumbling idea to a viable business model that generated $3.7bn in revenues last year.While the reclusive and geeky founder led the charge in attracting 845m people to the site, the financial growth at Facebook is seen as being rooted in Ms Sandberg’s ability to attract top business talent to the company, in particular from her technology alma mater. “I came because of Sheryl,” is a popular refrain among the string of Google employees who decamped to Facebook in recent years, often picking up the same title they held at the search engine.Her reception from incumbent engineers was less enthusiastic, but she soon carved a place for herself. Part of her success, insiders say, stems from her blatant defiance of the conventional wisdom that managers should not be personal with their employees. Though not beloved by all, people close to Ms Sandberg describe her as “warm” and “genuine” as often as “skilled”. She listens, her fans say; she helps; she rallies people round her cause and pushes projects to completion. Put together, and set against the grand philosophies Mr Zuckerberg has about his company, Facebook was a logical place for her to land.“It’s a technological manifestation of who Sheryl is,” said Clara Shih, chief executive of Hearsay Social, a social media start-up, and a protégé of Ms Sandberg’s. “She’s the ultimate social networker.”Her history with Facebook began at a Christmas party in 2007, when she met Mr Zuckerberg and stood talking with him for an hour. One of the company’s key investors had just chastised him for the disastrous handling of Facebook’s Beacon– an application that published users’ purchases from other websites without their consent – and urged him to hire a new chief operating officer.Mr Zuckerberg had aptly negotiated funding contracts so that investors could never force him out of his chief executive role. But analysts believed it was clear he did not have the skills, nor the inclination, to run the human resources and business operations of the company. He was 23 at the time.Instead, he found an “adult” who would do those things, but as a partner who shared his vision, not a replacement. Ms Sandberg was similarly looking for a new opportunity, where she would have much more leadership responsibility.In March 2008, she started work at Facebook, where she led one session after another with employees to settle on a business concept that everyone could rally around. Eventually, she was meeting advertising heads at companies from Starbucks to Walmart, explaining to them the benefits of social advertising and targeting messages to people based on specific interests and social connections. As tensions rose around the company’s privacy policies, she took the lead in Washington, lobbying on behalf of the company.Born in Washington, she grew up in Miami, Florida where she excelled in school, and worked at times in her father’s ophthalmology office and as an aerobics instructor – “silver leggings, the leg warmers …I have done a lot to hide all those pictures,” she told Jesse Draper, the host of The Valley Girl Show. She went on to Harvard as an undergraduate then for her MBA. She worked for her thesis adviser, Lawrence Summers, first at the World Bank, then as his chief of staff when he was Bill Clinton’s Treasury Secretary. From there, she went to Google.Throughout her career, she has been a vocal champion for several social causes, but none more than the advancement of women in the workplace. She calls the small representation of women – 15 per cent – in top corporate jobs and board seats a “stalled revolution.”On her mission to increase that number from the bottom up, she encourages women in speeches and one-on-one to “sit at the table” and assert themselves, and to “lean forward” reaching for new challenges and promotions, particularly if they are thinking about having a baby. Then they have something attractive to return to when the urge to stay home with the baby hits.At Facebook she was behind the company’s four-month paid parental-leave policy and its designated “expectant mother” parking spaces, choicely positioned near the office entrance. More than that, she conducts intimate pep talks with women that remind them to maintain their ambition. “Keep your foot on the gas pedal,” she says.With Facebook barrelling toward the largest internet stock listing in history, and other corporate and governmental leaders just waiting to offer her next opportunity, she’s setting an example by keeping her hand on the jet throttle.The writer is the FT’s San Francisco correspondent"
511;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:15:58+0000;Russia: Wagon Wheels’ British flavour;;"Wagon Wheels, the Great (big) British biscuits, are to roll back into Russia after an earlier attempt crashed during the country’s 1998 sovereign default.Burton’s Foods, which makes them, will be selling Wagon Wheels the way it did in the 1990s, marketing them on the “British-ness” of their taste, look and packaging. But would the company actually do better to make the flavour a bit more Russian?The track record is mixed. Some foreign food companies have succeeded in Russia by sticking closely to their original formula, as Burton’s Foods clearly intends to do.Starbucks, for instance, offers the same vanilla frappuccinos and caramel macchiatos that they do everywhere else, and in tall, venti and grande – a strategy that appears to have served it well. The company entered Russia only in 2007 and then only through a Kuwaiti franchisee but it has gone from having just 2 locations to 28. Seven new coffee shops have opened in the past month alone.On the other hand, some companies have gone a long way to adapting to local tastes. Take for instance Lay’s, the Pepsico crisp brand, which entered Russia exactly 20 years ago and has experimented with crisps flavoured with everything from caviar to mushrooms and sour cream.As Yuri Ovchinnikov, operations development and change manager at PepsiCo Russia who was working at Lay’s at the time, tells beyondbrics, the crisp maker’s original task at the start of the 1990s was to distinguish the American crisps from their Soviet cousins, called colloquially “no-name crisps” and known for their “very brown” colour and “oily and too salty” taste.Yet in the following years the company ultimately turned to a local relevance campaign, doing taste tests across the local market and coming up with flavours familiar to Russian palates.To get the best taste for “mushrooms and sour cream”, the company invited Moscow chefs to prepare the best mushroom and fried potato dishes, with the best chef winning a Lay’s contract to develop the crisps’ flavour.The company went on to launch other favourites like red caviar and pickled cucumber which continue to be sold today. Crab-flavoured crisps were originally launched as a special offer in Siberia and the Far East but after flying off the shelves during the first three months the company decided to roll them out across Russia. The flavour is now the the third best-selling in Lay’s Russia portfolio and has been exported to Thailand.So do multinational food groups need to go local? Should they follow Lay’s or Starbucks?Matt Lasov, director of research at Frontier Strategy Group who has worked with clients on adapting their products for different markets, says the best tactic is usually a hybrid approach: maintaining most aspects of the products that made it successful to begin with but experimenting with local flavours there.He gives the example of Pizza Hut in Pakistan which has adopted roughly 30 per cent of its products to local tastes and culture. The restaurant chain offers Hara Chicken and Spicy Prawn pizzas and has marketed Pizza Hut as a more upscale chain than it is perceived in America.Lasov says that striking a balance between assimilation and not changing at all is key. Speaking of the Russian market, he says: “If you go in [as a foreign company] and try to compete with purely Russian products you will fail because local companies, at least at the beginning, will be able to do it better and cheaper.“But if you go in with your product without any localisation you’ll fail again.”Related reading:

512;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
513;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-01-30T17:37:52Z;Starbucks plans $80m Indian joint venture;;Starbucks on Monday unveiled long-awaited plans to bring its coffee shops to one of the world’s greatest tea-loving nations through an $80m Indian joint venture with Tata Global Beverages.The first outlet will open in Mumbai or Delhi by September as part of a wider Asian expansion by the US-based coffee retailer, which has 544 stores in China and has been eyeing the Indian market since 2006.R K Krishna Kumar, chairman of Tata Coffee, said: “We plan to expand rapidly to all of the major metro cities and second-tier towns. By the end of the year we could have as many as 50 stores.”The 50/50 joint venture comes despite recent rule changes allowing 100 per cent foreign ownership of single brand retail stores, underscoring the difficulties faced by western companies seeking to enter India’s $450bn retail market without local partners.Starbucks is seeking to reduce the dominance of the US in its operations. More than 12,000 of its 17,000-plus stores are in its home market. The Americas region – including a few hundred stores in Canada and Latin America – accounts for three-quarters of its revenue.The coffee chain’s announcement in India follows the decision of Swedish homeware retailer Ikea to postpone its own Indian entry, citing onerous regulations requiring the local sourcing of products.For the first time Starbucks will feature two brands on its famous green and white signs, under the strapline: “Starbucks, a Tata alliance”.John Culver, president of Starbucks China and Asia Pacific, confirmed the company had not considered a sole entry, but said: “We think India can be one of our largest markets outside of the US.” The company has more than 17,000 stores in 55 countries.Rama Bijapurkar, a market research expert and author of Winning in the Indian Market, said: “If Starbucks come to India thinking that just because they carry a foreign label it will walk over the local competition, they are going to be in big trouble.“But there is an opportunity for them here, not least because there really are no nice places to meet in our big cities, outside the lobbies of five-star hotels.”India’s food services retail market generated about $8.2bn in the year ending in March 2011 and is forecast to grow more than 10 per cent annually over the next five years, according to Technopak, a retail market consultancy.However, cafés make up only a small segment of a market dominated by small tea stalls selling chai – a sweet, milky tea. Starbucks will face competition from a handful of incumbent coffee chains, including market leader Café Coffee Day with more than 1,000 stores.Mr Krishna Kumar said his objective was for the number of stories in India to surpass Starbucks’ presence in China, becoming in turn the largest component of the US group’s expansion in Asia.He said: “I wouldn’t be surprised if India’s share of it over the next five years would be equal to, if not more than, in China.”To underscore China’s place in its plans, however, Starbucks has begun to describe the country as its “second home market”.The Indian venture is also likely to see Starbucks products sold through other parts of the wider Tata group, one of India’s most recognisable conglomerates, including Taj Hotels and TajSATS, an airline catering business.
514;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-01-30T16:18:00Z;Starbucks: a challenge for chai;;"Trying to find a Starbucks near Oxford Circus in London throws up half a dozen options. All Occupied Out at Zucotti Park in New York? Three choices within a block.Starbucks is omnipresent in the west, and growing in the east (there are now more than 500 shops in China alone).But one place where it’s been missing is tea-drinking India. That changed on Monday, when the Seattle-based company, which has been looking at the country since 2006, announced it would enter the market this year with a $80m joint venture with Tata Group – a name that’s as well known in the the subcontinent as Starbucks is in the west.It’s the first time that the US coffee company is co-branding its shops, in this case as “Starbucks Coffee ‘A Tata Alliance’”.Analysts said the Seattle-based group was smart to use the trusted Tata name in introducing its product.“India is a very slow market, and unlike China they probably understand that here it will take a lot of time,” Pinakiranjan Mishra, head of retail and consumer goods for India at Ernst & Young, told beyondbrics. “They need local insight into local taste, product mix which they want to leverage from Tata’s experience.”With their decision to establish a 50-50 joint venture, Starbucks becomes the second company to publicly decide against exploiting the new liberalisation of the retail trade and investing taking 100 per cent of the project.The first was Ikea, which opted out last week to delay its entry into India altogether, over concerns about the requirement that 30 per cent of goods be sourced from local small and medium-sized companies.The first Starbucks store will open in Mumbai or Delhi by September 2012, but RK Krishna Kumar, chairman of Tata Coffee and vice chairman of Tata Global Beverages – the 50:50 partner in TATA Starbucks - said the company would expand quickly thereafter. “By the end of the year we could have as many as fifty stores.” He also said their objective was to surpass Starbucks’ presence in China, with an aspiration to open more than 3,000 stores.The JV also includes an agreement between the two companies that will see Tata Coffee – the country’s biggest coffee grower – roasting coffee to supply to the Indian venture, as well as to export to Starbucks for use in its stores worldwide.The company’s competition in India includes the over-1,000-store-strong Café Coffee Day – with expansion plans fuelled by a $200m investment from KKR in 2010 – and Barista, owned by the Italian coffee producer Lavazza.Tata’s help will be particularly useful when the new stores expand beyond India’s major metropolises. Mishra said:“Another advantage of the Tata brand [is that] the visibility is so good that if you move to smaller tier towns even if people aren’t familiar with Starbucks, the fact that it’s associated with Tata is a plus from a brand perspective.”India’s food services retail market generated about $8.2bn in the year ending in March 2011 and is forecast to grow more than 10 per cent annually over the next five years, according to Technopak, a retail market consultancy.However, cafés make up only a small segment of a market dominated by small tea stalls selling chai – a sweet, milky tea.As well as coffee, chai latte will be on the menu at Tata Starbucks. And standard Indian chai? Not decided.Related reading

515;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks: Irish coffee anyone?;If it is to thrive, US profits must expand. So it is eyeing alcohol sales;For all its international ambitions, Starbucks remains very dependent on the US, where roughly four-fifths of operating income is earned. If the company is to thrive, US profits must expand – despite the fact that there is little room for more stores when every suburb has a Starbucks drive-through. The company has managed this so far, growing US operating income by half since 2007, despite a flat store count. Further gain will be that much harder to find.Little wonder then that the company is experimenting with one of the only products as profitable as coffee – alcohol – which it is adding to select stores. After booze, though, what’s next? The world might be ready for a Starbucks cigarette. Customers could grab a pack at the drive-through, and smoke in their cars, where it’s still allowed.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
516;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:15:58+0000;Starbucks China outlets lag in sales volume;;The Starbucks coffee chain generates a lower volume of sales per store in China than in the US but its Chinese stores are more profitable than those in its home market, its chief financial officer has said.Troy Alstead, the chain’s finance chief, told the Financial Times that sales volumes at its 500-plus Chinese stores were typically between one-half and two-thirds of those in the US.But he said that “not too long ago” the proportion had been one-third and added that its Chinese stores, which are in 41 cities, were more profitable than those in the US because labour costs, rent, and utility bills were lower.Competition in China’s consumer market is intense as a growing number of multinationals and local companies battle for attention. Profit performance often diverges sharply, with successful groups generating bumper earnings while others struggle to reverse start-up losses.As it reported record quarterly revenue and net income on Thursday, Starbucks disclosed results for its Asian business separately for the first time, revealing that it contributed just $167m, or 5 per cent, of total sales, although sales in the region rose 38 per cent in the quarter from a year ago.The company said its Asian operating margin, or operating profit as a proportion of sales, was 34.6 per cent, much higher than its 21.8 per cent margin in the Americas. Its operating margin in Europe, the Middle East and Africa was just 6.5 per cent.Worldwide, the group’s net income beat market expectations in the three months to January 1 by climbing 10 per cent from a year ago to $382m, or 50 cents per share. Sales hit $3.4bn, up 16 per cent and also surpassing Wall Street forecasts.In the Americas, which makes up three-quarters of its business, revenues grew by 11 per cent to $2.6bn.Mr Alstead said Starbucks would make an announcement in the near future about India, where it has said it will open its first store via a joint venture this year, later than originally envisaged by its joint venture partner Tata Coffee.The Indian government, after a U-turn on broader liberalisation, agreed this month to allow foreign retailers – including coffee chains – to own 100 per cent of businesses that sell products from stores stocked with a single brand.But Mr Alstead said: “We do believe that India is best approached with an excellent local partner so that’s how we’re going to approach that market.”Starbucks said it continued to expect sales to grow by 10 per cent in 2012, driven by a combination of sales growth at existing stores, the opening of 800 net new outlets and higher sales of packaged coffee.Starbucks shares fell about 2 per cent in after-market trading following the earnings release. The shares had closed up 1.2 per cent to $48.34 in regular trading.
517;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:15:58+0000;Nationalist ‘ghost at feast’ in Russia;;"Maksim Martsinkevich, nom de guerre “Machete”, insists he is not a skinhead, even though his pate is smooth as a cue ball. The 27-year-old does not like being called a Nazi, though he once belonged to something called the National Socialist Organisation and spent four years in jail, in part for shouting “Sieg Heil!” at a political debate in 2007.He also insists that he is not a Russian opposition leader, even though he came second in an internet vote to determine who should speak at a December 24 anti-Kremlin rally that attracted up to 100,000, the largest public demonstration since the fall of the Soviet Union.Mr Martsinkevich was ultimately denied the stage by the organisers because of his racist views and penchant for throwing the odd “roman salute” in public. Over a cup of coffee at a Moscow Starbucks, however, he complains bitterly about the hypocrisy of it all. “I didn’t even want to speak,” Mr Martsinkevich says. “I just wanted to show that these other so-called opposition leaders are no leaders. If they can’t even win their own vote, what kind of power do they think they are going to get?”The avowed white supremacist is the most extreme example of a perplexing issue for Russia’s anti-Kremlin protests, which began as a reaction to a December parliamentary election that is widely believed to have been rigged and has mutated into a street movement which has yet to define clear goals, aside from its ubiquitous slogan “For free elections”.In the current turmoil, hardline nationalism is the “ghost at the feast” in the words of Alexander Verkhovsky, an expert on nationalism at Moscow’s Sova Centre think-tank. He says Russia, like much of Europe, is seeing a resurgence of the far right. “It’s natural. We had an empire, and it collapsed. All post-imperial states see a rise in nationalism. The question is not whether or not there will be a rise in nationalism, the question is what form it will take.”While Mr Martsinkevich’s internet vote success is ascribed by opposition leaders to either a Kremlin provocation or a prank, it raises a real issue: much of the groundswell of middle class protesters is made up of liberals, standing up for universal human rights and freedoms. But much of it is not. Russian nationalists see democracy as a means to an end, a path to power, but their commitment to a pluralistic political system once they have achieved it is, at best, an open question.One of the nationalists given the podium at the December rally, Vladimir Tor, told the crowd: “We Russian nationalists are, more than anyone else, interested in freedom and democracy in Russia, because we truly know and truly believe that in fair elections power will go to the majority”.That many nationalist have swung into opposition against Vladimir Putin, the prime minister seeking to regain the presidency in elections this year, is troubling for the Kremlin which considered such conservatives among their core constituency. When Mr Putin came to power in 2000, he was cheered by many nationalists as a strong ruler who wanted to restore Russian pride. However, nationalists, like all independent political movements, have also felt the bite of Mr Putin’s authoritarian rule.“The Putin regime has sent 1,500 of my brothers to prison. That is more than all the dissidents sent to prison under Brezhnev,” Mr Tor said during his speech.Mr Putin advocates a more imperial and militaristic brand of nationalism than most Russians. He rarely has a press conference these days without hinting that dark foreign forces are at work destabilising Russia. He has championed a 19tn rouble ($614bn) spending binge re-equipping Russia’s military and called for the creation of a “Eurasian Union” of former Soviet states.However, most ordinary Russians seem more drawn to ethnic nationalism, rather than nostalgia for great power. They are more concerned about immigration, which has increased rapidly under Mr Putin due to Russia’s economic growth; about ethnic tensions between neighbourhood gangs; and the budget-draining federal subsidies for the war-torn north Caucasus.According to a poll by the Moscow-based Levada centre, a sociological research agency, 59 per cent of Russians “strongly” or “moderately” support the ethnic nationalist slogan “Russia for the Russians”, higher than at any time since the poll was first taken in 1998.Nationalist Russians have deserted the Kremlin camp and swung into opposition, joining a handful of liberal activists who have latched on to the middle-class groundswell of protests.“We [nationalists and liberals] have very different views about the future development of Russia. But we are united in seeking an end to the regime, free registration of political parties, and free elections,” Mr Tor says in an interview.A synergy between liberals and nationalists is obvious to many in the opposition: Russia’s liberals have too many leaders and not enough followers, while nationalists have the opposite problem. Liberal ideas were discredited by the economic misery of the Yeltsin years, and the plethora of liberal parties have trouble finding recruits. Meanwhile, polls such as the Levada centre’s show broad public support for nationalist ideas but there is a lack of credible parties and popular leaders.The most successful opposition leaders have been those who can fuse liberalism and nationalism. Alexei Navalny, the only opposition leader to beat Mr Martsinkevich in the vote for speakers at last month’s rally, is an avowed nationalist, albeit a self-styled moderate one, as well as extolling democracy and fighting corruption.He favours curbs on immigration and argues that the war-torn Caucasus should be treated as “Russia’s Gaza Strip” and politically isolated. He also attracts controversy for addressing gatherings of extremist groups.Mr Navalny takes offence at the suggestion that he is a racist.“I would never consider any people ‘second class’,” he tells Boris Akunin, a liberal author, in a published email exchange.In the Russian context, with its violent skinhead gangs, Mr Navalny is indeed a moderate, though Mr Verkhovsky likens him to far-right European politicians such as Geert Wilders and his Dutch Freedom Party.The alliances between liberal politicians are in some cases being formalised. Liberals agreed at a meeting this month to share leadership of an umbrella group called the Civic Movement of Russia with leftist hardliners and nationalists – with all three groups given equal power on a steering committee.Ilya Yashin, a leader of the liberal opposition Solidarity movement, makes a distinction between radical nationalists and “constitutional” ones. “I see nothing wrong with a tactical alliance with constitutional nationalists,” he says.“I am certainly against what they say but their views certainly have a place in the political system, and they are represented in most European parliamentary democracies.”Many democrats want to avoid seeing nationalism used to divide the opposition.Skinheads loyal to Mr Martsinkevich tried to rush the stage at the December rally but were convinced to stand down – by other nationalists.Some also believe that Mr Martsinkevich may be supported by the Kremlin in an effort to divide and discredit the real opposition. It is a charge he heatedly denies, citing his time in prison.“They say I’m a Kremlin project. Where do they think I spent the last four years – in Bali?”"
518;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-01-24T21:19:30Z;McDonald’s creates 2,500 jobs in UK;;McDonald’s is creating 2,500 UK jobs in the latest sign that consumers are turning to “affordable treats” over more expensive choices in the era of austerity.The new positions, which will take McDonald’s UK workforce to 90,000, follow a similar expansion by Starbucks. The coffee chain aims to add 5,000 to its UK workforce over the next five years.The burger chain announced its 23rd consecutive quarter of revenue growth in the UK on Tuesday and has been expanding in the UK throughout the downturn. Hiring peaked in 2009 and 2010, when 11,000 jobs were created.The proliferation of fast-food chains contrasts sharply with the dwindling numbers of high street shops and suggests that consumers are opting for burgers and lattes over jeans and other more pricey purchases.Restaurant chains have “consistently” outpaced the growth of their retail peers, said Mark Sheehan, managing director of Coffer Corporate Leisure, the mergers and acquisitions advisory company.Politicians jumped on the news, buoyed in particular by McDonald’s pledge that roughly a third of the jobs would go to first-time workers, who have been significant casualties in the economic downturn. The government is particularly keen to see the private sector pick up the slack from public sector job losses, even though much of the new work may prove less well paid.Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, visited the UK training centre on Tuesday and praised the burger chain’s “excellent” reputation for staff training and development.This is an area on which McDonald’s prides itself, pointing out that 90 per cent of its restaurant managers and half its UK executive board started out working behind the counter.But critics have attacked “McJobs”, defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as, “an unstimulating, low-paid job with few prospects, esp. one created by the expansion of the service sector”. Some 60 per cent of McDonald’s employees work fewer than 30 hours a week.The company attempted to have the OED definition withdrawn but failed, although Jill McDonald, chief executive of the UK operation, claims progress in stimulating debate over the snobbery about service sector jobs. Together with leisure and hospitality, the sector accounts for one in 14 jobs, she said.While the jury may be out on the quality of the work, there is less doubt in diners’ minds about the fast-food chain. Like other casual eateries, takeaway pizzas and coffee shops, McDonald’s is riding the wave of cash-strapped and time-pressed consumers seeking value for money.By offering “affordable indulgence”, these chains are wooing consumers from other venues and at all times of day, said Michael Schaefer, head of consumer food service research at Euromonitor, a market research company.“Consumers are still reluctant to spend and as people look to save money they have become much more agnostic about where they eat, and the fast-food chains have stepped in there,” he said.Others that have ridden the wave include Domino’s pizzas – “people are making their own entertainment at home, maybe watching football and getting a cheap pizza”, said Mr Sheehan – and Gregg’s. The bakery chain sold 1.5m “superstar doughnuts” in five weeks last year.McDonald’s has also reaped rewards from lengthening opening hours: with many branches open 24 hours a day. This accommodates British working habits, said Ms McDonald, with more shift workers in areas such as health and the postal service, and parents who opt to change their working patterns, rather than paying for child care.“People are trying to make ends meet by working different shifts, for example parents [staggering work] to manage child care, because that’s expensive.”
519;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-01-20T22:05:20Z;Surreal El Salvador;Ken Baker is the founder of an NGO for economic empowerment in Central America;"The past five years have been the best of times and the worst of times for American Ken Baker and his family to live in San Salvador. Here in El Salvador’s capital, amid towering volcanoes and sprawling industrial parks, Baker has witnessed Central America’s smallest nation solidify its fledgling democracy while experiencing some of the worst drug-related violence in the Americas.As executive director of Glasswing International, the NGO he founded in 2007, Baker oversees economic-empowerment schemes in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador in partnership with multinationals such as Starbucks, Chevron and Citigroup. Baker is front-and-centre in the battle to help improve education and healthcare for Salvadoreans. It’s an “in the field” version of his former life as a vice-president at AmeriCares, a humanitarian foundation based in Stamford, Connecticut, and a far cry from the chauffeur-driven, bodyguard-protected existences of most of his fellow expats.“Security is constantly on your mind; you seem to always be – and should always be – looking over your shoulder,” says Baker, who lives in a gated compound with his Salvadorean-born wife Celina de Sola, their 10-month old son Nicolas and a trio of dachshunds. “But foreigners and aid workers are typically not targeted.”The Bakers’ home is their second in Colonia San Benito, a residential district in western San Salvador filled with tidy traffic circles and upscale hotels close to the restaurant-filled Zona Rosa and a short drive from his office in Colonia Escalon. With the concrete walls needed to withstand regular hurricanes and earthquakes, the 2,000 sq ft rental property has alarm wiring, “which adds another layer of security”, says Baker. “But what we like most is the complex’s size – large enough to walk around with the dogs and the baby.”Space and security are important commodities in San Salvador, a city with little pedestrian traffic beyond its compact colonial-era core, which is far from upmarket areas such as San Benito and Colonia Escalon. Both space and security, Baker explains, are expensive and essential, with private protection ubiquitous for San Salvador’s middle and upper classes.“There are more private security guards in El Salvador than uniformed policemen,” he says. “The added costs are just part of doing business here,” he adds, “which makes our expenses almost the same as in Connecticut – though on far lower salaries.”More than five years after his arrival, Baker concedes his Salvadorean stay may not be permanent. But thanks to his wife – who is Glasswing’s vice-president for programmes – it was always inevitable. Indeed, before their wedding, Baker knew that living here would be part of the marriage contract. And the Bakers’ leisure time often centres around trips with de Sola’s family to Pacific Ocean beaches – barely 30 minutes from San Salvador – or the clear waters of Lake Coatepeque, a Unesco World Heritage site set in a collapsed volcano that is less than two hours from town.Having travelled in North Korea, Iraq, Mali and Darfur with his previous NGO work, Baker had few misconceptions about living in a developing nation before moving to El Salvador. Still, the country has come with its own set of peculiar, if not surreal, circumstances. “On one hand, El Salvador has the second-highest murder rate in the entire world,” he explains. “Yet the country is very developed – with cinemas, WiFi, fast food restaurants and a very pro-US government; if you didn’t read the paper, you might feel as if you’re living in San Diego.”This relative stability has helped make El Salvador a regional darling of US-based relief agencies and US government; it is the only Central American nation that has been visited by President Obama. Millions of dollars are pouring into El Salvador to combat drug-trafficking and support its democracy. Keeping those dollars in El Salvador is the goal for Baker and Glasswing. “We want to create a non-profit organisation for the developing world that’s actually based in the developing world,” he says.……………………………………………………………..Buying guidePros:● Beaches, mountains and hilltop haciendas less than two hours away● Western-style amenities such as cinemas, shopping centres and WiFi● Well-connected airportCons:● Serious security concerns● Cost of living can be high for those not on traditional “expat” packages● City centre is unappealingWhat you can buy for …$145,000 A three-bedroom/150 sq m modern apartment in San Benito$349,000 A five-bedroom, 335 sq m home in a secure communityContacts:● Remax Central, www.remaxcentral.com.sv"
520;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-01-18T18:12:40Z;Private sector struggles to offset public job losses;;The private sector is struggling to create enough jobs to offset those lost in the public sector despite the latest data showing a modest rise of 18,000 in total employment in the three months to November.“Though a small increase, it does mark a shift from a few months back when the data were reporting declines of nearly 200,000 per quarter,” said Allan Monks, economist at JP Morgan Chase.It was not enough to stop unemployment from rising because more students and women entered the labour market to look for work and the working-age population expanded.Most analysts expect the jobless total to rise further as employers hold back from hiring. “The only way to resolve unemployment in the short term is to pull out all the stops to get the economy moving and business growing,” said Neil Bentley, deputy director-general at the CBI employers’ group.There are some bright spots, notably the car industry, buoyed by investment in innovation and its exposure to emerging markets. More than 3,000 new jobs have been announced recently including 500 at Honda’s Swindon plant, up to 1,500 at Toyota in Burnaston, Derbyshire, and more than 1,000 at Jaguar Land Rover’s Solihull factory in the West Midlands.Starbucks, the coffee shop chain, plans to open 300 new outlets in Britain in the next five years, creating at least 5,000 jobs. Marstons, the brewer and pub operator, wants to build 25 new pub-restaurants this year, creating 1,000 jobs.Against that, the retail sector is having a torrid time, with 1,300 jobs going at La Senza lingerie chain, more than 500 at Past Times, the gifts retailer, and 680 at Barratts Priceless Shoes, the discount shoe chain. Up to 10,000 jobs are at risk at Peacocks, the value fashion retailer, which has gone into administration.The shake-out in the City continues with Royal Bank of Scotland slashing 3,500 jobs worldwide from its investment banking division, on top of 2,000 job cuts at the end of 2011. Elsewhere, Premier Foods is cutting 500 jobs.Even the rise in total employment is not quite what it seems. A sharp fall of 109,000 in the number of employees was offset by a rise of 101,000 in self-employment to 4.1m – fuelled, as the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development reported this week, by people doing part-time odd jobs to avoid the dole queue rather than a resurgence in the enterprise culture.In the three months to September, the private sector created 5,000 jobs, while 67,000 public sector jobs were lost.In the longer term, the Office for Budget Responsibility expects the private sector to generate 1.7m jobs in the six years to 2017, more than offsetting a fall of 710,000 in public sector jobs. But it expects the unemployment rate to rise from 8.4 to 8.7 per cent by the end of this year, before falling back to 6.2 per cent by 2016.“The UK jobs market is struggling to cope with austerity measures but will bounce back,” said Kevin Green, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, representing job agencies. “We are starting to see some more encouraging signs in terms of employer hiring intentions later in the year and sectors such as IT, engineering and office professionals are already showing strong demand.”He warned, however, that “things will get worse before they get better”. With the economy faltering, surveys have shown weak employer confidence, including one from the Federation of Small Businesses showing that smaller companies plan job cuts too.
521;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-01-10T22:41:20Z;Enabling mobile payments;;"Since mobile phones first became popular, technologists have been looking for ways to turn them into electronic wallets. The aim is to let customers leave cash and plastic cards at home by enabling them to use their handsets to buy anything from a cup of coffee to a new car.Several technologies have emerged to facilitate payment, including simple text messaging, infra red, and radio frequency systems such as Bluetooth and near field communication (NFC).The problem is uncertainty over which will predominate. As with video recording in the 1980s, the myriad companies keen to participate in mobile payments are worried about making the wrong technical choice. They don’t want to be a Betamax equivalent in a world of VHS.“It is still early days, and the lack of services using existing standards is making mobile payments relatively slow to take off,” says Ted Bissell, managing consultant at PA Consulting in New York.NFC, the most technically advanced option, stores relevant information on a chip and has been installed on some Android handsets for three years. Yet relatively few customers have used it because most service providers have not yet activated the chip for financial products.Meanwhile, Apple’s iPhone does not include NFC, and the company remains publicly uncommitted as to whether it will be built into iPhones in future.There has been some progress. Last year saw: the launch of Google’s Android-based eWallet and MasterCard’s PayPass in the US, while in the UK Starbucks trialled the Quick Tap PayPass service, and in France BNP Paribas and Orange introduced NFC mobile payments.But with industry practices not yet established, it is unclear whether customers would easily be able to switch between services and suppliers. “The operators are still bickering about who will control the mobile wallet,” says Mr Bissell.“Many customers may not want to be ‘locked in’ to one company or consortium. Legislators are looking at it, to the discomfort of participants such as mobile operators,” he adds.One mobile payment technology based on well established standards is M-PESA, which is has proved hugely popular in Kenya and Tanzania. It enables people without bank accounts to settle bills and transfer funds via text message.The funds are held in accounts managed by the mobile operator Safaricom. “Some 80 per cent of the population adopted M-PESA within five years of launch, and similar uptake is expected in Bangladesh, Pakistan and South America,” Mr Bissell says.In these regions, there is a lack of banking infrastructure and text-based payments work well because they are more secure than cash. However, they are unlikely to be approved by regulators in more developed regions.Even NFC is not seen as particularly secure, says Keith Brown, chief executive of Paythru, which enables people to transfer funds via the cloud for applications such as parking charges.The maximum budget limit of £100 for NFC transactions has not been increased in the three years since it was introduced. This suggests not much progress has been made on security, says Mr Brown.“By using the cloud, nothing is stored on the phone, making the system much more safe and secure.” People will authenticate themselves with biometrics such as fingerprint or voice identification, he says.One reason why mobile payment has not taken off in the developed world is that there is no compelling reason to use it, says Benjamin Ensor, a director at Forrester Research. “There are no payments that you can only use mobile for. It lacks the sort of trigger that PayPal had on eBay.The fact that there are always alternatives means people will use the system they are familiar with, Mr Ensor says.He believes one of the biggest opportunities could be creating an easy way to pay small traders such as taxi drivers, music teachers or sports clubs, for which cheques are typically used. Companies focused on this market include US-based Square, and iZettle, headquartered in Sweden.As for establishing a standard, Mr Ensor says there is no reason why only one technology should dominate or be the winner; there could be several approaches.“The danger of financial institutions focusing too much on standards is in missing the boat. It increases the likelihood of an outsider such as Apple, Google or PayPal coming in and catalysing the business, leaving the banks flat-footed behind.”Another impetus could be the ability to offer real time vouchers and coupons relevant to people’s location.Technology is accelerating and unleashing creativity, Mr Ensor says. “In the past two years, we have seen a lot of change and we think there is quite a big chance for a disrupter to come in, perhaps using existing processes and networks in a new way that is faster, cheaper and better.”The list of companies competing for a slice of what most believe will be a huge market, is formidable. It includes mobile operators, banks, handset manufacturers, operating system suppliers, e-commerce companies, retailers and social networks.There need to be standards, says Mr Ensor. The last thing anybody wants is systems that are not interoperable.“But whereas we only needed one way to record TV, VHS or Betamax, there is no reason why we shouldn’t have several standards to make mobile payments depending, for example, on whether we are buying petrol at the pump, paying a utilities bill, or shopping online.”"
522;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-01-10T19:31:08Z;God bless the United City States of America!;A contemporary Hanseatic League is a tantalising prospect that is within reach, writes Bruce Katz;"With presidential politics in high gear, the US appears to be heading for a frustrating year of partisan conflict and policy gridlock. Like nature, however, the US abhors a vacuum. In previous decades, individual states have acted as “laboratories of democracy”. This moment finds US metropolitan areas providing the sort of innovation and leadership sadly missing in Washington, and, in doing so, forming what might be called the “United Metros of America.” Three particular trends are of note.First, metros are pursuing strategies that build on their distinctive strengths in the global economy. Before the recession, many cities and metros participated in the national consumption mania, pursuing uniform “Starbucks and stadiums” schemes that stamped eerily similar urban landscapes across the nation. But now there is a growing recognition that housing and consumption are derivative rather than driving sectors, and that lasting growth comes from using the productive sectors that vary markedly across disparate places. Metro leaders in Cleveland and Seattle understand this, and are adopting business plans that embrace their competitive assets – advanced manufacturing in Cleveland and clean technology in Seattle.Perhaps the most dramatic shift has occurred in the nation’s first metropolis. Remember New York City’s economic vision circa 2005? A major sports and entertainment complex on the west side of Manhattan. Fast-forward to 2012, and one finds the city attracting Cornell University and the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology to a new science district. The prior plan is largely parasitic; the latter plan, catalytic.Second – and related – metros are looking abroad for new growth possibilities, particularly in the rapidly growing cities and metropolitan areas of emerging nations. This reflects a new respect for the power of global demand, and represents a sharp deviation from the insularity and inward focus that has traditionally defined economic development in the US.Los Angeles, Minneapolis-St.Paul, Portland and Syracuse are all inventing new export plans and institutions to build on their strengths, forging a powerful trading culture, particularly among entrepreneurial immigrants who retain strong ties to their countries of origin. These export initiatives will strike deep trade and investment relationships with cities in rising nations. This is a tantalising prospect: the emergence of a modern Hanseatic League, where cities and metropolitan areas form trading relations directly with their global counterparts, bypassing national governments.Finally, metro innovations are inspiring states to catalyse and reward bottom-up economic growth strategies. Democratic governors in New York and Colorado and Republican Governors in Nevada and Tennessee are all placing their state resources in the service of local visions that are grounded in distinctive assets, oriented towards innovation and committed to performance.Taken together, these metro and state actions are defining a new growth model for national leaders that is simple yet profound. Describe a vision of economic growth that is productive, sustainable and inclusive. Deliver this vision via strategic investments and public-private arrangements in finance, implementation and ownership. Collaborate to compete for the long haul across traditional lines of party, jurisdiction and sector.Will the metro growth model become the national model for 2012 and beyond? Cities and metropolitan areas are not recognised in the American constitution. Due to cultural and structural reasons, the economic power of metropolitan areas far exceeds their political impact. But the vision they offer builds on deeply held American values, and responds to the palpable public yearning for hope and leadership. The most significant political event of 2012 may not be the presidential election but the emergence of the United Metros of America and the potential for national renewal from the ground up.The writer is a vice president at the Brookings Institution and founding director of the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program.

523;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;Twitter turns up heat on ambitions;;The arrival last week of media mogul Rupert Murdoch on Twitter was a symbolic moment for the five-year-old company. The quickfire nature of its 140-character updates has already won over many reporters. After overhauling the design and features of its homepage and mobile apps, Twitter is now gently turning up the heat on its ambitions as an advertising business.“Twitter is more of a journalistic than a marketing phenomenon,” says Mark Read, chief executive of WPP Digital, the advertising group. “If you talk to newspaper editors and people in the media, they are obsessed.”By contrast, Twitter is “still trying to figure out” its advertising products, Mr Read says.Marketers spent an estimated $100m-$150m on Twitter advertising to reach its 100m users last year, compared with forecasts of nearly $4bn for Facebook and its 800m users.“For the right category of marketers – those that involve entertainment properties, personalities, launches and news, those that have their own content or sponsor events – it’s pretty relevant,” Mr Read says. “But it requires a greater degree of sophistication than other forms of online advertising. It’s harder to evaluate its impact.”So far, Twitter’s advertisers have been prepared to pay $1 to $4 for each new follower through “promoted accounts”, though some – such as carmakers – are bidding more than $10. “Promoted tweets”, which make brands’ marketing messages more likely to be seen by more users, are charged based on “engagement”, such as the number of replies or “retweets”.That commercial model is hard to fit into a typical online media-buying plan which tends to revolve around clicks and impressions, says Simon Mansell, chief executive of TBG Digital, a social marketing specialist. “It’s not really simple for an ad buyer to make a purchase.”Twitter needs to grow its revenues rapidly to meet the expectations of its investors who have valued the privately-held company at $8bn.Adam Bain, Twitter’s head of revenue, says: “Twitter the product is five years old, [but] Twitter the business is just slightly over a year old. We’ve done a lot in a short amount of time …Our motto has been to do it right, rather than do it right away.”Only a “handful” of people worked in Twitter’s advertising department when he arrived in September 2010, but now more than 100 are employed in cities such as London and Tokyo, and it is hiring fast.The slow rollout of ads has helped to keep engagement rates much higher than other online formats – low-single-digit percentages of people seeing a sponsored tweet interact with it, compared with a fraction of 1 per cent for Facebook or standard display ads.“The engagement rate on ads is probably the highest I’ve ever seen on any digital advertising that I’ve run in the last 10 years,” says Mr Mansell at TBG Digital.Last month, Twitter began allowing some existing advertisers to use a self-service portal to buy ads. That move in itself was significant because Twitter’s first forays into advertising were with only a handful of carefully selected big brands, such as Starbucks and Paramount Pictures.Today, Twitter has run campaigns from a total of 3,000 brands, with Nike recently launching a new branded @Nike account. Twitter has commitments from some large brands to spend $2m in 2012, according to one source.In recent weeks, “handpicked” smaller advertisers have been brought on board, as long as they know the right people and can meet the $15,000 per month minimum spend.“I got an intro to one of their account managers, over Twitter appropriately enough,” says Damien Tanner, co-founder of Pusher, a real time messaging start-up. “I got the account up and running within a day. I only had to send them a few details. I was very impressed.”While Mr Tanner says his campaigns have been successful in attracting new followers, the overall return on that investment is not obvious. “I don’t have enough data to work out how much I can pay for a follower.”Mr Bain at Twitter said that advertisers “keep coming back for more” after starting to use its ads, but he adds: “Often they need help with ideas, they need help with best practices.”Other advertisers contacted by the Financial Times, who did not wish to speak publicly, gave Twitter and its products mixed reviews, raving about high response rates but describing the advertising system as “limited” and the company as “confusing to work with”.“We were struggling at first with Promoted Tweets but what we discovered is you have to got to be very timely and very current,” says Paul Smith, managing director of Techlightenment, a social marketing agency.Buying ads around phrases linked into live “event TV” such as X Factor or sports games was most successful, he says.“The level of activity and interest on the part of our followers is greater than any other channel,” says Anita Newton, vice-president of retail and digital marketing at AMC Theatres, a cinema owner. For some ad industry veterans, abandoning traditional click-based metrics is no bad thing.“Twitter has the opportunity to disrupt the media business with meaningful new formats, rather trying to retrofit the old ad model,” says Ajaz Ahmed, chairman of AKQA, a large digital agency. “The combination of scale, immediacy and real-time analytics provides an ideal platform for monetisation.”
524;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-01-06T01:39:09Z;Clinton set to downsize store portfolio;;Clinton Cards has started rationalising its sprawling store portfolio in a bid to cut its £80m ($124m) annual rental bill after reporting poor sales of greeting cards and gifts over the crucial Christmas trading period.The retailer has appointed property consultant Jones Lang LaSalle to advise on reducing its 771-store estate, which forms a key plank of incoming chief executive Darcy Willson-Rymer’s strategic review of the business, due to be presented to bank lenders and investors in the second quarter of 2012.“You don’t do a review first, act second, and resolve third,” said Mr Willson-Rymer, the former UK managing director of Starbucks. “We are building this plane as we fly it.” With more stores in shopping malls than any other retailer, recent deals have seen Clintons downsize stores in centres including the White Rose Centre in Leeds, moving to smaller, less expensive units.“There isn’t going to be a wholesale closure of stores, it is about making every store earn its right to be in the portfolio,” he said. “We are reviewing store by store, city by city, town by town and asking is it in the right place, and if it is, is it the right size? As opportunities with landlords come up, we will take advantage.”The high street greetings card retailer which trades from 771 Clintons and Birthdays stores in the UK reported weak trading over its peak Christmas period, but unlike last year, avoided posting a profit warning to its shareholders.In the five weeks to January 1, like-for-like sales at Clintons stores increased by 0.8 per cent compared with the same period a year previously, when sales were hit by the impact of snowy weather. However, there were further sales declines at its 141 Birthdays stores, which fell 2.7 per cent in the same period.Birthdays has failed to turn a profit since Clintons purchased the chain for £50m in 2004, despite putting its Irish business into administration last year, and a pre-pack administration in 2009 which allowed it to shed 136 unprofitable stores.Mr Willson-Rymer has implemented a strategy of daily sales reviews, and changing products on shelves better to match customer behaviour. “In the week before Christmas, we extended displays of wife and girlfriend Christmas cards in all of our shops, as we know men are more likely to shop at the last minute,” he said.Clintons reported pre-tax losses of £10.7m last November, and retail analysts have pencilled in slightly reduced losses of £8.8m for the year to July 2012.On Thursday, shares in Clintons edged up 0.25p to 11.25p, but have fallen 60 per cent in the past year.
525;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2012-01-03T15:47:04Z;The rise of the “artist-businessmen”;;"Happy 2012 to everyone — hope you had a good holiday.Don’t know about you, but I’m finding it a somewhat surreal re-entry, partly because not much seems to have happened in the fashion world — the real world has chugged on — so it feels a bit like time has stood still.Partly, because as we all go back to work the Iowa caucuses begin, and Republican politics are weirdly Magritte-esque at the moment (ceci n’est pas un politician); and partly because of something I just read, in my first non-Canadian newspaper in 10 days.Today my colleague Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson has a story about ex-P&G marketing guru Jim Stengel in which Mr Stengel lists his top 50 brands of the past decade (out of 50,000) as judged by performance, consumer loyalty, and growth. These included the expected names like Apple, Starbucks, Coka and Amazon, as well as some less expected. The only fashion/luxury brands that make the list are Calvin Klein, Diesel, Hermès, Hugo Boss, and Louis Vuitton. Vente-privée, Zappos, and Zara are also there, but arguably these are actually mass consumer brands.Surprised? How about now: Mr Stengel attributes their success largely to four factors, one of which is CEOs who are “artist-businessmen”.Whatever you think of the brands that did make it (or the mega ones that more surprisingly didn’t, like Chanel, Armani and Ralph Lauren), this is intriguing. After all, though Diesel’s Renzo Rosso largely fits the artist-businessman model thanks to his counter-culture positioning, in the last decade of its great growth Calvin Klein has been owned by bottom-line-focused group PVH; Hermès appointed its first non-family, non-artsy CEO in the form of Patrick Thomas; Hugo Boss was bought by Permira Private Equity; and Vuitton became the engine of Bernard Arnault’s empire — Mr Arnault being widely seen as the man who industrialised luxury.Successful as all these executives and groups are, I have never heard them referred to as “artist-businessmen”. Mostly, they are perceived, by industry-watchers at least, as hard-core businessmen, end of story.All of which suggests two things to me. Either one side is wrong — fashion/luxury-watchers or Mr Stengel’s theory — or, and I’m leaning toward this idea, fashion is an exception to his rule. Perhaps, because instead of one artist-businessman at the top it is built on two: the designer and the CEO. Same idea, different execution.Which, in turn, suggests that fashion actually got it right in the first place, and its original model has simply evoloved to suit other industries. Interesting, because fashion never gets any credit for this sort of smart corporate structure.So what do you think?And on another note, what do you think the various Republican candidates will wear when they make their various speeches after the caucus decisions from Iowa roll in tonight? Here’s a bet: no ties. Check back later to confirm/deny."
526;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-12-28T13:05:01Z;Wendy’s re-enters Japanese market;;If Wendy’s, the US hamburger chain, had any doubt whether it would be welcomed back into Japan – a market it withdrew from two years ago – the 300-plus customers who lined up earlier this week to get into its first new restaurant are likely to have blown such worries away.One passionate fan, who was dressed like the Wendy’s girl trademark, complete with red pigtails, apparently missed the burgers so much she waited from 4.30am until the opening at noon and ordered everything on the menu.“We’re very lucky,” says Ernest Higa, president of Higa Industries, the chain’s new Japanese franchisee.The 1,100 customers who visited Wendy’s new Tokyo restaurant on Tuesday exceeded expectations and “now we have to figure out how to handle a bigger crowd”, Mr Higa says.Like many foreign consumer product and services groups, which are lured by Japan’s large markets and discerning consumers, Wendy’s was forced to quit the country in 2009 after differences with its then franchisee.It has returned to Japan’s $240bn restaurant market with plans to open 100 restaurants in five years, which it hopes eventually to increase to 700.Wendy’s is also armed with a fresh strategy – to provide a more upmarket experience of fast food. This has proved successful within the US, where it is poised to overtake Burger King to become the second-largest fast-food chain by market share, according to analysts.The group has relaunched as a fast-casual chain, offering product at prices and speeds somewhere in between a fast-food chain and a restaurant.“As you get older, you might still want to go have fast food but you want higher quality. But if you go to a restaurant it will be more expensive and it will take more time,” says Mr Higa.The shift also applies to its target customer base.While most fast-food chains in the US cater to young people, “Wendy’s concept is to have a broader customer base, from kids to people in their 40s and 50s who can feel uncomfortable in a fast-food chain.“Our store is more [fashionable] like Starbucks, an atmosphere where even if you are an adult it would be OK,” Mr Higa says.Mr Higa, whose company pioneered the pizza delivery business in Japan as the master franchisee of Domino’s Pizza until 2010, has been careful to adapt the business model to the highly demanding Japanese market by adding Japan-only premium hamburgers to its menu.These include the “Foie Gras Rossini”, a premium beef burger with foie gras terrine, which costs Y1,280, and the Truffle and Porcini Grill Chicken at Y920.“In Japan, consumers are fickle so variety is critical,” he says.But can the strategy give Wendy’s a better chance of succeeding in Japan in the long term, or will the notoriously fickle Japanese consumer thwart its ambitions once again?It took Ikea, the Swedish furniture retailer, two tries to succeed in Japan, Burger King also relaunched a few years ago, but has missed its target of opening 100 restaurants in 3 years, according to Kiyoichiro Shigemura, analyst at Nomura.It is important for Wendy’s to succeed in Japan not only because it is a large market – it is the second-largest fast-food market in the world by sales – but also because trends in Japan are often copied in the rest of Asia, Mr Higa says.But some are sceptical of Wendy’s upmarket strategy.“Fast food is expected to be convenient and reasonably priced. I think if they enter the market at that price level, the chances of them failing are very high,” says Mr Shigemura.Fast food restaurants depend on repeat customers, but not many people are going to want to eat foie gras hamburgers all the time, says Yoshimasa Ikazaki, analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets.Mr Higa counters that even in Japan the core offerings are Wendy’s signature burgers, which have a much lower price point at between Y480 for a Wendy’s Burger and Y780 for a Wendy’s Burger triple.“If we just introduced gourmet hamburgers it would be a niche,” he acknowledges.Still he hopes that the gourmet category will catch on and help to differentiate Wendy’s from other chains.The Foie Gras Rossini was the top seller on opening day, which perhaps shows that “some of our adaptations for the Japanese market made sense,” Mr Higa says.
527;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;Facebook to allow advertising in news feed;;Facebook will begin mixing paid advertising content with users’ updates from friends and family in early 2012, marking a commercial invasion of the social activity that the network has generally held to be sacrosanct.Normally relegated to the ad column on the right side of the page, advertisers will soon be able to pay their way into the main Facebook news feed, a move that will help companies reach more potential customers and Facebook to generate more revenues ahead of its IPO. However, it might alienate users who have come to rely on the free service to protect their socialising from ads.“Facebook is under a lot of pressure to make money right now,” said Rebecca Lieb, an analyst with the Altimeter Group. “Users have to understand the value exchange of getting what you pay for.”Facebook experimented with introducing paid advertising into the news feed in late 2006, but discontinued the practice in 2008 because it was too “disruptive” to users.The roll-out in the new year will focus on “Sponsored Stories,” a form of advertising that takes a user’s action on Facebook, such as when a person “Likes” Starbucks or writes a comment on the Coca-Cola page, and repackages it into an ad box that is shown to the person’s friends. Now that ad will appear directly in the stream of updates about friends’ parties and lunch menus.Facebook said it would be cautious with the move.“Our goal is to do this thoughtfully and slowly,” it said. “We hope to show people no more than one Sponsored Story in their news feeds per day and the story will be clearly labelled as sponsored.”Sponsored Stories have raised concerns among privacy advocates and Facebook users who say Facebook is co-opting spontaneous social comments for commercial gain, and that it is unfair that the company does not allow users to opt out from appearing in the ad unit.Ms Lieb added that advertisers might have as much to be concerned about with the new ad placement as users.In newspaper advertising, for example, an airline is guaranteed that its ad will not be placed next to a news story about an aircraft crash, she said. With Facebook ads being integrated into the News Feed, there is no guarantee that an ad will not appear above or below a negative user comment about the advertiser, or a negative comment in general.“It remains to be seen what this advertising will look like next to photographs of people vomiting at a frat party,” she said. “No brand wants that.”Nonetheless, many marketers have been clamouring for greater advertising options to reach Facebook’s vast audience of more than 800m active users.Ben Wood, UK managing director of iProspect, a digital marketing agency owned by Aegis Group, said that Facebook saw sponsored stories in the news feed as its “killer app” for advertisers.“They think it’s the big one,” Mr Wood said. “The news feed is where it’s at. A solution that integrates some kind of brand marketing into that feed is incredibly powerful. But they need to be very careful about what the consumer response is to that.”Additional reporting by Tim Bradshaw in London
528;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-11-30T23:59:58Z;Starbucks reveals UK expansion plans;;Starbucks is betting that coffee is an indulgence austerity-era Brits are unwilling to forgo with the global coffee chain planning to open 300 new outlets in the UK over the next five years and hire 5,000 more people.The move, which comes after an aggressive expansion backfired badly in 2008, is at odds with other parts of the food and drink industry which are being forced to pull down the shutters as cash-strapped consumers curb spending and raw material inflation eats into their profit margins.However, Starbucks’ UK sales have grown for nine quarters in a row on a like-for-like basis – albeit the group still lost £34.2m at the net level in the year to September 30, 2010.Its plans to open 300 new outlets, bringing the UK total to more than 1,000. Much of the expansion will be in the north of the UK.Kris Engskov, Starbucks’ freshly-minted managing director for the UK and Ireland, reckons coffee is having its moment, just as wine did 25 years ago, where drinkers are discovering a taste for different varieties and an interest in the provenance of the product.“This might be a better time than any [to expand],” Mr Engskov added. “Rents are coming down across the UK. If there’s anything we’ve learnt over the last few years, especially in the US, it is to invest ahead of the curve.”Some 200 of the 300 planned new stores will be drive-through stores. While big in the US, where Starbucks has 2,500, there are now just 10 such drive-throughs in the UK but, the chain says, customers are seeking more roadside cafes.Starbucks is teaming up with Euro Garages for the drive-through stores. The privately owned petrol station and forecourt retail group will in turn pay a royalty to Starbucks.The UK move represents a divergence from the US where expansion most recently took the form of diversification into healthier drinks. Starbucks is paying $30m to acquire Evolution Fresh, a Californian juice maker, that it will use to open a new line of outlets focused on nutritious products.Not all the new jobs will be full-time: the average employee works a 30-hour week, and many combine the job with college or other employment. Some 70 per cent of Starbucks’ staff are under 24 years old.
529;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-11-11T21:54:09Z;Occupational hazards;Matthew Horne, a young protester, describes what it’s like being part of the Occupy London encampment outside St Paul’s Cathedral;"I meet Matthew Horne for the first time in the Starbucks opposite St Paul’s Cathedral in central London but he’s not drinking coffee. Peering at his phone, Horne tugs the charger out of the socket on the wall when he spots me approaching, perhaps aware of the incongruity of the situation.“We’ve got generators but sometimes it’s easier just to charge it up in Starbucks,” says the 23-year-old protester. The coffee shop that is the bête noire of the anti-globalisation crowd is part of a network of facilities that now constitutes Horne’s second home.Aware that he is an unlikely candidate for the FT’s At Home feature, he is initially shy about letting me inside his base – a tent outside St Paul’s where he has been living for the past two weeks. He made the 240-mile trek from Lancashire, northern England, to join the Occupy London Stock Exchange encampment on October 25 and doesn’t regret a thing.As he strides out of Starbucks towards the encampment, Horne looks more relaxed. A veteran of the war in Iraq, he is dressed in a military-style camouflage jumpsuit and black Doc Martens. One protester passes by in a Guy Fawkes mask – the signature of the Anonymous hacking collective – and gives him a nod.“It’s quite small and squashed in those tents,” he says. In fact, he’s got a prime spot. Horne’s green Eurohike tent is pitched directly in the line of the cathedral steps, the main focus of the encampment. “I spent eight months sleeping in a bunker in Basra,” he tells me. “This is nothing.”Horne sleeps in his tent full-time, which is unusual – about two-thirds of his fellow protesters sleep at the camp on alternate nights, or alternate weeks. Those who favour a regular washing routine find “full-timing” hard (there are no showers, just six blue portable loos) and many divide their time in order to maintain momentum.It hasn’t put off Horne. “My mum says I always do what I believe is the right thing, and this is the right thing,” he says as I crawl into his tent. The tent – number 143 – is a simple affair. Tents are assigned by co-ordinators and most are donated or left behind by protesters who go home. We cram in, knees crushed against our chins, the chill of the concrete floor felt through a sagging blow-up mattress.“I followed [the Occupy movement] from the very beginning, and I knew something was going to happen eventually,” says Horne in a thick northern drawl. “You can’t go around telling people this information when things are good because people are not going to listen. Now is the right time to spread the word.”Horne has a “softy jacket”, which he uses as a pillow, a small bag of clothes and an insubstantial green sleeping bag which, I’m assured, keeps him warm enough. There’s also a bright yellow high-viz jacket which he dons when he’s in his formal capacity as an “observer” of protests. He says he doesn’t eat much – in his tent there’s a carton of passion-fruit juice and a bottle of Evian water, and some loo roll. Life is simple here.But the lack of possessions is a necessity: there is little floor space. The only detritus is a dirty-looking shirt slung on top of a pile of books and magazines about socialism and economics (although, he says, he’s “not a socialist”). I tell him he lives like a monk. “Every human being needs four things,” he says, “food, water, education and a decent home.”The major theme of the Occupy movement on both sides of the Atlantic has been the income inequality between the top 1 per cent and the rest. So I ask him if even a “1 per center” deserves his four prerequisites to a civilised existence. “Yes, of course,” he says. “But you’ve got people in these multimillion-pound houses, with 30 bedrooms, yet they are the only person in it.” He pauses, then asks with exasperation, “Why do you need such a big house?”Horne has spent most of his life in Colne, a small town in Lancashire. When he left school he worked as a joiner and then joined the military, being sent to Iraq from 2007 to 2008. “I had my 21st birthday in Basra airport,” he tells me with pride. I ask if his inclination to wear military fatigues and his service in Iraq are a contradiction of the principles he expounds. “If you want to know what’s going on in the world, you’ve got to experience it for yourself,” he replies.As we walk through the encampment, which has become a functioning micro-society, Horne picks up errant crisp packets and puts them in the bin. He points out the medical tent, the technical tent, the meditation tent. “I only really use the kitchen,” he says, adding that food is free. “I’m not really into the spiritual thing.”The interaction between protesters usually takes on a very serious tone in the form of general assemblies where the citizens of the camp debate issues and ideas. There doesn’t seem much space for banter.A library called Star Books, created by protesters, impersonates the coffee shop opposite. The education theme is continued with regular talks by economists and political figures. As we walk along, the Marxist philosopher and King’s College London professor Alex Callinicos is giving a speech sitting on the floor of the sizeable Tent City University; John Pilger, the campaigning journalist, spoke earlier in the day. The tent turns into a cinema too – showing later is The Shock Doctrine, based on Naomi Klein’s book, and Iraq for Sale. “No Alcohol or Drugs” signs punctuate the walls.“It’s intellectually vibrant,” says Horne, and he seems clued up, riffing on the iniquity of the “fractional reserve banking system” and liberally quoting Nathaniel Rothschild and Aristotle. “It’s one of the happiest periods of my life,” he says. “This is what democracy should look like. We have people from all walks of life. Everyone is getting along, people get into discussions about their own views and lifestyle. We’ve got people who have quit their job to come here.”Back in the tent, Horne explains he wants FT readers to know he has nothing against them. “The people that work in banks are not the enemy,” he assures me and in fact, he says, FT readers should be down there with him. “They are like everyone else, they just earn more money, and some have worked incredibly hard for that and we understand that. It’s the people at the very top that we focus on.”Horne says he owns a three-bedroom property in Colne but can’t afford to live there so he rents it out, which provides some cash while he’s camping out. Occupying London has the added bonus of being a rent-free activity. He’s also looking for a part-time job in a bar nearby to bump up his income. “I probably won’t tell them I’m camping out,” he says.As we finish speaking, I unzip the small flap of tent, Horne’s only guard against the elements. It’s dark, so I squint at the bright lights around St Paul’s. “I’m going to be here until the end,” he tells me. I ask what he defines that as: eviction? revolution? “Until the government listens,” he shoots back as he races off to another meeting.……………………………………………………………..Favourite thingPerhaps it’s not surprising that Horne’s favourite thing is his inflatable blue mattress. It was bought from an online surplus military hardware store for £20 ($32) when he was planning his trip down to “Occupy” London and is now his most functional possession. “If I didn’t have the mattress I’d be sleeping on the cold floor,” he says.With a packed schedule of meetings and seminars, the mattress – which is small and thin – means he gets the sleep he needs to function. “Having something reasonable to sleep on makes you more productive. Without the mattress my sleep would be interrupted, I’d just get worn out pretty quickly.”"
530;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:08:53+0000;Starbucks to buy California juice group;;Starbucks, the US coffee chain, is tapping into growing demand for healthy food and drink by paying $30m to acquire a juice business that it will use to open a new line of outlets focused on nutritious products.The Seattle-based company said it was buying Evolution Fresh, a Californian juice maker, and declared its determination to change the way juice is sold in the US in the same way it helped to do so for caffeine shots.The Starbucks move follows steps by other big corporations, including McDonald’s and PepsiCo, to promote healthier food and drink amid growing criticism that they are contributing to an obesity crisis in the US.Starbucks fell into financial trouble after over-expanding to the point of ubiquity before the global financial crisis. Diversifying into juice is the brainchild of Howard Schultz, a former chief executive who returned to the job in 2008 to revive the company.Announcing the juice acquisition on Thursday, Mr Schultz said: “Our intention is to reinvent this category in the same [way] that we reinvented over the last 40 years the basic commodity of coffee.”The company said the “super premium” juice segment was a $1.6bn market in the US and that the health and wellness market overall was worth $50bn.Starbucks, which has made cups of coffee costing several dollars a staple of many people’s working days, said most juice would initially sell in 450ml bottles priced between $3.75 and $4.75.Justifying that price tag, Starbucks said Evolution Fresh peeled, pressed and squeezed its own raw fruits and vegetables and used a special high-pressure pasteurisation process that preserved freshness by removing pathogens without heating the juice.Mr Schultz said Evolution juice would be sold through three channels, including an as yet unnamed new line of stores that it will begin to open next year, which will sell juice and food and have tables and chairs for customers.A second channel will be Starbucks coffee shops, where Evolution juice will replace the current range of juices available.The third will be grocery stores – many of which already sell packaged Starbucks coffee – where it will be stocked on shelves alongside other brands.Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Wells Fargo, said: “Over the long term, Starbucks’ ability to leverage its expertise in building a brand and creating an experience around it will translate well into the health and wellness category.”Last summer, McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain, said that it was adding apples to its children’s meals and shrinking the size of its portions of fries.

531;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:15:58+0000;Sales in US and China jolt Starbucks’ profits;Coffee chain posts better than expected results;Coffee shop openings in the US and China helped Starbucks post better-than-expected quarterly sales and profits, which offset the impact of weakness in crisis-hit Europe.The coffee chain, which has 17,000 stores in 55 countries, said net profits jumped nearly 29 per cent to $359m in the three months to October 2, while sales grew at a more moderate 7 per cent but reached a record $3bn.Starbucks’ results were boosted by one-off items, but they underlined its status as one of the few US consumer companies whose domestic business is not suffering from the economic gloom afflicting many Americans.Troy Alstead, chief financial officer, told the Financial Times: “Our US business has been phenomenally strong, our [like-for-like sales] in Asia-Pacific are even stronger yet. Europe has been soft and perhaps that’s no surprise.”Howard Schultz, chairman and chief executive, used the company’s earnings call with analysts to publicise a campaign he has launched to tackle unemployment in the US by providing funding for loans to small businesses.“American business leaders need to step up and address the jobs crisis head on before an entire generation is lost to hopelessness and despair,” he said, adding that Starbucks had created 3,700 new jobs in the past fiscal year..The Seattle-based company’s sales grew by 10 per cent at coffee shops in the US that have been open at least a year.Mr Alstead said sales in China grew by between 30 and 40 per cent. Overall sales in its international business– which encompasses the extremes of China and Europe – increased by 6 per cent.Starbucks opened 131 stores in the US and 620 worldwide, in the 12 months to October 2, including its 500th store in China. In its new fiscal year, which began last month, Starbucks plans to open 800 new stores globally.Mr Alstead described the store openings as “more paced, slower than previously”, a reference to the difficulties Starbucks faced when it over-expanded and fell into financial trouble.After a previous stint as chief executive, Mr Schultz returned to the top job to revive the company in 2008 and cut 10 per cent of its stores.The one-off factors that affected Starbucks’ latest results were the sale of some real estate in Seattle and the acquisition of its joint ventures in Austria and Switzerland.Starbucks has been grappling with the impact of higher coffee prices and Mr Alstead said the problem was currently at its most acute.“The [past] quarter is close to the peak level but the next two quarters will be right about the same at that peak level. But then in second half … that cost moderates for us,” he said.Other US consumer companies have begun to express concern about the the risk of a stronger dollar, which would reduce the value of their overseas earnings in their home currencies. But Mr Alstead said this was not a big issue for Starbucks because 70-75 per cent of its business is in the US.
532;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-10-31T22:56:09Z;The public image: Starbucks interactive rewards promotion;An excellent idea, but with limitations;"Client: Starbucks
Agency: BBDO, Blast Radius, The Media Merchants
Territory: Canada
Verdict:Starbucks had the excellent idea of promoting its latest loyalty scheme by mounting an interactive, tablet-like screen on the front window of four outlets in Toronto and Vancouver.Press one of the stars moving across the screen and up pops information on a reward – for example, a free coffee refill.“They’re hoping to inform people in a very creative, functional way about the rewards programme,” says Brad Foster, chief marketing officer at The Media Merchants, which has provided similar technology for promotions by Hewlett-Packard and Kraft Foods’ Caramilk chocolate brand.By fixing the screens to the outside window, Starbucks is especially targeting new customers.If only it was that simple. Two cyclists waiting for a friend blocked the screen for 15 minutes on Yonge Street in Toronto at lunchtime last week. Glare from the sun made it hard to read.There are no instructions. Numerous jabs yielded no results until a barista explained that only the few-and-far-between gold stars burst into a reward. The barista said the screen was great fun for passing children – presumably not quite the new customers Starbucks has in mind.“Because We Love You Too … ” is the slogan. Starbucks must work a little harder to prove it."
533;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-10-27T19:00:02Z;Change on the cards for loss-making Clinton;;He has been barely two weeks in the job but Clinton Cards’ chief executive Darcy Willson-Rymer has just greeted the chain’s long-suffering investors with pre-tax losses of £10.7m at Thursday’s full-year results.A £55m debt refinancing caused its shares to perk up but a thank-you card is a long way off – Clinton’s share price has crumpled 77 per cent over the past two years as supermarkets, card personalisation websites such as Moonpig, and cheaper rivals have stolen market share.The former Starbucks UK managing director faces the formidable task of turning around the struggling chain. Mr Willson-Rymer, who is the first boss from outside the founding Lewin family, admits that Clinton “hasn’t kept pace with the market”. But he denies that the greetings card industry faces structural decline.“Cards aren’t going to be another books or CDs,” he says, claiming the UK greetings card market is worth £1.5bn annually, of which online cards account for just 3 per cent. The average Briton buys 52 cards a year, “the highest in the world”.However, analysts question how future-proof the card industry really is, when young people tend to find sending friends a birthday message on Facebook is sufficient.“This business is about sentiment and emotion – that’s why it’s sustainable,” Mr Willson-Rymer argues.Investors will have to wait until interim results in March to hear the results of his strategic review. In the meantime, rivals are wasting no time stealing market share.On Thursday, Card Factory, a rival chain owned by private equity house Charterhouse Capital, posted a 56 per cent increase in full year pre-tax profits to £55.7m in the year to January 31. Famed for selling seven cards for £1, most of its 600 shop leases were signed in the last few years, and the weak property market means it is paying a fraction of Clinton’s £80m annual rent bill for its 800-store portfolio.By contrast, Clinton’s like-for-like sales fell 2.9 per cent on revenues which declined 8 per cent to £364m in the 52 weeks to 31 July. The prospect of a steep rise in the price of stamps could decrease demand from its core card shoppers – older women – who may trim their Christmas lists.Birthdays, the 156-store chain Clinton’s acquired for £49m in 2004, is tellingly aimed at a younger demographic, and has never turned a profit. Posting operating losses of £8.6m this year, Mr Willson-Rymer says he will not rule out closing the chain, or folding it into a single Clinton brand.“There are no sacred cows,” he says, adding that the only thing he has definitely ruled out changing is the store’s bright orange branding.Clnton is the UK’s biggest shopping centre tenant by number of stores. Mr Willson-Rymer says he is not opposed to closing stores “which aren’t earning their right to be there”. But he does not want to cut numbers back too radically. He admits there have been “mistakes,” such as having two stores in the same shopping centre in Aberdeen, only one of which is profitable.A family stake of about 50 per cent and a £22m market capitalisation means no independent retail analysts cover Clinton Cards. House broker Numis has yet to update its forecasts but analysts who have previously covered the company believe it will struggle to return to profitability in the next 12 months.Mark Photiades, retail analyst at Singer Capital, wonders how declining footfall in stores can be reversed. “In tough times, people will always make a trip to the supermarket,” he says. “If you can pick a card up there, why make a separate trip to a specialist store?”
534;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-10-21T21:29:14Z;Join the struggle for a decent occupation;The professional class comes up with a splinter group to join the global anti-capitalist movement;"This weekend I shall be joining the global anti-capitalist movement by occupying the Electric Cinema in Portobello Road. This may not mesh entirely with the main agenda but they are showing Contagion and we’ve already got a babysitter.In particular, I shall be occupying the comfy sofas at the back which always seem to be booked up. In this I will be representing the 99 per cent who are denied the best seats by those who are greedy or organised enough to book early. I was initially going to join others at their occupation of the London Stock Exchange but the only movie they ever show there is that boring one depicting the origins of trading.It’s been bothering me for some time that I don’t have a true outlet for protest, especially since these global Occupy movements are garnering a lot of attention for not doing much more than running soup kitchens in salubrious spots. Such is the state of self-flagellation in western societies that their fuzzy laments against the iniquities of life are being taken seriously by commentators and governments. The media just loves them. They only have to announce plans for a coffee run to Starbucks and The Guardian will run a live blog on it. With all this potential for media celebrity, it’s like The X Factor for squatters.The difficulty is that this protest is dominated by students and others with – how shall we put it – time to spare for the global struggle. There’s no real outlet for the professional classes who have kids to take to parties and commitments to juggle. Hence, my own splinter group which – I think rather subversively – synchronises the protest meme with my Google Calendar appointments.Like the main demos, we’ll be using social media for our film protest, but only after the early evening performance, or I might not get a seat myself. So the flashmob will be arranged for the 8.45pm showing. As with last weekend’s demo at St Paul’s, Julian Assange might turn up in support but we’ve redirected him to the Clapham Picture House because we don’t want him spoiling the ending.Mobility is key if we are to avoid being kettled in the cinema and having to keep watching the same movie. So, just before the credits, I and some friends may make a break for it and occupy one of the nearby restaurants – there’s a rather nice Italian round the corner. This time we won’t reveal our intention until the bill comes, at which point we will declare ourselves to be part of the global movement and refuse to pay. We’ll probably still leave a tip, however, in solidarity with the ordinary worker and in case we want to go back.At present, my job only allows me to occupy things at weekends. But I’m certainly prepared to go Monday to Friday if the movement can raise enough money to support my existing lifestyle – and ensure someone is at home when Ocado calls. Some of my fellow anti-capitalists are suspicious of this splinter group but I point out that our new movement should be unfettered by the conventions and traditional protest norms. For example, I’ll probably occupy the local Caffè Nero while my son is at soccer practice. It will be strictly non-violent although things could turn ugly if they’ve run out of apricot Danishes again. I also draw the line at tents; so we’ll probably wrap things up around 11pm, unless we can occupy a Heal’s.We are still at the pre-formative stages on our list of demands. Enthused by the collaborative democracy shown at other demos, I shall be consulting widely at our dinner parties with a view to pinning down our manifesto over the Muscat. I don’t want to jump the gun but a reintroduction of the sibling policy at the best private schools looks a strong contender, and possibly a better deal on family tickets at the movies. That alone may not smash the capitalist system but, I tell you, it would make a difference to ordinary people like us.So come and join us at the cinema on Sunday. But remember – the sofas are taken."
535;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
536;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;Green Mountain falls on Einhorn comments;;Shares in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters tumbled on Monday after the maker of coffee brewing technology was criticised by David Einhorn, the billionaire short seller.In a presentation to the Value Investing Congress in New York titled “GAAP-uccino”, Mr Einhorn attacked the quality of financial disclosure from the manufacturer of single-cup coffee machines and the pods to supply them.Mr Einhorn famously used the same forum in 2007 to argue that Lehman Brothers was in trouble, a year before the investment bank filed for bankruptcy. Last year, his target was Florida property company St Joe, which saw its share price drop by a fifth in two days following Mr Einhorn’s comments.Green Mountain’s share price had more than tripled this year as the company assumed a central role in the market for premium coffee products made for home machines that brew single cups.Both Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts, two of the US’s leading coffee chains, have forecast rapid growth in the single-cup market and signed deals under which Green Mountain will package their coffee into branded capsules.Green Mountain shares rose 41 per cent on the day in March when Starbucks announced its partnership with the company.Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts are betting that US consumers will be attracted by the ease of using single-serve pods at home and by their lack of waste compared with traditional drip coffee machines.Packaged coffee promises higher profit margins for the coffee chains than their branded stores, and prospects for the industry mean that Green Mountain trades at a valuation more commonly associated with leading online media companies, around 40 times earnings for 2012.Mr Einhorn attacked the quality of Green Mountain’s reported results, however, and said single-serving coffee remains a luxury item and so the market will be smaller than the more optimistic forecasts assume.The company declined to comment.Shares in Green Mountain were down 10.4 per cent to $82.50 at close of trading. The stock had been a favourite of short sellers in January, with more than a fifth on loan. Short interest had dwindled as the shares rose this year. They stood at 8 per cent on Friday, Data Explorers reported.Mr Einhorn has often been a vocal investor. In May, he called for the Microsoft board to sack Steve Ballmer as chief executive. Last month, a deal to shore up the troubled finances of the New York Mets baseball team by selling a $200m minority stake to Mr Einhorn fell apart after the two sides could not agree on whether or not he would one day become majority owner of the team.
537;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;Greggs picks its moment to take on Starbucks;;"There are flying ducks on the walls, comfy seats and not a sausage roll in sight; Greggs, the UK’s biggest baker, has combined tongue-in-cheek heritage with innovation at its pilot coffee shop, Greggs Moment.With Costa Coffee next door, M&S Kitchen just yards to the left and Starbucks a few units to the right in Northumberland Street in Newcastle city centre, Greggs is spoiling for a fight with the competition as it trials the move into coffee shops.Shy bairns get nowt, runs the Geordie saying, and Greggs is fighting the competition on multiple fronts. It is fighting them on price; its sandwiches, for example, are £1 or more cheaper than most of the opposition’s offerings.It is fighting on ambience; while not everybody likes quirky kitsch, its interior decor has a freshness its rivals lack. And it is fighting the opposition – at least on its Newcastle home turf – on reputation and sheer brand devotion.“Everybody loves Greggs; it’s just gorgeous”, says Angela Cheetham, an employee of Northumbria University’s human resources department, relaxing after lunching on a chicken and stuffing pie, from the Greggs Moment signature “gourmet square pie” range. Asked to name her favourite Greggs product, she hesitates. “It’s just too difficult.”But even in Newcastle, where the company was founded in 1939 and opened its first shop 60 years ago, there are some dissenters. “I just associate Greggs with fast food rather than a nice coffee,” says Francesca Nuttall, a 20-year-old history and politics student, sipping a Starbucks cappuccino. But the constant flow of customers into the new Greggs unit, which has been trading for nearly two weeks, shows many people disagree.Of Greggs’ 1,500 shops around the UK, fewer than 120 have seating, and this is ancillary to their prime retail function. Others have takeaway hot drinks. But Greggs Moment is its first coffee shop dedicated solely to eating in.Richard Hutton, Greggs’ finance director, says it was decided Greggs Moment should not simply replicate the shops’ range – a policy which might just divert customers from its existing outlets – but should tailor products for people sitting down with more time. Thus, instead of sausage rolls there are sausage and bean pies with cheesy mash.“You trust in the brand; because I knew it was Greggs I thought it would be nice,” says Carol Allen, a teacher who has arranged to meet two friends at Greggs Moment. Relaxing in deep settees beside a bookcase, they have polished off three pots of tea, a lemon meringue pie, a rocky road cake and a scone, all for under £8. They like it so much they are staying for lunch.The UK coffee shop market was worth £1.2bn in 2010 according to Mintel, but is predicted to grow to £1.6bn by 2015, says Mr Hutton. Greggs believes this offers it scope even though major supermarkets are considering standalone coffee shops too.Greggs’ focus on food means it can do a better job than existing rivals, asserts Mr Hutton. “We felt there was a need to offer better value.” Innovations include the Brekkles cake – an Eccles cake topped with yoghurt and fruit – fresh lemon tea muffins for £1.15 and smoked bacon and cheese scones for £1.25, warm with butter.By year end it will analyse the pilot shop’s performance. The next step would be several more coffee shops in contrasting locations.Greggs has so far avoided much of the gloom enveloping the hight street, lifting total sales 5.4 per cent in its third quarter, with like-for-like sales growth of 0.8 per cent.Mr Hutton declines to discuss the – presumably tight – margins on which the new unit is operating. But if price-sensitive consumers’ love affair with Greggs continues, its coffee shop Moment may have come."
538;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;Ms Murphy’s law will help push football in a new direction;Brands seem to be the UK’s last prized economic assets, writes Simon Kuper;It was a surprise to find that such an English pub still exists in today’s England. The Red White & Blue, in Portsmouth, is not a gastropub or Starbucks or French bakery. It’s just a pub. Its signboard shows a ship sailing under a Union Jack flag. The pub’s no-nonsense landlady, Karen Murphy, seems to have sprung straight from the 1970s. The only un-English thing about the place is that for a while it showed Greek television. Ms Murphy bought the TV feed as the cheapest way to supply her customers with football matches from the English Premier League.This week Ms Murphy won and lost a court case against the Premier League. The European Court of Justice said she was free to buy a decoder card from anywhere in Europe to watch matches herself. However, if she wanted to show them to her customers, she had to use British TV.Ms Murphy’s pub looks like an historic British institution, yet uses globalised business methods. The same goes for the Premier League: 20 old English clubs supported around the world. Scarcely impeded by the court’s ruling, the clubs are finally starting to monetise their global brands. Their battle to do so is the story of the new British economy (or what remains of it) writ small.Thirty years ago the UK had mines, manufacturers and a City of London run by Brits. The mines have since closed, as have many manufacturers, whereas the City is now dominated by foreigners. Still, not to worry. The UK has one thing left to sell: its historic brand names. During the British empire it convinced many foreigners to attach themselves emotionally to brands such as Cadbury’s, the royal family, the BBC and Manchester United.Today brands seem to be the UK’s last prized economic assets. Foreign students, including a Gaddafi, have filled British universities. Tata of India has bought Tetley’s tea, Jaguar and Land Rover. Americans own Cadbury, Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool FC.Football clubs exemplify the strength of British brands. The modern game, like much of the modern world, was born in Victorian Britain. That means British clubs have the oldest brands. Because the UK has since avoided dictators, civil wars or foreign invasions, these brands have grown uninterrupted. These venerable institutions interact excitingly with the young men who inhabit them. When a player shows insubordination to his club, as Carlos Tevez of Manchester City did recently, a delicious frisson arises. And the whole show is performed in the new global language.The result is that much of the world consumes English football. I once met an Albanian who under Stalinism had taught himself English by secretly listening to match commentaries on the BBC World Service under the bedclothes. Manchester United claims 333m fans worldwide – many of whom, judging by recent TV pictures, were Libyan rebel fighters sporting pirated shirts. But it’s not just United. Africans cram into “show houses” or “chicken parlours” to watch English games.Yet globally, many more people could be watching. The Initiative, Futures Sport + Entertainment consultancy says that a few tens of millions of viewers worldwide see at least parts of the biggest Premier League games live at home. That figure omits people watching in places such as pubs and clubs, and it is much bigger than for almost all other sport, though it is still disappointing given English football’s global popularity. The Premier League’s strategy has been to restrict viewing by selling games mostly to pay channels. Yet in India and China very few people subscribe to these channels.The global market for English football exists. However, the delivery channel needs rethinking. Selling to pay channels reaches only a small proportion of foreign fans. It has also not produced very much foreign income yet. The Premier League sold all its overseas broadcasting rights for 2010-2013 for about £1.4bn, or 40 per cent less than it got for British rights alone. Admittedly foreign revenues are rising fast. In a decade, three-quarters of the league’s TV money could come from abroad, says Stefan Szymanski, sports economist at the University of Michigan.But perhaps the Premier League could accelerate that by staying on pay channels where that model works – particularly in the US, where viewing records for soccer have been tumbling in recent months – but shifting to terrestrial TV in countries such as India and China. Kevin Alavy, director of Initiative, says when English games appeared on terrestrial TV in Indonesia, viewing figures hit “eight digits”. For some English matches, half of all global viewers can be Indonesians.Gaining more global viewers would allow English clubs to charge sponsors more. Bayern Munich, regular performers on terrestrial TV, earned €172.9m ($231.3m) from commercial income in 2009-10, or nearly double Manchester United’s figure. English football could experiment: sell some matches to free channels and others to pay TV. Liverpool-Manchester United on terrestrial TV could reach in the low hundreds of millions of live viewers worldwide, says Mr Alavy. Few other TV programmes and certainly no foreign league match, not even Real Madrid-Barcelona, could rival that, he adds.English football’s future is finding smarter ways to milk its global brands. The same is true of the British economy.
539;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;Starbucks seeks donations for job scheme;Wristbands aim to raise funds for microfinance;Starbucks is to ask the 60m Americans who use its coffee shops each week to help solve the US jobs crisis with a partnership looking to raise millions of dollars for community lending institutions so that they, in turn, can provide microfinance and other loans to struggling small businesses.Howard Schultz, chief executive officer of the chain, announced the partnership with Opportunity Finance Network weeks after launching a campaign urging companies to accelerate hiring and to withhold political contributions until members of Congress and President Barack Obama reach a bipartisan debt reduction deal.The Starbucks Foundation has started the campaign, under the slogan “Create jobs for USA”, with a $5m donation. Stores will start offering red, white and blue wristbands with the word “indivisible” on them to anyone making a donation over $5 from November.“The number one issue with regards to unemployment is access to credit for small business,” Mr Schultz told a New York lunch hosted by Bloomberg View. Banks were sitting on cash largely because of heightened regulatory scrutiny, he argued. With the nationwide reach of Starbucks, “we’ll raise millions of dollars very quickly”.Mark Pinsky, chief executive of Opportunity Finance Network, said the money raised would be distributed to community development financial institutions, or CDFIs, which he described as “profit-making but not profit-maximising” organisations that use their local roots to work closely with borrowers.The CDFIs will make the credit decisions about microloans, housing project financing, community centre loans and small business loans, he added. Those loans typically range from under $10,000 to as much as $200,000, Mr Pinsky said.Mr Schultz said he had no interest in running for office and would not single out the president or either main party for criticism, but was acting as “a concerned citizen”. His pledge to withhold campaign contributions had been signed by more Democrats than Republicans, he said, but reflected “profound disappointment and, I’d say, disgust with the unbelievable partisanship” on display in Washington.“I want to send a message to Washington and, unfortunately, the only message they understand is money,” he said, adding that the prospect of an election campaign costing $5.5bn in 2012 was “sick”.Without honesty from political leaders and the promise of both shared sacrifice and shared prosperity in future, “we’re going to see riots in the streets”, he said, citing the Occupy Wall Street protests in lower Manhattan. “We need an analogue to the Marshall Plan [for reconstructing Europe after the second world war], but the Marshall Plan was based on leadership and we have none of it,” he added.Mr Schultz is due in New York City’s Harlem section on Tuesday to unveil what the company called a new business model aimed at deepening its commitment to underserved communities. He did not disclose details of the planned partnerships with the Abyssinian Development Corporation in Harlem and the Angeles Urban League in Crenshaw, California.

Since the only way to do that is to have a presence in as many countries as possible, the UK company intends to “get there first” and is “running through a list of countries”, chief executive Mark Dixon told beyondbrics.Regus is pushing ahead quickly – its most recent openings in Croatia and the Ivory Coast brought its global presence up to 90 countries.Dixon intends to open over 800 additional business centers, mostly via joint ventures with local landlords, over the next three years.The next two centers are to be located in Kuwait and Slovenia and the group is eyeing moves into 30 new countries, such as Nepal, Madagascar and Uruguay.The company – whose clients include Google, Starbucks, Nokia, GE, GlaxoSmithKline, Bloomberg and Accenture – has had mixed results over the past two years. It suffered a loss of £6.1m in 2010 before recording a pre-tax profit of £13m ($21m) in the six months to June 2011. However Dixon is confident that his business model is “recession friendly” and points to record occupancy numbers (last recorded at 86 per cent) to support his claim.The company’s aggressive expansion is based on the belief that a “workplace revolution” is underway with demand for “mobile work platforms” set to increase rapidly.Local governments, keen to get Regus into their countries, clearly agree and Dixon said that invitations are not uncommon.Essentially, Regus is hoping that companies, to save money, will opt to rent bespoke space from a centralised source rather than invest directly or rent from diffuse third parties.But whether demand for such facilities will hold up in a more positive, confident, business climate remains to be seen.Related reading:

542;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-09-13T15:20:07Z;7-Eleven becomes Indonesia’s trendy hangout;;An unlikely makeover for 7-Eleven from a corner store into trendy hangout is helping the world’s biggest franchiser crack the lucrative but tough Indonesian market.On an average Friday night in Jakarta, pavement tables are packed with young urbanites, talking over the thump of techno music, sipping imported beer and text-messaging friends through a wireless hotspot.This might sound like a trendy new nightclub in Tokyo or London, but the crowd is packing the local 7-Eleven convenience store in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, which has the world’s largest Muslim population.7-Eleven’s products in the country do not contain pork but the stores sell alcohol, and hot meal choices include Indonesian rice and chicken, instant noodles and hot sauce. The free internet and sidewalk seating make it an automatic draw for the young crowd, who park their bikes outside.“It’s the new Indonesian lifestyle of 24-hour convenience, fast food, Twitter and Facebook. The growing middle class is demanding such services,” says Henri Honoris, president director of PT Modern Putra Indonesia, 7-Eleven’s Indonesian franchisee.“Rather than go to the street vendors – the warung – or traditional markets, they are now getting used to the idea of these modern, convenience services”, Mr Honoris says.7-Eleven’s move began without fanfare last year, when a handful of pilot stores opened under the franchise deal with PT Modern Putra Indonesia. The agreement took 7-Eleven into its first new market in 16 years.Twenty stores began operating, selling signature Slurpee and BigGulp drinks and putting the bright green and orange logo on Indonesian streets. Sales from the 7-Eleven stores jumped almost 700 per cent to $15.6m in the first half of 2011 and are expected to reach $37m for the full year, PT Modern Putra Indonesia said.Business has been so brisk that the franchisee said last month it would invest an additional $18m to increase to 57 outlets in 2011. It plans to more than double again next year to 117.7-Eleven’s presence in Indonesia may appear small – it has close to 40,000 outlets worldwide, making it larger than McDonald’s. Yet the new formula of blending a small supermarket with a food and beverage retailer with seating signals an important shift for the company, which was acquired by its Japanese franchisee Ito-Yokado in 1991 after running into financial trouble.The initial success in Indonesia comes in an increasingly competitive market in the emerging democracy of 240m people. Foreign food retailers are attracted by Indonesia’s steady economic growth, which reached 6.5 per cent in the first half of this year, driven largely by rising consumer spending.About 131m Indonesians, or 55 per cent of the population, earn at least $2 a day – almost 50m more than in 2003 – an income that makes them middle class, according to the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.7-Eleven, founded in Dallas in 1927, is among scores of foreign companies scrambling for a share of the largest consumer market in Asia after China and India.McDonald's, Burger King and – to a lesser extent – Starbucks are 7-Eleven’s closest competitors in Indonesia, but those chains are not expanding as rapidly. McDonald's, which arrived in 1991, has 112 outlets and plans to open 16 new branches in 2011. Burger King is targeting 40 restaurants this year, up from 17. Starbucks entered in 2002 and has 100 coffee shops.The bulk of 7-Eleven’s clients are students and young professionals who do not splurge on gourmet coffee or upscale dining, but are eager to try something new, said Mr Honoris, who signed the Indonesian 7-Eleven franchise in November 2009.The selection and service at Indonesian 7-Elevens is similar to the traditional American chain, with BigBite hot dogs and $0.60 coffee. Yet the small differences are what seem to be making it such a hit.“Modern Putra’s first wave of openings has surpassed both ours and their expectations”, said Chris Tanco, vice-president for 7-Eleven Inc. They “are very popular among the millennial crowd [16-35-year-olds], and they especially enjoy Slurpee drinks.”It is hard to know if the Indonesian business will grow to the size of those in Japan, Thailand or Taiwan, which have a combined 24,000 outlets. But Indonesia’s population is larger than the three countries combined and growing faster.
543;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;US Postal Service: postmortem;Feckless politicians are hindering an efficient but lossmaking post office;In the words of its first postmaster, “time is money”, and the US Postal Service is rapidly running out of both. Of course, even after shedding 110,000 employees in the past four years, more than all but the largest companies’ entire workforces, it remains so huge that Benjamin Franklin would scarcely recognise the old place. For example, it has more retail outlets than McDonald’s, Walmart and Starbucks combined.That, and many other aspects of its business, are part of the problem that will probably drive it into default by October. The popular view that this is a result of vanishing “snail mail” and its own inefficiency is inaccurate though. Today’s postmaster has lobbied for changes that could save $20bn annually by 2015 – twice its projected 2011 net loss. But his hands are tied by Congress where several bills that would allow lay-offs (opposed by powerful postal unions) or more limited service (abhorred by voters) languish.Technically, Washington writes the rules without holding the purse strings as the USPS is self-financing. But a $15bn credit line nearing exhaustion has acted as an implicit subsidy as well as a way to avoid tough decisions. The USPS ploughed much of this back into mandatory pension contributions that it will now miss for the first time, triggering technical default. That deadline may come and go though and normal service could continue through next summer. With elections looming, Congress must then make a decision or cough up more loans.A post office, even one with fewer branches and delivery days, is quite a useful thing to have but need not cost taxpayers a penny. By global standards, the USPS is efficient and there are reasons to believe it could become more so given the chance. Instead, feckless politicians probably will inform them that their unwanted cheque is in the mail.E-mail the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
544;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-08-30T22:02:43Z;Taiwan’s coffee chain challenger;;"Anyone who has enjoyed such concoctions as the sea salt coffee or the taro-flavoured marbled bread served in Wu Cheng-Hsueh’s 85C cafés might easily picture him as an eccentric food scientist fervently devising surprising combinations of flavour and texture.Then there is the lively waiting room outside his office in a Taiwan business park. Laid out just like one of 85C Bakery Café’s coffee shops, two employees work coffee machines behind the counter and cheerily offer drinks and snacks.But inside his plain office, with its solid desk and slightly worn sofas, Mr Wu’s demeanour is sober and his appearance in a black buttoned-up shirt is serious. “I was never especially interested in the food and beverage business. I just went where there was money to be made,” he says candidly.On one office wall is a slab of marble that is a nod to one of the many and various entrepreneurial ventures that preceded 85C, and that helped him amass the funds to start the chain in 2004 with one outlet on the edge of Taipei. The 85C chain now has more than 300 outlets across Taiwan and has expanded into mainland China, with a few outposts in Australia and the US. Last year it listed on the Taiwan stock exchange as Gourmet Master.Mr Wu set up 85C after he saw an opportunity to provide “affordable luxury”; hence the experimenting with ingredients in search of added value. The name comes from Mr Wu’s belief that 85 degrees centigrade is the best temperature to serve coffee.As a child, Mr Wu moved around Taiwan frequently as his father pursued a succession of casual jobs. He just managed to graduate from high school and never had the opportunity to go to college. Now 44, Mr Wu still recalls the first time he was able to afford a car – a Toyota Camry – in his early twenties. “I was so happy that I slept in the car on the first night I got it,” he says.Taiwan serial entrepreneur Wu Cheng-Hsueh started up in several different sectors before founding 85C. Here are his tips for success:●Funds and experience are paramount. These, rather than an ingenious business idea, are the two most important ingredients to success. They are also vital to giving you choices about the business you want: “When you are starting out and do not have a lot of funds, your choice of industries or businesses to get into is limited,” Mr Wu says.●Get a grip on every detail. An entrepreneur must have control over all the details of the business: “That is how you learn not to make the same mistake twice.”●Be flexible, be fast. Have the courage to admit you are wrong and, thereby, stop your losses. “If your strategy is incorrect, you have to adjust immediately – the speed and flexibility with which you do this will determine whether you succeed or fail.”Before opening the first 85C store, he had set up a hair salon, a shoe-sole factory and an interior decoration business, among several others.Mr Wu started the hair salon with some friends as a 23-year-old fresh out of military service. “The start-up funds needed were not big. We just had a small shop …I knew friends who were hairdressers, and so we decided to pool our money,” says the softly spoken Mr Wu. With no haircare expertise, “I was responsible for chatting with the customers”.Six months later, a chat with a customer who owned a shoe factory inspired him to leave the hair salon to open a factory making rubber soles.Mr Wu’s tanned, rugged face breaks into a smile as he makes light of entering such a different business where, again, he had little experience. “I felt I could make a go of it because it didn’t really involve any special technology or knowledge. If I didn’t understand it I just found someone who did,” he says.Among all his ventures, some have made more money than others, he says. “But I never lost big on any of my ventures. If I had, I wouldn’t have been able to start the next business.”The 85C chain is, however, his greatest success by far. It expanded quickly, thanks to aggressive recruitment of franchisees, and within two years it had achieved its goal of overtaking Starbucks as the biggest coffee chain in Taiwan. Mr Wu had even made sure he sourced his beans from the same premium Guatemalan supplier as the US chain. A year later, 85C expanded into China.It was not his first foray into mainland China – he manufactured some of his rubber soles there. Costs were lower, but he found business much tougher there and after two years he sold his stake and returned to Taiwan, aged 27. The next venture, as an interior decoration contractor specialising in marble, was when he experienced his first big setback – customers failed to pay when the property market crashed. These experiences taught him lessons that he is now applying to 85C. “I prefer having my own brand,” he says, adding that, in food retail, “which is an all-cash business …at least there won’t be any bad debts.”Mr Wu got the idea for 85C when he and some colleagues had afternoon tea at the Grand Hyatt hotel in Taipei. “It was very tasty, but the price was certainly not affordable for most people,” he says. They wondered if it would be possible to make pastries and coffee as good as a five-star hotel’s, but sold at half the price.Mr Wu hired pastry chefs and bakers from Taiwan’s top hotels, including the Grand Hyatt, to make 85C’s trademark unusual bread and cakes, such as a squid-ink buns and bread using yeast grown on grapes. He has aimed to keep prices affordable without the product losing freshness by using standardised, large-scale production. The dough is prepared in a central kitchen, frozen and then shipped to the stores to be baked.The biggest investment Mr Wu has to make in the business, he says, is also the biggest challenge – recruiting and managing people. “The most difficult thing about a food and beverage business is managing people …how do you train and educate them? It is not like a factory where everyone is in the same place.” This is especially the case in China where the cafés, which are directly operated by 85C instead of through franchisees, are spread out geographically.With little idea of how to prepare inexperienced employees for working in a café chain, Mr Wu decided to emulate KFC and McDonald’s and institute a very specific set of instructions that would be common to all cafés.He also hired staff from the two big US chains. “When KFC and McDonald’s went to China there weren’t a lot of food and beverage [trained employees] there, so they trained a lot,” he says. “Now those people are senior staff and when I went [to China], I was able to pick up a bargain [by hiring them].”While he looked to KFC and McDonald’s for ideas on retail, he says: “Now that we have more than 10,000 staff, the retail side is just part of the whole equation.” He is increasingly focusing on processes and logistics, such as innovations in preparing pastries on an ever bigger scale.Part of the reason for listing was to raise funds to expand the current 150 or so 85C shops in China to a planned 1,000. Like other entrepreneurs who have listed for the first time, the move represents a big a change. “Everyone becomes your supervisor. You have to be responsible to the regulator, your shareholders and society,” he says. “However, in order to run a sustainable business, this is a path that must be taken.” Looking on the bright side, he says, “It is because there are all these people scrutinising your company that you know immediately if you are doing something wrong, and that way, you can improve and run a better company.”"
545;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-08-28T16:17:10Z;Caterpillar chief attacks Washington;;The head of one of the US’s biggest manufacturers has launched a scathing attack on Washington, saying the country’s economy could be dragged into another recession because of political brinkmanship on Capitol Hill.In an interview with the Financial Times, Doug Oberhelman, chief executive of Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of earthmoving equipment by revenue, said he feared that pending bilateral trade agreements and road-building legislation could fall victim to political bickering.Mr Oberhelman joins a growing chorus of US business leaders who say they are fed up with the widening gap between Democrats and Republicans, displayed most recently in the gridlock over the debate to raise the country’s debt ceiling.Howard Schultz, Starbucks chief executive, has called on his peers to stop donating to politicians until Congress reaches a bipartisan agreement on debt reduction. More than 100 business leaders have backed the campaign, including Duncan Niederauer of NYSE Euronext, Walter Robb of Whole Foods and Myron Ullman of JC Penney.Mr Oberhelman’s remarks – which are notable for a company that in spite of being a strong industrial force, rarely speaks out on political issues – indicate a deeper concern that the lack of political consensus could continue to paralyse US government and derail the US’s fragile economic recovery.The Caterpillar chief blamed political leaders in Washington for their inability to find agreement over the debt ceiling, an issue that contributed to Standard & Poor’s downgrading of the US’s credit worthiness.“The process was ugly and it was a red herring of a problem,” Mr Oberhelman said. “The politicians turned [it] into this big giant thing that scares people. I’m equally critical of both sides.”He said the debate had also poisoned the US’s political atmosphere, saying it diminished the chances of securing Congressional approval for outstanding trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea, which he said were critical to keeping US companies internationally competitive.“This deficit debate sucked all the air out of Washington,” Mr Oberhelman said. “Here we are with no free trade agreements, not anywhere in sight. Meanwhile, our competitors, led primarily by China, are signing up countries to free trade agreements.”He said he was also concerned that road-building legislation could fall victim to partisan squabbling.“Spending on infrastructure made us one of the most competitive economies on the planet. But now our infrastructure is deteriorating badly. We have decided as a country not to invest in infrastructure any more. It’s short-sighted and it’s dangerous for the future of our country. We cannot give up our international competitiveness. That’s what’s at stake.”
546;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-08-24T23:59:53Z;Schultz’s donation plea gains momentum;;A campaign led by Howard Schultz, Starbucks chief executive, that calls on top executives to halt political donations to Washington lawmakers is gaining momentum, in a sign of the deep frustration felt by some business leaders about political paralysis and dysfunction in the US capital.Mr Schultz said in a letter on Wednesday that more than 100 business leaders had signed on to a two-part pledge he unveiled last week, which seeks an end to political donations to incumbent lawmakers until a bipartisan debt reduction deal is agreed by Congress, and urges the executives to accelerate employment at their companies. Among top executives who signed the pledge are Duncan Niederauer of the NYSE, Walter Robb, co-chief executive of Whole Foods, Myron Ullman, the head of JC Penney, and Barry Sternlicht, who leads Starwood Capital Group.The chief executive of the global coffee chain is asking Congress to reach a debt reduction deal that would both address government spending on expensive programmes such as Medicare and Medicaid and increase revenue, although the pledge is not specific about the kinds of tax increases an agreement should include.“As many of our political leaders campaign and vacation, the US economy remains in a cycle of fear and uncertainty,” Mr Schultz said in a letter. “I’m encouraged that many of you agree there is a way to break this cycle of fear.”He added that the initiative represented an opportunity for organisations and businesses who share the goal of “putting country above partisanship”.While it is too early to say whether the pledge will ultimately cut into lawmakers’ coffers, Mr Schultz’s activism is symbolically important because it exposes the growing dissatisfaction among business leaders with wrangling among lawmakers.The sense of gridlock in Washington seemed to reach new heights this summer as the Republican-led House of Representatives and White House tussled over an agreement to increase the US debt ceiling. A deal reached in the 11th hour saved the US from a default on its debts, but not before testing the US markets and voters’ faith in the Congress and Barack Obama.Standard & Poor’s, the ratings agency, downgraded the US in the wake of the debt ceiling debacle, in part because it said it doubted the ability of the political system to confront the challenge of rising debt loads.The US president is expected to unveil his own jobs plan in early September, as is Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential candidate. The White House said on Wednesday that Mr Obama talked to General Electric chief executive Jeffrey Immelt and Ken Chenault, the American Express chief, on a conference call.The men co-chair Mr Obama’s jobs council and are preparing a new push to increase the number of engineers that graduate from American institutions. The council is also discussing a plan to put more construction workers back to work through a programme to upgrade buildings to make them more energy efficient. Mr Obama, who is on vacation in Martha’s Vineyard, has also spoken with billionaire investor Warren Buffett and Ford executive Alan Mulally to discuss economic issues.
547;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-08-21T15:11:43Z;Companies can keep clients and employees happy;Customer satisfaction and staff happiness should be mutually beneficial;"The customer is king, right? Not according to Rob Hamilton, founder of office brokerage business Instant. His business has grown rapidly over the past 12 years, success that Hamilton puts down to making his employees happy first.“You can say, I really want our customers to have X and Y, but it is the people in the business who know how to do that,” he explains.Instant practices what it preaches when it comes to keeping employees happy, winning multiple awards for its workplace culture. It has a set of principles to back this, not just pledging fair pay but promoting fun, such as an evening of ballroom dancing involving cast members from BBC’s Strictly Come Dancing ­programme.Another way Instant lightens the mood while encouraging camaraderie is the daily tea round, in which a different person in each of the company’s three offices, in London, Sydney and Miami, takes a cup of tea and a slice of cake to each of their colleagues.In London, where there are 80 employees, it takes an hour to get round everyone with the tea trolley, according to Hamilton, who is part of the rota. However, he insists that even for the managing director this is time well spent for raising morale and team spirit. “It sounds like a really silly little thing, but it is amazing the bonding it provides,” he says, adding that in London there is quite a competition among staff now over who bakes the best cakes.Hamilton adds that the Bolivian cleaner, who is not even a full-time employee, recently cooked a Bolivian delicacy for everyone because he wanted to be part of the culture.Hamilton is in good company with his employee-first strategy. Sir Richard Branson of the Virgin Group and Howard Schultz at Starbucks have both pushed the same mantra.However, there are many other successful entrepreneurs holding the opposite, more conventional, view that only a focus on those buying the end product can sustain profitable growth.Jack Ma, chief executive of the highly successful ­China-based internet marketplace Alibaba.com, has taken this to an extreme, claiming that customers take priority because they provide the revenue, but shareholders, who come and go, must come last, even after the employees.Mark Needham, founder and chairman of Widget UK, a distributor of portable electronic devices, has difficulty understanding any argument that does not put customers first because without them nobody gets paid. “There is a serious debate to be had about how the income from those customers is to be shared by employees, management and shareholders, and there is evidence to show that employees’ share of this income has diminished over the past 20 years,” he says. “But organisations which do not prioritise customer needs do not stick around to enter this debate.”Others believe the problem comes in asking to choose between customers and employees when both are important and their needs are interconnected.For 35 years, Marcel Landau and his brother Tony built their Lincolnshire-based furniture and retail packaging business, Marland, by focusing on keeping staff happy. Marcel claims that happy staff are the raw material for attracting and retaining customers – critical for a business starting from scratch.The company was sold to Nottingham-based Gee Tee five years ago. At the time it was said to have a good name and strong orders, but needed investment and streamlining, including getting rid of some staff. However, Marland did not prosper under its new owner and was put into administration two years ago.The Landaus started again with a former customer, Smartbox, a German supplier of cardboard packaging and storage products. The new business, LSM Consumer & Office Products, started life with four of Smartbox’s existing customers in the UK, which meant that customer service became more important than employee satisfaction, according to Marcel.“It depends on what the premise of your business is,” he says. “If you start with nothing you have to start with focusing on your employees. If you start with customers, then you have to focus on them.”Alex Macpherson, who leads the ventures team at private equity firm Octopus Investments, says an entrepreneur should see the employees as one of several customers within a business, which includes customers, shareholders and external suppliers. “Any business that chooses to ignore or prefer one over the other in anything other than the short-term does so at its peril,” he says.In a service business, Macpherson notes, the company could not function if the employees did not return to work each day.
“A business may well have a customer base, but who owns this? Is it the business or the employee with whom that customer interacts?“As a result, the business should be mindful of treating its employees as an internal customer, listening to their needs and adapting processes to maximise productivity, which almost certainly is optimised when the work force is content.”Guy Letts ran the customer service operation at accountancy software business Sage. He quit his role two years ago to found Customer Sure, a supplier of software that automates the process of customer feedback. Letts claims that the companies people most admire for customer service also have a strong emphasis on keeping staff happy. He points to the example of banking business First Direct, notable for being one of the few call centre operations that people actually want to work for, and John Lewis, the retailer “owned” by the people who work for it through the company’s employee-owned share structure.“You cannot sustain customer satisfaction without caring for the people you expect to deliver it,” he says. “If you understand this it becomes a virtuous circle.”"
548;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-08-16T21:59:37Z;Warren Buffett on American taxes;A plutocrat is sick of being coddled and wants to pay up;It is time for the US government to get serious about shared sacrifice, writes Warren Buffett in the New York Times this week. He paid just 17 per cent tax on his income last year, he explains, but his employees paid between 33 and 41 per cent. The mega-rich, Mr Buffett says, have been coddled too long.It is telling – and welcome – that more business leaders are becoming fed up with politicians unable to get their fiscal act together. Until they do, says Howard Schulz, head of Starbucks, business should withhold political donations.On the substance, Mr Buffett is correct, as far as he goes. Moderate progressivity, which the US tax code fails to provide at the top end, is a good thing in any income tax system. But whether this standard of fairness is best satisfied by raising the highest marginal tax rates (rather than, say, broadening the tax base) is a separate question – one that Mr Buffett glides over.Mr Buffett’s frequent pleas to be taxed more heavily delight the Obama administration, which has made higher taxes on “millionaires and billionaires” the centrepiece of its fiscal policy. Yet Mr Buffett does not endorse Mr Obama’s plan to raise tax rates for households making more than $250,000 a year. He says rates should rise only for those making more than $1m.This would be better politics. But as Mr Buffett says, it would also leave rates for 99.7 per cent of taxpayers unchanged. The increase in revenues would be far smaller. He and other business leaders are right to take Congress to task for not stabilising the public finances, but depending on the rates Mr Buffett has in mind, his tax proposal might be close to irrelevant as a deficit-reduction measure.Mr Buffett specifies neither rates nor what kinds of income to apply them to. “People invest to make money and potential taxes have never scared them off,” he says – a self-contradictory observation that suggests no ceiling. For guidance, there is the principle of “shared sacrifice”. But this is vague too. What would it require in his case?Mr Buffett’s taxable income of $40m is impressively small for a man with a reported $50bn fortune. He pays next to no tax because he accumulates wealth as unrealised capital gains, which escape tax altogether. In his case, shared sacrifice probably requires a wealth tax. Set at a modest 2 per cent, he would owe about $1bn a year, or 25 times his current taxable income.The US should do as Mr Buffett asks, and tax him till he notices. He promises it will not change his investment policies, and he will know how the rest of us feel.
549;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:22:14+0000;E-mail from Howard Schultz, Starbucks chief;;August 12, 2011Earlier this week, I sent a communication to our employees and a few CEO peers about what we at Starbucks intend to do in the face of the recent turmoil in the financial markets and overall macroeconomy.The reaction and ensuing conversations were similar in tone and concern that the uncertainty in the financial markets and the crisis in confidence caused by the debt/deficit debacle has further contributed to the challenges facing the country and that ,sadly, the urgency of the situation seems to be lost on the political leadership in Washington and a “business as usual” attitude.In my conversations, a few specific areas were emphasized. First, we have an immediate crisis in relation to job and job creation where businesses need to do all they can to accelerate job creation and growth within the contour of their specific financial and shareholder obligations. In addition, given the financial condition of the states, corporations will be asked to do more to pick up the slack for community and social investments that the states will no longer be able to fund.Secondly, I am asking that all of us forgo political contributions until the Congress and the President return to Washington and deliver a fiscally disciplined long-term debt and deficit plan to the American people. Finally, there seems to be unanimous agreement that the unemployment situation and corporate and small business acceleration of investment in new jobs requires congressional and presidential focus so that the public and private sector are rebuilding the confidence of the American people, investors and the overall global economy.If you agree with this, I would be delighted to talk with you further and encourage you to voice your perspective publicly. Earlier today I conducted an interview with the New York Times’ Joe Nocera in which I explored these themes.I’ve included the link from this column here and would ask you to please review it and consider joining me as we work to restore and enhance our economy and try to change business as usual in Washington DC.With great respect and concern, I look forward to hearing from you.Howard Schultz
550;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-08-15T18:51:21Z;Buffett and Schultz weigh into deficit debate;;American chief executives are weighing into the debate on the US deficit, with Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor, urging tax increases for the rich and Howard Schultz of Starbucks telling fellow chief executives not to donate to political campaigns until Congress solves the fiscal crisis.Their calls came as President Barack Obama began a three-day bus tour aimed at showing that fixing the economy is his top priority.“We have a political culture that doesn’t seem willing to make the tough choices to move America forward,” Mr Obama told a “town hall” meeting in Cannon Falls, Minnesota on Monday afternoon.“You’ve got to send a message to Washington that it’s time for the games to stop, it’s time to put country first.”The president repeated his calls for the 2 percentage point cut in the payroll tax for average workers to be renewed next year, for free-trade deals to be ratified, and for an infrastructure bank to be established.Following a deal to raise the US borrowing limit and cut its deficit earlier this month, a “supercommittee” of 12 lawmakers has been set the task of finding $1,500bn in savings before November.Mr Buffett, who often gives Mr Obama advice, on Monday said the mega-rich had been “coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress”.He urged the committee to raise tax rates for American households earning more than $1m a year and to immediately end the 2 percentage point tax cut for the richest Americans, instituted by former president George W. Bush.“I would raise rates immediately on taxable income in excess of $1m,” Mr Buffett wrote in The New York Times, saying there were 236,883 such households in 2009. “And for those who make $10m or more – there were 8,274 in 2009 – I would suggest an additional increase in rate.”After a struggle last year to continue the tax cuts only for households earning less than $250,000 a year, Mr Obama allowed the cuts to be extended for all Americans until next year.Separately, Howard Schultz, the chief executive of Starbucks, has sent an e-mail to other business leaders urging them to stop giving politicians money until they solve the deficit problem.“I am asking that all of us forgo political contributions until the Congress and the president return to Washington and deliver a fiscally disciplined long-term debt and deficit plan to the American people,” Mr Schultz is reported to have written in his e-mail.Mr Obama’s bus trip will take him through Minnesota, Iowa and his adopted home state of Illinois, all of which he won during the 2008 election and all of which he needs to hold on to next year.It is also seen as an effort to reclaim some of the media spotlight following the closely watched straw poll of Republican presidential candidates in Iowa at the weekend. Mr Obama will return to his persona as the tie-less guy who charmed voters at diners and on farms four years ago.Cannon Falls, population 4,000, last saw an American president 83 years ago, so the town was abuzz at the president’s impending arrival on Monday.“That’s probably the biggest thing that has happened to this town,” said Tony Ehrlicher, a 65-year-old resident. “Most people don’t know where this place is,” he told Minnesota’s Star Tribune.But in reality Mr Obama has few options for stimulating an economy that is in danger of stalling once again.With the debt ceiling deal setting a cap on discretionary spending from October, the president will lack the funds for new initiatives. His best economic hope is an extension of the payroll tax holiday into 2012, which will at least reduce the fiscal drag on the economy next year, even if it does not stimulate it.In the absence of such measures, economists say that all Mr Obama can try is microeconomic tweaks, such as patent reform or a better system to dispose of foreclosed property owned by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-backed mortgage lenders, to try to spur some economic activity.

I am going fishing;Holdings fall, but I choose to close my eyes, says Dina Iordonava;The dates of big market falls mark the key points in a private investor’s history, but often differ from other significant moments – the financial world may be collapsing, but day-to-day life has to go on. Repercussions are only felt much later.Peter Lynch, for example, opens his book One Up on Wall Street by recounting memories of when news of the October 1987 stock market collapse got through to him, while he was on holiday in Ireland. He describes several intense days in the throes of one extreme or another: blissful enjoyment, or stressful anxiety. Compelled to maintain the appearance of normality, he moved on and off the golf course and was on and off the phone, instructing his US office. While physically at Blarney Castle and the Sceilig Hotel, his mind was at the exchanges in London and New York.I was nowhere near investing back in 1987, and accounts of that Black Monday are just historical tales to me. However, I remember the nadir of the sell-off in 2008. Visiting Chicago at the time, I rememeber a string of beautiful “Indian summer” days. These were weeks of euphoria about the impending US election, particularly around Hyde Park, where the soon-to-be president lived. Obama T-shirts were on sale, people were sipping frothy cappuccinos and chatting optimistically in cafés.By contrast, logging on to my brokers’ website revealed a situation of evolving panic. One of the banking stocks I was holding was dropping like a stone. Faced with such a graphic signal, I took only five minutes to deliberate and, within moments, I had closed all my UK positions, at a substantial loss. For some reason, however, I clung to the American ones – maybe because of all the hope in the air. I was rewarded, since Apple and Starbucks recovered later).Strangely enough, this time around, in 2011, I have got more at stake, but my behaviour is different.When prices started falling in early August, I put stop-loss orders on those stocks that were doing well. It did not take long for the stop-loss levels to be hit and the shares sold, so I have now taken my profits.But I did nothing with the stocks that were already in the red. I saw my main losing stock – Barclays – fall nearly eight per cent in a matter of hours, and my gut feeling was that it would fall further. Even so, I still did not sell. Instead, I spent a rainy afternoon going about chores and later sat with a colleague at a nearby cafeteria to talk work. He was sipping a frothy cappuccino and the world was going about its business as usual.I have now lost all the advances that my portfolio had made in 2011. However, there is something telling me I do not want to sell my losers. Perhaps there will be the chance to sell later at a smaller loss? Everybody warns against such behaviour. Nonetheless, I choose to close my eyes and wait.In fact, I choose to not know what is going on. I am off to a retreat in the north of Scotland, a long-planned break. I will drive through the Cairngorm mountains. Once I arrive at my destination on the Moray coast, I will not look for a WiFi connection. Next week, I will take long walks across the dunes at Findhorn Bay and watch the ospreys. At the end of the week, I will cross on to the Black Isle.What will happen to my investments? I will know by the next time I write this column. I guess we will all still be here. For the time being, however, I am going fishing.Dina Iordanova is an active private investor, writing about her own investments.

552;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-08-11T12:48:22Z;UGG and the flight to the high-end;;Recently I was at the unveiling of the new line of UGG Australia boots – you know, those squishy sheepskin booties that looks like slippers and became hugely trendy after movie stars like Kate Hudson and Sadie Frost started wearing them with shorts to get their Starbucks (that’s Sadie’s sister in her classic UGGs at a launch party below left). Anyway, these UGGs were not those UGGs. These UGGs were all Made in Italy, mostly sporting very high heels or wedges, and priced not an average of $150, but an average of $1095. They also had matching bags (price: $695-$1295).Yes, UGG, one of the defining styles of mass market cool, wants in on luxury. But does luxury want in on UGG?I see two issues, neither of which have necessarily to do with the product itself, which is pretty good: the boots, which come in squishy sheepskin and stacked wood heels, can be rolled up to the thigh, down to the knee, or folded at the calf, so you get three styles in one, and look convincing. But I wonder about timing, and image.After all, while it’s not a surprise the brand (which is owned by US company Deckers) would want a piece of the high-end. If you look at recent quarterly reports, like today’s Polo Ralph Lauren news, luxury has been bucking trends pretty aggressively, and looks like about as much of a safe haven as anything. But launching at the front end of a possible double dip seems questionable: if the last recession taught us anything, it was that consumers tend to take refuge in proven experts when it comes to spending lots of money (for example Hermes and Louis Vuitton for leathergoods, the above-mentioned RL for clothing). They want to know an investment is going to sustain its value over time, and clearly an arriviste brand, such as UGG, is unproven in the high-end context.Then there’s the issue of perception: the consumers’, and the brand’s. The UGG folk have spent years looking at pictures of Ms Hudson, among other celebs, wearing their product and carrying, say, a Balenciaga bag, and they probably think: hey! No fair! She should be carrying our bag! Hence the decision to fight Balenciaga on its own ground – or close to it, and launch a competing product.But what they have missed is the cool appeal of wearing a street-like product with a super-expensive piece of fashion kit: it’s precisely UGG’s practical, comfy, un-luxury identity that makes it the perfect companion on high/low, I-am-not-a-stuff-snob days for a luxury accessory. That’s a very important market niche, and I wouldn’t undervalue it.Given market conditions, I expect we will see more of this flight to the high-end on the part of many brands, and I’d suggest they look at what happens with UGG as a test case. Personally, my breath is baited.
553;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;A non-foodie food executive;;"Andrew Lynch is standing in the corner of a dimly lit pub in Euston station looking dismayed. He had wanted to demonstrate the table-mounted mobile phone chargers his company – which owns the pub – offers its customers. But all the devices have been snapped off at the base. “They seem to have been vandalised,” he says, scanning the restaurant for a working example. No luck.Up to that point, the tour of the station had been going so well. SSP, where Mr Lynch is chief executive, owns many of the mainstay brands of British travel hubs: Upper Crust, Caffè Ritazza and Millie’s Cookies. It runs even more through franchise agreements with the likes of Burger King, Starbucks and higher-end airport staple Caviar House & Prunier. And Mr Lynch clearly enjoys showing off the outlets – when the details he is showing off have not been destroyed.During an interview earlier that day, in a pristine office that he had borrowed for the afternoon from SSP’s UK head, Mr Lynch was open and thoughtful but only truly animated when explaining the results of in-depth company-commissioned research into travellers’ dining habits. Most people, it seems, turn right rather than left outside a door, or “at least they do in a travel environment”, he says.It is when he crosses the Euston Road for the station, however, that he finally relaxes – though even mention of a personal passion, music, brings him back to a business concern: a café that SSP has set up in Geneva’s airport which plays jazz from the Montreux Jazz Festival.Tall and blond, the 54-year-old Mr Lynch was born in Cumbria and lives near Reigate in Surrey, south-west of London. That means he is not one of the morning rail commuters to which SSP caters. “It’s going cross-country, so it’s very difficult to take a train.”He does sample its fare most days, thanks to product development kitchens at SSP’s headquarters in nearby Weybridge. “I always try to eat what we sell. And in the morning, I always have an espresso.” Mr Lynch takes a quiet pleasure in describing his own eating habits for once, rather than being fixated on those of his customers.Many of the staff at head office rose up through the group’s shops or have attended its training courses, which means most know their way round an espresso machine. “Even I can make a half-decent espresso,” he says.Catering, however, is an industry he admits he “knew nothing about” when he was approached about a job in the field more than 20 years ago. A trained accountant, Mr Lynch was working at the time in corporate finance at Prudential, the insurance group, when he got a call from KPMG. John Griffith-Jones, an ex-colleague who is now KPMG’s chairman for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, was helping British Rail spin out its catering business and had one of his team ring Mr Lynch.“He said, ‘It’s a competitive bid, and management want it. But they need someone who’s got outside private company experience rather than nationalised company experience. Are you interested?’ ” recalls Mr Lynch. “And I said: ‘Why would I be interested?’ ”Nonetheless, out of respect, he went and had a look “and I just really liked the people”.It was the early days of privatisation, and British Rail was looking for commercially viable segments it could prise off. “In a sense you were creating [a new company], because everything had to be put in – banking and insurance and those sorts of things. Yet it already had critical mass.”It was also a chance for the young, ambitious accountant to get on to the board of a reasonably sized company, with about £100m in turnover at the time. A consortium of four private equity groups raised £13m to buy the business, and Mr Lynch joined as finance director.Today he calls it the second-best decision he ever made (his best decision was to come 16 years later). The move was an opportunity to go from advising to “getting closer to running something, having the opportunity to make things happen, and accountability, I suppose”.By any standard, but particularly for a man who took so much early persuading, Mr Lynch has stuck with it for a rather long time. Travellers Fare, as the spin-off from British Rail was called, soon expanded from railway stations to airports in the UK, and then internationally. When the company was bought by contract caterer Compass Group in 1992, Mr Lynch joined the board at the FTSE 100 company and he became group finance director in 1997.For a time, Compass was a darling of the City, increasing its market capitalisation from £300m to about £7bn in less than a decade. Mr Lynch “walked on water at that stage”, says Kevin Lapwood, an analyst with Panmure Gordon.But Mr Lynch’s tenure as financial director was not universally lauded. He “had a penchant for capitalising things that other people would normally expense”, says Mr Lapwood. A review of the balance sheet by Mr Lynch’s successor corrected that – and wiped £20m off operating profits.Mr Lynch laughs nervously when asked about that and other profit warnings in the year after he had left the finance role. “Gosh, that’s going back,” he says. “Everybody will have a view with the benefit of hindsight. All businesses will hit tough periods, and how they come through those is the mark of the strength and resilience of the business. And you see how quickly [Compass] recovered and how strong it was very soon thereafter.”In 2004, he had made what he calls “the best decision of my life” with a move from group financial director to chief executive of SSP – which stood for Select Service Partner – the travel-food business within Compass.“I enjoyed being a finance director,” he says. “I wasn’t one of those guys sitting there frustrated in finance. But I had been a FTSE 100 finance director for seven years and it wasn’t obvious you could go to another FTSE 100 company and have a better job. I thought, ‘I love the business and industry, but I need a new challenge.’”●Born: December 27 1956 in Penrith, Cumbria

●Family life: Married with three daughters
●Interests: Travel and music – from pop, to opera, to jazz. He is particularly proud of SSP’s work at Geneva airport, where one restaurant plays jazz recordings from the nearby Montreux Jazz FestivalWithin two years, Compass was looking to focus on contract catering, and needed to pay down more than £2bn in debt through disposals.Mr Lynch led the sale of SSP for £1.8bn, a third more than analysts had expected and a number that still makes him proud. “It was a lot more [than expected]. Which I think was probably my responsibility.”The rail and airport divisions went to the Swedish private equity group EQT Partners, and Macquarie Bank bought Moto, the motorway service stations business. He stayed in the trains-and-planes game, becoming CEO of the independent SSP.While he has moved the group back into motorways in some territories, nearly half the business comes from airports and 43 per cent from rail. That cushions it somewhat from economic shocks, he argues, since rail travel often rises when fewer people travel by air.Mr Lynch is particularly proud of the customer research undertaken by SSP, which has resulted in a map of different diner profiles according to what people want to eat and where they want to eat it. The matrix is so complicated that some of the profiles seem almost contradictory – including experimental food lovers looking for a “safe space” to sit down for a meal and “apathetic experience seekers” grabbing a bite between flights. He wants the company to meet all those needs.And while he admits the methodology is “quasi-science and quasi-art”, the research – overlaid with data collected from airports or stations to which the group is pitching – has proved very useful in starting conversations with potential clients. “You say, ‘This is what we think about your airport’,” he explains. “And I’ve never yet met a client who isn’t interested in that. They might say, ‘That’s rubbish,’ but it doesn’t matter, you’re already into the discussion and you build the picture of what you think might work.”EQT will probably begin looking for an exit towards the end of 2012 or beginning of 2013, depending on market conditions. That means Mr Lynch will have to become comfortable again with the financial press. He does not seem particularly wary of a return to public ownership: because of the company’s size, with revenues of £1.6bn last year, he argues that SSP is a good candidate for flotation. But all options will be considered.And he seems content remaining in the sector he stumbled upon more than 20 years ago. “I’m an adventurous eater,” he says, describing his own travel-dining profile. “But I like safe spaces.”"
554;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-08-05T21:44:15Z;A breakfast with built-in indigestion;A date that was supposed to be memorable unfortunately turned into a disaster;"My girlfriends are very important in my life. I value them and try to let them know that I do as often as possible. And whenever I take them out, be it for breakfast, lunch or dinner, I always want to treat them to somewhere they will remember.Recently, I did exactly that for my Investment Banking Girlfriend. Unfortunately, she will remember our date for all the wrong reasons. We met up for breakfast the other day at a hotel in Mayfair; I hadn’t seen her on my own for ages because, like me, she has a very full-time job with a team to look after and a series of demanding clients. She is also a single-digit dress size and her hair and nails are always perfect. Just being seen with her is very good for the ego.So, all in all, I was looking forward to seeing IBG, whose husband by the way is a Very Serious Investment Banker; an actual Master of the Universe. But when I arrived I first had to battle my way through hordes of tourists even to locate the room where breakfast was being served. I finally found IBG perched behind a plant that occupied most of what little room there was on an already tiny table.When IBG had arrived, having ascertained that I was not already there, she inquired if she could go through and wait. “If you want to,” came the reply. No one thought to seat her until she strongly suggested they might do so. A truly terrible table was then offered, which IBG refused, selecting instead the least worst one she could see. It was then that I turned up and eventually found her obscured behind a pot plant.After IBG had moved the plant to make enough room for her plate of melon – from the very mediocre buffet – we then found we almost had to set off a red flare to attract any attention from the waiting staff. Worse still, we didn’t see anyone we knew.When I had seen the venue in the diary – it was my office that had made the booking – I had briefly wondered why it had been chosen. I assumed that my staff, liaising with IBG, must have identified the latest power breakfast venue that has taken over from The Wolseley, or Cecconi’s, or even The Connaught. After all, I am not always in the swing of things. Mayfair might be IBG’s preferred area, but selecting a venue that neither of us had ever visited was rather risky. IBG’s impeccable manners meant that she had not questioned the arrangement.The only upside we could muster was when IBG pointed out that it would be a very good place to rendezvous were one discussing a deal or interviewing someone for a job, because you could guarantee to be totally anonymous.We spent our time talking about businesses we knew and were interested in, some of which were thriving and some were not, and why that might be. Once we got engrossed in conversation it didn’t really matter where we were, we could have been in Starbucks. In fact, why hadn’t we gone to Starbucks? There were several within spitting distance of the hotel we were in, and many more in and around Mayfair. And at least we would have had some decent coffee.The final straw for me was that, having been embarrassed by the choice of such an inadequate venue in which to show IBG how much I appreciate her friendship, she then picked up the tab for the whole ghastly experience. I was so busy thinking how I could apologise that I didn’t even notice that the bill had arrived. You won’t be surprised to hear that she didn’t leave a tip.When I got back to the office I sent her some flowers, and didn’t leave anything to chance – I sent them from a company in which I happen to know she owns shares. Moral of this story? Next time I see IBG, I shall not be delegating the arrangements. I want her to remember the next date with pleasure, not a shudder.mrsmoneypenny@ft.com"
555;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-08-05T21:24:14Z;Things ain’t what they used to be;Things ain’t what they used to be: time for a lesson in typewriters, phoneboxes and potpourri;"Readers over a certain age may remember a TV sketch in which a man walks into a shop to buy a record player but is mercilessly taunted by the staff because he calls it a gramophone. Although we can see that the staff are vile, we laugh along as they humiliatingly call him “grandad” and lampoon his ignorance of modern parlance.Having spent the past two decades laughing with the shop assistants it has come as something of a rude awakening to discover that I have crossed over into gramophone-ordering grandad. The moment of crossover was a casual mention to my children of my old typewriter languishing somewhere in the loft. That they had never seen a typewriter did not surprise me, but that they had no idea what one actually was came as a shock.Yes; it’s happened. I now occupy the place my parents and grandparents did when discussing things like mangles, slide rules and outside toilets. But I intend to rage against the dying of the light. So for the benefit of the young, here are some explanations of now obsolete (or soon to be) devices and concepts to the next generations.Typewriters: A forerunner of the computer keyboard. The letters went directly on to paper, so that you often had to write the same thing many times before it was free of mistakes. Encouraged precision. No use for gaming since hitting the space bar would not kill aliens. Noisy, dirty, time-consuming, yet missed by all who used them.Libraries: Municipally administered buildings where you could go to steal books. They were also rather convenient for pirating music, as you could borrow an “album” and record it on to a “cassette”. This was especially good if you liked Herb Alpert or Yes, often the only artists in stock.Fixed-line phones: Only 30 years ago all telephones were attached to walls by a cable. Almost all telephone conversations therefore took place in the hall and could be listened to by others in the house. Calls to set up a date were invariably answered by parents, resulting in conversations of the “so who’s this David bloke?” variety. Fixed-line phones were great for dodging relatives’ and work calls. The switch to mobiles meant there has been a massive transference of power from the called to the caller. See also:Phone boxes: Used by people when out of the house in the era before the mobile. The phones themselves rarely worked, but highly valued by men as a public convenience.Television schedules: Hard though it is to believe, there was a time before TV on demand when people had no choice about what they watched. They had to purchase special magazines like the Radio Times to find out what they would be allowed to watch that evening.Potpourri: Hard to explain even to those who used it. Allegedly smelled nice.Photo-processing shops: Before digital cameras photographs were taken on rolls of film, which had to be taken to photo-processing shops or chemists to be developed. This discouraged immodesty since photos would be scrutinised by shop assistants who would smirk when you collected them and pass naked pictures of your wife or girlfriend around their mates. Explains the brief popularity of Polaroids.Shops: Before the internet, if you wanted to buy something you had to go to a “shop” and hope they had it in stock. If they didn’t, you were invited to come back in a fortnight when new stock arrived. Amazingly, people did this for fun.Discretion: An odd custom from the last century, before Facebook, when people didn’t tell everyone when they had made a complete arse of themselves but kept quiet and hoped no one noticed. Our parents once believed that their private feelings were for themselves alone. They did not distribute embarrassing photos of themselves “mullered” at parties. It did not occur to them that others might want to know when they were at Starbucks. Analysts are still debating the impact of this repressed locationalism.This is only a start. Please let me know others I might add, or follow #thingswe’veleftbehind hashtag on Twitter and join the movement.robert.shrimsley@ft.com"
556;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:22:14+0000;Theme park opens new front in copyright wars;;As China moves from a culture of fakes to a culture of innovation, the copycats are also getting more creative – designing better and better knockoffs that pose an increasingly stiff challenge to foreign companies that do business there. From fake iPods to phoney Apple stores, Chinese pirates are moving up the value chain.In the low green hills of eastern China near Changzhou, the boundaries of piracy may be pushing even further with a theme park based on the global online gaming blockbuster, World of Warcraft – a dream come true for gamers, in a country where addiction to the internet is so common that it is treated in hospital.Dominating the Joyland park is a section called Mo Shou Da Lu, a World of Warcraft lookalike whose name incorporates a trademark registered in China by the WoW owners, Blizzard Entertainment, for use in connection with things such as amusement parks.The park has Taobao Street – which has stores whose staff say they are authorised Disney, Ultraman and Hello Kitty retailers. And in the World of Warcraft section – with its distinctive neo-medieval architecture and sombre colour scheme – visitors are greeted by a sweaty young man on stilts wearing a wolf’s head.“That’s Wolfman!” says a passing youth, naming a popular World of Warcraft character.Visitors can take a tour of World of Warcraft landscapes in the Journey of Dangers ride and buy a Rmb1,600 ($250) WoW sword from a storekeeper who claims the merchandise is authorised by Blizzard.Blizzard says it is “looking into the situation” at the park but did not license its intellectual property to the attraction. Huanqiu Dongman Xixi Gu, the company that operates the park, declined to comment.One WoW fan says the park is “80 per cent” similar to the game: but 80 per cent may not be enough to make it a violation. Legal experts say determining when a fake violates the law is never an easy question in any country. In China, it is arguably even harder – and winning such cases is tough because courts often use the law as a tool of local favouritism.Beijing says it wants to crack down on piracy, and has held a nine-month anti-piracy campaign closing down 12,000 factories making counterfeit products. But many foreign companies think it is useless to try to protect their intellectual property in China, says Horace Lam, an IP expert at the law firm Jones Day in Beijing. “A lot of US companies complain about how bad the situation is in China”, he says. “But their IP protection is a joke”.Starbucks, for example, failed to register its Chinese trademark, Xingbake, before a rival, which opened cafés bearing a lookalike Starbucks logo and the same Chinese name. Starbucks eventually won that case, partly because Xingbake has no meaning independent of its connection with the US coffee company – but other businesses with less distinctive trademarks might not be so lucky, legal experts say.The Joyland park is arguably an example of a new kind of Chinese copying: “shanzhai”: fakery, but with value added, such as taking a virtual world, and recreating it in the Chinese countryside. The head of the China National Copyright Administration, Liu Binjie, says “shanzhai shows the cultural creativity of the common people. It fits a market need, and people like it.”Elliot Papageorgiou, of the IP law firm Rouse in Shanghai, says some element of copying has always been part of innovation: “As Sir Isaac Newton said, ‘If I have seen a little further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants’ ”. Making money from the intellectual property of others is permitted in China – so long as that use of the IP is not protected by law.Joyland is where China’s new culture of innovation meets the old culture of copying – in a no man’s land where foreign companies will increasingly have to learn to operate.With additional reporting by Shirley Chen
557;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-07-29T21:11:39Z;US stocks fall;;US equities fell this week, with the S&P 500 registering its worst weekly performance in a year and its biggest losing streak since 2008, as investors weighed the likelihood that lawmakers can iron out a deal to avoid a US default against evidence of weak economic growth.The US economy grew by an annualised rate of just 1.3 per cent in the second quarter, towards the bottom of the range of expectations, data released on Friday showed.There was also a downward revision in first-quarter growth from the previous estimate of 1.9 per cent to 0.4 per cent.“You aren’t seeing a collapse because the market ultimately thinks there is no way Washington won’t come up with a plan, but you are seeing a little more worry as we get closer that August 22 date,” said Scott Marcouiller, senior equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors.Barack Obama, the US president, on Friday warned of the consequences of a credit rating downgrade if opposing lawmakers in Washington fail to agree on a plan to raise the US borrowing limit as the August 2 deadline looms.The president also urged a bipartisan solution.The S&P 500 fell 0.7 per cent to 1,292.28, paring some earlier losses.The index showed a weekly drop of 3.9 per cent and three straight months of losses for the first time since late 2008.The Nasdaq Composite index lost 0.4 per cent on the day and 3.6 per cent on the week to 2,756.38 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8 per cent on Friday and 4.2 per cent this week to 12,143.24.The worst performing sector of the S&P 500 on Friday was energy, which was down 1.2 per cent, followed by materials, which was 1.1 per cent lower.The political theatre in Washington overshadowed the second-quarter earnings season. Some 76 per cent of the earnings released so far have exceeded expectations, 1 per cent matched and 23 per cent were below expectations, according to FactSet, a research group.During the week, energy companies reported soaring profits, boosted by strong oil prices, although the price of crude fell on Friday.Shares of Chevron fell 4.5 per cent to $104.02 this week despite Friday’s report showing net income of $7.7bn for the second quarter, up 43 per cent from the same period the year before, and beating estimates.ExxonMobil, its rival, saw its shares drop 6.4 per cent this week to $79.79. Exxon’s second-quarter earnings, also reported this week, were up 41 per cent from the same period last year to $10.7bn, but missed analysts’ estimates.Sprint Nextel, the third-largest US mobile carrier, hit a new low for the year of $4.16 after a poor earnings report. Its shares ended down 18 per cent this week to $4.23. The company reported a loss for the 15th consecutive quarter as more customers dropped their contracts.Merck, the US drug company, said on Friday that it would slash as many as 13,000 jobs as it looked to cut costs and invest in emerging markets. Merck’s shares slipped 2.3 per cent to $34.13 on Friday and were down 5.4 per cent on the week.Shares of Starbucks, the coffee chain, gained 0.3 per cent to $40.09 on Friday after the company reported late Thursday that earnings per share increased 33 per cent to $0.36 from the same quarter a year ago as same-store sales jumped 8 per cent. But shares still were down 0.6 per cent on the week.In spite of the prevailing uncertainty, Dunkin’ Brands soared in its debut this week on the Nasdaq. Its shares closed Friday at $28.93 after listing at $19 earlier this week.The figures on second quarter US gross domestic product cast a shadow on hopes that the US can achieve recovery in the second half of the year.“That economic growth has been as anaemic as currently reported in spite of unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus speaks volumes about the severity of the post-bubble adjustment process,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.“In the near term, the outlook is greatly dependent on the direction of the labour market and hence the path of wage and salary growth and the ability of consumers to expand spending,” he added.
558;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Clinton Cards to appoint Starbucks chief;;Troubled greetings card retailer Clinton Cards has embarked on the biggest shake up of its board in its 43-year history as the Lewin family, the company’s founders and majority shareholders, accept that external help is needed to turn round the struggling business.On Friday, Don Lewin, the company’s 78 year old chairman and chief executive, announced that he will step back to become life president from next March. Darcy Willson-Rymer, managing director of coffee chain Starbucks’ UK operation, is set to become chief executive in October.Until recently, Mr Lewin’s son, Clinton Lewin, had been viewed as the natural successor having worked at the company for more than 30 years. He will remain in his current role of managing director, focusing on property and supplier relationships.With its revenues under attack from supermarkets, cheaper rivals like Card Factory and online card personalisation sites, a collapse in profitability has led to concerns from landlords that a restructuring is on the cards to reduce the £80m annual rent bill on its 800-store UK portfolio.Last week, the retailer extended the refinancing timetable for a £55m revolving credit facility with lenders Barclays and RBS to the end of September, having previously hoped to complete the deal by the end of its financial year on July 31.Clinton has a greater number of stores in shopping centres than any other retailer. And because it generally signed up early, Clinton typically pays the highest rent per square foot in many shopping centres. The company’s house broker Numis has slashed full year pre-tax profit forecasts from £13.2m to £2.5m after a series of profit warnings this year.Mr Willson-Rymer joined Starbucks in 2007, having previously spent three years at Unilever Ventures and 19 years at Yum! Brands, the US company which owns fast food chains Pizza Hut, KFC and Taco Bell. Retail analysts believe his biggest challenge will be convincing the family-dominated company to wake up to structural changes in its market place.“Clintons has many problems,” said David Stoddart, retail analyst at FinnCap. “It is over-exposed to the high street. It has been attacked by lower-priced rivals and also by mass merchandisers. Its push into more aspirational ranges worked for a while but looks less well-suited in times of austerity.”Having fallen 62 per cent in the past year, shares in Clintons lost 0.25p on Friday to close at 12.25p, a fall of 2 per cent.
559;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”

In that market it competes against Starbucks and McDonald’s.Dunkin’ Brands also owns the Baskin-Robbins ice-cream chain and in total has 16,000 outlets in 57 countries.Three private equity groups that acquired it in a leveraged buy-out in 2006 – Bain Capital, Carlyle Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners – have maintained a controlling stake of about 78 per cent in the company after the IPO.Dunkin’s shares climbed steadily in the morning then slipped back in the afternoon before rallying again toward the end of the trading session.Asked whether Dunkin’ should have sold the shares at a higher price, Neil Moses, chief financial officer, said: “That’s always a challenge. We debated that yesterday. But we felt we wanted to start the trade well in the after-market.”Proceeds from the offering will be used to pay down some of the company’s long-term debt, which it took on in the leveraged buy-out.Mr Moses said the company carried about $1.5bn of debt, equal to five times this year’s forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of about $300m.He said the company aimed to reduce the debt to 4.5 times forecast earnings by the end of this year.Dunkin’ Donuts plans to double its number of US outlets from about 6,800 over the next 20 years. It operates an “asset-lite” model through which most of the capital investment in new stores is made by franchisees.The company provides support in the form of a supply chain, marketing and product innovation.The chain has most of its stores on the American east coast and wants to open more in the western US. It also has fast-growing businesses in China and Russia and plans to open more stores overseas.
561;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-07-24T16:26:39Z;UK’s Tesco to pilot free WiFi in stores;;Tesco is poised to offer customers a free WiFi internet service in its stores, in what is thought to be a first for a British supermarket.The move comes as Britain’s biggest retailer seeks to embrace customers’ changing shopping habits, but also reinvigorate its domestic business, under new chief executive Philip Clarke.Providing WiFi, which enables wireless connectivity to the internet for smartphone and laptop users, means customers will be able to compare prices and read product reviews as they shop.Mike McNamara, Tesco’s chief information officer, said consumers were already using mobile technology to check that the supermarket’s prices were competitive. “You can stand Canute-like and pretend nothing is happening . . . or you can say it’s happening, and I am going to help it happen,” he said.Tesco is currently experimenting with the WiFi service in four stores. Mr McNamara said that if this was successful, it could be rolled out quickly elsewhere. “My guess is it will go to all stores,” he said.Mr McNamara said the service would be free. Much of the investment in infrastructure had already been made, as Tesco uses WiFi in its own operations in stores. However, “if you sit there streaming video forever, we may switch it off,” he added. Tesco could also look to replicate the WiFi service outside the UK.While several US store groups, including the Sam’s Club warehouse chain, are providing WiFi in stores, Tesco is thought to be the first big UK retailer to do so. Sam’s Club is owned by Walmart, the world’s biggest retailer, but serves higher income customers than Walmart-branded superstores, which do not have WiFi.The size of Tesco’s estate – it has 2,700 stores covering almost 37m square ft – will significantly expand the number of free WiFi hotspots in the UK.Many are currently in coffee shops, such as Starbucks and fast food restaurants such as McDonalds. But Paul DeBeasi, analyst at Gartner, said retailers could be the next wave of businesses to offer free internet surfing.Colin Jeffrey, a director at Deloitte, predicted that many customers would expect WiFi as a matter of course within a year: “Its almost taken for granted in coffee shops and hotels now. Retailers are going to have to move quickly to meet the basic expectations of customers.”For Tesco, another incentive to offerWiFi is its Clubcard loyalty scheme, which is poised to become increasingly digital. A US experiment with the scheme this autumn will see customers receive rewards digitally, rather than through physical vouchers. This approach could then move to China, followed by the UK, where customers can already access their Clubcard accounts online.Additional reporting by Barney Jopson
562;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T02:30:15+0000;Struggling consumers boost McDonald’s;;Struggling consumers are still flocking to McDonald’s, the US fast food restaurant chain, which has benefited from the lingering effects of the economic downturn.McDonald’s shares touched a record high on Friday, after the company said its frozen drinks and breakfast offerings helped its second-quarter earnings exceed Wall Street expectations. With an expanded menu offering, it is stealing market share from competitors such as Starbucks and Yum! Brands and luring consumers away from their breakfast tables with oatmeal and smoothies.Jim Skinner, chief executive, said McDonald’s was succeeding by offering more “relevant” food and beverage choices and because of its move to modernise its restaurants. Drinks sales at McCafe, which Mr Skinner introduced in the US in 2009, increased 29 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter.McDonald’s raised prices in March and May this year to keep up with soaring commodity costs. But the company said that although consumer sentiment remains “volatile” and unemployment is high in the US and across Europe, customers have not shied away or changed their eating habits.“We aren’t seeing any dramatic spike in the usage of our dollar menus,” Peter Bensen, chief financial officer, said in a call with analysts. “We’ll continue to be judicious as we move forward.”Mr Bensen said that because grocery prices are rising faster than restaurant menu prices, McDonald’s has more room to raise prices later this year. He expects commodity prices to “top out” in the third quarter and ease during the last three months of the year.McDonald’s plans to import some of its premium hamburgers that have been popular in Europe to the US, as it looks to fend off competition from increasingly popular “better burger” chains in the US. The company would like to begin exporting its strawberry lemonade beverages, which are popular in the US, but said it is assessing global fruit supplies.Meanwhile, McDonald’s is looking to use its scale to capitalise on weak spots in the economy and to edge out competition. Mr Bensen said McDonald’s had purchased more restaurant sites in 2011 than last year and would likely increase its real estate ownership further next year.John Ivankoe, restaurant analyst at JPMorgan, said in a research note that he was “comforted” by McDonald’s performance and that it had strong momentum going into the second half of the year.Net income at McDonald’s rose 19 per cent to $1.41bn, or $1.35 a share, from $1.23bn, or $1.13, in the same period a year ago. The results sent the company’s shares up 2.3 per cent to close at $88.56 on Friday.Total revenues at McDonald’s rose 16 per cent to $6.9bn.The US was the slowest growing region of the world, with total revenues increasing just 4 per cent. The pace of growth picked up in Europe, where total revenues increased 21 per cent, and in Asia and the Middle East, where they jumped 25 per cent.McDonald’s said it expects global comparable store sales to rise 4-5 per cent in July.
563;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-07-22T21:17:37Z;The Fat Years;Prosperity and paranoia clash in Chan Koonchung’s dystopian portrait of China;"Sipping his Lychee Black Dragon Latte, Old Chen, the protagonist of Chan Koonchung’s The Fat Years, is overcome by emotion. He feels so blessed to be in China at a time of unrivalled power and prosperity that he weeps with joy and tears soon dilute his coffee.It is 2013 and China rules the world. Its ascendance happened overnight in 2011 when the dollar lost a third of its value in a day, prompting a financial earthquake. To wit, Old Chen is drinking his Lychee Latte in a café owned by the Chinese company that took over Starbucks. Yes, even Starbucks, global purveyor of oversized milkshakes for adults, is now owned by China.In the midst of this golden age there are inevitably a few discontents. There is Fang Caodi, an old friend of Chen’s, who is convinced that just as the 2011 financial crash occurred, China lost an entire month. The suspense of The Fat Years, a whodunit of sorts, is built around discovering what happened during that month in 2011.This is a not-so-veiled satire of the Chinese government’s tendency to make dates such as the Tiananmen massacre of June 4 1989 virtually disappear from the country’s history. Published in Chinese in Hong Kong and Taiwan in 2009, The Fat Years was banned in China for posing uncomfortable questions about Beijing’s selective memory.The novel is peopled with strange characters. Fang, for instance, becomes convinced that, as an asthma sufferer, he and others like him using inhalers are taking a steroid that not only helps their asthma but immunises them against the optimism epidemic that is so virulent in China.The hunch becomes a conviction when Fang saves the life of a young musician who has just been beaten with clubs by a gang of neo-fascists for the heck of it. The musician also uses an inhaler and he too remembers a month in 2011 when there was a bout of panicked buying at grocery stores in China and even a run on pet food.Old Chen is on a hunt of a more quotidian sort. He is searching for an old flame, Little Xi, whom he meets after years apart but is unable to find again because Xi, a dissident blogger, keeps changing addresses. The cross-country search Chen embarks on to find her while his mind lurches between self-doubt and optimism is touchingly depicted.Xi used to be a judge but quit after the pressure to use the death penalty for minor offences became too intense. Unlike just about everyone else around her, she does not suffer from the optimism bug. It’s hard to blame her. Her son, Wei Guo, is a bright law student who aspires to become a high-ranking member of the Communist party’s propaganda department.Wei is a neo-fascist and it is he and his buddies who wait outside a nightclub to beat the young musician Fang saves. The motive? As far as one can tell, Wei and his friends simply don’t like the look of him. Wei is on the lookout for his mother but only to turn her in to the authorities.Among this odd cast there is also a surprisingly like­able Communist party official who is an insomniac and drives around Beijing in the wee hours of the night.Reading this book in 2011 is disquieting because some aspects of Chan’s dystopian China are already here. The brutal crackdown on activist lawyers and others who question the state, for instance, began months ago as a paranoid response to the democratic revolutions sweeping across north Africa. Then there is the assembling of 80,000 people in Chongqing in late June to sing Communist songs from decades ago; the provincial leader, Bo Xilai, even had that consummate air-brushing mandarin of Chinese history, Henry Kissinger, on the dais as an honoured guest.Huxley’s Brave New World is an obvious inspiration for Chan’s novel but there are other, cheerier possibilities. Millions of Chinese are freer than they have ever been in conducting their lives. Chan is an example. He relocated from Hong Kong – which has different laws because of the autonomy it was promised when it was returned to China in 1997 – to Beijing about a decade ago. The optimism implicit in that move is not reflected in this novel. Perhaps Chan needs another Lychee Latte.Rahul Jacob is the FT’s South China correspondentThe Fat Years, by Chan Koonchung, translated by Michael S. Duke, Doubleday, RRP £12.99, 307 pages"
564;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-07-21T22:56:38Z;Uruguay: wake up and smell the (high end) coffee;;"By Janie Hulse in Buenos AiresWith half its population tracing roots to Italy, it may be surprising to learn that up until recently Uruguay’s coffee scene was limited and somewhat uninspiring. While coffee drinking is common, most Uruguayans have preferred their self-prepared thermoses of mate, a bitter herb sipped with a metal straw out of a small container.But coffee snobs can rejoice. A recent influx of high-end Argentinean coffee chains means Uruguay’s more discerning caffeine junkies can now get their fix. “Uruguay has a long history of coffee drinking, what is new is the proliferation of gourmet coffee through the expansion of the international chains”, explains Carlos Carro, the manager of the Argentinean Havanna chain´s international network.Havanna, a high-end coffee retailer known best for its traditional cookies filled with dulce de leche, is moving into Uruguay next month. Already present in eight other Latin American countries and Spain, it’s surprising that Havanna has waited so long to penetrate its neighbour’s market. “At this point, proximity, cultural affiliation and market growth make it hard for us to stay out”, says Carro.Havanna, operating under a franchise model, will open its first shop in an undisclosed location in Montevideo next month and is looking to expand further in the capital city and in the exclusive beach resort Punta de Este.Havanna is not alone. Other big Argentinean chains like Bonafide and Café Martinéz already have a presence in Uruguay. McDonalds is also successfully expanding its McCafé in the country. There have even been rumours that local investors are trying to gain the rights to open up Starbucks in Montevideo. (The American coffee giant has spread like wild fire in neighbouring Argentina since 2008.) But alas, it appears that Uruguay´s market remains too small to interest the Seattle-based group.But just because it’s small doesn’t mean it’s not beautiful.According to a study conducted by A.T. Kearney, Uruguay is one of the top ten most preferred countries for business expansion, mostly because it is seen as a launching point for bigger, neighbouring markets. It ranked eighth place in the 2010 Global Retail Development Index (FRDI) together with other countries – big and small -like China, Kuwait, India, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Chile, United Arab Emirates, Peru and Russia. Slow growth and volatility in more developed markets are prompting investors to look abroad.While by no means an utopia, Uruguay is one of the safest bets in the Latin American region thanks to years of strong economic growth and a long history of political and social stability. Globalisation has also created more discriminating and sophisticated consumers in Uruguay. Spending money in hand, they are returning to their Italian roots and demanding premium espresso.Related reading:

565;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-07-20T15:17:37Z;Apple Store? Yup, we can fake that too;;"From fake eggs to Louis Vuitton knock-offs, China’s counterfeiting prowess is well known.But the country’s ever resourceful entrepreneurs have taken counterfeiting (and copyright infringement) to a whole new level with – get this – a whole fake Apple store, complete with a Genius Bar, transparent staircase and blue t-shirted staff.That, at least, is what this expat found in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province in southwest China - and then she found two more.RP and I went inside and poked around. They looked like Apple products. It looked like an Apple store. It had the classic Apple store winding staircase and weird upstairs sitting area. The employees were even wearing those blue t-shirts with the chunky Apple name tags around their necks.I know, you guys are laughing: an Apple store in Kunming? No one who doesn’t know me personally has ever heard of Kunming before. Kunming is the end of the Earth. It’s all true – but seriously, China warps your mind into believing that anything is possible, if you stay here long enough.An Apple store in Kunming is not as impausible as it sounds. As the blogger herself noted, a number of major Western brands – including Starbucks, H&M, McDonald’s and KFC – have all set up shops in this city of 7m already, so why not Apple?However, a quick glance at Apple’s website shows that, in China, there are only genuine stores in Beijing and Shanghai.You have already guessed the punchline, of course: this was a total Apple store ripoff. A beautiful ripoff – a brilliant one – the best ripoff store we had ever seen (and we see them every day). But some things were just not right: the stairs were poorly made. The walls hadn’t been painted properly.Apple never writes “Apple Store” on it’s signs – it just puts up the glowing, iconic fruit.While we at beyondbrics are laughing at the hilarity of it all, Apple and Steve Jobs are probably not amused. News of the “clone” Apple store comes just a day after the company highlighted the role China has played in its blockbuster results.Tim Cook, chief operating officer, said China was key to the company’s results, with sales up more than sixfold year-on-year in China and Taiwan, reaching $3.8bn. And as breakingview noted, China is where Apple has the biggest opportunity given the low penetration rate of smart phones among the country’s 910m mobile phone users. Last thing it wants is China’s monied class buying fakes thinking they are real.The revelation of the clone Apple store is also a serious embarassment to the Chinese government, which has been trying to crack down on counterfeits and IP infringments in an attempt to address an issue that has become a big liability in Beijing’s economic relations with the west.And before readers rush to point out that this is just one isolated incident, here’s the kicker. The blogger found not one but two more counterfeit stores within a ten minute walk of the first.China is a big, big country so one can only speculate how many more Apple store clones are out there. Readers can check out photos of the fake Apple stores here – we especially like the Apple Stoer.Related reading:

566;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Starbucks to expand role in Chinese coffee;;Starbucks is expanding its role in China’s expanding coffee growing industry by launching a joint venture in the country’s south that will give it control over the production and processing of coffee.The Seattle-based coffee chain said that it had signed an agreement with Ai Ni Group, a farming company in Yunnan province, to form a joint venture by the end of this year.China is not yet recognised as a country coffee “brand” in the same way as its Asian neighbours Vietnam and Indonesia, but already exports about 45,000 tonnes of a year, according to the Beijing Coffee Industry Association.Only a few commodity products are exported successfully from China, a country better known for its voracious hunger for the rest of the world’s raw materials.The price of arabica beans soared this year to a 34-year peak in March, because of rising demand.These prices have prompted food companies including Starbucks to look for ways to control supply of the prized beans.The joint venture will operate a coffee mill that will enable it to export roasted as well as raw coffee beans, which will be both used by Starbucks and sold to rival coffee makers.“Coffee from China will become one of the coffees you look for,” Starbucks said.At present, most of China’s coffee beans are exported, but that could change, as the population develops its taste for the drink. Most of the Starbucks coffee sold in Asia is roasted in the US.Starbucks declined to comment on how much capital the partners would invest in the joint venture. The company said it was a “win-win” initiative that would both provide profits and coffee supplies to Starbucks, while also helping improve the productivity and incomes of the Chinese farmers involved.Starbucks last November announced it would open a farm in collaboration with a local government in Yunnan, but it has not done so yet.In China, high prices have helped turn Yunnan province, traditionally famous for growing tea, into a nascent coffee growing region. “The geological conditions and climate of Yunnan can yield high-quality coffee beans,” said Ji Ming, head of the Beijing Coffee Industry Association.“High-quality beans are in short supply across the world, which is why Starbucks comes to Yunnan to search for beans,” he added.The company has farmer support centres in Rwanda and Costa Rica.
567;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-07-15T21:20:43Z;Can Tesco freeze out the competition?;If the retailer wants to put one of its lasagnes more conveniently in my path, there’s no downside as far as I’m concerned;"We are getting a new Tesco Express convenience store opposite the train station. This is exciting news, eliminating the extra three-minute walk from the station to the existing Tesco Express at the top of the High Street. There will now be three such stores within walking distance of my house which, you have to admit, is well, convenient.Or is it? Surely Tesco can do better than this. Not one of these stores is within five minutes of my house. It will take at least eight minutes to reach the nearest, and once there I’ll only have to walk back again. You’d imagine a company such as Tesco would think about these things.The move makes sense, of course. The store will catch the station traffic which currently has only a manky independent grocer that’s pretty much only good for old veg, John West salmon and Fry’s Turkish delight. But it also speaks of a paranoia at Tesco not only that a customer might miss the opportunity to visit its stores but that its customers are so staggeringly lazy that the extra three minutes perambulation might prove too much. Tesco is hardly the first business to flood the zone; Starbucks is famous for it, but then if your coffee was as bad as Starbucks you’d want to crowd out Caffé Nero as well.There is only one way this can end: Tesco in your house. They need to be there, under the stairs so you don’t go running off to the Spar across the street when you need something. Even that’s risky; best to have a small branch by the back door too. And another near your computer so you don’t decide to order elsewhere online. Of course, there are downsides; the overnight deliveries can be noisy and you might find yourself thinking you’ve got burglars. But after the second or third time of creeping downstairs with the boy’s cricket bat in your hands, you’ll probably relax into it. These home branches could evolve so you don’t even have to get off your fat arse but could contact them through the technological miracle known as yelling.Let me stress that I am not a Tesco-hating obsessive. By and large, I’m a fan. Far better a clean, well-stocked supermarket with a reliable range of microwaveable meals than a miserable, cramped store with nothing but pilchards and Pot Noodle. If Tesco wants to put one of its Finest brand lasagnes more conveniently in my path, there’s no downside as far as I’m concerned.Indeed perhaps we should be pleased these supermarkets are returning to the high street. Some will voice fears that this is simply a further step towards Tesco towns in which all independent retailers are throttled. But high streets are now so homogenised that frankly what do I care if Tesco engages in a death struggle with Greggs, Superdrug and Clinton Cards? The independent stores which survive will be those that build customer loyalty with better service or better produce; let Tesco crush the others.Perhaps this is the answer to the big question over the future of the high street. Every other store could be a Tesco Express, a Sainsbury’s Local or an M&S Simply Food. That way you would never be more than a few feet from one of them. Once it has achieved saturation it could branch out into specialist areas: Tesco Butchers, Tesco Deli and Tesco Bakers, etc. It wouldn’t have bookshops and music shops and all the other stores whose products have migrated online but it would be like a high street in that you’d have to get wet walking from shop to shop and obviously you wouldn’t be able to park there.Naturally, such uniformity would take away the pleasure of retail therapy. The only independent shops would be boutiques and those selling things no one needs like expensive essential oil burners and novelty toilet seats. Clearly these stores will have to be watched too in case they eat into valuable Tesco time.At some point Tesco may want to move in to Tesco Bric-a-Brac or Tesco Random Gifts. They’d probably be a bit of loss leader but they’d add variety to the high street. And you know what they say, “Every little helps”.robert.shrimsley@ft.com"

At JPMorgan, he will help to lighten the management load on Frank Bisignano, who for the past five months has run the bank’s troubled mortgage business while also maintaining his responsibilities as chief administrative officer.“He’s a tech and finance guy who has a lot of skills we need at a financial services institution,” Mr Bisignano told the Financial Times. “We have a robust real estate agenda, whether it’s finishing the build out of Canary Wharf in London or building branches. And we’re always looking at ways to be more efficient on expenses.”JPMorgan bought the London headquarters of Lehman Brothers, the failed securities firm, in December for $800m. The bank has pledged to open 1,500-2,000 retail branches in the next five years.Mr Bocian, who had served as chief financial officer at NCR, a technology vendor to banks, and at coffee retailer Starbucks before his appointment as HP’s administrative chief, was a familiar figure to JPMorgan’s executives.“If you’re a CFO of a public company, we generally get to know you,” Mr Bisignano said.JPMorgan named Mr Bocian an executive vice-president and added him to its executive committee. He will report jointly to Mr Bisignano and Doug Braunstein, JPMorgan’s finance chief.Jamie Dimon, the bank’s chief executive, had brought in Mr Bisignano in February to help fix a mortgage business under siege from regulators for its foreclosure practices. Mr Bisignano’s duties broadened again last month, when the bank ousted David Lowman as head of the mortgage unit.The largest US mortgage-servicing companies, including JPMorgan, are in talks with federal and state prosecutors to settle inquiries into their foreclosures practices. In April, the bank settled a class-action lawsuit that it wrongfully seized homes from active-duty service members.In hiring Mr Bocian, Mr Bisignano has reduced the number of executives who report directly to him.While acknowledging that Mr Bocian’s appointment came just as he had taken on a greater role in turning around the mortgage business, Mr Bisignano said, “I would’ve hired Pete regardless.”Mr Bocian left HP after his position was eliminated by Mr Apotheker, the computer maker’s new chief executive.
569;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:22:14+0000;Dunkin’ Brands;Making the first meal of the day profitable on a global basis is crucial;"Breakfast is a local phenomenon: a bit of Italian bread, or a bowl of Chinese congee, leaves an American nonplussed. Yet making the first meal of the day profitable on a global basis is crucial to Dunkin’ Brands’ future.Dunkin’s sponsors set the initial public offering price range on Monday at $16-18 per share. At the midpoint, that puts an enterprise value of about $4bn on the company, about 14 times trailing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. That is comparable with the multiples on Canadian doughnut powerhouse Tim Horton’s, and to the global coffee leader Starbucks. Shares in smaller Krispy Kreme, thanks to a very strong recent earnings report, trade at over 20 times. The comparisons do not necessarily mean that the Dunkin’ offering is priced reasonably. The three caffeine and fatty foods merchants have handily outperformed the wider market over the past 12 months; the share prices imply high growth expectations, both on the sales and in profits, for the whole group.At Dunkin’, top-line growth is driven by the company’s international businesses. Domestic franchisee sales at core doughnuts and coffee stores, however, grew just 4 per cent last year. At Baskin-Robbins, Dunkin’s chain of ice-cream shops, the figure shrank. But the international versions expanded 15 per cent and nearly 20 per cent, respectively. International is just a quarter of global store sales now, but won’t be for long.Profitability is a slightly different issue, especially at breakfast. In the US, profit at Dunkin’s Donuts amounts to over 5 per cent of franchisee sales.

Lee Partners acquired the group’s 16,000 locations in 57 countries, which includes the Baskin-Robbins ice-cream chain, in a leveraged buy-out in 2006. The firms are selling no shares in the offering, consistent with other private-equity deleveraging deals.In such deals, the owners hope to pay down the company’s debts in an IPO, then sell shares in secondary offerings.Dunkin’s shares will be listed on the Nasdaq exchange, where Starbucks is also traded.
571;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-06-27T21:25:29Z;Economists expand remit to find relevant workThe Fed turned economists into equity pundits;;Marshall McLuhan is not a name often associated with financial matters. The former self-styled communication theorist (who once played himself in the Woody Allen movie, Annie Hall) argued that even seemingly insignificant changes in technology or structure could have far reaching and unexpected impacts.One recent example of his theories might be the iPod. With respect and congratulations to Apple, the iPod was a simple progression from the formerly ubiquitous Sony Walkman. While one could previously buy music and play it, Apple and the MP3 player enabled you to do so with a simple click and set off a virtual revolution in the entertainment business.Or who would have suggested that a chain of coffee shops (Starbucks) would result in the virtual disappearance – in the States at least – of standard shift transmissions, it being difficult to downshift while drinking a vanilla latte.The financial markets have also evidenced significant dislocations from seemingly minor and sometimes not so minor developments. In the US, quoting stocks in decimals, rather than fractions, led to high frequency and program trading.Regulatory changes such as Sarbanes-Oxley accelerated the decline of the traditional brokerage firm which had traditionally focused on commissions but now emphasised proprietary trading. Hence, the broker/dealer became the dealer/broker.I recall a meeting at Salomon Brothers where the bankers and traders introduced a new financial instrument, mortgage backed bonds which spawned all manner of other instruments and ultimately crisis.Another seemingly innocuous development was the modification of Federal Reserve policy which undermined the economic community, although I wonder if they understood its implication at that time.Until 1994, the primary function of economists was to forecast interest rates. Economists were, in effect, the strategists or soothsayers for the bond market. Salomon’s economist, Henry Kaufman (and his predecessor Sydney Homer) was known and sought out for his views on rates and his annual preview of the upcoming 12 months was one of the few seminal events in the business.Until February 1994, Fed meetings were usually non-events and not until the minutes were released six weeks later were we privy to their discussions. In the intervening period, economists speculated, tracked the market, and provided their views.However, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, not only provided the results immediately after the meeting but with subsequent speeches in Cincinnati or Miami, further detailed the Fed’s (or his) thinking, thereby virtually eliminating the need for economists to do so.Over time, perhaps to continue to provide some service, economists expanded their horizons to discuss the employment outlook, the prospects for housing, orders for durable goods, and – ultimately – the stock market.In my experience, economists are not equipped by training or discipline to provide insight and guidance on stocks. As manifest by any number of cliches, the bond market is about here and now while stocks are always looking ahead.Hence economists, almost by definition, “lead from the rear”. One recent example might be that several brokerage firms have lowered their second-quarter gross domestic product forecasts but only after a lower reading of consumer confidence and lower factory orders, lower ISM readings and after a disappointing jobs number.And their recent concern regarding the banks and the implication for the financial system may indeed be correct but I would note that the recent weakness of the traditional banks is actually the norm.In the nine bull markets back to 1962, 48 per cent of banks’ ultimate gain was made in the first two months of the rally. In the last two bull markets, after the first two months, banks not only underperformed, they were actually down the rest of the rally.I understand the desire and temptation for economists to expand their horizons and I respect that they are financial professionals but of a different discipline. Cardiologists and paediatricians are medical professionals but I would not encourage the latter to engage in open heart surgery.So when I read, as I did recently, that a bearish economist is citing Dow Theory, I am actually encouraged as it suggests that he lacks negative economic arguments.And with regard to Mr McLuhan, his views on change might not be wholly his. After one of Peter Drucker’s lectures, I suggested to the writer and management consultant that his views were very similar to those of Mr McLuhan. He responded to me, with a twinkle in his eye: “Oh Marshall’s been stealing my stuff for years!”Laszlo Birinyi is the founder and president of Birinyi Associates
572;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-06-16T18:27:05Z;UK telcos join mobile wallet game;;Now there is another mobile wallet to add to consumer confusion. The UK’s three largest mobile operators, Vodafone, O2 and Everything Everywhere, on Thursday said they had teamed up to create a single platform for making payments by mobile phone.It comes only a few weeks after Google, Mastercard, Sprint Nextel, Citigroup and a number of US-based retailers announced their own platform for mobile payments.Meanwhile, three of the top four US mobile network operators – Verizon Wireless, AT&T and T-Mobile – are planning their own mobile wallet initiative, with plans to launch with multiple payment networks and banks when it goes live in 2012.Apple is also thought to be working on its own NFC solution.It is unclear whether any of these will be interoperable. But at least the schemes are similar in that they rely on using near field communication (NFC) chips, which allow consumers to pay for items by tapping their phone against a special reader at participating retailers.Aside from NFC, there are plenty of other ways to pay by phone. You can pay for a coffee at Starbucks by scanning a bar code displayed on the mobile phone screen. In the UK, Carphone Warehouse, Best Buy and Monitise have set up the Mobile Money Network, which allows consumers to pay for items through an SMS message or a mobile application.Internet payments systems such as PayPal and Moneybookers are also looking to go mobile. PayPal and Pizza Express on Thursday launched a new iPhone app that would allow diners to pay for their bill using their smartphone.“NFC payments are not as rich for a retailer as a connection with a customer through an app,” said Cameron McLean, General Manager, Merchant Services at PayPal.Mr McLean says that PayPal is bent on giving consumers choices and good experiences. But it is hard to foresee anything other than confusion at the moment over what stores will accept what payment, with what device. A little like the early days of credit cards, when it was by no means a given that a certain card would be accepted.And the industry is going to have to work hard to convince people to adopt any of the above systems. A YouGov survey in the UK on Thursday suggested that about 70 per cent of the population still has no idea what a mobile wallet is.
573;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-06-03T20:48:50Z;The taste test: Fairtrade ground coffees;;"There are three foodstuffs which smell even better than they taste: frying bacon, baking bread and roasting coffee. Consumption of them, while often wonderful, is always tinged with this disappointment. Bread and bacon can wait for another day – we were asked to test Fairtrade ground coffees. To concentrate our minds, we carried out the tasting in Italy, where the humblest corner café serves coffee that’s incomparably superior to anything in Pret A Manger, Starbucks et al. So we packed 11 high-street brands into a plastic bag and ordered the FT Weekend private jet to transport us to Tuscany. After an espresso in Arezzo as an acclimatiser, we got down to work. We were looking for a coffee flavour as close to that tantalising smell of roasting beans as possible. Joining the Discerning Litigator (DL) and the Gluttonous Pig (GP) was a newcomer to the panel, recruited for the breadth of vision and forensic rigour he would bring to the proceedings. May I introduce the Theoretical Astronomer (TA).Fairtrade coffee is bought directly from the growers at a premium price. The system promotes fair labour, democratic growing co-operatives and community development. Its aims are noble, but as yet it amounts to less than 1 per cent of world production. Of course, if Fairtrade products didn’t taste very good, we’d be less inclined to support them (I have terrible memories of some early Fairtrade tea bags that tasted strongly of their paper material but little else). I’m pleased to report we found a number of very acceptable coffees, and two which can be highly recommended.So many factors can influence coffee flavour: the bean, the grind, the country of origin, the roast, the packaging, the method of preparation. Most of our coffees were Arabica beans, medium-roasted. But there were still distinct differences. We tasted products from Peru, Colombia, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Uganda and Indonesia, as well as some blends. Some suppliers, such as Waitrose, Costa and Starbucks, now include a one-way valve in their packaging to allow them to put the grounds in as fresh as possible, immediately after roasting and grinding. The CO2 which the process produces can then escape the packet.One complaint we have is that most brands now include somewhat baroque tasting notes on their packets. That’s our job (they could put this column out of business). But on this occasion we’ve included their verdicts with ours. They seem to have developed a “citrus” obsession. Although coffees do have different acidity, this particular conceit went over our head.Three coffees that scored quite highly were led by Jackson’s Colombia Excelso. They say: “Lively citrus notes.” We say: “A bit bland after good first taste”(DL). Costa’s Mocha Italian Formula One also did well. They say: “Citrus with lime and tangerine zest.” We say: “Unobjectionably isotropic”(TA). And also Tesco’s Finest Fairtrade Costa Rican Roast and Ground Coffee. They say: “Gentle fruity flavour …slightly spiced chocalatey aftertaste.” We say: “A right royal roasting – not for the faint-hearted”(GP).For us, two products were way out in front. This is subjective, of course, but on the day we thought the resulting cup, made in a jug with water just off-the-boil, was the rival of many espressos. Conveniently, we thought one was an ideal breakfast drink and the other good for after dinner. The runner-up, by a whisker, was Asda’s Extra Special 100 per cent Arabica Fairtrade Colombian Medium Roast. They say: “Sweet fruity aroma, rich caramel finish.” We say: “Italian-style high-roast flavour bunga bunga!”(GP); “Smoky, rounded”(DL); “Great breakfast coffee”(TA).And our top coffee was Percol’s Fairtrade Colombia Arabica. They say: “Hint of nuts …attractive citrus notes.” We say: “Almonds, softness with bitterness”(GP); “deep and complex”(DL); “aromatic – an accretion of flavours”(TA). Percol’s packet promises an “adventure in coffee”. We certainly enjoyed the experience. And we took note of the fact that both winners are Colombia Arabica.ftweekendmagazine@ft.com…………………………………………..The Winners1.

Brazil’s president Dilma Rousseff has launched an expansion of the government’s politically popular welfare system, which is credited with lifting millions out of poverty and contributing to her election victory last year, the FT reports. Ms Rousseff said the plan, known as “Brazil Without Misery”, would focus on 16.2m people still living in “extreme poverty” by expanding the government’s “Bolsa Familia” family stipend scheme and other benefits for small farmers, garbage pickers and others. The government planned to spend R$20bn ($13bn) annually over the next four years, a sum that may raise eyebrows at a time when the country is trying to control fiscal spending to help curb rising inflation.Beijing fires back at Google
China denied that the country was the source of recent attacks against users of Google’s email service, the WSJ reports.

577;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;How Google is changing the game on mobile payments;;It’s easy to see why Google and its rivals would have their eyes set on mobile payments, but less easy to see how they can break into this market. With its Google Wallet announcement on Thursday, the search company has just come up with an answer.When it comes to the mobile computing world, commerce is more powerful than advertising: bringing actual customers into stores is the game-changer.In this paradigm, a built-in payment system closes the loop, connecting lead generation with an actual transaction, all on one device.But how to do it? As PayPal (which has sounded very much on the defensive during the recent spate of mobile payment announcements by rival companies) points out, it isn’t enough merely to offer an alternative. To change consumer behaviour, any new payment method has to be demonstrably better.Googles’ answer: tie payments to discounts and retailer loyalty programmes.The idea of receiving a coupon from a favourite merchant on a phone, then going into a store and waving the phone over a terminal to complete a transaction, has clear appeal, says Alistair Newton, an analyst at Gartner in the UK.He still cautions against the hype that usually goes along with announcements like this. After all, most people don’t carry smartphones, and even those that do are likely to use other forms of payment most of the time.But when loyalty programmes and payments converge, Mr Newton says it creates a “sweet spot”: retailers effectively provide a cross-subsidy that incentivises consumers and oils the wheels of the transaction, allowing the banks and card companies to keep their margin. He points to the Starbucks prepayment/loyalty card – now available on mobile phones – as an early example of effective card-less payment.Square, which came up with its own ambitious mobile payment idea this week, is working on exactly the same thought. Also pointing to coffee cards as the model, founder Jack Dorsey called existing credit card-based rewards arrangements “a mess”. They take loyalty programmes away from merchants and build them instead into cards, robbing merchants of the extra gratification that their customers would get from an instant reward tied to making a purchase.There are, of course, many reasons why an idea like Google Wallet might not catch on. Not the least of them is the difficulty of reaching sufficient scale to change the behaviour of both merchants and consumers.Also, as Mr Newton, points out, people might resist the idea of giving Google valuable information about their purchasing habits to add to its growing trove of data. But introducing the right incentives should certainly help.
578;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-05-26T07:46:04Z;Starbucks decries speculators as coffee prices spike;But retailers’ own hedging helps lift futures;"Coming to a coffee shop near you: a heart-stopping increase in prices.Arabica coffee futures have more than doubled over the past year, and now retailers are hiking prices. Starbucks became the latest on Wednesday, announcing a 17 per cent increase in the price of its packaged coffee, while JM Smucker, owner of Folger and Dunkin’ Donuts coffee brands, has raised prices 38 per cent since last May.But the cause of the spike in coffee prices is the subject of a heated war of words. In the blue corner are the “evil speculators”. In the red corner: Starbucks.Howard Schultz, Starbucks chief executive, has landed a few early blows, lashing out at “hedge funds, index funds and other ways to manipulate the market”.“In our view, [the increase in prices] is the result of extreme speculation and not a result of normal market forces. We do not believe this is sustainable,” he said late last year.It’s undeniable that investors/speculators have been active in the coffee futures markets in the past year. But it’s not at all clear how responsible they are for the move in prices, which has seen high-quality arabica coffee rise 125 per cent to a 33-year high of more than $3 a pound.According to positioning data from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, speculators piled into the New York-based arabica futures market in June 2010, moving from a more or less neutral position to a net long position – a bet on higher prices – of 42,902 contracts in mid-August. At the same time, prices rose 35 per cent to $1.80 a pound, having spent most of the previous five years in a range of $1-$1.50.Since then, however, speculative bets on higher coffee prices have actually fallen. The net long position most recently stood at 20,538 contracts – half of August’s peak level. And the price has risen a further 47 per cent over that period.If speculators haven’t been the main driving force behind the coffee rally after its initial jump in June-August, what has?Ironically enough, one culprit may be Starbucks itself. With the prospect of higher coffee prices on the horizon, the company has sought to hedge as much of its price exposure as possible.“As the coffee prices began to escalate as we moved through December, we took the decision to remove that risk from this year, we think the responsible decision, and lock our pricing,” Troy Alstead, CFO, said in late January discussing the company’s quarterly results.Sensible though it may be, the move to lock in prices for longer effectively involves buying coffee futures, and so puts upward pressure on prices.Traders say a rush from coffee roasters such as Starbucks to hedge is one factor that has put wind in the sails of the coffee rally. Before last June, roasters typically hedged 2-3 months ahead of its needs, according to traders. In January, Starbucks said it was fully hedged through to the end of September – ie eight months ahead. In April, the company said it was covered until almost the end of the calendar year.Of course, there is also the small matter of the influence of supply and demand fundamentals on prices. Global stocks of coffee are at their lowest in five decades; the crop in Brazil, the largest producer, looks likely to come in lower than initial expectations; and demand is growing strongly, especially in emerging markets."
579;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-05-25T18:49:50Z;High coffee costs hit Starbucks prices;;Starbucks, the US coffee chain, said on Wednesday that it would raise prices of its packaged coffee by 17 per cent this summer in an effort to “sustain the business” in the face of soaring costs.The price rise follows a similar move by JM Smucker, which makes Folgers and Dunkin’ Donuts coffee. It said on Tuesday that it would raise prices by an average of 11 per cent because of sustained increases in green coffee costs. That was the fourth price rise since May last year, totalling a 38 per cent increase.In March, Kraft Foods raised prices for its Maxwell House and Yuban ground coffee brands by 22 per cent, marking its fourth increase in the past year.The price of Arabica coffee, the higher-quality variety, has soared 125 per cent on the futures market since last June to a 33-year high of more than $3 a pound at the start of this month. On Wednesday, benchmark Arabica futures were trading at about $2.70 a pound.The surge in prices has been spurred by a series of dismal crops from Colombia, the largest producer of high-quality beans, as well as lower-than-expected production from other exporters that have depleted global inventories to their lowest level in 50 years.Starbucks said that its increases would take effect on July 12 in US retail locations. It is the first increase since September 2009.“We have held on as long as we could and absorbed as much of the increased commodity costs as we could,” Alan Hilowitz, a Starbucks spokesman said.Prices for beverages sold at Starbucks’ stores will not be raised yet, he said.Starbucks will raise prices by 6 per cent at its Canadian retailers. Earlier this year, the company raised prices of the coffee it sells through grocery outlets by 12 per cent.US consumers have been willing to accept higher coffee prices so far but analysts have noted that, with petrol prices continuing to rise, even coffee drinkers might begin to curtail their consumption habits.Wednesday’s announcement marks a shift from Starbucks’ most recent statements regarding prices. In a conference call with analysts last month, Troy Alstead, Starbucks’ chief financial officer, said that the company would increase prices in “small, appropriate doses”.“I absolutely will not use pricing as the only way to offset those commodity pressures,” Mr Alstead said.On the same call, Howard Schultz, the company’s chief executive said: “Our ability to use other methods within the business provides us with a competitive advantage in terms of making sure that our customers are seeing the fact that Starbucks is providing value for them at a time when perhaps others are going to have to raise prices in a significant way”.Additional reporting by Jack Farchy in London
580;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-05-25T05:18:48Z;Vietnamese coffee and Philippine hamburgers look a neat fit;;"Although Vietnam has opened up rapidly to foreign capital and foreign tastes over the last two decades, the formal fast food market remains underdeveloped with big names such as McDonald’s, Burger King and Starbucks yet to set up shop.That has left the field open to pioneer investors like Jollibee, the largest fast food group in the Philippines, which is expanding in Vietnam through a joint venture with the owner of Highlands Coffee, Vietnam’s leading upmarket coffee shop chain.Infrastructure bottlenecks, high retail rents, restrictions on the foreign ownership of franchised restaurants and a lack of domestic investors with deep pockets have made Vietnam a tough market for international fast food groups, which rely on scale for profitability.But, eyeing Vietnam’s youthful population and rapidly growing middle class, some early movers such as Jollibee, Yum Brand’s Pizza Hut and KFC, and South Korea’s Lotteria have entered the market.Jollibee, which currently has 22 outlets in Vietnam, announced on Friday plans to invest $25m in a joint venture with Viet Thai International, which has 60 Highlands Coffee cafes in Vietnam and operates the Hard Rock Café outlets in Vietnam and Hong Kong.Jollibee will also lend Viet Thai $35m at a rate of 5 per cent per annum, at a time when commercial borrowing rates are well over 20 per cent a year, and in exchange will receive a 49 per cent stake in a joint venture company in Vietnam and a 60 per cent stake in a joint venture company in Hong Kong.The Filipino company said in a stock exchange filing that some of this investment will be used to fund the acquisition by the joint venture of another restaurant chain, which would leave the new company with a total of 118 outlets in Vietnam and 21 in other countries.Neither company responded to requests for further information about the rationale behind the deal and the intended acquisition target.Like many such deals between two emerging market companies, both are likely to bring something to the party. Viet Thai, which has international ambitions, can learn from Jollibee’s success in the fast food market in the Philippines and overseas, where among other investments, it operates 210 Yonghe King noodle stores in China.Jollibee, which terminated a franchise agreement to run Delifrance cafes at the end of last year and is introducing a Korean-style coffee shop chain called Caffe Ti-Amo, can take some advice from Viet Thai founder David Thai about how to build a strong café brand that attracts upwardly mobile young urbanites.A number of other fast food franchises such as Subway, Carl’s Jr and Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf have recently made their first forays into Vietnam and Fred Burke, a lawyer at Baker & McKenzie in Ho Chi Minh City, says he expects more to follow.But he warned that large foreign franchise owners may be put off if Vietnam’s trade and industry ministry pursues a plan to introduce complex implementing guidelines for Vietnam’s otherwise straightforward franchising law.Foreign retailers often complain that they have been hamstrung in Vietnam by the requirement to pass an “economic needs test” for each new outlet they want to open. Burke says that the implementation of similar restrictions in the franchised fast food industry would be a “complete show-stopper” for some of the big international fast food groups currently casting an eye over Vietnam.In the meantime, Vietnam will remain free of McDonald’s, making life difficult for homesick American expats and Vietnam’s embattled central bankers, who are unable to use The Economist’s redoubtable Big Mac Index to work out the most appropriate exchange rate, at a time of great economic instability.Additional reporting by Roel Landingin in Manila.Related Reading

581;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;The long and the short of coffee;The experience and philosophy offered by coffee bars in the UK and in the US is a pale shadow of the Italian one;"On a recent trip to Italy I heard a man order an espresso “un po’ lungo” (a little bit long). I was expecting he would receive the Italian version of a caffè Americano; a strongish coffee but served in a decent-sized cup and long enough to provide a few minutes of meditative sipping. Not a bit of it: when the coffee arrived, it was to my eyes indistinguishable from a normal espresso or even what in London coffee houses is called a ristretto (not a term I have ever heard anyone use in Italy). In other words, it consisted of about a teaspoon and a half of incredibly strong black coffee, concentrated to the point of viscousness, topped with that tawny foam that is the good espresso’s equivalent of the creamy head on a pint of Guinness.Perhaps it took him 45, rather than 30 seconds, to knock it back. That, for him, was un po’ lungo.Back in London, I attended the opening of the Southbank Centre’s 60th anniversary celebrations of the Festival of Britain (on which more later). Trying to wake myself up, I had one cup of so-called coffee and then another. Each contained at least five times the liquid volume of the espresso un po’ lungo but nothing of that beverage’s intensity, flavour or drama. Eventually, arriving back home, I had to make myself a proper cup. By this time I had had far too much coffee, yet not enough.All this prompted wider-ranging reflections on length and shortness, not just as they affect coffee. Although many chains of coffee bars in the UK and in the US claim to be Italian either in origin or inspiration – Caffè Nero promises “the best espresso this side of Milan” – in fact, the coffee experience and philosophy they offer is a pale shadow of the Italian one. The fact is that English and American people, on the whole, cannot and do not want to drink coffee in the way Italians do. For Italians, coffee is something very short, very intense and done standing up – a sort of gastronomic knee-trembler. Even an Italian cappuccino is not much longer than an espresso – it is beautiful, served in a small cup, and designed to be dispatched swiftly. Hardly anyone sits down at a table to drink one; not least because they know they will be charged three times as much.The success of Starbucks is based on an entirely opposing philosophy. Everything is predicated on size. Even the smallest Starbucks coffee is called “Tall”, and if it consisted of coffee as Italians understand it, it would be enough to send three human beings into orbit. Thank goodness it consists mostly of water, or some watery perversion of milk.Many Starbucks customers like to sit on their own, often with a computer, less frequently, alas, with a book or notebook, slowly sipping their hot coffee-based beverage while dealing with e-mails. Italians, on the other hand, intensely social creatures, nearly always drink their coffees in company, conversing with someone, a friend, colleague or the barista (who is never called a barista).Length as opposed to intensity, volume rather than flavour: here we have not just two ways of making coffee but two philosophies of life. Is it better to draw something out as long as possible, or, as the poet Andrew Marvell put it in another, erotic, context, to “roll all [its] strength and all [its] sweetness up into one ball” so that we can “tear our pleasures …thorough the iron gates of life”?While these reflections on the length of a cup of coffee were unfolding, I was reading and listening to the news from government statisticians that one in four of today’s under-16s “can expect to live to be 100 years old”. Apart from the fact that extreme longevity sounds like something to appeal more to the Starbucks habitué than the espresso drinker, I wondered about both the claim and the use of “expect” and “expectancy”, which have become normal parlance in discussions of lifespan.The fact that, statistically, the mean of lifespan is 80 or 82 or 102 does not mean that any individual can expect to live that long, in the way that a Starbucks customer can expect to receive a cup with 12 or 20 fluid ounces of coffee. For a single individual, for all sorts of obvious reasons, there is absolutely no way of knowing how long he or she will live.Presumably, “life expectancy” depends to some extent on how one chooses to live one’s life. Someone as brave as Tim Hetherington, the photojournalist and documentary-maker killed recently in Misrata in Libya, was less likely to comb grey hair than an employee of the Inland Revenue living in suburbia. But then, as the great cartoon by HM Bateman shows, and as Italian coffee drinkers instinctively know, the roof can fall on the head of the most cautious and risk-averse of human mice.harry.eyres@ft.comMore columns at www.ft.com/eyres"
582;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-05-20T21:19:45Z;A font of wisdom on economies of scale;In spite of its ubiquity, spare Swiss typeface Helvetica is vulnerable to competition;"A confession: I have become something of a fontophile over the past couple of months. And I don’t think it’s just me. This year’s April Fool’s Day witnessed some splendid typographical jokes. Typing “Helvetica” into Google provoked an alarming change: every letter in the search was suddenly transformed, not into the spare and elegant Swiss typeface, but into Comic Sans. (Comic Sans is a determinedly informal font loathed by almost everyone with a knowledge of typography, and unwittingly adopted by most of the rest of the human race.)Helvetica itself was the subject of an eponymous and entertaining documentary in 2007. The message of Helvetica echoes contemporary concerns about globalisation. A single typeface, designed in 1957 in Münchenstein near Basel in Switzerland, graces the American Airlines logo, Coca-Cola adverts, the New York subway, labels in American Apparel stores, Crate and Barrel, Kawasaki, Gap, Panasonic, BMW, Jeep and even Oral B. One designer, infuriated by its ubiquity, declares in the documentary that Helvetica is the font of the Vietnam war. She’s only half joking.Modern life tends towards standardisation. The likes of McDonald’s and Starbucks try to replicate the consumer experience, the branding, the size of the drinks cups. In such cases, economists often look for signs of “economies of scale”, a term used to describe a business operation whose average costs decline as the size of the business expands. Annoyingly, economies of scale are analytically inconvenient – if you want to build a textbook model of an industry with scale economies, the mathematics are messy – and yet Adam Smith’s famous example of the pin factory simply illustrated how fundamental economies of scale are to economic progress.Fonts and typefaces enjoy economies of scale: once designed, they can be used again and again at low cost. Indeed this is more true than in the days when a font was hundreds of pounds of carefully sculpted metal. (Simon Garfield’s likeable book, Just My Type, includes the tale of Doves, the font that drowned. Thomas Cobden-Sanderson, the designer of Doves, did not wish his glorious font to be used by a rival after his death. Over the course of three years the septuagenarian Cobden-Sanderson destroyed the casts for the type, and then every metal letter, by consigning parcels of them into the Thames. Helvetica is immune from this fate. So, alas, is Comic Sans.)Economies of scale underpin real-world monopolies. Could Helvetica achieve this status? Hardly. Just like most dominant companies, Helvetica is vulnerable to competition. Arial, an upstart font with the same proportions as Helvetica, was packaged with Microsoft Windows from 1992 and guaranteed instant prominence. The world’s most popular font these days is probably Calibri; it was pushed centre stage by Microsoft as recently as 2007, the year Helvetica was produced.Contrary to popular belief, Helvetica never even wiped its rivals off the face of the New York subway. An obsessive coffee-table book by Paul Shaw documents that the Helvetica-style font that defined subway signage is in fact Standard Medium. Helvetica didn’t become the official typeface on subway signs until 1989. Standard Medium persists in corners of the subway and most people don’t notice the difference.Economies of scale in fonts, as often in the corporate world, do not seem to stand in the way of diversity for long. There have never been so many alternatives to Helvetica, and new fonts are created at an unprecedented rate. There is always demand for the next forward-looking font. Barack Obama used a 21st century font, Gotham, for his 2008 election campaign. Evidently some people think it helped his fortunes: Gotham has now been adopted by Sarah Palin."
583;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
584;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-05-18T22:20:02Z;Vision of dystopian future for workers;;"The Shift
The Future of Work is Already Here
By Lynda Gratton
HarperCollins, £18.99The great danger in writing about the future is that you exaggerate the pace of change. Off you go boldly predicting a Jetsons future in which Spacely Space Sprockets and Cogswell’s Cosmic Cogs compete to make personalised jet packs and hologram communicators, and 40 years later, all we have is WiFi, Starbucks and the Chevy Volt. But then, no futurist could make a living saying things will amble along much as they have, constrained by the bottleneck of human habit. Far scarier to say everything is changing at white-knuckle speed.Lynda Gratton does just this in The Shift. Not only does she describe the future of work, but renders our understanding of it all the more urgent, by declaring it “already here”. A pedant would argue that a future already here becomes the present. But that would be exactly the sort of 20th century pettifogging that will get you left behind.Gratton, a professor of management practice at London Business School, describes five forces that will shape the future of work: technology; globalisation; demography and longevity; society; and energy resources. No great surprises here.Technology shrinks the world but consumes all of our time; globalisation means we can work anywhere, but must compete with people from everywhere; there are more of us, and we’re living longer; traditional communities are being yanked apart as people cluster in cities; and there is rising energy demand and fewer traditional resources. What’s the worker to do?Gratton terrifies us then uplifts us with two visions of how the future of work might look, presenting a compendium of modern management and social science theories along the way. The novelty of Gratton’s book is her synthesis of so many contemporary ideas about the changes to our working lives.The first vision she calls the “default future” which will occur if we carry on as we are. Technology will enslave us. Just because we can communicate at all hours to people all over the world, we will be expected to. Our personal lives will be hollowed out. We will flit between endless small tasks rather than applying ourselves to larger, more meaningful projects. More of us will be working from home, losing the camaraderie of the office. We will have the world on a screen, but no one to share it with. For those without a good education, there will be no advantage to being born in a wealthy country. The poor in the US and Europe will get poorer as they are forced to compete with the poor of Asia and Africa.Gratton then pulls out of this nosedive of misery to present what she calls “the bright side of the crafted future”. In this future, we use technology and globalisation to develop new networks of collaborators; we co-operate and pursue balance in our lives; and we create micro-enterprises that can survive by tapping into global markets. She creates fictional characters to illustrate her points. For example, as micro-entrepreneurs, she has a Chinese mother and daughter, Xui Li and Bao Yu. Xui is a dressmaker who distributes hand-embroidered dresses through Li & Fung, a global supply chain manager, and also trades in freshwater pearls on Alibaba, the Chinese online trading platform. Bao also earns her living through Alibaba, selling handmade straw handbags to Americans. They are both self-employed, see plenty of each other and pursue work they enjoy. They also expect to live longer than previous generations.Gratton urges her readers to open the “aperture of choice that creates the space which will enable you to write a personal career script that can bring you fulfilment and meaning.” This requires the “shift” of her title and consists of three steps. The first is from “shallow generalist to serial master”. There is no longer any value in being a jack of all trades. The new world of work demands highly specialised masters. You need to become one, but then also be capable of “sliding and morphing” as the market’s demands change.The second shift is from “isolated competitor to innovative connector”. Stop reading Facebook wall posts and really use that social network.The third shift is from “voracious consumer to impassioned producer”. Quit goggling at the television and shopping at the weekends, and create instead.Gratton predicts a big role for social entrepreneurs. This seems to give too little credit to large companies and what must be called just “entrepreneurs”, those who build businesses, create jobs and distribute profits without the need to pursue any larger social mission. It would be a grim future if work were dominated by the noisiest, self-proclaimed do-gooders, while the social utility of plain old capitalism went ignored.Gratton writes that “the challenge is to lead a more purposeful working life, where we can create a stronger sense of who we are and what we care about, and the choices we face and their possible consequences”. She is right, of course, but this has always been the challenge. The ambitions of the future sound a lot like those of the past and will be just as difficult to fulfil."
585;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Compass points to turnround strategy success;;Compass offered fresh evidence that the world’s biggest catering group by sales has put a problem-ridden past behind it, brushing aside the impact of food price inflation to deliver a 15 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits.Now five years into his turnround plan, Richard Cousins, chief executive, said the company – which serves about 4bn meals each year in 50 countries – still had an “obsession with efficiencies”.“We will never get bored of driving the margins forward,” said Mr Cousins, who added he had “a lot more to do” in his cost-cutting push. “It’s a tough world. Clients want value for money.”Operating margins at Compass, which employs about 420,000 people, rose a further 20 basis points to hit 7.2 per cent. They were already comfortably ahead of those at Sodexo, its French rival.Although the results came in ahead of brokers’ expectations with a rise in pre-tax profit from £459m ($741m) to £528m, shares in Compass – which had risen 160 per cent since the start of 2006 – slipped 4p to 575p.The group, which took a £5m impact on profit from the earthquake and tsunami in Japan during the first half of the year, estimated the disaster would cut profit by a further £20m in the subsequent six months.Overall, diluted earnings per share rose from 17.8p to 20.2p in the six months to end-March, prompting the group to declare an interim dividend of 6.5p, up 30 per cent. Net debt fell from £766m a year ago to £671m.“There is an understandable perception that our balance sheet is in danger of getting a little bit lazy,” Mr Cousins added. “We are keeping that under constant review.” The group spent £126m on acquisitions during the first half.Total revenue at Compass, which won contracts with Starbucks in North America, Mercedes-Benz in Turkey and Edinburgh Zoo during the period, rose from £7.1bn to £7.87bn. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, sales rose 5.7 per cent.On this basis, turnover in the UK and Ireland dipped 0.4 per cent and the improvement in the rest of Europe was also limited. North America fared better, with a 7.8 per cent rise.The sales rise was strongest at the group’s other international markets, such as Brazil and Australia.
586;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-05-17T22:20:10Z;The right café can perk up a start-up;Many an entreprising plan is hatched in a coffee shop;"Coffee shops have been hives of business invention for more than three centuries. In the digital age they have re-established their role as meeting places where entrepreneurs mingle and start new ventures.In 1668, Edward Lloyd’s Coffee House in Lombard Street became the gathering point for ship owners and marine insurance brokers. The world’s first and greatest insurance exchange was formed there, and its establishment paved the way for London’s pre-eminence as a world leading financial centre.Thirty years later, Jonathan’s Coffee House in Change Alley became the precursor to the London Stock Exchange, when John Castaing set up shop there and began to issue a list of stock and commodity prices. It was felt that while taverns were rowdy, drunken dens, coffee “will prevent drowsiness and make one fit for business”.Even social enterprises were created in these hubs of caffeine and intellectual activity. In 1754, at Rawthmell’s Coffee House in Covent Garden, William Shipley founded the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce – which became the RSA.Fast-forward to the 21st century, and the modern-day equivalent might be Buck’s Restaurant in Silicon Valley. Financiers and technology entrepreneurs rendezvous there for breakfast, and to do deals. It lies close to Sand Hill Road, the largest concentration of venture capitalists in the world. The owner, Jamis MacNiven, explains: “Hotmail was founded here. Netscape had their early meetings in the back room; Tesla was founded here and PayPal got funded here.” Apparently an early stage investment in Yahoo was turned down on the premises.Of course coffee shops are not the only spots outside offices where enterprising plans are hatched. I can recall meeting in the lounge at Brown’s Hotel off Piccadilly in 1991 to hear about a restaurant opportunity. That encounter led to the purchase of PizzaExpress and transformed my career. And a secret little library in the Charlotte Street Hotel was used for abortive merger discussions when I was at Channel 4. It wasn’t really a very inspired choice from the perspective of confidentiality since the place is well-known as a media hangout.Most of us have a few favoured salons where we conduct business – away from HQ. Especially if you are plotting a start-up, then your sitting room or your employer’s office both seem wrong. What is wanted is somewhere discreet, comfortable and accessible. Better an independent, convivial location, where one can obtain refreshment, and sense that you are surrounded by others being productive.There are of course quite a number of clubs in cities such as London and New York, from White’s to The Knickerbocker to The Groucho to Soho House. But these elite have disadvantages: you need to be a member to gain access, they often have tedious dress codes, many forbid women, and frequently they bar members from discussing business or producing work papers.Meanwhile some adventurous individuals attempt to do business in places such as nightclubs or lap dancing clubs. This strikes me as a very dangerous idea, especially under the new Bribery Act. I fail to see how sound decisions can be made under the influence of darkness, loud music, cocktails and naked flesh. Such escapades are also likely to be very expensive – and only feasible late at night anyway.The present day versions of Jonathan’s or Rawthmell’s in Britain are high street chains such as Starbucks, Caffè Nero and Costa. Free WiFi is available in most, so freelancers can sit and communicate with the world online, scheming away. Look around and you will see plenty of would-be tycoons e-mailing furiously, or perhaps presenting a business plan to a potential backer.Virtually every company requires premises of some sort, even if they are serviced offices and the staff hot-desk. But I think most of us also need an off-site haven, somewhere to slip away for an espresso and a more freewheeling chat. Different surroundings help to clear one’s head, avoid the immediate issues, and facilitate the exploration of grander visions – and what can be more important than that?E-mail the authorThe writer runs Risk Capital Partners, a private equity firm, and is chairman of the Royal Society of Arts"
587;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-05-16T12:13:58Z;China: profiting from high speed rail;;"How can portfolio investors make money out of China’s high-speed rail project? After all Beijing isn’t looking for partners for the state-run scheme, the largest infrastructure project in history.Morgan Stanley has come up with a plan – invest in listed companies which stand to profit from the inter-linking of China’s big cities in everything from rolling stock manufacturers to Starbucks.Morgan Stanley’s report doesn’t say a lot about recent controversies about the project’s management or costs. But perhaps it doesn’t need to – it wouldn’t be the first time a big infrastructure scheme lost money for its owners but generated profits for other people.The engineering achievements are already colossal, with the network expanding from 407km in 2003 to 8,358km by January 2011 and on target to reach 13,000km by the year-end, spending Rmb700bn ($106bn) this year alone. Morgan Stanley forecasts in its base scenario that the system will reach 16,000km by 2015 and link at least 200 cities, with 50 per cent of the population and 67 per cent of GDP.The report concedes that this could drop to 15,000km “as macro tightening and anti-corruption sentiment could dominate the mindset of China’s senior government officials.”This bearish forecast reflects the railway ministry’s recent announcement of a possible cut in future capital spending from Rmb4,000bn to Rmb2,000bn-3,000bn in the 2011-15 five-year plan. The plans are being revised after the railway minister was removed for “disciplinary violations” – amid claims of corruption in the high-speed rail project.Last month, Beijing lowered operating speeds on the network from 350km/hour to 300km/hour in response to safety and cost concerns.Jerry Lou, a Morgan Stanley China strategist and one of the main authors, told beyondbrics that these factors could reduce the size of the network. But the reductions would come in the least cost-effective lines – for example those in China’s sparsely-populated far west. He said:Clearly cuts have come but they won’t have huge economic impact. The lines with a smaller economic impact are being down-sized but the overall economic benefit will not be down-sized.Morgan Stanley’s main interest is identifying the companies that can profit from this economic benefit – and are accessible for international portfolio investors.The sectors with likely opportunities are: budget hotels, restaurants, tourism, consumer staples, retailers, car rental companies, commercial and residential property, railway infrastructure and rolling stock.Sectors which could come under new pressure are aviation, including sales of regional jets, and toll roads.Morgan Stanley proposes two equity investment baskets. The first is composed of Hong Kong listed companies:The second is a basket of global stocks ranging from CSR rolling stock maker to Walt Disney:Many of these companies, will of course, benefit whether or not the high-speed railway per se fulfils the great hopes that have been invested in it. Such is the momentum of China’s urbanisation that the 200 cities that will be linked are likely to grow regardless.

But “I haven’t talked to Bernie about this [the possibility of the change of ownership],” he said.Mr Mittal takes a back seat in running the club – although this did not stop him being serenaded by celebrating fans at the team’s final home game last Saturday.He leaves QPR matters to Amit Bhatia, his son-in-law and the club’s vice-chairman. Mr Mittal was persuaded to take an initial 20 per cent stake in 2007 by Mr Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore, the former team principal of Renault F1. He has always stressed that he has never intended to be a long-term shareholder let alone take over the majority stake.However, it is highly unlikely that Mr Mittal would want to cut his share at such a successful moment in the club’s history. Also, as a keen football fan – who has fond memories of playing the sport as a child in India – Mr Mittal could easily be open to the challenge of being the lead shareholder.Looking ahead to next season, Mr Mittal said the priority was “to stay in the division and make progress”. He said that the club needed “at least two seasons of stability [in the Premiership]” as a prelude to what he hopes will be a long spell in England’s top league.…Stark realityJürgen Stark, ECB executive board member, was in London this week delivering a lecture to City bankers amid swirling speculation that Greece might need to restructure its debt.

589;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:22:14+0000;Love story with a double shot of schmaltz;;"Onward
How Starbucks fought for Its life without losing Its soul
By Howard Schultz
Rodale, $25.99/ Wiley, £14.99Onward picks up where Pour Your Heart Into It left off. The latter is the story of the coffee chain that Howard Schultz built from the early 1980s. Onward is the story of how Starbucks faced the demolition ball until Schultz returned as chief executive in 2008, eight years after he had stepped down.It is a tale of derring-do, traversing the globe and crowded with a cast of exceptional people. But more than anything Onward is a love story: a paean to coffee and good people (be they baristas or farmers), to Starbucks and, perhaps above all, to Schultz himself, the affable, poor-boy-made-good without whom none of it would have happened.Schultz returned as CEO in 2008 because he felt like “a former captain who could sense his ship slowly sinking”. And sinking Starbucks certainly was: sales were sliding and the share price heading south.Much of the story will be familiar to students of business, investors and even coffee drinkers. There is the leaked memo in 2007 in which Schultz pours his heart out over the commoditisation of Starbucks, fretting over the loss of romance, theatre and even the aroma of coffee in stores; the temporary closure of 7,000-odd US stores to retrain baristas a year later; and a subsequent scaling back of the coffee shops.As one would expect in a work subtitled How Starbucks fought for its life without losing its soul, the book is heavily laced with schmaltz and stuffed with tales to tug the heartstrings. There is the barista who donated a kidney to a customer; another who bought a poor fellow worker a cow; and accounts of Schultz’s undereducated father lying ill without healthcare insurance.The vibe can be summed up in a quote given to Schultz: “When you get into a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hang on a minute longer, never give up.”Never giving up is what Schultz does best. His philosophy centres on caring about people – or partners, as Starbucks workers are called – passion, and blue-sky thinking. This, the more cynical reader may feel, sometimes leads him down dubious paths. The New Orleans bonding conference for 10,000 people was held weeks before announcing “shockingly reduced” quarterly earnings in late 2008. Yet it went ahead complete with 33,000 meals a day and extravagantly “conceptualised” galleries (one of which held 1,000 coffee trees).To be fair, there are descriptions of taking practical action too, including the replacement of computers so old they could not access the internet or run word processing software.The supply chain, where operating costs were ballooning to about $100m a year, also comes under scrutiny, as does the bloated bill for wasted food.Even so, it would have been nice to have more meat in the tale of Starbucks’ turnround. We learn that slashing stores and staff was heart-rending. We discover good communications are vital: Schultz is torn to pieces when his carefully worded memo is leaked. And we learn that consultants are worth hauling in.The book is also disappointingly light on overseas expansion. Starbucks has been phenomenally successful internationally – it has nearly 6,000 stores outside the US and generated $1.25bn of net revenues there in the first half.But in the book, this merits very little coverage, and much of what does appear will be underwhelming to the average business reader. Some is even cringeworthy, as when Schultz is delighted by the offerings at one Starbucks in China, which include something called Iced Oriental Beauty.His enthusiasm for other offerings on the menu looks a little exaggerated, given what is generally available in cafés in virtually any country in the world: “It was obvious that our partners were truly thinking outside of the box. Sesame noodle salad. Spicy Thai beef wrap. Soup. Lasagne! …I was impressed by the creativity I was experiencing.”If the book is any guide, such Pollyanna-isms are second nature to Schultz. He is trusting to a fault (“I conduct my life with an expectation that people will do the right thing”) and seldom has a bad word to say about anyone, even those he is ousting.His own personal failures are also given short shrift. A rare example is the adoption of a new drink, Sorbetto, which was mispriced and made in machines that took one and a half hours to clean at the end of the day. Sales failed to stack up as anticipated and eventually – with Mr Schultz feeling “somewhat responsible” – the drink was abandoned.Instead, the book is testament to his drive and dedication: here is a man who, on holiday with wife and children in Hawaii, goes off on daily three-hour bike rides with Michael Dell, the founder of Dell computer company, and checks sales figures every day – all without eating breakfast.He is a man who never writes down his speeches. Since whole chunks of speeches and presentations form a fair part of the book this suggests he is blessed with a perfect memory. Either that or the book, like his speeches, comes from the heart – which would explain both its strengths and its weaknesses."
590;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-05-08T23:11:06Z;A chief executive’s game plan in trying times;;Most Harvard case studies start with ‘It was a dark and stormy night,’” says Christine Day. “Mine could have started with ‘It was a perfect storm.’” By January 2008, when she joined Lululemon Athletica as executive vice-president of its retail operations, she had spent 20 years helping Howard Schultz turn a tiny chain of coffee shops called Il Giornale into the global retail phenomenon of Starbucks, which by then had more than 12,000 outlets.Lululemon, a “yoga-inspired” clothing retailer with a cult-like following, a habit of recruiting yoga instructors as brand ambassadors and a reputation for remarkably high sales per square foot, had similarly entrepreneurial roots, founded by Chip Wilson in 1998 with one store on the same premises as a yoga studio in Vancouver, Canada.Nine years on, the company had opened more than 100 outlets in the US and Canada in little more than a decade and gone public, but, Day recalls, “there was quite a schism between the founders and the people they had brought in to run the company. Both camps were ready to quit. There wasn’t a lot of trust.”By June 2008, Robert Meers had retired as chief executive of Lululemon, and Day was appointed to run the company just as the recession started to bite. One of her first moves was to send two of the founders on the Harvard Business School advanced management programme she herself had attended in 2002, and a third to Stanford, to try to “solidify the board” around a single approach and strategy.“What I saw in the founders was that they didn’t trust a public company because they didn’t understand it,” she says. “By creating the experience for them at Harvard, it created an opening for me to coach and develop the founders … By pushing them aside, we would lose something in the company.”Michael Tushman, professor of business administration at Harvard and faculty chair of the advanced management programme, has in turn published a Lululemon case study, focusing on how to work with founders. Day, who participated in an earlier Harvard examination of Starbucks, has returned to the school several times to speak, and is a firm believer in the benefits of the programme and the influence it has had on her management style.“What I learned at Harvard Business School made me make a lot fewer mistakes at the early growth stage of Lululemon,” she says. “I’m a very team-orientated leader. I really believe in setting a strategic plan and having all functions align with that. We focus on planning together, and we all commit to the plan. I wouldn’t have seen that without Harvard.”Day, a regular yoga practitioner who led the initial public offering that helped fund Schultz’s acquisition of Starbucks, recalls that by the time she came to consider executive education, most of the training at the ever-expanding coffee-shop empire had focused on developing retail store managers, rather than executives with a more administrative, general management background.“I’d grown up inside the Starbucks organisation … and [going to business school] seemed a good opportunity to benchmark myself outside the company,” she says. She considered Stanford Graduate School of Business but felt it would be strong on strategy but too heavily concentrated on technology industries, and saw other executive education programmes as too financially focused.“I was looking for broader general business experience,” Day says, adding that she liked the Harvard case-study approach (and its Boston campus). One Starbucks colleague had also completed the advanced management programme before.She already had a BA in business administration from Central Washington University and three years’ experience in financial services before Starbucks, but had only ever worked in North America.“What attracted me to the [Harvard] programme was that it had a large international base of participants. I knew that building that international base would be invaluable,” she says. According to Harvard, the 150 people who enrol in the advanced management programme each year typically come from at least 50 different countries, and case studies are drawn from 30 countries.“The world is changing so quickly, you need to take a step back, invest in yourself and look at things happening on the global stage,” Day says. Taking 12 weeks away from a day job for the course, for which participants study three cases a day, six days a week, “is obviously hard to do”, but she was helped by attending it between management jobs at Starbucks.Of the professors who lectured at Harvard, she says she was particularly impressed by Robert Kaplan’s teaching on management accounting and Richard Vietor’s classes on international political economy. (“Working on global strategy, that has become so helpful now,” she notes.)According to Harvard, the $64,000 course “reflects the issues and conditions of the moment”, and Day says enrolling just after the Enron scandal meant that “governance was a hot issue”. Corporate social responsibility, she recalls, “was at an infant stage, but we really got the best of the thinking on CSR early on. It shaped a lot of my thinking processes.”She adds: “I also think the whole strategic activity mapping I got from Harvard helped me design the company’s strategy and what we invest in to protect the brand.”Many of the lessons came not from the professors but from her classroom peers, she adds, and she soon saw the value of her international alumni network when she moved from running North American finance and strategy at Starbucks to its international group as president of Asia-Pacific operations.The alumni network was particularly useful in Asia, she says. “You can imagine arriving in India at 2am, knowing no one, and the next day you have breakfast with your colleagues from the Harvard Business School programme. That was particularly valuable for a woman travelling alone to all these unfamiliar places.”After visiting one former colleague, Haibo Dai, a senior official of Shanghai’s Pudong district, Day remembers being delivered to her next meeting in a government car.“You should have seen the faces of the people I was meeting,” she says. “They were trying to figure out how in the heck I knew all these people.”She also did business with one Harvard class member, striking a partnership deal for him to sell Starbucks’ bottled Frappuccino drinks in South Korea. The alumni still write holiday letters, and receive a monthly update co-ordinated by one graduate of the programme.With a franchise in Australia, an office in Hong Kong and a small wholesale presence in London (in time for the expected boost to all things athletic from the 2012 Olympic Games), Lululemon’s international reach is still a long way from that of Starbucks.In spite of her international experience, Day says Harvard helped teach her that no business can do everything at once. “We’re still a small company and we’re focused on building out in North America,” she says. “Saying no has got to be one of my great strengths.”

equity portfolio companies to seek a public offering.The company was acquired in 2006 by private equity firms Bain Capital, the Carlyle Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners. It is now seeking to pay down its total debt load, which is 6.3 times its adjusted earnings in the year to March 26, according to the prospectus.Dunkin’ also said in its filing it would seek to increase its term loan, currently at $1.4bn, by $100m.The proceeds of the deal, none of which will go to investors in the private equity funds, will be put towards repayment of $475m owing on debt notes due in 2018.Dunkin’ said its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, after excluding one-time charges and refinancing costs, or adjusted ebitda, was $287m in the year ended March 26. The prospectus did not indicate the company’s targeted valuation.In spite of its origins selling doughnuts, Dunkin’ Brands claims to be the biggest seller of coffee in the US, with over 1bn cups a year, and markets itself as a more down-to-earth competitor to Starbucks, the world’s largest coffee retailer.Dunkin’ has more than 16,000 locations in 57 countries under the Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin Robbins brands. The doughnuts brand was created in the 1940s when Bill Rosenberg founded his first restaurant, which was later renamed Dunkin’ Donuts.Both Dunkin’ and Starbucks are grappling with rising prices of coffee and sugar, and are seeking to compete head to head in selling premium coffee products for home machines that brew single cups, a US market they hope will boost earnings.In the first quarter, Dunkin’ had revenues of $139m, a rise of 9 per cent over the same period last year, with operating income of $44.8m, a jump of 22 per cent.Private equity firms have been successful in 2010 selling shares in groups that are cutting debt rather than returning cash to investors. HCA, the hospital chain, raised $3.8bn, and Nielsen Holdings, the media measurement group, sold $1.6bn in shares.Dunkin’ plans to list on Nasdaq OMX’s US market.The underwriters are JPMorgan, Barclays Capital, Morgan Stanley, BofA Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs."
592;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-04-29T18:00:45Z;Coffee producers chase the high;;The “morning coffee ritual” is spreading through the world.As the aroma of the freshly brewed beverage reaches markets such as China, and consumption skyrockets in producing nations such as Brazil, the global coffee industry is witnessing a boom that could reshape the market and lead to higher prices.For centuries, poor farmers in Africa and Latin America have grown the commodity to satisfy the daily caffeine fix of rich consumers in the US, Japan and western Europe.While the so-called traditional markets remain central to the industry, markets in Asia, Africa and Latin America are increasingly important.“The coffee market is at a turning point,” says Nicolas Tamari, director-general of Sucafina, a Geneva-based coffee trading house.“Demand in western Europe and the US is nearing a plateau, while consumption in emerging markets is rising strongly, particularly in coffee-producing countries.”Brazil is paradigmatic of the trends. Already the largest coffee producer, it is set to become the biggest consumer too next year.The Brazilian Coffee Industry Association (Abic) forecasts that domestic demand will top 21m bags, of 60kg each, in 2012, which is up 50 per cent in the past decade and surpasses that of the US.“The world of coffee consumption is changing,” says Nathan Herszkowicz, Abic executive director. “Brazilians are drinking more coffee each day too.”And other emerging markets, particularly in Asia, are “shifting from tea into coffee”, he adds. The rapid increase in demand from emerging countries – which echoes other commodities markets such as oil and copper – is one of the main reasons for the surge in speculative investment in coffee, according to analysts and traders.The rise in demand has an impact beyond the industry. For years, coffee has been a sleepy niche commodity market, largely handled by roasters and trading houses. But lately less specialist investors have gained exposure through popular commodities indices.This week the cost of arabica coffee, the high-quality bean appreciated by espresso connoisseurs, hit its highest level in 34 years, above $3 per pound. Arabica coffee prices have risen 125 per cent in the past year, forcing retailers to raise prices.JM Smucker, the US company behind the popular Folgers brand and a trendsetter, has raised retail prices three times during the past year, totalling a 23 per cent rise.Unlike the previous four big rallies of the coffee market – in 1975-77, 1985-86, 1994 and 1997 – which were triggered after frost hit Brazil’s coffee belt, the current high has a broader cause.Supplies are running low in a larger number of countries, particularly Colombia, a top producer of premium arabica beans, while demand in producing countries such as Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico and Ethiopia is skyrocketing.As important as the rapid increase in producing nations’ consumption is the arrival of the coffee culture to Asian countries such as China.Coffee shop chains consider the region a top priority. Howard Schultz, Starbucks chief executive, says he is “beginning to see the morning [coffee] ritual develop” in China, confirming plans to triple the company’s number of stores there to more than 1,500 by 2015.According to the International Coffee Organisation, global demand for the beverage has risen 2.4 per cent per year over the past decade. But the increase masks a divergent trend: while consumption in the traditional markets of western Europe, the US and Japan grew by an anaemic 1.1 per cent per year, demand in producing countries swelled by an impressive 4.3 per cent per year. Consumption in non-producing emerging countries expanded by 3.8 per cent per year.The divergent consumption trends have narrowed the demand gap between different markets.Back in 2000, the traditional consumers accounted for more than 60 per cent of global demand, estimated then at 105.5m bags.But in 2010, after a decade of strong demand in emerging and producing countries, the share of the US, western Europe and Japan fell to less than 53 per cent of the 134m bags consumed globally.If the current consumption trends persist, as most of the industry expects, by the middle of the decade the traditional consumers will represents less than half of the market for the first time.The rise in demand from emerging countries is affecting not only quantity but also quality.Consumers in nations such as Brazil and Indonesia have for years consumed coffee made from robusta beans and those arabica beans that are of lower quality.But Keith Flury, soft commodities analyst at Rabobank, one of the largest lenders to agribusinesses, says demand is starting to move up the quality ladder, with consumption of premium washed arabica beans rising, albeit from a level that is still low.If trends towards greater consumption and higher quality continue in emerging markets, traders and industry executives say the result will be correspondingly higher prices.
593;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-04-28T21:35:45Z;US GDP data weigh on markets;;Wall Street continued to trend upwards following the multiyear highs reached in the previous session, but sentiment was held back slightly by mixed earnings reports from industry bellwethers ExxonMobil and Procter & Gamble and disappointing data on US economic growth.ExxonMobil, the world’s largest oil company by market capitalisation, reported a 69 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings to $10.7bn, largely on the back of high oil prices. A record performance in Exxon’s chemicals division also helped, and earnings came in at $2.14 per share, ahead of the $2.07 expected by analysts.But the recent jump in energy prices had left the markets with extremely high expectations for the oil giant, and so the stock was down 0.5 per cent at $87.34 following the results. The stock has still gained 19.3 per cent, however, since the start of the year.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Procter & Gamble reported weak sales growth of less than 1 per cent in developed markets and said it had underestimated commodity inflation in “a very difficult operating environment”.But thanks to emerging market growth, overall net sales increased by 4.5 per cent, which helped to negate any negative impact on the stock from slower domestic growth. The stock was mostly flat throughout the day, but was up 0.8 per cent at $64.50 at the close.These mixed results left the wider markets struggling for direction for much of the session, but in late trading the overwhelming optimism in the markets thanks to the surprising good earnings season so far won out.The S&P 500 index closed up 0.4 per cent to 1,360.48, its highest point since June 2008. The S&P has risen 1.8 per cent this week as first-quarter earnings have largely beaten forecasts. So far, 78 per cent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings so far have beaten analysts’ expectations, ahead of the 73 per cent beat-rate in the last quarter.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.6 per cent to 12,763.31 while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.1 per cent to 2,872.53.Sentiment was not helped by news that the rate of growth in the US economy had slowed to 1.8 per cent in the first three months of 2011 from the 3.1 per cent rate in the same period a year ago. This was below the 2 per cent growth rate expected by economists.“We can see that headwinds like commodity price inflation and the slow rate of job creation are dragging on the US economy,” said Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer of Hennion & Walsh. “This raises concerns about the sustainability of the US economy when the government stimulus comes to an end,” he said.Starbucks also reported mixed results, leaving the coffee chain 0.8 per cent lower at $36.88. The company reported worldwide net earnings up 20 per cent to $261m as well as a 20 per cent rise in sales growth in China, but margins were hit by higher coffee prices.In deal news, Constellation Energy rose 5.7 per cent to $36.26 after Exelon agreed to buy the electricity generator and utility operator. Exelon shares were up 1.7 per cent to $42.18.The all-stock deal valued at $7.9bn would create a US utility to rival Duke Energy and Progress Energy as the country’s largest power group. Duke was up 0.8 per cent to $18.68 while Progress added 0.8 per cent to $47.32.Sprint Nextel added 6.7 per cent to $5.11 after reporting that its loss had narrowed by nearly half as the wireless carrier continued to add customers.Aetna results were another bright spot, with the stock rising 4.1 per cent to $41.45 after the health insurer raised its 2011 profit target and reported first-quarter earnings that topped estimates.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Ebayreported steady earnings growth for the first quarter of 2011, driven mainly by its payment arm. But investors were disappointed, and the stock was down 0.1 per cent to $34.Eastman Kodak, the troubled photography group, sank 10.1 per cent to $2.85 after swinging to a first-quarter loss of 92 cents a share. The company also reported that revenues fell 31 per cent amid continuing declines in its film segment.Evergreen Solar slumped after the company said it may need to raise cash to continue operations after first-quarter sales fell short of expectations. The stock tumbled 31.7 per cent to $1.42.Skechers lost 7.5 per cent to $19.02 after the maker of Shape-ups toning shoes reported first-quarter profit of 24 cents a share, missing the average analyst estimate by 20 per cent.
594;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-04-27T23:40:43Z;Starbucks hails progress in China;;Starbucks has hailed the development of the western-style “morning coffee ritual” in China, a new consumption habit that has the potential to boost the sales of all coffee chains within the Asian superpower.While the bulk of Starbucks coffee in China is still drunk in the afternoon, Howard Schultz, chief executive, said the company was “now beginning to see the morning ritual develop” as it reported quarterly sales growth of 20 per cent in the country.In Japan, another east Asian country better known for tea drinking, the morning cup of coffee had gained popularity in the mid-1990s, he said, and he forecast that China would eventually be Starbucks’ largest market outside the US.Nigel Travis, head of Dunkin’ Donuts, a Starbucks rival in the US and China, last month cited internal research showing that breakfast coffee was “growing very quickly” in China. After several years of rapid growth in the economy and household incomes the world’s most populous country is awash with coffee and other products that form the staples of middle-class life. But many multinationals have made mistakes in their eagerness to profit from new consumer demand.Starbucks is emerging from a two-year reorganisation led by Howard Schultz, chief executive, that included closing underperforming US and international locations.At the start of March, Starbucks terminated an unsuccessful packaged coffee distribution deal with Kraft and retook direct control of that business, but the company said the change had no impact on profits in the four weeks that followed.The bulk of Starbucks’ revenue and its revenue growth still come from its branded coffee stores, but the company is seeking to expand its sales of packaged coffee and food for home consumption, which promise higher profit margins.Mr Schultz said it was still “very early days” for Starbucks in China but he announced that the company wanted to triple its number of stores there to more than 1,500 by 2015.Alluding to the difficulties some multinationals had faced, he said Starbucks was continuing to “build trust” and, in spite of his enthusiasm for coffee with breakfast, stressed the need to act “with respect [for] the Chinese consumer and Chinese culture”.China was the single biggest contributor to Starbucks’ sales growth in the quarter to the end of March although the company does not break out specific sales figures for the country.International sales, which include China, rose 15 per cent to $610m. They remain less than one-third the size of sales in the US, which rose 6 per cent to $1.9bn even as cash-strapped consumers faced higher fuel and food prices.Starbucks itself has been grappling with the high price of coffee, but it had only a limited effect on worldwide net earnings, which rose 20 per cent to $261m.The price of arabica coffee has risen 125 per cent in the past 12 months and Starbucks said it had cut 2 percentage points off its operating profit margin of 13.5 per cent. It also said it had “locked in” coffee prices for the rest of 2011 by forward buying.
595;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:22:14+0000;Case study: Trung Nguyên coffee;;The story. Coffee cultivation in Vietnam began under French colonial rule in the 19th century and soon became a staple industry. By the mid-1990s, the country had become one of the three biggest coffee producers in the world.Much of it, however, was low quality and sold at cut prices overseas. Vietnamese-American entrepreneur Dang Le Nguyen Vu believed high-quality Vietnamese gourmet coffees could be produced and sold profitably. So, in the mid-1990s, he launched Trung Nguyên, a coffee manufacturer and café chain.The challenge. Vietnam is an emerging market. In 1995, per capita income was only $250 (the 2010 figure was $1,200). This was one reason why Mr Vu chose to develop a luxury brand that would appeal to both domestic and export markets.To do so, he would have to persuade the home market that his expensive product offered value, and convince overseas customers that Vietnam could produce gourmet coffee.The home market. As the owner of a coffee-processing business, Mr Vu could improve the quality but there was no efficient distribution network. The answer was to set up a chain of coffee shops, modelled in part on Starbucks, that would also sell coffee beans for home consumption.The branding of Trung Nguyên was carefully planned. To counter competition from big multinationals, whether coffee shops or brands such as Nescafé, Mr Vu positioned it as part of a Vietnamese tradition. A Trung Nguyên museum tells the history of coffee-making in the country.One of Trung Nguyên’s best-known products is kopi luwak or “weasel coffee”, made from coffee berries that have passed through the digestive tract of a civet cat. Marketing this expensive delicacy, which is harvested only in south-east Asia, helps identify Trung Nguyên with Vietnam’s coffee culture.Combining heritage and modernity is at the heart of the brand, whether in the packaging or the styling of the coffee shops. Straplines such as “Bringing creativity into coffee” suggest innovation.By pricing the coffee high, Mr Vu appealed to the aspirations of Vietnamese people. An emerging middle class took to the brand and the coffee shops became important social centres. The first Trung Nguyên coffee shop opened in Ho Chi Minh City in 1998, and by 2010 there were more than 1,000 across Vietnam.Trung Nguyên has also diversified into decaffeinated and instant coffee and tea production.The overseas market. Export was part of the strategy from the start. Trung Nguyên now markets its coffee in more than 40 countries, including the US and the UK.Most of the brand’s appeal is to niche markets, to consumers interested in exotic coffees and, especially in the US, to visitors to Vietnam who have seen the brand there. Most of the coffee is sold online through franchisees. Sales volumes are very small compared with those in Vietnam.Attempts to replicate the domestic coffee shop branding strategy and set up Trung Nguyên outlets overseas have met with mixed success. There are now two stores in Singapore and a few elsewhere in the world. But, generally, in spite of its success in Vietnam, the Trung Nguyên brand is not well-known elsewhere.Current challenges. Trung Nguyên must expand its export market if the company is to continue to grow. Although rising prosperity in Vietnam means there are opportunities for domestic growth, Trung Nguyên is under pressure from competitors.Key lessons. Creating a luxury brand in an emerging market might seem contradictory. But the Trung Nguyên case shows how it can be done. By appealing to national culture and values, and creating an aspirational brand with which rising middle classes could identify, it transformed the coffee market in Vietnam.However, Trung Nguyên has also learnt that extending the brand overseas will take longer, and require more finessing.The author is honorary senior fellow at the University of Exeter Business School
596;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-04-25T18:37:00Z;Social stock selection;Good for consumers but double-edged sword for companies;Leave aside the lonely who follow brands on social networking sites. The likes of Twitter and Facebook are now actively used by the world’s biggest companies as sophisticated marketing tools. It is not just that customers are targeted for campaigns and promotions or that behavioural data can be mined. Numerous studies have shown relationships between online activity (the cyberspace equivalent of word-of-mouth) and consumer behaviour.For example, the volume of internet chat has been shown to predict book sales (Gruhl, Kumar, Nova and Tomkins). Another study last year (Asur and Haberman) concluded that short-term box-office sales can be forecast from the rate at which people tweet about a film. A recent research paper by Arthur O’Connor at Pace University goes a step further, finding a correlation between the fan counts of Starbucks, Coca-Cola and Nike on social media sites and those companies’ respective share prices over a 10-month period.The positive spin for marketers who might leap on such studies is that growing fan counts are a sign of increased brand loyalty and, thus, brand performance and ultimately revenues. Other things remaining constant, higher revenues should boost stock prices. Perhaps. Research is in its infancy on how social media affect customer knowledge, retention, motivation, and decision making. At the very least, advertising and marketing departments can get closer to, and gather more information about, their end customers than ever before.But correlations are one thing and causality quite another. Perhaps a company’s share price is rising at the same time as it is adding thousands of new Facebook followers because of a huge marketing push elsewhere. Also, do social media reduce the chance of a brand surviving a big negative shock? The internet is unambiguously good for consumers. But it remains a double-edged sword for companies.E-mail the Lex team in confidence
597;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-04-07T17:15:43Z;Coffee chains see future in single-cups;;Dunkin’ Donuts is racing against Starbucks to roll out a premium coffee product for home machines that brew single cups, a US market that the companies hope will boost earnings.The two groups are increasing their investments in so-called at home coffee at a time when their profitability is threatened by coffee prices that last month hit a 34-year high.Packaged coffee promises higher profit margins than the groups’ branded stores.Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, which makes the most popular US single-cup machines, is trading at a valuation more commonly associated with leading online media companies.“This product is about convenience,” says Nigel Travis, president of Dunkin’ Donuts, which says it is the US’s biggest coffee merchant and sells more than 1bn cups from its stores every year.“A lot of our customers come to our stores two or three times a day, but they are desperate for our coffee in the evening. This caters to that,” he says.In Europe, the coffee pods that are fed into single-cup machines have been popularised by Nestlé’s Nespresso brand.The US companies are betting that US consumers will be attracted by the ease of using single-serve pods as well as their lack of waste compared with traditional drip coffee machines that make whole pots.Starbucks says it expects its own single-cup packaged coffee business to generate $1bn of annual sales in the future.The US single-cup market, which is still in its infancy, was worth $2bn last year, according to the company.Larry Miller, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said: “There is a little bit of overhype about the single-serve business, but it is a pretty big open-ended opportunity.”Green Mountain, which will package both Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts coffee into branded pods, is trading at a valuation equivalent to 53 times its forecast earnings for the next 12 months.Green Mountain shares jumped 41 per cent on the day last month when Starbucks announced a partnership with it.Dunkin’ Donuts announced its deal with Green Mountain in February and wants to launch its pods in the US this summer, ahead of Starbucks in the autumn.Green Mountain has a 70-80 per cent share of the US single-cup business, built on proprietary technology that weds together its K-cup pods and home coffee makers.It sells the machines at cost – for as little as $100 – and makes profit on the pods, which retail for 60-80 cents each.Mr Miller said: “If Starbucks can chop up its packaged coffee business into smaller packets that sell at five times the price, that’s great for them.”The price of arabica coffee, a high-quality bean, has climbed 89 per cent over the past 12 months.Starbucks said last month that it would raise the wholesale price of its packaged coffee by 12 per cent.Both companies reject suggestions that the premium pods are a stealth means of implementing further price rises.
598;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:15:58+0000;Street smarts needed to thrive in China;;Shanghai’s premier shopping street, Huai Hai Middle Road, is a roadmap of US brands.At number 550 stands the shuttered House of Barbie, the department store for the doll and symbol of all that can go wrong when the US sells to China.At number 887 are KFC and Pizza Hut, examples of what can go right in the relationship between multinationals and China consumers.Occupying pride of place at number 1 is Starbucks, the coffee-house.The street tells a tale of foreign capitalism in China, with a moral: to thrive on the mainland, brands must be flexible, meaning altering not just their products but sometimes their core business models to suit Chinese tastes and culture.After setbacks for brands such as Home Depot, Best Buy and Barbie, which have closed stores or withdrawn after failing to win over Chinese consumers, the lessons of Huai Hai Road are germane.“Anybody who comes into this market and thinks they can just plant their brand and let it grow will be sadly mistaken,” Tom Doctoroff, north Asia chief executive of JWT, the advertising agency, says.“Any [foreign] business model needs to be brought into alignment with Chinese cultural and consumer imperatives.”He points to Pizza Hut, Starbucks and Häagen-Dazs as the gold standard for foreign brand success in China. They took products alien to Chinese tastes and made them popular.Pizza Hut and KFC, both owned by Yum Brands, localised their menu. On Huai Hai Road, Pizza Hut offers teriyaki squid with quail egg skewers, while one of KFC’s most popular breakfast dishes is rice gruel with thousand-year egg.But adjusting to local tastes is not just about food, Mr Doctoroff says.Pizza Hut, Starbucks and Häagen-Dazs all focused on eat-in, rather than carry-out, in China.“Barbie just got plonked down in China.”Even luxury goods companies have had to adapt their model, he says. The Chinese market for luxury goods is “broad and shallow”. Not all consumers can afford a luxury handbag, so top-end brands offer more accessories such as key-chains and sunglasses.“When foreign companies come to China, they are very proud of the business model that gave them success in other countries,” Chen Can, of Beijing-based Analysys International, says.Amway, the US direct selling company that has 43 per cent of the China direct sales market, took the opposite approach, abandoning core elements of its business model when pressed to do so by Beijing. This included setting up retail outlets, which it had in no other country.Eva Cheng, recently retired head of Amway China, says the company changed its strategy “to promote harmony and fusion with the Chinese culture” – words that might not trip off the tongue of every foreign chief executive.This has proved to be a winning strategy, Audie Wong, president of Amway China, says.“At first we opened retail stores to comply with government regulations, but then we found they were very useful,” he says.He notes that Chinese consumers prefer a brand with premises they can visit in case of problems.China is Amway’s biggest market, with sales of Rmb22bn ($3.6bn) last year.John Quelch, dean of the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, says the go-to-market strategy of companies must be locally tailored.“The key differentiator between successful and unsuccessful companies is distribution management,” he says.Additional reporting by Shirley Chen
599;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-03-30T18:48:57Z;The fickle value of friendship;;In a glass box in the middle of a PepsiCo marketing department, five people are staring at a huge bank of screens showing a constantly updated river of tweets, “likes”, praise and damnation from consumers of Gatorade, the company’s sports drink.“Doing it in a glass room means every single person in the marketing organisation is seeing the insights brought to life in real time. It reminds them how important it is to know the heartbeat of the consumer,” says Bonin Bough, global director of digital and social media at PepsiCo. “I really feel like it is the future of marketing.”A similar scenario is playing out in marketing departments around the world. A survey of members of the World Federation of Advertisers, a grouping of multinational brands, by Millward Brown found that 96 per cent were spending more of their budgets managing Facebook pages, Twitter accounts and other social media, racing to accrue fans, retweets and that elusive but ubiquitous quality: engagement.However, the research also found that few knew why they were doing it – half were “unsure” of the returns they were getting from their efforts, while more than a quarter found the payback was “just average or poor”.It is only one indication that advertisers’ attitudes towards social media might be shifting. Brands are still flocking to Facebook and its share of display advertising spending is rising fast but finance directors are questioning the value of accruing thousands of fans and followers. Unlike search-engine advertising, where calculating the net gain or loss from each click is relatively straightforward, demonstrating the return on investment of many social media campaigns is proving a challenge.“The hype vessel is at full throttle, and largely without a rudder,” says Michael Maoz, an analyst at Gartner, the research company. “Social media is like the surgeon’s scalpel – a valuable tool in the right hands but potentially dangerous.”Social media gained ground rapidly in the past few years due in part to the shift in consumer behaviour – social networking is now the most popular online activity in the UK, ahead of search or entertainment, while Facebook overtook Google to be the most popular site in the US last year.It has also captured the imagination of marketers because it has been seen as cheap. Now that marketing budgets are rising again – advertising spending in the UK, for example, rose 6.9 per cent in 2010, according to the Advertising Association – more money is being poured in.It is not hard to find examples of social media having a positive impact on a brand. Starbucks, the coffee chain, says it boosted UK sales of Christmas drinks by 15 per cent last year by inviting its Facebook fans to choose seasonal flavours.But the Starbucks example also reveals that it is not having lots of Facebook friends that counts – it is what companies do with them and how they engage them that can translate into increased sales.“To be completely up front about it: there is no ROI for any social media programme,” says James Whatley, marketing director at 1000heads, the social media agency. “However, there is definitely provable ROI for social media programmes that are set up to do something. It’s all about setting a clear objective.”Attempts to pin a dollar value on a Facebook fan have largely been abandoned because it varies depending on whether the brand’s page is trying to sell coffee, cars or simply create a community to monitor for complaints and feedback. Estimates suggest 10-15 per cent of Facebook posts are seen by their intended recipients and click-through rates are little better than for traditional banner advertisements – fractions of a percentage point.Mr Bough talks about social media being useful for driving “experiences” for consumers, such as getting fans of Mountain Dew, the soft drink, to suggest new flavours and packaging design. “It’s about the experience you are creating that reaches the passion of your consumers,” he says. “Digital is today’s language. Now more than ever, this provides the opportunity to create deeper relationships with consumers than we were ever able to before …It’s not experimentation for experimentation sake or digital for digital’s sake.”He points to the Gatorade Mission Control room. Each of its five operatives represents a different part of the company, such as branding, PR and customer service, which means relevant comments are fed back to the right part of the company. “This is the largest unaided focus group you could ever ask for,” he says.Other companies, meanwhile, are yielding results with less effort. A recent ranking of “social brands” by Yomego, a social media agency, put Apple – which makes no effort to maintain a presence on Facebook or Twitter – in second place, finding it had the highest satisfaction score on the list.The real value of social media comes not when it is run in isolation by a crack team of supergeeks but when it forms part of a larger strategy, with broader goals than just fans and consumer engagement.According to Ankur Shah, co-founder of Techlightenment, a social media agency and technology provider, companies that run search engine advertising in parallel with social media campaigns are more cost-effective than social media on its own. His company is developing a tool to track how a newsfeed item propagates through Facebook by telling an advertiser when a friend of a friend buys something based on its advertising.Mr Shah admits it is still early days for such technology. “At the moment, putting that figure – what exactly is the value of a [Facebook] fan – is tricky, it’s vague and it’s fluffy,” he says. “If a brand tries to rationalise it, they will get in trouble because those attribution models are not developed yet.”Brendan Tansey, UK chief executive of Wunderman, a direct marketing agency, believes the wide range of uses for social media exempts it from the usual online measures of marketing success. “Traditional online ROI has always been focused on the ‘click to conversion’ as this is what online advertising and [pay per click] can achieve,” he says. “However, social media offer a much broader mix of online consumer interaction. Social media ROI, specifically the return, should therefore not be focused on the conversion alone.”Other advertising experts are not sure that is enough. “You are looking for the big ‘e’ word – engagement – and what that does, but also purchasing or signing up to be part of a loyalty scheme or whatever it happens to be,” says David Kershaw, chief executive of M&C Saatchi, the advertising agency. “One wants a bit of marriage rather than just engagement.”
600;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-03-20T17:30:21Z;China rekindles fondness for western ways;Management lessons and rip-off handbags;"“How was China?” everyone asked last week when I pitched up at home bleary-eyed after an overnight flight. In reply, I found myself repeating the line from Noel Coward’s play Private Lives. “Very big, China.”This was not an especially impressive insight given that I’d just spent six fabulous days swanking around Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. Neither was it something I’d learnt from being there. When you are whisked round from flight to car, distance ceases to mean much.In accepting the invitation to go on a debating tour, I had expected to return with a mind full of management ideas and a suitcase full of rip-off handbags. The former, I was sure, would be as plentiful as the latter: you can’t have an economic miracle on the scale of China without producing the odd management lesson that other countries can learn from.Within 30 seconds of my arrival in Beijing, I’d had my first workplace insight. Waiting to help us manage the airport was the neatest young woman I have ever seen, wearing a uniform of a belted blue coat and white gloves. At the hotel, the staff were wearing smart grey dresses; the men driving the tourist rickshaws were in fashionably rustic beige jerkins. China really knows how to do uniforms, while the west has forgotten: it sacrificed them on the temple of individuality a long time ago. Uniforms, I saw, are smart, good for the consumer, give some pride to the job and take the stress out of getting dressed in the morning.The next lesson was more profound. Everywhere was speed and efficiency. Workers were conspicuously doing the very thing that workers are meant to do – work. As we drove around, we saw lines of uniformed people being given a stern talking to by their bosses before starting their shifts. It seems that in China the long forgotten management tool “do it because I say so” still works a treat. All rather impressive, if a little scary.On day three, I met a Chinese journalist who writes about the workplace and compared notes. She told me that Chinese workers moan the whole time and have conniptions if any colleague is given any privilege they are not. The place is riddled with office politics – promotions on merit are almost unheard of; the rules that govern relationships and status are all important – and impossible for any westerner to grasp.In return, I tried to explain the ludicrousness of western office life to her. “People skills?” she repeated, looking entirely baffled. “Anger management classes?” She shook her head in disbelief. In China there is nothing wrong with shouting. Everyone does it all the time. When I explained “360° feedback” to her she nearly keeled over. In China, she said, workers are often asked to appraise their peers, but this turns out to be less feedback than snitching. Only when I talked about team bonding she perked up. Ah yes, she said, very popular in China only it happens at the weekend and if you don’t show up your pay gets docked.As we talked, something peculiar happened. Even as I was ridiculing the nonsense and hypocrisy of western management I started to think about it rather more fondly than usual. I stopped wanting to bring home any management lessons from China at all. Evidently she felt the same way: after our lunch she e-mailed to say that her next column was on why it’s easier to be a boss in China.This left shopping for handbags and watches – which turned out to be equally perplexing. On the street the going rate for a fake Calvin Klein watch is £1.80, less than a cappuccino. What invisible hand decreed this set of relative prices?An even bigger puzzle were the luxury shops. In Beijing and Shanghai there are almost as many Louis Vuitton and Chanel stores as there are Starbucks and Costas. Everyone knows that in China there is the greatest luxury boom the world has ever seen. But when I walked past these stores, the only signs of life were squadrons of eager shop assistants. Westerners don’t shop there, as the stuff is much cheaper at home. But I didn’t see a single Chinese customer in any of the stores either.Are the shops a front for something? Or will some of the big luxury companies soon admit – like Mattel did recently with its Barbie store– that they dashed into China too hastily? What’s at the bottom of it all, I asked our Shanghai correspondent. She shrugged. The better she got to know China, she said, the less she expected to be able to get to the bottom of anything.lucy.kellaway@ft.com"
601;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-03-18T22:28:06Z;KCom revamp set to elicit BT interest;;"In the centre of Hull, a drab Brutalist-era building casts a shadow over the former fishing town. The offending edifice is that of the telephone company Kingston Communications – and the residents of Hull cannot get rid of it.While new shopping centres have shot up around Hull, the KC headquarters and the company’s ubiquitous cream telephone boxes are reminders that Hull is different from the rest of Britain: it is not covered by BT.In 1917, Hull’s council decided boldly to keep control over the municipal phone company instead of merging with the rest of its peers to form British Telecom, a decision many of the council members’ descendants would come to lament.Though KCom, KC’s parent company, made it on to the FTSE 100 during the dotcom boom, shares in the company have fallen more than 90 per cent since their peak, a blow to the 50,000 Hull locals that bought into the flotation.Moreover, as competition heats up across the country between BT and alternative broadband providers such as British Sky Broadcasting and Virgin Media, Hull has been passed over.To locals, it is a version of Waiting for Godot. “We always thought other services would come, but they never did,” Mark Rolands, a resident and early KCom investor, says. “KC has got better but it’s a lot worse than it should be.”Aaron Cryan, another resident, is less kind, denouncing the company as a “rip-off, monopoly and not open to change”.After years of complacency, the financial crisis has forced KCom to wake up to such criticisms in a desperate two-year drive to restructure its business.But the restructuring seems to have worked better than KCom would have liked, and may end up accomplishing the unthinkable: making KCom’s Hull business an acquisition target for BT.“What would have been inconceivable a while back is not inconceivable now,” says Mark James, an analyst at Liberum Capital.Since taking over as chairman in 2008, Bill Halbert, a BT veteran, has forced the company to abandon hopes of becoming a national network operator and eliminated six of KCom’s eight brands.The company is now focusing on the two remaining brands: its managed services business for companies – also called KCom – and KC, the Hull business, with an emphasis on rebranding. Plans are also under way to knock down KC’s headquarters and replace it with a building more worthy of the city’s slogan: “Welcome to the new Hull.”Internally, KC used to be called the “legacy business”, Mr Halbert says. “And when you visited the people in it and looked at the way that they were interacting with their customers, it behaved as a legacy business …No ambition. No plan to grow. Defensive attitude. It had built up a monopoly in its traditional business and was resting on its laurels. Do legacy businesses go anywhere?”KCom’s new plan, he says, is to offer Hull customers fresh services, such as cloud-based computing, and encourage them to sign up for new bundled services. At the same time, the company will try to expand its reach to nearby northern cities.The makeover has won few friends in Hull. “They’re trying to rebrand themselves without allowing for competition,” says Mr Cryan. But it has been well-received by investors who point to the reduction of the company’s debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation from 3.7 times to 1.5 times in the past two years.The company reported a pre-tax profit of £19m in the 2009-10 fiscal year, versus a loss of £11m the year before, while its free cash flow has doubled.The next step, analysts say, is for KCom’s managed services and Hull businesses to both be acquired; the first by a smaller telecoms group, such as Daisy, which has been expanding through acquisitions; the latter by its rightful king.While a BT takeover once might have been unthinkable from a regulatory perspective, the situation has changed, says Liberum’s Mr James. “The regulatory pendulum has swung in BT’s favour over the past few years because it’s had the heart pulled out of it by the bundlers of this world, like TalkTalk, and lost …market share.”Mr Halbert dismisses the notion that BT could convince shareholders to go through with the deal, because it could hardly make enough returns in Hull to justify buying the business.In the interim, KCom is hoping its new KC tagline, “Proud to be part of local life”, will start winning it more fans in Hull. Yet, if Mr Rolands is any example, KCom might make more inroads by focusing on the financials.He is still waiting for the 60p shares to reach their 225p initial offering price – and the 900p at which he bought them."
602;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:22:14+0000;Lunch with the FT: Howard Schultz;Can a coffee chain with 17,000 shops worldwide really match a decades-old family-run New York delicatessen for authenticity? Starbucks chief Howard Schultz makes his case to John Gapper;When I arrive at Barney Greengrass, the Upper West Side family delicatessen whose former owner Moe Greengrass was known as The Sturgeon King, there is no sign of Howard Schultz near the long counter of cured fish. I find him in the restaurant to the side, sitting at a Formica-topped, metal-legged table with Moe’s son Gary, who inherited the place.Barney Greengrass is a relic of New York in its mid-20th century glory, when it was the global capital of business glamour, and the immigrant diaspora flocked to a joint that reminded it of family and home. Nothing much has changed. It has the same dingy green walls, the same tables packed together, and waiters exchanging the same barbed repartee with regulars. As the founder and once more chief executive of Starbucks, 57-year-old Schultz oversees 17,000 coffee stores from Seattle to Shanghai. But he first came here with friends as a teenager, taking the subway from his home in Brooklyn.Barney Greengrass is a symbol not only of where Schultz came from but what he left. Among the photos of Hollywood actors on the wall is Leonardo DiCaprio filming a scene in the restaurant for Revolutionary Road, the film of the Richard Yates novel about a couple who long to leave New York for Paris but end up miserably in suburbia. They don’t escape, but Schultz did.I have persuaded him to choose a place that means something to him, rather than a standard Manhattan restaurant. He has told his story so many times (how in 1982 he joined a small Seattle company called Starbucks, how he visited a Milan espresso bar and was inspired by the experience, and how he went on to buy the company) that I fear that he has nothing left unsaid.He is now telling it again, focusing on the recent chapters, when Starbucks faced a crisis of over-expansion and loss of identity in 2007. Schultz, who was then chairman, responded by ousting the chief executive and reclaiming his old job. Things are looking up again as Starbucks marks its 40th anniversary this month and he has a book coming out about his return to the company and the rebound, named with typical ebullience Onward: How Starbucks Fought for Its Life without Losing Its Soul.Schultz looks comfortably ensconced with Greengrass, chatting about the old days, but is never entirely at rest. He is tall and lean, with a big, friendly, leonine face that he thrusts close to me as I sit down. He has taken off his jacket and perches on the front of his chair in a white shirt and black tie – like the marketing executive he was before Starbucks – gazing intently as he makes his pitch.I ask what he is up to in the city, besides publicising his book and Starbucks’ anniversary. “My kids are here,” he says. “My son is trying to be a sports writer and my daughter is a college student. She wants to be a comedy writer and she’s at film school. I discouraged both of them early on from getting involved in Starbucks. I didn’t think it would be fair, plus they didn’t have any interest anyway.”…We glance at the menu, a bafflingly long list of eggs and cured fish served in multiple combinations. “It’s authentic food and it’s relaxed and I’ve known Gary for many years. It’s kind of an extension of your house, really. It reminds me of my mother’s food,” Schultz says.We talk about Brooklyn for a while, a borough whose reputation as a rough melting pot has changed in the past few years towards becoming a symbol of gentrification. I live in Park Slope, the epicentre of the shift. “That’s not really Brooklyn,” Schultz says quickly. I mention another chief executive I’ve met who grew up in Bensonhurst. “That’s Brooklyn,” he says approvingly.“You guys want to order?” The waiter says, arriving abruptly.“I’m going to have the salmon with eggs,” Schultz says.“Bagel or bialy?”“Bialy. With pickled herring to start. And bring a little whitefish salad.”I order sturgeon and salmon with scrambled eggs and onions.“You want a bagel or a bialy, my friend?” the waiter says.I admit that I have never tasted a bialy, an east European variation on a bagel with no hole in the middle. “Well, you’re about to have a new experience then. I’m really excited,” the waiter says laconically, walking away.“And whitefish salad,” Schultz reiterates after him.“Yeah, yeah,” the waiter says.The Brooklyn where Schultz grew up was Canarsie, a rugged district between Coney Island and John F Kennedy airport. “It was a good childhood but it was tough,” he says. “My father was uneducated, an army veteran in the South Pacific. He had a series of tough, tough jobs. As a child, you saw the pressure and his personal lack of achievement and how that started eroding his self-esteem and self-respect.“My mother was also uneducated but she had an innate spirit about America, that you could do anything.” She sounds as if she had more faith than his father, I say. He nods. “She had this incredible relationship with JFK. I mean not personal, but she believed in him. I haven’t talked about this in 100 years. When he was assassinated, it was an unbelievable emotional moment, just days on end of her being moved to tears and depression.”He was 10 at the time. The same year, his aunt took him to Manhattan for the first time in his life. After visiting Radio City Music Hall they went to an automat restaurant, where the food items were displayed behind windows on a long wall and customers put coins into slots to release them. Schultz was stunned by the theatricality of it. “I said: ‘Aunt Shirley, how?’ She said: ‘There’s a magician behind the wall’ and I believed her.”…The automat’s “romance, its emotional connection to the customer” stuck with Schultz. He won a scholarship to Northern Michigan University and then returned to New York to work first for Xerox and then Hammarplast, a Swedish coffee machine maker. His job took him to the Pacific coast in 1981 to visit Starbucks in Seattle.“As soon as I got off the plane, it was one of those phenomenal days when the sun was shining and the snow was …it was just like magic, unbelievable euphoria. As I was driving into the city, I felt like I was in The Wizard of Oz: ‘Where am I? What is this place?’.” He laughs. “No one told me that it rained half the time.”Our waiter returns, thumping various plates of food down on the table. There is a lot of it. “Let me give you the whole thing,” Schultz says, pointing around each dish in turn. “This is whitefish salad. Taste it. Tell me how good that is.” I obey and nod. It is fresh and tasty. I bite into some of the herring as Schultz continues his story.He first had to persuade the owners of Starbucks to employ him as their marketing director. It took a year because they found his New York intensity and ambition intimidating. “We became friends, trust was built, my intentions were honourable,” Schultz says. It sounds endearingly old-fashioned, as if he were asking for their daughter’s hand in marriage.In 1985, he had to work on his real-life father-in-law, who arrived for a visit from Ohio when Schultz had left Starbucks (which, despite a successful pilot, had refused to roll out his espresso bar concept). He was trying to raise money to open his own chain of coffee bars in Seattle and Vancouver, called Il Giornale, and was working for no pay. His wife Sheri was about to have their first child.“He asked me to go for a walk. I knew what was coming. We sat down on a park bench. As God is my witness this is exactly what happened. He says: ‘I don’t want to be disrespectful but I want you to see the picture I’m looking at. My daughter is seven months pregnant and her husband doesn’t have a job, just a hobby. I want to ask you in a heartfelt way, with real respect, to get a job.’“I started to cry, I was so embarrassed. We went back to the house and I really believed it was going to be over. That night in the privacy of our bedroom, I told my wife the story. I was so disappointed. Not angry, disappointed. She was the one that said: ‘No, we’re going to do it. We’ll raise the money.’ If she’d said: ‘He’s right,’ it would have been over. I’m sure of it.”…He reflects that his feelings for the business are still like “a love story” and then pivots skilfully into the reason for our lunch – his return to the company in 2008, eight years after he’d stepped back from day-to-day management to be chairman. I mention that his account of the crisis in his book makes it sound like a psychological shock as well as a financial one. He writes about being unable to sleep at night and being too tense to eat breakfast.Schultz nods. “I was seeing something dying that was an extension of myself and I had no influence. I’d given up the CEO title and I wasn’t paying attention. The week I came back, I stood up in front of everyone and apologised for letting them down. This was never a job, this was not a company, this was my life’s work and I was watching it fade away. It was turning into something I didn’t admire.”Although Schultz is generous in the book about Jim Donald, the former chief executive, he is scathing about the way that Starbucks had “become operationally driven, about efficiency as opposed to the romance”. He waves around the room. “This is an experience. If a professional manager came in here, he’d say the place isn’t very efficient, let’s clean it up. We’d lost the soul of the company.”Did he need to take the reins himself? “I knew where the bones were buried in a way, and I had the licence from people to do things that were necessary, even unorthodox ones such as closing all the stores for retraining for half a day. We had to admit that we weren’t as good as we had once been. It was not about how many drinks we made per hour but making the perfect beverage.”Appealing though Schultz’s narrative is, I visit Starbucks not because I am in love with its stores but because it offers a reliable level of quality. If I want something quirky and adorable, I will go to an independent. Surely, I suggest, he does not think that a corporation with 17,000 stores can combine size with Barney Greengrass-style authenticity?Schultz glances down, as if realising that he has not yet closed the deal. “You can. You can,” he says quietly. “We’re doing it right now.” He still looks disappointed by my question and he switches to corporate language. “I appreciate you coming in, for whatever reason. Customers have different need states and life experiences. Our aspiration is to exceed their expectations whatever their need states might be.”We tussle for a while longer, with Schultz recalling a company-wide conference in New Orleans in October 2008, just after Lehman Brothers collapsed, at which he stood up in front of 10,000 store managers and appealed for help. “I displayed my own vulnerability and said: ‘Howard Schultz cannot transform Starbucks alone. We’ve let our customers down and we can only do this if all of you know what it means not to embrace mediocrity’.”The waiter appears with a cup of tea for Schultz and some fruit and babka, an east European yeast cake with chocolate, for both of us. “The challenge of the retail business is the human condition,” he says. “We’re only as good as the moment, that fragile moment when we please or hopefully don’t disappoint the customer.”Schultz’s remedy appears to have worked because Starbucks’ earnings and its shares are rising, and it is again rolling out stores. He has just returned from visiting China (Starbucks has 400 stores in mainland China) and Kuwait. “We are back growing again, but I would say not in the same somewhat reckless way.”His lasting achievement may not be individuality but convergence. He talks happily of visiting Kuwait, which is a long way from Brooklyn. “The physical environment and coffee bring people together, like the British pub 30 years ago. I walked into one store and it was packed. The people were dressed differently but they were doing the same thing as they do here. It’s about humanity.”Preparing to wind up, I ask him why he does not relax. His stake in Starbucks is worth $540m and he has achieved everything he could have imagined as a boy in Brooklyn, yet he is still nervy and driven, seeking not only growth but also approval. As he ponders this, the waiter arrives with the bill and a family at the next table say hello. Finally, he returns to the question.“Let me try to answer. I think my whole life, because of where I came from, I had a fear of failure. Sitting in front of you now at the age of 57, and having achieved what most people might think is the American Dream, I still have it. That’s what drives me. I can’t answer the question intellectually, I just feel it.” He grins as if mystified by his own nature. “But it’s honest.”…………………………………………..Barney Greengrass541 Amsterdam Avenue, New YorkWhitefish salad $12.00Pickled herring $9.00Nova Scotia salmon scrambled with eggs and onions $14.00Sturgeon and Nova Scotia salmon scrambled with eggs and onions $17.75Tea and soft drinks $11.50Total (including tax) $70.20…………………………………………..John Gapper on the second comings of chief executivesHoward Schultz’s return to run Starbucks as chief executive three years ago puts him alongside other entrepreneurs who have handed over power to a professionally trained manager after launching their companies, only to be disappointed by the result.The best-known and most successful example of recent business history is Steve Jobs, who was pushed out of Apple in 1985 by John Sculley, whom he had himself recruited from PepsiCo. Jobs eventually returned to the helm in 1997 as “interim CEO” and started Apple’s spectacular revival, culminating in the business becoming the second most valuable US company.Other company founders have not done so well. Jerry Yang, one of the co-founders of Yahoo, returned as chief executive after stepping back to become “Chief Yahoo” and handing over power to Terry Semel. He took back the lead role at the troubled company in 2007 but failed to solve its problems and stepped down again in 2009.Michael Dell pioneered the direct selling model in the personal computer industry and then stepped down as chief executive in 2004, ceding day-to-day power to Kevin Rollins. Three years later, he took back the job but has since struggled to restore Dell’s earlier lustre.The phenomenon of the founder’s return is particularly common in the technology industry because so many founders of large companies are still alive and young enough to take back power. They also tend to have a large enough stake in their enterprises to impose their will.However, it also occurs sometimes in other industries. A notable example in the financial services sector was Charles Schwab, a pioneer of discount retail stockbroking in the US who ousted David Pottruck as chief executive in 2004 after his eponymous company strayed from its roots.Strictly speaking, Schultz was not the founder of Starbucks – it was launched 40 years ago this month by Jerry Baldwin, Gordon Bowker and Zev Siegl – but it was Schultz who transformed it from being mainly a chain of stores selling coffee beans into a coffee bar business after buying it from the founders in 1987.Schultz argues that many companies go through the same phase as they grow of “bringing in professional management to manage what we’d built …[Then] the entrepreneurs and the creative people are subordinated by the MBAs.” That was what prompted not only his return but those of many others.John Gapper is chief business commentator of the FT
603;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Greggs joins coffee wars;High street baker to take on coffee giantoperators;Greggs, the high street baker, is to take on coffee operators including Starbucks by offering cut-price lattes and cappuccinos across its 1,480-store estate by the year end.The retailer, which reported annual results on Tuesday, is targeting 80 store openings this year and hopes that increasing its share of the hot drinks market will drive growth.Greggs sold 28m cups of tea and coffee in 2010, a 28 per cent annual rise. Priced at up to 40 per cent less per cup than other high street coffee brands, the company hopes to tempt cash-strapped consumers to trade down, installing coffee machines in 400 stores.“With 6m customers coming into our stores every week, the growth opportunity is significant,” said Ken McMeikan, chief executive. “We have made sure the type of coffee we’re offering is freshly ground, fair trade and outstanding value.”Greggs set out to take a bigger share of the breakfast market in 2010, and revealed on Wednesday it had sold 10m breakfast rolls and 300,000 pots of porridge in the period.The gross margin rose 50 basis points, despite food price inflation, but the company said it continued to see “significant upward pressure” on costs.Mr McMeikan said passing on price increases to Greggs’ value-driven customers would be a “last resort”, adding that any price rises would boil down to “pennies here and there on different products”.The company is targeting “marginally positive” like-for-like sales growth in 2011, reporting that sales for the first 10 weeks of trading were up 0.4 per cent on a like-for-like basis.“Greggs is well positioned to drive growth through new stores in non-conventional locations such as airports, business parks and university campuses,” said Sanjay Vidyarthi, retail analyst at Espírito Santo. “It is a highly cash-generative business with a rock-solid track record.”Full-year pre-tax profits rose 7.6 per cent to £52.5m on sales of £662m, boosted by the opening of 68 new stores. On a same-store basis, sales rose 0.2 per cent. Earnings per share were 37.8p (34.1p).The total dividend of 18.2p marks the 26th year of pay-out growth and the shares are yielding nearly 4 per cent at Wednesday’s close of 466.3p. The rating of 12 times forward earnings estimates is a notch above the sector average, but Greggs’ defensive business model stems from the fact that it makes 90 per cent of what it sells, a key ingredient in managing cost inflation. UK-only growth stories seem a risky bet, but Greggs’ march into new markets and the promise of more cost-cutting means its shares are good value.
604;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-03-16T18:24:16Z;India’s youth savour fast-food chains;;It is lunchtime and the McDonald’s at Mumbai’s Phoenix Mills – a textile factory turned upmarket shopping complex – is slowly filling up with college students, mothers and office workers.Among them is Akshaya Batta, 30, who grabs lunch at McDonald’s or Subway, at least once a week, rather than carry a packed lunch from home, as many Indians still routinely do. “This is like a snack to fill your tummy, not to satisfy your tastes,” says the marketing executive, as he tucks into a Fillet-O-Fish, fries and a Coke. “I don’t have a desk job – I can’t move around with a tiffin [lunchbox], so whenever I’m hungry and I see a McDonald’s, I stop.”When western fast-food chains such as McDonald’s, Domino’s Pizza and KFC initially opened their doors in India in the mid-1990s, they struggled to compete with spicy street food and the elaborate home-cooked meals Indian women regularly prepared for their families.But more hectic schedules, rising incomes and demographic realities – about 60 per cent of Indians are under 30 years old – have created new appetites among Indian consumers.Now, sales at western fast-food chains, and local rivals, are taking off, growing at an average of 28 per cent a year, as dining out moves from being a special occasion, to a routine part of Indians’ busier schedules.Indians spent an estimated $1.3bn on dining out in “chain restaurants” in 2009, of which about 400m was accounted for by fast food, according to research group Euromonitor.It is not just India’s biggest urban agglomerations, but smaller, second-tier cities where such restaurants are finding growing favour.“Whatever a guy anywhere in the world wants, a guy in India wants that as well,” said Amit Jatia, vice-chairman of McDonald’s India – south and west. “The consumer is beginning to recognise that quick-service restaurants mean quality and value for money.”Domino’s Pizza is growing at a blistering pace, with 364 outlets in 55 cities, all run by Domino’s Indian franchisee, Jubilant Foodworks, in New Delhi.Jubilant, which raised $71m in an initial public offering last year, increased sales by 61 per cent from April to December, compared to the previous year, buoyed by 54 new stores opened in the period.“The Indian market has been growing and evolving at a very fast pace,” says Hari Bhartia, Jubilant Foodworks co-chairman.Last month, US-based Dunkin’ Donuts, owned by the private equity firms Carlyle Group, Thomas H. Lee and Bain, announced a partnership with Jubilant to bring its deep-fried products to India.Subway is also gaining popularity in India, with 199 outlets, and Starbucks is gearing up for an Indian market launch this year.Hardcastle Restaurants, one of two Indian partners to McDonald’s, is buying out the US hamburger chain’s stake in the 50-50 joint venture that operates the chain in southern and western India, paving the way for accelerated expansion. Hardcastle aims to open 30 McDonald’s outlets this year. “It’s getting competitive,” said Mr Jatia.Western fast-food brands have gone through a tough learning process to cater to Indian tastes.Traditional menus were spiced up, vegetarian options enhanced, and low price, entry-level items developed to make the restaurants more accessible in a highly price-sensitive market.Such efforts have won the loyalties of consumers such as Sahal Amlani, 30, a store manager, who spends at least Rs50 ($1.10) on an afternoon snack at McDonald’s twice a week, and treats his wife, and one-year-old son to a McDonald’s meal, spending up to Rs300, every weekend.“My child likes French fries so much, and even my wife has a desire to go out and have some junk food,” he says.While fast-food chains have finally adapted their recipes to local tastes, they face other trials.Finding suitable real estate in crowded Indian cities is difficult. “Real estate is the single biggest challenge,” said Mr Jatia.Indian rivals also pose stiff competition. Café Coffee Day, a coffee chain based in Bangalore, has around 1,000 outlets, and a range of food offerings.Near McDonald’s at Phoenix Mills, cheery food stalls like Dosa Hut, On a Roll, Thai Chi, do brisk business serving up Indian and Asian dishes – which for many Indians are still more appealing than spiced up versions of Western fare.“Indian food is far safer and healthier if you eat on the street,” says Charu Gargi, 48, a film-maker, as she tucked into a south Indian lunch with friends.“They make it fresh, and I don’t want to have so many preservatives.”

But how do you make sure that the first meal of the day really works for you?Why breakfast?“Breakfast is far more time efficient than lunch,” says Robin Jay, author of The Art of the Business Lunch. “It is very finite and there’s a cut-off point. If you have to be in the office at 9:30, then you have to leave at 9. You don’t need an exit strategy.” However, she adds: “It is still much more than just a business meeting. You break bread together and that sharing is very important.”Furthermore, while people sometimes feel guilty about lunching, they may actually feel virtuous about a business breakfast.Are there any points of etiquette?As breakfast is less formal, it can make for a good introductory meeting. If you are struggling to get into someone’s diary for lunch, you might try breakfast instead. Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology at Lancaster University, says that people who view lunch as a hassle often see a breakfast as “rather good fun”.Because of the time constraints, punctuality is very important. “Be a few minutes early,” advises Carole Stone, founder of the TheStoneClub networking organisation. “Don’t faff around, get the pleasantries over quickly and get down to business.”If it is a larger breakfast with a speaker, ensure the table is cleared before they start. Being surrounded by half-eaten fried eggs can be off-putting.What about the location and food?Breakfast is considerably less formal than lunch, which means you have more leeway with venues. For instance, you might not have lunch in a Starbucks but for breakfast it would be fine. Indeed, if you have the facilities, your own office is a perfectly good place to have breakfast – and from the perspective of advancing your career, it will help if your boss catches you in the act.Nonetheless, if you are choosing a restaurant, Ms Stone says you should select somewhere friendly and efficient: “You don’t want a place that’s too fussy and formal where the service is time consuming.”Because breakfast has become quite a networking opportunity, she adds, popular breakfast restaurants such as the Wolseley in London can be a good option, too.On the food front, breakfast menus have far fewer pitfalls than lunch menus do. “I’d suggest something simple like scrambled eggs and bacon and toast,” says Ms Stone. “If you’re arranging it, you’d want to serve fruit and croissants, too. Most people don’t want a heavy meal like a full English breakfast.”When doesn’t breakfast work?“If you have a serious problem to discuss, breakfast probably isn’t the right place as it means starting off your day on an unpleasant note,” says Prof Cooper.He adds that you can also have too much of a good thing. “Although I think working breakfasts are great, if you do them all the time, particularly if you’re a parent, they can have work-life balance implications. You need to have family breakfasts too.”And Ms Jay says that if you have a lot of business to discuss, lunch may still be preferable: “A classic power lunch still needs to be a lunch.”

607;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-03-11T22:48:56Z;Wall Street rebounds from sharp losses;;Following the devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit north-east Japan, the strongest in 140 years, the US’s KBW property and casualty index fell 0.7 per cent, even as the broader market saw gains.Insurance analysts said that losses to private insurers would be limited, in part because Japan maintains a government quake insurance fund. The KBW index recovered from an earlier 2.2 per cent tumble.“The initial take on today’s event, centred about 180 miles from Tokyo, is that it likely is less severe in terms of industry losses,” said Brian Meredith, analyst at UBS.Aspen Insurance Holding, which has exposure to Japanese quakes, fell 4.2 per cent to $27.59. Platinum Underwriters fell 4.6 per cent to $37.83. ACE Ltd, which recently purchased protection to limit earthquake losses, was up 0.5 per cent to $61.37.However, US refineries and steelmakers were seeing sharp gains as the price of oil fell further, partly on expectations that consumption in Japan would fall.Tesoro, the petrol refiner, led the S&P 500 risers, gaining 8.5 per cent to $24.51. AK Steel rose 5.7 per cent to $15.46. US crude oil dipped below $100 a barrel at one point.“There could be some rebuilding in Japan to offset weaknesses coming out of China,” said Steve Coker, portfolio manager at Frost Investment Advisors. “But now that oil’s coming off, there are higher expectations for steel and commodity names.”Energy, up 1.6 per cent, and materials, up 1.3 per cent, led the broader market higher on Friday.The S&P 500 index was up 0.7 per cent, to 1,304.25. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent to 12,043.94.Retail sales, which account for about 70 per cent of US economic activity, helped the closely watched Philadelphia Semiconductor index bounce back. The index was up 0.6 per cent, recovering from a 5.5 per cent drop in the previous two sessions after analysts at Goldman Sachs downgraded the sector earlier this week. As measured by the US commerce department, February sales of $387.1bn were the highest in four months.The index’s move was led by National Semiconductor, which gained 3.8 per cent to $14.70, along with Micron Technology, which rose 3.2 per cent to $10.24. Nvidia rose 0.7 per cent to $18.05.Hewlett-Packard, the PC maker, was up 0.6 per cent to $41.73 after hitting its lowest point of the year on Thursday. Apple rose 1.6 per cent to $351.99.There are still concerns, however, that sales will be weak, especially with a flood of “tablet” PCs, such as the iPad and Xoom, entering the market.“Tablets … are a delaying factor in notebook purchasing decisions in developed markets,” said analysts at JPMorgan Chase.Verizon, which provides WiFi to tablets, fell 1.5 per cent to $35.85. Technology was still the biggest loser for the week, with the Nasdaq Composite index falling 2.5 per cent. It was the worst week for the index since last August.JDS Uniphase, which makes fibre optic connections for large telecoms companies, slid 22 per cent to $21.26. Technology groups have overtaken financials as the largest sector in the S&P 500. Finisar lost 46 per cent to $23.21, after it warned that the next quarter would see a sharp drop in activity in China.For the week, the Dow was down 1 per cent, and the S&P 500 fell 1.3 per cent. Losses were led by energy stocks, which fell 4 per cent as oil prices eased.Analysts said the market had been at a tipping point in the past week, with each of the major indices falling below their 50-day moving averages at one point.“We’ve had three weeks in consolidation, as the market was coiling to do something, spurred by geopolitical risks,” said Bernard McDevitt, director of trading at Cheevers & Company. “That is looking like it will resolve itself to the downside.”On Friday, RC2, a toymaker that makes Thomas the Tank Engine models, saw its shares rocket 11 per cent to $28.31 after Tomy, the Japanese group, said it would pay $640m to acquire it.Warner Chilcott, the drugmaker, rose 2.6 per cent to $23 after it announced a secondary offering, a further exit for the private equity group that had taken the company private.
608;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;The top FT stories read by the legal world in the coronavirus lockdown;Professionals are hungry for reporting on how peers are responding to the crisis;How is the legal sector responding to the coronavirus crisis? Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
609;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Race against time in Rio;;With only one of the eight immigration desks open during peak arrival time, landing at Rio de Janeiro’s busy international airport is the opposite of efficient – but a stark introduction to the pace of life in southern Brazil.Even though my next four days were jammed with meetings, five hours of my meagre discretionary time was spent getting from the airport to the hotel. That left one free afternoon for shopping. A sympathetic concierge at the Fasano Hotel in Ipanema and an unemployed-city-planner-turned-cab-driver promised me I could make it count.Shopping Leblon, a giant mall, was my first stop. While standing in line at Starbucks ordering an Americano to fuel up (embarrassing but true), I did some window shopping at Schutz, a shoe store. It makes three shades of tan-matching nude and I now own two pairs of open-toe platform courts (US$250 leather and $280 patent) perfectly matched to my un-tanned skin.Most of the clothing stores at Shopping Leblon are arranged illogically, perhaps to inspire a leisurely stroll. Cris Zveiter is a tiny sliver of a shop based on one woman’s designs where I found a black, three-quarter-sleeved modal mini dress with a drawstring cinched empire waist ($120). I felt a little cocky fitting into an extra small but was humbled when I realised the sizing was generous.I initially walked past Le Lis Blanc Deux because I could not figure out what it had for sale but the people inside were beautiful, so I decided to explore and zeroed in on a pair of open-toe stiletto booties ($350).Much easier to understand was a youthful store called Oh, Boy!, which felt like a clothier to a girl’s rock band. The staff didn’t flinch at my (ahem) age and quickly identified some perfect pieces (no, not the silver hot pants in the window), including a long-sleeved grey and black striped cotton-Spandex T-shirt ($45). The second item was a hip-length grey T-shirt dotted by tiny black metallic skulls ($50).On the first floor is Cantao – a small gypsy-nomad boutique. All items in my size were sold out – even the killer $300 purple fade to gold plaid ombre jumpsuit. On the flight home, I wore the $275 black cotton jumpsuit with neon galactic print that was coincidentally hanging in my changing room.Fashion Mall is a short drive away (minutes unless you hit rush hour) in Gávea. It has an airy atrium setting book-ended by a terrific Italian restaurant at one end and a McDonald’s at the other. The stores are upscale and most will not let you in if you are holding French fries and a large Diet Coke, just a warning to those of you that like to multi-task.Farm Rio is a local line designed clearly with the carioca in mind – colourful and tiny. Most pieces range from $200-$350, including a surprisingly demure $325 red and black poplin shift dotted with turquoise butterflies and cinched via a self-tie waist.Much more subtle is a store for the ladies who lunch called Sacada (not Escada), where I tried on a black, round-neck modal jumpsuit with gold and black obi belt and batwing sleeves ($358). Somehow the combination of different styles didn’t work for my body type, so I moved on to Mara Mac (not Max Mara), where I bought two white cotton poplin button-down blouses (each about $250).With time for just one more store, I made it to Osklen, a hip Brazilian favourite with branches in New York, Tokyo and Rome. Their clothes are typically sporty, loose-fitting, and casual but this season’s trousers (shorts, capris, long) were even more so with a harem style and extra-low slung crotches. I considered a black bias cut chambray dress with a wraparound feel and self tie-belt ($350) but the fabric and construction around the waist and hips added bulk and made my curvy figure look a little bit too square.Or maybe it was the French fries?www.shoppingleblon.comwww.scfashionmall.com.brThe Mystery Shopper is a globe-trotting executive who reveals her international shopping discoveries
610;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-03-10T21:43:33Z;Tech stocks drag down Wall St;;A pull-back in technology shares matched a broad decline in US stocks as confidence in the economy was hit by troubling data.The Nasdaq Composite index, weighted towards tech groups, dropped 1.8 per cent to 2,701.02, below its 50-day moving average, a key technical marker.Especially troubling was a report from China that Hewlett-Packard, the personal computer maker, was considering spinning off its PC business.HP said the unit was not for sale, and many analysts discounted the likelihood of such a move.But HP shares were off 1.4 per cent to $41.48, their lowest level of the year. Rival Dell was off 1.2 per cent to $15.24.The moves followed a report from analysts at JPMorgan Chase on Wednesday that supply of “tablet” PCs, like Apple’s iPad and Motorola’s Xoom, could outstrip demand by 36 per cent. Shares in Apple were off 1.7 per cent to $346.67.The Philadelphia Semiconductor index was down 2.5 per cent, adding to its 3 per cent drop on Wednesday, to below its own 50-day moving average.“Semiconductors are the best indicator, because they go into everything, from toasters to aeroplanes,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of US equity trading at Canaccord Adams. “The shares always top out first and bottom out first.”Micron Technologies fell 3.8 per cent to $9.93 a share and NXP Semiconductor was down 4.6 per cent to $26.51 a share.NetApp, a provider of data storage, fell 6.1 per cent to $48.41 after it sold its external data storage unit to LSI, a rival. LSI rose 3.1 per cent to $6.32.The broader S&P 500 index was 1.9 per cent lower at the close, at 1,295.11. The Dow Jones Industrial average was also off 1.9 per cent to 11,984.61. Both were, like the Nasdaq index, below their 50-day moving averages.A negative jobless claims report was received as evidence emerged that rising oil prices were a threat to the economic recovery. The US labour department reported that 397,000 people filed unemployment claims last week, against a consensus forecast of 378,000.Trade data were also troubling. China reported a $7.3bn deficit as its exports, a key measure of global economic activity, declined. Meanwhile, the US trade deficit, widened to its highest level in five months in January. “To the extent that this surge reflects the strength of domestic demand . . . it isn’t necessarily a disaster,” said Paul Ashworth, economist at Capital Economics.“Nevertheless, it is a concern, particularly when we know that the latest surge in the cost of imported oil will drive the deficit above $50bn over the next few months.”Energy shares pulled back as US oil prices fell, though they remained above $100 a barrel.The S&P 500 sector fell 3.6 per cent, its worst one-day decline since last June. Chevron, the oil group, fell 3 per cent to $99.08, and rival ExxonMobil fell 3.6 per cent to $81.38.Materials and industrials groups were also hit hard. Caterpillar, the producer of industrial equipment, fell 3.9 per cent to $98.39 a share. Alcoa, the aluminium group, lost 3.1 per cent to $15.80.Shares in General Motors, the US carmaker, fell 2.6 per cent to $31.42 after it said that Chris Liddell, chief financial officer, was leaving the company.“Now [GM has] talented people in all the right spots but they don’t seem to want to hang around,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx Group. He said it was reassuring when Dan Ammann, the incoming CFO, said he planned to stay indefinitely.HCA, the hospital group that went public in a $3.8bn deal on Wednesday night, opened at $31.02, a 3.4 per cent rise from its issuing price of $30 a share.Starbucks, the coffee and beverage retailer, was the top gainer in the S&P 500, hitting an all-time high.Shares were up 9.9 per cent to $37.97 after it made a deal with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, makers of the Keurig single-cup serving system, to allow it to use Starbucks brands. Shares in Green Mountain soared 41 per cent to $61.71 a share following the deal, a record high.Iron Mountain, which handles data storage for companies, saw its shares jump 5.2 per cent to $27.66 after Elliott Management, a hedge fund, nominated four members to the board.Elliott has argued that Iron Mountain could unlock value if it spun off its warehouses used for storing documents into a separate property company.
611;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-03-10T17:20:45Z;Starbucks expands single-cup push;;Starbucks said on Thursday that it will join forces with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters to distribute its coffee and tea products in single-serve pods, widening its push to sell beverages outside of its stores.The move will allow people to brew Starbucks coffee in Green Mountain’s popular Keurig single-cup brewing systems. The pods will be available at supermarkets, drug stores and wholesale clubs across the US and Canada later this year.Howard Schultz, Starbucks’ chief executive, said that the deal was a “win” because 80 per cent of the company’s customers do not yet own a Keurig brewing system and that it would allow more people to drink Starbucks products at home.Last year, single-cup coffee sales totalled $2bn globally and Starbucks has made its own push with Via instant coffee packets, which it plans to start selling in China. Analysts at Cannacord Genuity said that more than 5m Keurigs are being installed every year and that a partnership with Green Mountain could allow Starbucks to expand its range of beverages.Green Mountain’s share price surged by nearly 31 per cent to $57.11 in midday trading in New York on Thursday and in the last 12 months, its stock has climbed by 85 per cent. Shares of Starbucks rose by 7.8 per cent to $37.24.“This relationship is yet another example of GMCR’s strategy of aligning with the strongest coffee brands to support a range of consumer choice and taste profiles in our innovative Keurig Single-Cup Brewing system,” Lawrence Blanford, Green Mountain’s chief executive said.The Keurig has been driving Green Mountain’s sales, which in its latest quarter rose by 67 per cent to $575m. Last month, the company struck a similar agreement with Dunkin Donuts, a Starbucks rival, to make its coffee available through the Keurig.The terms of the Starbucks deal were not disclosed. It comes less than two weeks after Starbucks ended its distribution arrangement with Kraft, which sold Starbucks coffee through grocery stores and in single-serve discs for its Tassimo brewing system.

US same-store sales rose by a more modest 2.7 per cent.“McDonald’s commitment to connecting with customers around the world continues to drive our sales performance,” Jim Skinner, McDonald’s chief executive, said in a statement.On Monday, Subway, the US sandwich shop chain, overtook McDonald’s as the world’s largest restaurant chain by units, with 34,225 in 95 countries. McDonald’s had 32,737 at the end of last year.The company said on Tuesday it is committed to expanding its McCafé options in the US to make the chain a “beverage” destination and that there has been strong appetite for its healthier options such as oatmeal.McDonald’s is also becoming increasingly competitive with Starbucks, as it has improved its coffee and drinks offerings and invested in modernising its restaurants.In January the company said that rising commodity prices could compel McDonald’s to raise prices in 2011.European sales were fuelled by a premium beef campaign in France and the launch of the “Big Tasty” promotion in the UK. Japan and Australia led sales in Asia, which were held back by slower sales in China due to the Chinese New Year holiday.Shares of McDonald’s slipped by 0.17 per cent to $76.16 in pre-market trading in New York.

But the wider markets endured another day of losses due to the ever-growing turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East.Howard Schultz, Starbucks CEO, said he expected the coffee chain to make “a number of acquisitions” as part of its expansion into the single-cup, home-brewing market.“We are building and investing in resources and people to build a significant consumer products business that over time will rival the size and scale of our retail company,” Mr Schultz told the Wall Street Journal.Morgan Stanley also upgraded the coffee chain to “overweight” from “equal weight” with a $40 price target, saying it was optimistic about the company’s plans to enter the “rapidly growing $3bn global single-serve coffee market”. Shares in Starbucks were up 1.5 per cent to $33.60, one of the biggest gains on the S&P 500.Elsewhere in the sector, McDonald’s was up 0.3 per cent to $76.29. The S&P restaurant and bar index was up 0.4 per cent, one of the few sectors to rise in the session.The S&P 500 closed down 0.8 per cent to 1,310.13, adding to the 0.7 per cent loss in the previous session, as Libya lurched further towards civil war, causing oil and gold prices to spike higher for another day.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.7 per cent to 12,090.03 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.4 per cent to 2,745.63 in the sessionThe S&P 500 index is now off 2.5 per cent from its mid-February high on fears that sustained high oil prices will hamper economic growth. “The recent surge in oil prices poses a threat to the US expansion,” said analysts at Morgan Stanley in a report.These fears over the economic recovery hit the materials sector particularly hard. Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s largest copper miner by market capitalisation, was down 3 per cent to $50.14 while Cliff Natural Resources was down 3.4 per cent to $95.77. The S&P materials index was 1.8 per cent lower, the worst performing sector in the session.Industrial stocks also saw sharp losses for the same reasons. Boeing, the aerospace and defence company, was 1.3 per cent lower to $70.88 while Joy Global, which manufactures mining equipment, fell 2.9 per cent to $93.82. The S&P industrial index was down 0.8 per cent.The Vix volatility index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, was up 8.1 per cent. The index is now up 31.4 per cent since its mid-February lows before the markets began reacting strongly to the global political tensions.Semiconductor stocks were some of the worse performing after Wells Fargo cut its view of the sector to “market weight” from “overweight” for the first time in more than two yearsThis left the Philadelphia Semiconductor index down 3.1 per cent as Micron Technology fell 5.2 per cent to $11.03 and Nvidia lost 1.4 per cent to $20.47.The technology sector was down 1.2 per cent despite deal activity elsewhere in the sector. Western Digital, the hard drive maker, announced a deal to buy Japanese rival Hitachi’s hard disk drive business for $4.3bn in cash and stock. The news sent shares in Western Digital up 16.2 per cent to $34.87.Accuray, the medical equipment maker, said it would buy TomoTherapy, a radiation treatment company for about $277m, or $4.80 a share in cash and stock. TomoTherapy was up 24.5 per cent to $4.57 while Accuray fell 10.1 per cent to $9.Shares in OCZ Technology Group were up 15.4 per cent to $9.12 after the company announced that it expected to report record fourth-quarter revenue.

Since March 6 2009, when the S&P reached an intraday low of 666.79, the market has almost doubled.Since then, financials have added 169 per cent, consumer discretionary stocks are up 148 and industrials have added 143 per cent. One of the biggest gainers has been Netflix, which has gained 452 per cent to $207.40.
614;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-03-04T19:31:57Z;A fate written in the stores;Reflections on the death of Borders books;"Borders became one of the hottest corporate chains of the 1990s because it didn’t do things by halves. Its bookstores were of an unheard-of size and sophistication. They stretched not just from coast to coast but around the world. Since it filed for US bankruptcy protection in mid-February, it has shown the same thoroughness in dismantling its empire that it did in building it. The Borders bookstore down the block from my Washington office, where I have browsed almost weekly for the past decade and a half, looks gutted, sacked. At least 200 of Borders’ 642 stores are to close. Those that remain will continue the chain’s drift away from books, and towards cat calendars and stationery. After four straight years of losses, Borders has liabilities of more than $1bn. It owes tens of millions each to publishers Penguin USA, Hachette and Simon & Schuster. Its stock, which peaked at $37 in June 1998, traded this week for 23 cents a share. Borders is set to shrink, merge or die.The demise of Borders is not just the loss of a good place to browse. It is a comeuppance. When its outlets began popping up in shopping malls in the early 1990s, many observers warned that Borders was wiping out independent sellers. Others – myself included – argued that Borders’ virtues more than compensated for the losses. These were matters of scale. The average Borders at the time had 100,000 titles, and some had as many as 175,000. It carried academic titles, foreign language novels and more (and better chosen) poetry than most poetry bookshops. In almost every case where a Borders opened in a US city, it offered a larger selection than all the area’s existing bookshops combined. Borders was bringing world-class culture to second-tier cities. Residents of Albuquerque had access to books once rarely seen outside of New York and Cambridge, Massachusetts.We tend to romanticise independent bookstores and their solicitous proprietors. A small-town teenager buying The Grapes of Wrath might get to hear from the owner how it thrilled him when he first read it and learn of others in town who love Steinbeck. This is indeed great. A literary culture gets built that way. But impersonality has its place too. A teenager looking for an anthology of gay short stories or The Communist Manifesto might not be so eager to chat. And the impersonality Borders offered was not soulless. Founded at the University of Michigan in 1971, it kept the “flavour” of an independent bookstore. Its cashiers were knowledgeable, drawn, perhaps, from the inexhaustible ranks of unemployable graduate students. It was rumoured that Borders required them to pass a literary examination.You could drink espresso there. Borders shared with Starbucks the vanguard role in a movement towards “third places” – neither office nor home – that supposedly provided the ideal atmosphere for creation, contemplation and pleasurable productivity. But as at Starbucks, which has gone in the past decade from cool café to overpriced milkshake outlet, things changed. Borders’ staff grew less savvy, even as the chain became a “player” in corporate bookselling. Borders went from being a place that celebrated books to a place that warehoused them. Now that we may be heading towards a world with neither independent bookstores nor Borders, those of us who defended the big chain look like credulous tools of corporate propaganda.Were we? The central question that Borders’ bankruptcy provokes is whether things could have wound up any differently – whether the company was doomed by its own mistakes or by circumstances beyond its control. There is a surprising consensus on what Borders did wrong. It took overlong, expensive leases for its stores. On the eve of the financial crisis, it went deep into debt to buy back stock and drive up its earnings, just as its chief competitor, Barnes and Noble, was paying debt down. Worst of all, it commissioned Amazon.com to handle its internet sales of books and music, cutting itself out of today’s main growth area in publishing. E-books, e-readers, iPads – all that stuff caught Borders by surprise.But Borders, like every mom-and-pop, bricks-and-mortar, non-virtual bookstore, would now be in trouble no matter what it had done. The forces that crippled it are the same ones that killed Tower Records, with the lag accounted for by the surprising fact that music wound up being easier than literature to digitise to customers’ satisfaction. Borders’ rise was computer-based: it was the first bookstore to carry out the digital revolution in inventorying. It could display more books because its software kept precise track of what was selling and how fast. Live by the sword, die by the sword. Borders’ inventorying turned out to be relatively simple to duplicate. Walmart and Target, not to mention Amazon.com, were soon able to match and beat its prices. Tax policies that favoured virtual enterprises over physical ones hurt, too. (In the US as in Australia, Borders’ online competitors did not have to charge sales tax.)The rise of Borders, in its own literary way, had something in common with the credit-stoked, real-estate bubble. Easy money convinced average earners they could afford an extra bedroom or even a country house. Similarly, it convinced literary people in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that they could support a bookstore as big as Foyle’s and a literary market to match that of mid-20th-century London. This couldn’t last; but was beautiful while it did. Over the long reign of printed books, which started with Gutenberg Bibles in the 15th century and may now be drawing to a close, there was probably never a better time to be a book-buyer than in the last decade-and-a-half.The writer is a senior editor at The Weekly Standard"
615;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-02-22T20:31:43Z;Instability hits investment in Haiti;;Political uncertainty and a slow-moving $5.3bn reconstruction effort is hurting Haiti’s ability to attract the private sector investment it craves as it tries to recover from the devastating earthquake in January 2010, according to major donors to the country.Many of the basic functions of the state – from healthcare to sanitation and water – are being carried out by the 7,500 non-governmental organisations still working there since the earthquake that killed an estimated 300,000 people and displaced 1.5m, creating one of the biggest humanitarian emergencies to ever hit the hemisphere.But the aid and lending community is worried about the willingness of the private sector to take over these functions. “Free services such as healthcare, education and water are being provided to hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people,“ said Cinta Pluma, spokesperson for Oxfam in Haiti, which has raised $98m for its three-year response plan. “But while this is saving countless lives, it is also having a negative effect on the small Haitian private companies and individuals who traditionally provide many of these services.”The accusations of fraud that marred the recent elections and the ongoing political uncertainty have led foreign investors to question the ability of the government to maintain stability. “To say that the private sector is rushing into Haiti right now would not be exactly what’s happening,” said Pamela Cox, the World Bank’s vice-president for Latin America and the Caribbean. “I think the problem for Haiti has been that not only did they get hit by the earthquake, they then get hit by a cholera epidemic, they then get hit by another hurricane, so they get hit by these disasters, and then they have a political disaster. None of this encourages people to come and invest.”The World Bank promised $479m in March 2010 and so far has delivered two-thirds of the funds for emergency response and construction, among other projects. As part of that total, it wrote off the $39m of debt Haiti owed. The World Bank’s private sector arm, the IFC, has put $49m of direct investment into Haiti, investing in the cell phone system Digicell alongside money for businesses to maintain jobs in the aftermath of the earthquake.According to a senior official, the World Bank will be pledging a “substantially increased amount” at the beginning of July for the next three years of investment. But the process is made more difficult as the election run-off drags on. “We are not yet in consultations until there is a legitimate government,” said Ms Cox.Another of the major players in the reconstruction is the Inter-American Development Bank, which disbursed more grant money, $177bn, than any other multilateral source in 2010. “What’s really going to change Haiti and make this process different from all the previous ones is [the] development of the private sector, and I think there’s a consensus in that,” said Agustín Aguerre, Haiti manager for the IDB. But he admits that the perception of the country as risky and unruly is damaging the reconstruction effort. “There is a big problem of branding and this is something we will be working with the next government on,” he said. “Of course, it’s difficult to launch an optimistic view today of Haiti as it deals with so many political problems.”Haiti has not traditionally been a lightning rod for investment from around the world, coming in at 161st in the 2011 World Bank ranking of “ease of doing business”. But the IDB says it is working with the ministry of finance to enact measures that could take the country up 50 places in that ranking, for example by improving the time it takes to set up a new firm or get construction permits. “Easy stuff,” added Mr Aguerre.Not everyone thinks it will be so easy. “The Haitian bureaucracy couldn’t be worse than it is,” said Larry Birns, director of the Council of Hemispheric Affairs. “It’s like the ocean that these fish swim in. There are no ingredients for an honest man.”A key worry for foreign investors is poor infrastructure – from the lack of a national power grid to dirt roads. “There are a whole bunch of factors that create an incentive for private sector to invest, and one is clearly infrastructure,” said Paul Weisenfeld, deputy assistant administrator in the US Agency for International Development’s Latin American and Caribbean bureau, which pledged $1bn for the initial emergency relief effort.To compound these barriers to investment, many of the records on land ownership and rights were lost in the disasater. “A very important bottleneck for both reconstruction and investment is land titles,” said Corinne Delechat, Haiti mission chief for the IMF, which disbursed $100m for emergency relief in the aftermath of the earthquake and cancelled the $216m in debt it was owed. “It’s very complicated and there could have been decisions taken by the government early on.”But according to some analysts, the money needed to build a functioning infrastructure, is simply not there. “If you look at estimates made about rebuilding Haiti after the earthquake, they were huge, you know $15bn, even more than that,” said Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington DC. “They haven’t come up with anything like that, even a fraction of that. It’s a small country but it’s still 10m people and so if you don’t clear the rubble, you don’t have roads, you don’t have housing, you don’t have water, you don’t have sanitation, so what kind of economy are you going to get out of that? That’s the real problem.”The only major deal signed so far is with the South Korean textile company Sae-A Trading which invested in a fledgling industrial park that has been set up in the north of Haiti. The company will become the biggest private sector employer in Haiti, promising to create 20,000 jobs. It has been attracted by the favourable conditions of the HELP Act passed by the US, which cut tariffs on imported Haitian garments.Another flagship project, brokered by the Multilateral Investment Fund division of the IDB, is an initiative with Coca-Cola which has created a new soda called “Mango-Tango” to be produced using mangoes from new producers. A similar deal with Starbucks seeks to transform individual farmers into cooperatives and market it as Haitian coffee.Critics have called this the “sweatshops and mangoes” development model. They argue that a better model for development would be one focused on the growth of the agricultural sector. “They need roads, they need irrigation in the countryside, but that’s the other thing these guys won’t do,” said Mr Weisbrot.

The stock was down 0.5 per cent to $45.70.Progress is in the midst of being acquired by rival Duke Energy in a $13.7bn deal that would create the largest power utility in the US. Duke was down 1 per cent to $17.94.The S&P 500 closed up 0.2 per cent to 1,343.01, a gain of 1 per cent over the week, led by oil and gas stocks. On Wednesday, the index reached the point where it had doubled from its recession low.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 12,391.25, up 1 per cent over the week, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9 per cent to 2,833.95, adding 0.9 per cent over the five-day period.Energy stocks saw the strongest gains as oil prices edged higher on political uncertainty in north Africa and the Middle East. Murphy Oil was up 1.7 per cent to $73.88 while Chevron added 1.6 per cent to $98.72. The S&P oil and gas index was up 0.8 per cent.Material stocks gave up ground, however, on news China had raised its reserve ratio requirement by 50 basis points in a further move to combat inflation.Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s biggest copper miner by market capitalisation, was down 4.2 per cent to $52.95 while the S&P basic materials index was 2.4 per cent lower.Traders also had one eye on Europe amid concerns about Portugal’s ability to raise funds in the capital markets, ahead of this weekend’s meeting of G20 finance ministers in Paris.In earnings news, Newpark Resources, a provider of drilling fluids, reported fourth-quarter earnings of 15 cents a share, beating the average analyst estimate of 10 cents, and sending the stock up 4.8 per cent to $6.81.Elsewhere in the wider energy sector, SunPower, the second-largest supplier of solar cells in the US, forecast 2011 earnings of as much as $2.20 a share, far surpassing the $1.74 cents a share estimated by analysts.

The biggest US industrial group by market capitalisation said it was buying the well support arm of John Wood Group, the UK oil services company. GE was up 0.5 per cent to $21.44 over the week.Along with high oil prices amid tensions in the Middle East and north Africa, this helped energy stocks see some of the strongest gains over the week. Among the leaders was Noble, the offshore driller, which was up 8.1 per cent to $42.07 while Schlumberger added 5.1 per cent to $95.04.Elsewhere, NYSE Euronext unveiled formal plans to merge with Deutsche Börse, the main German exchange.NYSE was down 1.4 per cent to $37.79 on the week, however, after investors reacted negatively to the specifics of the deal which will see the German exchange own 60 per cent of the new company and have the majority of directors on the board. NYSE is still up 13 per cent since rumours of merger talks emerged.Sanofi-Aventis, the French pharmaceutical group, finally agreed its deal with Genzyme for $20.1bn in the biggest takeover in the pharmaceutical sector since 2009. This led Genzyme up 3.9 per cent over the week to $75.38.In the retail sector, an investment group made an offer for Family Dollar Stores, sending shares in the discount retailer up 19 per cent to $52.55 over the week.Shares in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, the US market leader in one-cup coffee brewing, lost ground after Starbucks said it was partnering with a rival single-serving coffee company.The stock had jumped more than 40 per cent in the previous two weeks on rumours it was in talks with Starbucks.Analysts at Roth Capital argued, however, that this might all be a negotiation tactic by Starbucks and that there was still a “fair chance” an alliance would be reached. Still, shares in Green Mountain were down 3.8 per cent to $41.81 over the week.A raft of economic data also helped to move the markets higher. The most promising piece of data was from the Philadelphia Fed showing that US manufacturing had risen strongly in February, surging unexpectedly from 19.3 in January to 35.9 in February.However, data also showed that the number of people claiming for unemployment had risen by 10,000 more than expected, to 410,000.In other data, US home construction was strong and consumer price index inflation was higher than expected. The Federal Open Market Committee revised the US gross domestic product outlook up and unemployment down.

This sent the stock up 11.9 per cent to $15.56, a nine-month high.The news buoyed related stocks. Hewlett-Packard was up 2.1 per cent to $48.99 while Apple gained 0.9 per cent to $363.13. The S&P technology sector was up 1 per cent.That helped the S&P 500 close 0.6 per cent higher to 1,336.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5 per cent to 12,288.17 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.8 per cent higher at 2,825.56.The S&P has now doubled since March 9 2009 when the index reached its intra-day nadir of 666.79.Back in the last cyclical low for the S&P in 2002, the index took more than five years to double. This time it took less than two years.In that time, the financial sector has bounced back 175 per cent, the industrial sector has gained 146 per cent while technology stocks have rallied 134.5 per cent.“Back then, we were pricing in Armageddon, whereas right now we are pricing a recovery,” said Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Wealth Management.Also helping to lift sentiment in the markets was a spate of deal activity.Sanofi-Aventis, the French pharmaceutical group, agreed to pay $20.1bn in cash, or $74 a share, for Genzyme in the biggest takeover in the pharmaceutical sector since 2009. Genzyme was up 1.1 per cent to $75.09.Elsewhere, Family Dollar Stores was up 21.1 per cent to $53.25 after Trian, an investment group, made an offer for the discount retailer of $55 to $60 per share, valuing the company at up to $7bn.This is the latest in a series of mergers for Wall Street over the past few weeks. On Monday, General Electric announced an energy acquisition worth $2.8bn. On Tuesday NYSE Euronext, the world’s largest stock exchange by revenue, confirmed a merger with Deutsche Börse, the German exchange.The previous weeks saw Ensco, the UK oil services provider, saying it would buy Pride International for $7.1bn while Danaher, the US conglomerate, agreed to buy Beckman Coulter, a maker of diagnostic equipment, for $6.8bn. Rumours are swirling that Green Mountain Coffee Roasters is in talks with Starbucks over a potential partnership. Green Mountain has gained almost 30 per cent in February to $42.72.Economic news in the session was mixed. Data showed that US home construction had risen 14.6 per cent in January to its highest level since September, in a positive indicator for the downtrodden housing sector. But these numbers were boosted by multi-family homes, a volatile part of the housing market.Separate figures showed that industrial production had unexpectedly fallen 0.1 per cent in January, short of the 0.5 per cent rise expected. But this was mitigated by a rise in manufacturing output, which increased by 0.3 per cent. “More important than the aggregate figure was the report that manufacturing output increased,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Elsewhere, producer price index data showed that wholesale prices in the US had climbed during January to their highest in more than two years, raising possible worries about inflation.Investors were somewhat cheered as minutes from the latest meeting of the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee showed officials more optimistic about the strength of the US economy. The GDP outlook was revised upwards.In earnings news, Abercrombie & Fitch was up 7.6 per cent to $57.46 after reporting that its profit almost doubled in its fiscal fourth quarter. The clothing chain said business had improved in the US and that overseas revenue had continued to grow.Deere, the world’s biggest tractor maker by sales, rose 2.4 per cent to $95.86 after reporting that earnings had more than doubled in the first quarter.Comcast, the largest US cable provider, reported strong fourth-quarter earnings and said it would raise its dividend by 19 per cent and increase is share buy-back programme. This sent its shares up by 4 per cent to $25.13.

After the flurry of activity getting our seven-year-old out of the door, it’s wonderful to listen to records we are working on, artists we’re thinking about working with, and just for fun.Recently, I’ve been playing Paul Simon because we’ve signed him – and I’ve been a fan for ever. He told us he wanted some fresh ideas about making and distributing music, and his record, So Beautiful Or So What, is due out in April.With major artists, labels often employ the old-school major-media “shotgun” approach, where the artist has to do much of the work blasting the word out to the core. Our approach with this recording is to use every channel available, including digital initiatives such as social media and blogs, non-record store retail like Starbucks, and a six-month pre-release campaign.● Sunday night was special for me. I spent it at the Grammys in Los Angeles and our jazz performer Esperanza Spalding, who’s on the Concord label Telarc, walked off with the “best new artist” award.● I bunch my e-mails. Answering them through the day is too distracting. Now, especially with the iPad, it’s easy to knock out a few, and I’m notorious for my 1am e-mails. Artists, executives and managers – so many of them seem to be active at all hours of the night.● Going to Midem music convention in Cannes in January was a chance to meet our overseas distributors and contacts, and learn at first-hand what is happening outside North America. I took part in an “Indie summit” panel on how independent labels can flourish by constantly diversifying.Midem confirmed my view that the main difference between the US and Europe is that the US is much further along in its conversion to digital. It has been a tough road. In Europe, it will be interesting to see if new business models and greater protection for intellectual property make the transition easier.● Attendance at Midem was down, but there was a new energy to it. A lot of tech companies, anyone with a new business model, was there. The main topic was “the cloud” and the new model in which consumers get their music from, say, streaming services instead of owning a track. It caused much excitement and speculation – and renewed discussion once I got back to Beverly Hills.● But before that, I flew straight from Midem to Washington, for a meeting at the White House chaired by vice-president Joe Biden about IP piracy. It was one of those “pinch-me” moments – also present were the attorney-general, the secretary of commerce, the head of immigration and customs enforcement, as well as the CEOs of Verizon, MasterCard, Fox Studios and others.To represent the music industry was flattering, but it was mainly an opportunity to say, “Look, we’ve been hammered for 10 years now by piracy”, and to thank the administration for making this issue a priority.● Concord has grown very quickly, both organically and by acquiring a few significant independent labels. I try to remain involved in all facets of the company, mainly by having a team who understand the differences between the labels as well as what we all have in common.● At some point today, I’ll go to Starbucks. It’s so much more than a coffee retailer – it facilitates connections and has a voice. Those qualities make it very effective in marketing music, for instance by having CDs for sale on the counter. Just like with coffee, it is not just a music retailer, it is a curator for customers, which is so necessary in a world of endless choice.I love ordering a French Press of the Verona coffee and maybe getting complimented for being a coffee purist. Of course, I’m also there to check what’s happening with the CDs on the counter and what’s playing overhead.
619;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-02-14T21:45:42Z;Wall Street edges higher on deal activity;;General Electric’s announcement that it was making an energy acquisition worth $2.8bn lifted oil services stocks and helped the wider markets rise to new 30-month highs.The biggest US industrial group by market capitalisation said it was buying the well support arm of John Wood Group, the UK oil services company.The news sent shares in GE up 0.8 per cent to $21.50 and helped lift oilfield services stocks. Cameron International, which makes oil-and-gas pressure control equipment, was up 4.1 per cent to $58.84 while Schlumberger was up 2.3 per cent to $92.22. The S&P oilfield services sector added 2.1 per cent.The wider energy sector also gained as energy prices ticked up on news that China’s trade surplus had fallen to its lowest level in nine months, indicating strong domestic demand.EOG Resources, a natural gas company, was up 1.6 per cent to $104.90 while Denbury Resources, an oil and gas company, added 5.4 per cent to $22.52. The S&P energy index was up 2.1 per cent.Materials stocks saw strong gains as metal prices also rose. Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, was up 4.9 per cent to $56.14 while Cliffs Natural Resources, an iron ore and coal miner, added 5.9 per cent to $92.67. The S&P materials index was up 1 per cent.This helped the S&P 500 close 0.2 per cent higher to 1,332.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 12,268.19 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3 per cent to 2,817.18.Green Mountain Coffee Roasters was up 6.7 per cent to $46.35 on rumours that it was in talks with Starbucks over a potential partnership. Starbucks was up 0.8 per cent to $33.60.In more concrete deal news, EchoStar, one of the largest satellite television companies in the US, agreed to buy Hughes Communications, a broadband satellite services provider, for about $2bn including assumed debt.Hughes Communications lost 3.7 per cent to $59.47 while EchoStar was up 3.2 per cent to $30.84.Elsewhere Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, the US private equity group, said it was buying Emergency Medical Services at a sharp discount to its current share price. Shares in Emergency Medical Services were down 11 per cent to $62.92 following an offer that, at $64 a share, was a 9.4 per cent discount to Friday’s closing price.The offer price, however, is still 19 per cent above the share price in early December, before EMS said it was looking at strategic alternatives.This string of mergers and acquisition news follows on from heavy deal activity in the previous week. Last Monday, Ensco, the UK oil services provider, said it would buy Pride International for $7.1bn while Danaher, an acquisitive US conglomerate, also agreed to buy Beckman Coulter, a maker of diagnostic equipment, for $6.8bn. NYSE Euronext, the world’s largest stock exchange by revenue, announced last week that it was in advanced merger talks with Deutsche Börse, the main German exchange.Retail stocks lost ground in the session after JPMorgan Chase cut its recommendation on Walmart Stores from “overweight” to “neutral”. The world’s largest retailer by sales was down 1.6 per cent to $54.80.That weighed on related stocks. Macy’s was down 3.1 per cent to $23.87 while Sears fell 2.1 per cent to $89.29. The S&P consumer services index was 0.5 per cent lower.Equities across the S&P 500 index fell slightly after President Barack Obama announced $1,100bn in deficit reductions over a 10-year period in his 2012 budget.Netflix, the video rental and streaming service, was up 7.1 per cent to $247.55 after strong data from Nielsen, the media measurement group.MGM Resorts International was down 3 per cent to $15.07 after reporting lower fourth-quarter earnings at most of its Las Vegas resorts and declining casino revenue.Seahawk Drilling was down 41.1 per cent to $4.65 after announcing late on Friday that it was filing for bankruptcy protection.The company said it would sell its fleet of offshore drilling rigs to Hercules Offshore for $105m. Hercules was up 18 per cent to $4.27.Investors continued to react negatively to news that Nokia had entered into a “broad strategic partnership” with Microsoft. Nokia, which fell 14 per cent on Friday, was down 6 per cent to $8.84 while Microsoft was down 0.1 per cent to $27.23.
620;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-02-13T23:57:28Z;Smartphone wallet a step closer to reality;;"When news leaked that Apple was considering implanting a NFC (near field communication) chip in its next generation of iPhones and iPads, the rumour mill went into overdrive.NFC, a short-range wireless technology that allows data to be swapped between devices, is already included in many handsets and enables some useful tricks, such as mobile phone boarding passes for aircraft and phone-to-phone contact file sharing.But NFC is perhaps best known as the technology of choice for mobile payments. With its limited geographical range, high frequency and good security, many see it as the technology that will make a reality of the dream of the “mobile-phone wallet” – a smartphone that works like a credit card, debit card or even cash.“It could change everything,” gushed the TechCrunch blog. “It could transform Apple from the biggest technology company in the world, to the biggest company in the world, period.”The enthusiasm of the blogosphere reflects the widely shared belief that the mobile payments business is an underdeveloped opportunity to get a share of the trillions of dollars spent every day online and in stores and restaurants, from Beijing to Brussels and Boston. For companies that are able to get even a sliver of this revenue, billions are to be made.“As the line between online and offline blurs, the opportunity goes beyond e-commerce to retail,” says Anuj Nayar, director of global communications at PayPal.As millions adopt smartphones and become more comfortable using them for a growing number of purposes, from finding information on the web, to sending sensitive work documents, to managing their home appliances, paying for goods and services seems a natural next step.Nielsen, the market research company, estimates smartphone penetration in the US will pass 50 per cent this year, and the numbers are growing fast internationally as well.“There’s been a realisation in the industry that the payments world is ripe for innovation, and that it will be disintermediated by the internet,”says Mr Nayar.In recent months, retailers, start-up companies and established technology behemoths have begun experimenting more aggressively with mobile payments. Starbucks, the coffee chain, has begun using QR codes, or 2-D barcodes to enable mobile payments.One of the hottest start-ups in Silicon Valley is Square, which makes a credit card reader for the iPhone and iPad, and was set up by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. Google is reportedly working on its own mobile payments products, and there is the possibility of NFC technology in Apple’s new phones.“We’re probably at least three years away from general access to mobile payments,” says Beth Robertson, director of payments research at Javelin Research.One of the hurdles facing merchants and device makers is finding a common technology protocol to power a mobile payments infrastructure. In addition to NFC, there are Bluetooth technology, and the QR Codes of the sort used by Starbucks.Standardisation aside, PayPal’s evidence on the appetite for mobile payments is compelling. It has several applications for the iPhone, Android phones and BlackBerry that allow users to send and receive money directly into their accounts.In 2008, PayPal’s various mobile applications processed $25m in payments. In 2009, that figure was $141m. Last year, the number grew to $750m, and this year the company expects $1.5bn.Another hurdle to mass adoption will be security and regulation. “Payments is a heavily regulated industry, as it should be,” says Mr Nayar. “Working with the local and international regulations that govern your business is important as you grow.”Many are forging ahead. Bling Nation, based in Silicon Valley, has developed an adhesive NFC chip that turns iPhones into mobile wallets. Its team realises it may be some time before mobile payments are ubiquitous, but is keen to start early.“Your wallet has a lot more things in it than just credit cards and cash; you have pictures of your kids, reward cards and identification,” says Matt Murphy, general manager at Bling Nation. “And your phone never leaves your hands. You have the security of it always being in front of you.”"
621;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-02-11T22:16:21Z;Focus on cloud computing;;"There’s no escaping the relentless discussion on the move to cloud computing and how, by golly, it’s going to save you money! It’s as though the cry of “Show me the money!” from the 1996 movie “Jerry Maguire,” has been replaced by “To the cloud!” But when you ask your techies to explain the concept to you (like that ever works), you can only decipher a few basics: cloud computing is big, it’s everywhere, and it’s almost totally incomprehensible to anyone without a degree in geek-speak.But you do remember that phrase, “It will save you money!” So you tell your best people to go figure it out. You need to know how it will affect your business – especially if it can impact the bottom line.In a series of articles about the business and economic impact of cloud computing, we’ll help you figure it out. We’ll explain why it’s too big to ignore, and whether that statement about saving you money will be true.But first: What the heck is it?Cloud computing means someone else runs the computers and software while you use what they deliver and focus on its value. You can access solutions that are “in the cloud,” like community resources that everyone can use without owning any of them, and everyone pays part of the price, which lowers total outlay for all.Cloud solutions are delivered to you “as a service,” like a cup of coffee from Starbucks down the street. You go in, order, pay and gulp down a cup before 6:30am. Did you stop to think about how much of the coffee maker you used? Or what type of machine it was? Of course not. You don’t have to. What you came in for was a cup of coffee. The timeliness, taste and price dictate whether you will come back, not the equipment used to make the coffee. That’s a service. Everybody uses the same equipment and gets their coffee in the same way.That’s also the principle of cloud computing. Everyone uses the same equipment and software, without owning or maintaining it. This is where the cost savings can come from. You no longer need to own some of your computing equipment, which also means you don’t need staff to maintain it; an external provider can handle all this for you as a service, just like Starbucks manages the coffee-making equipment and the barristers. You get a reduced price through economies of scale.Just as importantly, you are free to focus on the value your organization provides. You can let your people concentrate on doing their jobs, instead of worrying about which new technology needs to be purchased. You can let them evolve your business by selecting the best solution for your organization from a lot of “cloud services” and then pay for it out of operating expenses instead of capital expenses. This provides a lot more choice and flexibility, so that you can measure success on business outcomes, not just cost. And you gain price transparency because you pay only for what you need.Now you’re thinking, “This sounds just like outsourcing! Why all the fuss?”First, ignore all those techies talking about things like infrastructure as a service or software as a service. Instead, imagine the possibility of a company merger where system integration doesn’t hold back business integration because they both use cloud services from the same utility, like the electricity shared in your building. Imagine finally getting an ERP (enterprise resource planning) solution without paying for five-year upgrade cycles and slowing your ability to change your culture, your processes and your people. You can ignore all that and just run your business. Cloud computing allows you to simply buy subscriptions to a billing service, or a check printing service or a programming service. The price is based on what you get out of it and what the market will bear.All of this is enabled by technology, but it’s technology your line-of-business leaders can consume without the strictures of traditional IT. If you want to automate your sales force, you can open your Web browser and sign up this morning at Salesforce.com. If you want to enable your HR department, you can go to WorkDay.com and click “join.” When was the last time either IT or an outsourcer said that? Line-of-business leaders everywhere are bypassing IT departments to get applications from the cloud (also known as software as a service, or SaaS) and paying for them like they would a magazine subscription. And when the service is no longer required, they can cancel that subscription too, with no equipment left unused in the corner.Some technologists are resisting this emerging trend. But others are moving servers, storage, e-mail, collaboration, apps and more to the cloud. Anything can now potentially be done by someone else, but is it all that simple? No. There are risks. Who guarantees service delivery? If the coffee shop shuts down, you miss a cup. If a cloud provider handling your paycheck distribution fails, what then? Who can you trust with your business? You need a guarantee that they won’t give away your data. You need to make sure your provider isn’t a monopoly that’s too big to fail. And you don’t want to pay for so many subscriptions that there is nothing left to capitalize!We’ll address the opportunities and risks of cloud computing in the coming months. We’ll also examine specific aspects from security to economic impact. We’ll talk about internal (private) and external (public) cloud models and examine intermediaries (brokers) who function between your business and the cloud. We will show how this will affect your comfort level for years to come.Cloud computing is big, risky and has already changed your world. You get on-demand movies from it, store your files in it, and you meet friends and future partners (professional and personal) in it. Now, do you dare run your business in the cloud?The more pressing question is: Do you dare not?Daryl Plummer is a Gartner managing vice president and research fellow. This is the first in a series of pieces by him on different aspects of cloud computing."
622;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-02-08T22:50:35Z;Small business confidence lifts Wall Street;;"McDonald’s led gains for US equities as the wider markets edged up on news that small business confidence had risen to its highest level in three years.But disappointing earnings reports from smaller companies and a fall in energy stocks due to an interest rate rise in China pared gains for the session.McDonald’s, the world’s largest burger chain by sales, saw strong gains after reporting same-store sales had unexpectedly risen by 5.3 per cent in January compared with the same period a year earlier. The stock climbed 2.6 per cent to $75.36.The news lifted the restaurant sector. Starbucks was up 2.4 per cent to $33.12 while the S&P consumer services index was up 1.8 per cent to 306.96. This helped Wall Street add to the 2½-year highs reached on Monday.The S&P 500 index closed 0.4 per cent higher to 1,324.57. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 12,233.15 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5 per cent at 2,797.05.Also helping to lift markets was data from the National Federation of Independent Business showing that US small business confidence was at its highest level since December 2007.But the survey also showed that small businesses remained cautious about hiring and the group was far from jubilant about the future prospect for small business.“While recent political rhetoric favours small business, it is belied by the actions of policymakers whose new policies and activities almost exclusively support big businesses,” said Bill Dunkelberg, chief economist at the National Federation of Small Business. “While the economy is moving forward, albeit at a snail’s pace, it is not nearly fast enough to dramatically improve the unemployment situation, which continues to languish.”Also tempering sentiment on Wall Street was some lacklustre earnings news.Principal Financial, the life assurer, released disappointing fourth-quarter results, sending shares down 4.3 per cent to $32.24. The group reported a profit of $199.3m, or 62 cents a share, up 40 per cent from the previous year but short of the 68 cents predicted by analysts.Elsewhere, NYSE Euro-next, the world’s largest stock exchange by revenue, said fourth-quarter net profit had fallen 20 per cent as trading volumes in the US and Europe slowed. This sent shares in the group down 1 per cent to $33.41.The energy sector saw the greatest losses in the session on news that China had raised interest rates in an effort to combat domestic inflation.Schlumberger, the largest oil services group in the world, was down 0.9 per cent to $88.04 while Halliburton lost 2.6 per cent to $44.97.This was the third time that China had raised its benchmark interest rate since October and it sent the S&P energy index down 0.5 per cent to 552.71.The wider markets were not dragged down by the rate rise, however, as many investors saw the move as both expected and even necessary.“The Chinese keeping inflation under control is positive for US equities,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial. “It is only if investors think they are pulling back too hard that equities will really start to react badly.”In deal news, Kindred Healthcare agreed to acquire RehabCare Group in a move the companies said would create the largest US post-acute healthcare services group. The $900m deal sent shares in Kindred Healthcare up 28.3 per cent to $25; RehabCare Group shares climbed 45.5 per cent to $37.05.Herley Industries, a defence contractor, agreed to be acquired by Kratos Defense & Security Solutions for about $270m. This sent shares in Herley up 16.3 per cent to $18.89 while Kratos shares were flat at $14.01.Conexant Systems, the semiconductor maker, jumped 17.9 per cent to $2.47 after saying Golden Gate Private Equity had offered to buy it for $2.35 to $2.45 a share.These deals follow on from a series of bigger deals in the previous session. On Monday, Ensco, the UK oil services provider, said it would buy Pride International for $7.1bn in a move that would create the world’s second-largest offshore driller by number of rigs. Danaher, an acquisitive US conglomerate, also agreed to buy Beckman Coulter, a maker of diagnostic equipment, for $6.8bn."
623;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-01-31T13:59:06Z;The £4,000 Facebook check-in;;"Facebook’s Deals service landed in Europe on Monday, three months after its US launch.It has lined up various promotions in the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain, from brands such as Starbucks, Yo! Sushi and Debenhams, offering freebies and loyalty discounts when people “check in” to their “Place” via Facebook’s mobile app.But the most eye-catching deal was from Mazda, which is offering 20 per cent off its sporty MX-5 at five dealers across the UK. That’s worth around £4,000 off the list price, just for sending a message to the average Facebook user’s 130 friends’ news feeds.Facebook says it’s had more than half of the brands using Deals in the US come back for a second promotion, and the inbound interest was sufficiently large for the European launch that it’s been able to pick and choose the best offers to showcase the service.But is a check-in on a mobile application really worth thousands of pounds?
Local advertising has long been seen as one of the great untapped revenue sources on the web.Google has already done a fantastic job at allowing small businesses to target local shoppers via search and its maps service. With the Android mobile operating system and its recent creation of Places pages, Google is well placed to tap local businesses further. But it hasn’t quite closed the circle between online advertising and offline shopping – no doubt a consideration when it tried to buy Groupon, the daily deals service, for billions of dollars last year.Facebook fielded plenty of questions about what impact Places Deals might have on Groupon. “I don’t think this will kill Groupon,” said Emily White, director of local at Facebook. “We don’t want to kill Groupon, they have been an amazing partner on a number of fronts.”But it was clear from a couple of comments that Facebook really has Google in their sights here.“We used to go to the internet to search for information,” said Joanna Shields, Facebook’s head of Europe, Middle East and Africa. “Today we mostly go to find out what is happening with our friends.”Facebook is hiring plenty of Googlers at the moment, Ms White among them. She wouldn’t comment on how well she felt that her former employer had tackled the local market, except to say that the two companies approach it “from very different angles… search and people”.To me, the difference goes further. Facebook is trying – and to some extent succeeding – to attract marketers to the web that have not previously been big online advertisers. Through Places check-ins and Deals, Facebook is able to connect online and offline marketing activity in way that similar independent services such as Foursquare lack the scale to achieve.For instance, Gabriele Lunati, digital director at Benetton – not a name you see using Google Adwords a lot – told me that the clothing retailer has now realised it has “always been a social brand”.“I think there is a parallelism between ‘the United Colors of Benetton’ and a social network,” he said. “We are going to increase the use of Facebook and other social media platforms. It belongs to a more complex digital strategy for Benetton that we will create this year and next year.”Benetton sees 50,000 check-ins as a successful result for its Deals campaign, which donates €2 to charity for each.“Retailers don’t actually care about eyeballs, they care about the faces in the store. [Deals] really helps connect that,” said Ms White. “Doing deals does drive ‘liking’ of pages. Over time that relationship will become more explicit.”The camera-filled press conference and half-dozen stalls of supporting brands made today the biggest launch of a new Facebook product I’ve seen in Europe to date.“This is a main focus for all of the company, both on the web and mobile,” said Ms White. “We have a saying at Facebook: ‘We are 1 per cent done.’ With this product and everything we are doing, if you let your mind run wild there are amazing things we can do. It will be informed and evolved based on how businesses use it.”One of the aspects yet to be evolved is how Facebook takes its cut. Deals are currently being offered for free to brands, with a self-service system already up and running in the US.“We start by optimising the user experience,” Ms White said. “We don’t want to shut the door on anything. We want to create phenomenal user and brand experience.”Places isn’t worth anything to Facebook yet, but if some brands are prepared to give £4,000 discounts for a single check-in, it could soon be a big deal for the social network too."
624;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-01-27T23:08:37Z;Wall Street weighed down by jobless data;;Soaring profit for Caterpillar lifted industrials but sentiment for US stocks was tempered as other US bellwethers posted weaker results and there was a surprise jump in unemployment claims.The world’s largest maker of earthmoving equipment reported strong fourth-quarter profit as high metal prices sparked greater demand for digging equipment.The heavy machinery manufacturer also forecast that 2011 would be its most profitable year on record.Caterpillar had profit of $968m or $1.47 a share, up from $232m or 36 cents a share from the period a year earlier and ahead of the $1.27 estimated by analysts.Its stock climbed 0.9 per cent to $96.63 while the S&P industrials index added 0.2 per cent to 315.69.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index reached the landmark 1,300-point level three times over the session, a peak last reached in August 2008 before the financial crisis.But the US benchmark failed to maintain the momentum throughout the day, closing just short at 1299.54, a gain of 0.2 per cent on the session.The Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to tip over the 12,000 mark for the second day in a row but again failed to maintain progress, rising less than 0.1 per cent to 11,989.90. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6 per cent to 2,755.28.The indices were weighed on by news that the number of people filing first-time unemployment claims in the US had increased by 51,000 to 454,000 last week.This jump was unexpected with economists forecasting 405,000 claims. The number of continuing claims was also up, rising by 94,000 in the week to 3.99m.Also disappointing the markets were figures showing that durable goods orders had fallen by 2.5 per cent in December, well short of the 1.5 per cent rise in orders forecast by economists.“This is a surprise. We expected a rebound in aircraft orders to lead the way but they dropped by $5bn,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.But some commentators argued that the figures were not as bad as they looked. The jobless claims data were skewed by snow in some southern states last week which prevented people from filing claims and created a backlog.But researchers at Goldman Sachs said: “The durable goods report looked awful at first glance but improves considerably on inspection,” noting that, with transportation figures removed from the durable good orders, the index actually went up by 0.5 per cent.Separate economic data showed that pending home sales was up 2 per cent for December, a positive signal indicating recovery in the US housing market.Sentiment was also supported by confirmation from the US Federal Reserve in the previous session that it would continue with its $600bn bond purchase programme to aid the economy.The consumer goods sector saw some of the strongest losses of the session after two industry bellwethers, Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive, reported disappointing earnings figures.Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer goods maker, reported that second-quarter profit had fallen by 28 per cent and its margins had declined due to higher commodity costs.Sales, however, were up slightly in the quarter and the fall in profit was exaggerated due to one-off gains last year in discontinued operations. But investors took the news negatively with its shares falling 2.9 per cent to $64.18.Colgate-Palmolive, which competes with P&G in toothpaste and other products, was down 3.3 per cent to $77.39 after reporting fourth-quarter earnings down 1.1 per cent due to higher materials costs and lower-than-expected revenue.The S&P consumer staples index was down 0.9 per cent to 302.67.AT&T, the largest US telecommunications group, was down 2.1 per cent to $28.13 in spite of posting earnings in line with expectations. The company reported a decline in the number of new long-term service contracts that it had signed on in the quarter.The S&P telecoms index was 0.9 per cent lower at 126.34.Microsoft reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings of 0.77 cents a share shortly before the markets closed.Shares in the technology giant were up 0.3 per cent to $28.87.Amazon reported better-than-expected earnings per share after the closing bell but also posted worse-than-expected revenue. The online retailer was up 5.2 per cent to $184.45 in anticipation of the results but lost ground in after-hours trading.Netflix, a video streaming and rental service, rose 15.2 per cent to $210.87 after reporting better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings as the number of its subscribers rose 63 per cent.Starbucks reported a 44 per cent increase in first-quarter profit but gave a downbeat forecast for the coming quarter due to rising coffee costs. The stock was down 0.1 per cent to $33.03.DR Horton, the second-biggest US home builder, fell 3.3 per cent to $12.81 after posting a first-quarter loss that was sharper than expected due to weaker home sale revenues.Bristol-Myers Squibb, the biopharmaceutical company, was up 1.6 per cent to $26.35 as investors reacted positively to fourth-quarter earnings.Eli Lilly, another drugmaker, was up 1.5 per cent to $35.47 after reporting fourth-quarter earnings up 28 per cent.Cypress Semiconductor, a semiconductor design and manufacturing company rose 8 per cent to $22.04 after agreeing to sell its image sensor business unit to ON Semiconductor in an all-cash transaction. Shares in ON Semiconductor were up 0.5 per cent to $11.36.
625;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks launches US phone payments;;Starbucks, the US coffee retailer, has launched a smartphone-based payment system at more than 7,800 stores in its home market, marking one of the first nationwide deployments of long-awaited phone-based payment technology in the US.The system is aimed at members of the company’s loyalty card programme who maintain a cash balance on their cards for purchases. They will now be able to use BlackBerry or iPhone smartphones to make payments by presenting a barcode on the phone’s screen to a scanner, instead of the card.Brady Brewer, the head of Starbucks’ loyalty programme, said that one out of five Starbucks transactions were paid for using loyalty cards, which are linked to a rewards programme, and that mobile payment “will extend the way our customers experience and use their card”.The national roll-out of the payment system follows pilots in markets including Seattle, California and New York, and at its outlets in more than 1,000 Target discount stores.The company said its customers loaded more than $1.5bn on to Starbucks loyalty cards in 2010, an increase of 21 per cent over 2009, after it launched its first rewards programme. More than one-third of its US customers use smartphones, of whom nearly three-quarters use BlackBerry smartphone or iPhone mobile devices.Mobile phones have been used to make retail payments in Japan and Korea for several years, using near field communications (NFC) technology, based around a short-range radio-frequency identification tag incorporated into mobile devices. But the technology has yet to establish itself in the US and Europe.Starbucks’ move, based around a unique scannable code delivered by a smartphone app, comes as a variety of payments companies are testing NFC in the US and Europe, amid growing interest from retailers and other merchants.Bling Nation, a California based start-up, is running a pilot payments and loyalty system with a number of merchants and local banks in Silicon Valley that is also in use in the cafeteria of Ebay, the online marketplace that owns the PayPal payment system.Since most US mobile phones are not equipped with NFC tags, Bling Nation is relying on stickers applied to regular mobile phones.Telefónica, the Spanish telecoms company, has said it would use its sponsorship role at the 2012 Olympics in London to promote mass use of NFC in the city, in a partnership with La Caixa, the Spanish bank, and Visa.Visa is also involved in pilots of NFC-equipped phone payments in the New York and Los Angeles public transport systems.

627;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-01-14T22:03:15Z;Tweaks to a logo? A bit of a no-go;Rebranding does often seem to be used as an alternative to fresh thinking;"Like you, I know I’ll always remember where I was the first time I heard about the new Starbucks logo.I remember it like it was last week. I was on a train; no hang on a minute – maybe I was driving. Yes that’s it, I was driving and I heard the news on the radio and was so stunned I had to pull over, where I got talking to another man who was just as shocked. Anyway, we stood there reminiscing about great cups of coffee we’d had and how we’d miss the great logo, even though we’d never really noticed it before. “It’s like a piece of my heritage has been erased,” he said. “I loved that blue square.”No, that can’t be right. Oh wait, wait; that was where I was when I heard about the new Gap logo. I was definitely on a train when I read about Starbucks – or maybe a bus. Ok, I admit it, my world was left pretty much intact by the news that Starbucks’ name and the outer circle of the design were being removed from what I hadn’t previously recognised as the “mermaid” logo.Some people, however, took it less well. These are the thousands of angry people who left furious messages on the Starbucks blog or the company’s Facebook page. (It’s tempting to digress into wondering what sort of person ordinarily reads Starbucks blogs or joins the Facebook fan page, but I’m staying on mission).But these people were very upset: Amanda Austin said the new logo “makes me throw up”. On the blog, LRboyd was “so fired up” he opened an account just to leave an angry comment. Mimi Katz wanted the name of the “bonehead” who came up with the idea. But some were, just as bafflingly, terribly excited. Shelleyjo99 thought it was “bold, brave and beautiful”.Now, I’m not one of those people who thinks all logos and branding are nonsense. It is just something of a struggle to get worked up about it. Rebranding can be valuable to signify a new direction, although it does often seem to be used as an alternative to fresh thinking and can even denote an attempt to retain the status quo by changing the presentation. Nestlé may keep bleating on about how it is now a “health and wellness company” but to most people it is still primarily Kit-Kat, coffee and Smarties.Few can deny the value of a strong logo – the Lloyds black horse; the RBS begging bowl or the Golden Arterial Stents of McDonald’s. But still, this fuss seems overstated. Starbucks’ logo tweak is not exactly Disney dumping Mickey Mouse.But then in a world where people pay to wear other companies’ logos, carry their bags and drink from their branded coffee cups, it is easy to understand why they feel invested in the aesthetic. Perhaps this is why the latest logo-rage (should that be logorhythmia?) seems to go further. It is not just about people’s desire for anchors in a constantly shifting world; it speaks to our every day consumption being an increasing part of our identity. We really are becoming what we drink, eat, wear and watch. I’m a Mac; not a PC. I’m Gap not Brooks Bros; I’m Starbucks not Nescafé.Now, there’s always been a touch of this. People have long defined themselves by the car they drive or the paper they read. But a logo is less tangible. Driving a Ferrari makes you a Ferrari driver; wearing Ferrari aftershave does not. Once upon a time we knew this; we knew that smoking a Marlboro did not make you a cowboy. Wearing Fred Perry certainly did not make me a tennis player. But now it seems too many people have bought in. We are sold on the idea that being a Starbucks guy makes us more like one of the cast of Friends and less like another bloke in an office. It builds out our image.Of course, we aren’t fooling anyone. After all, I may have a MacBook but deep down I know that I’m probably still a PC really. But if you don’t want to know this, the logos are your permission to be the person you’d rather be. And all of a sudden the company goes and changes them and they look naff to you. The illusion is destroyed. And you remember that the coffee was never actually that good in the first place.robert.shrimsley@ft.com"
628;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:22:14+0000;Starbucks joins Tata for India foray;;Starbucks is to enter India – home of some the world’s greatest teas – through an alliance with Tata, the Indian conglomerate, that could see the US-based coffee retailer open its first branded coffee shop in the country within six months.The two sides said they had signed a memorandum of understanding to explore retail opportunities, after Starbucks signed a sourcing and processing deal with Tata Coffee, India’s biggest coffee grower.R K Krishnakumar, chairman of Tata Coffee, said he expected stores to open rapidly. “They have a very aggressive strategy, and within six months you should be able to have a Starbucks coffee in Mumbai that will be exactly like the one you would have in New York or Paris,” he said.Starbucks plans to open standalone outlets in all big cities as well as inside Tata-owned luxury hotels and retail stores, said Mr Krishnakumar.India’s most popular hot drink is masala chai – a strong, sweet, milky tea. But coffee consumption has risen sharply, almost doubling in between 1998 and 2008 from 50,000 metric tonnes in 1998 to 94,400 metric tonnes in 2008, according to India’s Coffee Board.The growing coffee culture is being driven by demand from the country’s emerging middle classes but India’s retail coffee market remains highly fragmented and is dominated by small street-side vendors.Local chains, including Café Coffee Day and Barista account for less than a third of the total domestic market, according to analysts.Cafe Coffee Day has 1,000 coffee shops in more nearly 177 cities and town across India, and has emerged as an extremely popular hangout spot for students, young professionals and even the elderly to meet friends and hang out.With revenues of around $220m, it is planning a double its number of coffee shops over the next three years.Last year, KKR, the New York-based private equity firm, invested $200m in Café Coffee Day’s parent company, Coffee Day Holdings.Starbucks has been eyeing India for several years. Under India’s foreign direct investment regulation, a single-brand retailer is only allowed to control up to 51 per cent of a joint venture with an Indian partner. Both Costa Coffee, the UK chain, and Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf of the US, have recently established themselves in India through local partners.The move into India is part of Starbucks’ efforts to expand internationally after saturating its home market, with particular focus on in emerging markets.Starbucks is also focusing on growth in Russia, where it operates around 50 stores, and Brazil, where it took full control last year of around 20 stores previously run by a joint venture partner. It said in November last year that it plans to triple the number of stores it operates in China, where it has set up more than 400 stores since entering the market in 1998.
629;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2011-01-06T21:02:36Z;Protests brew over Starbucks logo revamp;;"Starbucks, the world’s biggest coffee chain, has triggered a wave of protests from irate coffee drinkers after dropping its name and product from its logo.Reducing its logo to one of the sirens – the creatures in Greek mythology who lured sailors to their death – is “a total waste of time, energy and money” one comment posted on the coffee chain’s website said.Starbucks, noting the name has not been dropped entirely but is simply no longer attached to the logo, sees it differently.In a webcast that suggests the group will endorse a wider range of products, Howard Schultz, chairman and chief executive officer, said: “We’ve allowed [the siren] to come out of the circle in a way that gives us the freedom and flexibility to think beyond coffee.”Starbucks has announced the termination of its US distribution agreement with Kraft Foods, a move that Kraft is disputing in court.In announcing the logo change, Mr Schultz indicated that the new trademark would be appropriate for non-coffee products. The company markets strawberry frappucino ice cream in the US, and wants to expand its presence in the packaged goods business.The new logo, which will appear in stores in March, comes as the company prepares to celebrate its 40th anniversary that month and is part of a broader rebranding which will affect the look and feel of stores and include new formats in the UK. Starbucks says there is no more “one size fits all” for its stores and markets.For example the coming months will see the opening of a narrow “walk-through’ store in London’s Borough High Street and a smaller Covent Garden store centred round a single large table and a spacious café complete with laptop area at Heathrow Terminal 5.Brand experts took a kinder view than coffee drinkers to the logo revamp. “If they believe as an organisation they can release the name from the symbol, that’s a pretty enviable and strong position to be in,” said David Roberts, creative director at Fitch, the branding design consultancy.Several other companies have taken Starbucks’ strategy, he noted, such as Royal Dutch Shell, the oil group; McDonald's’, the fast food chain ; Vodafone, the largest mobile operator by revenues; and Apple, the technology company.The other advantage of a word-free logo is that is translates more easily across digital media and overseas. Starbucks, like many companies, is now targeting a global audience with a wide range of written languages.Starbucks said it expected the new logo to be a talking point because “people like talking about us” and as it invites customers to engage.One post called on Starbucks to “Please listen to your customers and halt the printing of this new logo!!!” Last November Gap, the clothes retailer, was obliged to drop its digital new logo after a great deal of protest.But for Starbucks there is one upside: many of today’s bloggers said they would go out and buy as many coffees in old-logo cups as they could ‘while stocks lasted’."
630;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-12-30T18:29:10Z;SSP gets a boost from travel revival;;A faster than expected uptick in travel gave a much needed boost to sales at SSP, which operates food and retail outlets in railway stations and airports.Falling passenger numbers in 2008 and early 2009 had forced the company to agree a debt restructuring under which its parent company, the Swedish private equity group EQT, invested additional equity in the business and mezzanine lenders converted their debt into equity stakes.The company, which has over 2,000 stores in Europe, Asia and the US, owns the Caffe Ritazza and Upper Crust brands and operates franchises of Starbucks and Burger King.SSP earns 36 per cent of its revenue in the UK.The company reported a pre-tax profit of £112.9m ($174m) for the year ending September 30, a recovery from a loss of £682.1m the previous year.Excluding exceptional items, the company made a pre-tax loss of £53.7m.Full year like-for-like sales improved 3.4 per cent, but the growth was heavily weighted towards the latter half of the year in spite of the negative impact of the volcanic ash cloud in SSP’s third quarter.Sales had fallen 0.6 per cent in the first quarter, but grew 6 per cent by the fourth.“Although passenger numbers in several of SSP’s major airport markets still remain significantly below their pre-recession levels, we have clearly seen during the past year a recovery in airport passenger numbers earlier than envisaged,” the company said.Total sales for the year were £1.63bn, up from £1.5bn and ahead of the £1.55bn forecast by a report that was prepared during debt restructuring discussions.SSP, which EQT bought in 2006, saw sales begin to falter in the second half of 2008, at which point servicing its debt of £1.2bn began to threaten its ability to invest in the business.The company ended the year with net debt of £959m, down from £1.74bn in the previous year.
631;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T02:30:15+0000;US stocks edge up on deal speculation;;Rumours of more buy-out activity in the retail sector and a boost to shares in rare earth companies helped US stocks nudge up.BJ’s Wholesale Club surged 7.1 per cent to $47.62 after it was reported that private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners could make a hostile bid for the warehouse store operator if an auction was not started soon. There has been a spate of buy-out activity in the retail sector with Leonard Green playing a leading role.Last week, Leonard Green bought Jo-Ann Stores, a fabric and crafts retailer, for about $1.6bn in cash, and the month before it participated in a buy-out of clothing chain J Crew.The S&P 500 retail index edged up 0.3 per cent after slipping in recent days, as investors took profits with stocks reaching three-year highs during the holiday shopping season.Elsewhere, it was reported that another private equity company, Blackstone, had joined the bidding for Centro Properties, an Australian shopping centre owner, which also owns malls in the US. Blackstone advanced 1.6 per cent to $14.36.Shares in rare earth companies continued to climb after China cut its export quotas. The minerals, which are increasingly used in technological devices, are in tight supply and the world is dependent on China, which makes up 97 per cent of production.Molycorp, which owns a rare earth mine in California, surged 6.8 per cent to $49.32 while Rare Element Resources soared 13.5 per cent to $14.69 and Arafura Resources jumped 11.1 per cent to $1.36.The S&P 500 closed up 0.1 per cent to 1,259.69, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.1 per cent to close at 11,585.38.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent higher, at 2,666.93, hitting a three-year high that it has been edging towards throughout the month.Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial, forecast a “middle of the road” 2011 after recent years of extreme market movements, but added that the stock market could be in line for a modest decline.“History tells us that when there are too many bulls, the market may be due for a pullback,” he said.He said that, according to the American Association of Individual Investors, those bullish on US equities increased to 63.3 per cent last week, and that the last time the percentage of bulls was 55 per cent or higher was October 2007, when the market peaked.Stephen Lewis, an analyst at Monument Securities, said: “For the moment at least, [investors] are prepared to overlook negative elements in the investment picture.“Among these are the increasingly tight fiscal restraint in some European countries, financial turmoil afflicting the eurozone despite that restraint, the likelihood that bond yields will go on rising and the risks of a slowdown in China’s growth.”Energy stocks led the market higher with the S&P 500 energy index climbing 0.8 per cent.In financials, AIG, which has gained 91 per cent this year, lost 2.8 per cent to $57.27 after the Pennsylvania regulator said it failed to report $18.7bn of policyholder guarantees at two subsidiaries in 2008.An AIG spokesman said they had adopted a remediation plan to ensure disclosures were more accurate in the future.BlackRockgained 0.7 per cent to $190.82 after the world’s largest money manager said it would launch an internal trading platform next year, making it less dependent on Wall Street banks.Some investment banks edged lower, with the S&P 500 investment banking index down 1 per cent and Morgan Stanley slipping 1.4 per cent to $27.28.Elsewhere in retail, Ebay was almost flat at $28.36 after it said its PayPal business would set up an international commerce hub in Chongqing, China to help the online payment service connect local companies with global customers.Shares in Sears Holdings, the department store owner, soared 6.4 per cent to $74.49 after the retailer said it was launching an online film download service, Alphaline entertainment. Netflix, which dominates the market, fell 1.9 per cent to $180.27.
632;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Fresh details in Starbucks’ Kraft dispute;;Starbucks struck a $500m agreement in principle with Kraft Foods early this year to buy back distribution rights for its roast and ground coffee, only to have Kraft reverse course and demand an additional $200m, according to the latest court filing in this acrimonious business dispute.The claim by Starbucks adds new detail to the coffee chain’s repeated assertions that the distribution agreement between the two companies – struck in 1998 and revised in 2004 – had reached a nadir early this year.More importantly, the attempt by Starbucks to extricate itself from the deal underlines the coffee chain’s intention to continue expanding its packaged goods business even as it is rumoured to be testing a new single-serve premium coffee machine which would compete directly with Kraft’s Tassimo system and Nestle’s Nespresso.Currently, sales of packaged Starbucks coffee beans distributed by Kraft to US grocery stores and supermarkets account for about $500m in revenues.On November 4, Starbucks announced the termination of its distribution agreement with Kraft, effective in March 2011.Kraft, which was caught flat-footed by the announcement, maintains that its distribution agreement remains in force and that if Starbucks wants to terminate the arrangement, it should pay a 35 per cent premium to the total value of the business – meaning about $1.5bn.Kraft is seeking a preliminary injunction against Starbucks’ attempt to switch North American distributors. Both parties will submit briefs over the next three weeks, with the prospect of a court hearing on January 27.The dispute has so far included the airing of e-mails between two powerful chief executives– Starbucks’ Howard Schultz and Kraft’s Irene Rosenfeld.In Monday’s filing, Starbucks cites a January 2010 e-mail sent by Anthony Vernon, a senior Kraft executive, to Mr Schultz, apologising for Kraft’s performance and admitting that the relationship was “very broken” – but adding that Kraft wanted “to fix the sins of the past”.Mr Vernon’s e-mail followed a back-and-forth e-mail exchange between the Starbucks chief executive and Ms Rosenfeld, in which Mr Schultz complained about problems in the relationship.Kraft’s position is that such e-mails reflect the normal ups and downs of a complicated distribution partnership but fall short of constituting a material breach of the agreement.In addition to seeking a preliminary injunction against Starbucks, Kraft has submitted the matter to an arbitration panel, in accord with the rules governing the distribution agreement.But in turning the matter over to arbitration, rather than settling for a payment, Kraft runs the risk that it might walk away from the inevitable divorce empty-handed.
633;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”

Earnings came in at $1.16 a share compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.31 and revenue was also lighter than the consensus forecast.But the package delivery company raised its forecast for the fiscal year 2011 on the back of a stronger-than-expected holiday season, much of which was not included in the second quarter. It now predicts earnings per share of between $5.00 and $5.30 for the full year.Shares in FedEx gained 2 per cent to $94.22, helping the wider industrials sector add 1.1 per cent.The stock fell after its reported first-quarter results in September which had more than doubled year-on-year because the company issued a cautious outlook warning of the slowing of economic growth.Rival United Parcel Service also rose, up 2.1 per cent to $73.76.“I’ve always looked at FedEx as a bellwether of US economic activity because they transport goods across the country,” said Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer of Smart Growth Funds. “They raised estimates on the back of the positive holiday season but is that going to extend
into 2011?”Stocks extended their gains after a report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed factory activity in the region rose to 24.3 in December, maintaining and adding to gains after a jump to 22.5 the month before.The S&P 500 closed up 0.6 per cent to 1,242.67, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.4 per cent to close at 11,499.25 and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.8 per cent lower at 2,637.31.Initial jobless claims unexpectedly fell last week, down 3,000 to 420,000. But last week’s figures on the number of people claiming unemployment benefit for the first time were revised slightly higher.“This is a modest decline but enough to keep both the four- and eight-week moving averages heading down; the former is now at just 422,750, the lowest since July 2008, before the Lehman bust,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.A separate report released before the opening bell showed construction began on more homes in November than in the month before, the first such rise for three months.The S&P 500 homebuilders index added 1.6 per cent to $248.16.Shares in Visa and Mastercard tumbled after the Federal Reserve proposed new rules which could cut the debit card fees paid by retailers who accept the cards by up to 90 per cent. Visa dropped 12.7 per cent to $67.19 and Mastercard lost 10.3 per cent to $223.49.Bank of America rose 1.9 per cent to $12.52 after the bank said investors in some mortgage bonds had agreed to postpone a deadline

635;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-12-08T01:16:32Z;Koreans try to bridge linguistic divide;;What is Korean for Frappuccino? A bewildered North Korean defector cowering beneath the menu at a Starbucks in Seoul epitomises a growing linguistic schism that is forcing North and South Koreans apart and could complicate any eventual reunification.“Words like Americano and other foreign words on the menu make life tough for us,” says Park Sang-hak, who now works for a human rights group after fleeing Kim Jong-il’s dictatorship. “South Koreans do not understand what we say and ask us to repeat ourselves. Then we clam up and become shy.”The thorny issue of reunification was sparked again recently with the leak of US diplomatic cables that quoted Chinese diplomats questioning the long-term future of China’s alliance with North Korea and hinting that Beijing could accept reunification.The North and South Korean languages have grown apart so severely over 65 years of division that both countries have agreed to collaborate on a joint dictionary to stem the growing confusions. North Korea’s language is filled with ideological terminology while South Korean is awash with foreign words.Thirsty South Koreans happily order a “juice” but North Koreans ask for “danmul” – literally “sweet water” – a word that is greeted in Seoul with either bemusement or derision depending on how forgiving the waitress is.In just a foretaste of the problems that could arise at unification, many North Korean defectors already complain that linguistic differences are a source of discrimination and lead to their unfair dismissal from jobs.Still, Han Yong-un, South Korea’s head of the dictionary project, said these social pitfalls were not his immediate priority.“We are mostly concerned with technical and academic language. At the moment, North and South Korean doctors cannot conduct an operation together and architects cannot co-operate to construct a building together,” he said.Mr Han heads a team of 30 lexicographers on the 12th storey of an office block in central Seoul. Penned in their cubicles, they have been elucidating problematic words since 2005, meeting North Korean colleagues to chew over thorny definitions four times a year.But politics has intervened. Since Seoul accused North Korea of torpedoing one of its warships in March, with the loss of 46 sailors, the dictionary teams have been working in isolation. Any hope of resuming the meetings has been scotched by North Korea’s bombardment of a South Korean island last month, making the 2014 deadline for completing the 370,000-word project increasingly improbable.Mr Han says the North has agreed to distribute the completed dictionary to libraries and universities. South Korea’s lexicographers, sponsored by Seoul’s unification ministry, plan to issue shorter volumes for professional spheres such as medicine and technology.In the simplest cases, problems derive from old regional differences, with North and South Koreans using different words for “geese” and “wolves”.South Koreans import foreign words whereas North Koreans create indigenous ones. For example, shoppers in Seoul buying tights will simply ask for “stocking” whereas North Koreans have a pure Korean word “salyangmal” meaning “skin-sock”. Mascara in North Korea is “nunsseobmeok” or “eyelash-ink”.For the South Korean dictionary compilers, the toughest words are political. Words such as “comrade” are far more loaded in North Korea, thanks to decades of Soviet influence. Most difficult is the word “juche” which is the North Korean state ideology, often translated as self-sufficiency. To South Koreans the word simply means “subject”.With such sensitive entries, Mr Han keeps the definitions as dry as possible while including dozens of literary examples to show how each country uses the word differently.“These artificial political terms are expected to vanish once the countries unify,” he says.Many defectors insist the main challenges are not vocabulary but accent, intonation and manners. South Koreans, who have an extremely courteous culture of client service, find North Koreans abrupt and rude. In turn, North Koreans find South Korean language effeminate and insincere.“We try to mimic newscasters on television but I have still got my accent,” says Jang Sung-geun, who works as a taxi driver in Seoul after defecting 10 years ago and claims that police have discriminated against him because of the way he speaks. “We can somehow overcome the foreign words in South Korea, but our accent is difficult to fix.”Additional reporting by Song Jung-a
636;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Kraft seeks injunction against Starbucks;;Kraft Foods is seeking a preliminary injunction against Starbucks to prevent the world’s largest chain of coffee shops from terminating their $500m partnership without compensation next March.In a complaint filed in federal court, Kraft claimed that Starbucks wanted to sever its ties to Kraft in order to enter the market for single-cup brewed coffee on its own. Starbucks currently supplies single-serve coffee disks that work exclusively with Kraft’s Tassimo home brewing system, and has signaled its interest in the single-serve category.In its motion seeking an injunction, Kraft claims that Starbucks had offered to buy itself out of the distribution agreement in August for $750m but that it rejected the offer as inadequate. In October, two months after the bid was rejected, Starbucks sent Kraft a letter citing several material breaches of the contract, and complaining about an erosion in market share for its packaged coffee products in 2008 and 2009.In early November, Starbucks announced the dissolution of the partnership starting in March.In response to the filing, Starbucks said, “It’s unfortunate that Kraft has chosen to attempt this delaying tactic through seeking preliminary injunction, a course that will ultimately prove harmful to customers. Starbucks will vigorously oppose any action on Kraft’s part that would prevent Starbucks from rightfully assuming full control of our brand and business”.
637;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-12-03T22:16:52Z;Stuck in the middle with who?;It’s clear now that the squeezed middle is the place to be;"After much hand-wringing I’ve decided to join the squeezed middle. Everyone else seems to be a part of it and I was beginning to feel seriously left out. I’d been putting it off because – to be honest – I really haven’t felt that hard-pressed. But it’s clear now that the squeezed middle is the place to be.For a start everyone likes you. The Tories, the Labour party, the Daily Mail, The Sun, the BBC – they all sympathise with the pressures you face. It’s like being in one giant support group that everyone can join as long as they can afford the coffee in Starbucks.No, you can’t be completely without resources; that would be a drag. The genuinely poor would lower the tone and we’d have to go somewhere cheaper for coffee. You don’t want to hear people telling you that they can’t afford Christmas presents for their kids when you are fretting about air passenger duty. We know things are tough on the poor but the point about being in the squeezed middle is that we are officially more deserving. We’re not deaf to their plight; we just think we should be first in line if any money is being handed out.Equally you can’t be loaded. You can have an iPhone and a Wii, but an Audi and a second house in Southwold really won’t cut it. The squeezed middle needs to protect its brand identity.As I said, for a long time I stayed away from the squeezed middle. It wasn’t snobbery. It just seemed to me that the only qualification for membership was the government had found some way of making you poorer which, when you think about it, is not a great selling point.Of course the definition was always a bit fuzzy. Until recently it was pretty much anyone. A comfortably paid journalist had every right to be in the squeezed middle if he wanted to. You just had to walk around saying things like “these school fees are crippling us” or “have you seen the price of petrol?” and you were in. You could still buy most things you wanted as long as you first sucked the breath in through your teeth and said something like “can we really afford this?” The squeezed middle was pretty much anyone whose vote a politician wanted but didn’t have.Political leaders were always very decent about this. I think it was part of David Cameron’s Big Society ethos. Cameron has done a lot to boost inclusivity. How else can one look at child benefit withdrawal, train fare increases or student fee hikes. It’s obvious Dave is trying to bring us all inside the tent. And if none of these changes has left you feeling squeezed yet – don’t worry, the coalition is working on it; it’s good about things like that. They truly are the parties of aspiration.On the other hand I’m worried about these Labour types who are getting rather selective about the squeezed middle. First, Ed Miliband excluded anyone earning more than £100,000. Perhaps that’s reasonable; but now another Labour figure, Liam Byrne, has set it between £26,000 and £50,000.This is downright elitist. Some of us simply cannot afford to be part of the squeezed middle at those prices. We’ll have to join the unsqueezed middle and no one gives a stuff about them.The unsqueezed middle is suffering just as much as the squeezed middle. We also thought the kids were off the books when they went to university. We also found the child benefit jolly useful – now we’ll probably have to pay for their first car ourselves. The great thing about the squeezed middle is that its aspirations are capped but the unsqueezed middle has a whole variety of things it can’t afford: private school, second homes, fancy holidays, Bose speakers.The unsqueezed middle doesn’t expect much help, but it is just easier to cope if you know Ed Miliband is rooting for you. Perhaps there should be a new category for those who don’t earn as much as an investment banker but are treated as if they do; the comfortably off, the squeezed rich.I know, it doesn’t quite sound right; it needs some branding advice – the waning wealthy, perhaps; or the squeezed smug; the cash-strapped comfy? All suggestions welcome.robert.shrimsley@ft.com"
638;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-11-29T17:46:54Z;Kraft seeks Starbucks divorce;;"Kraft Foods has started arbitration proceedings against Starbucks to force the Seattle-based coffee company to pay a fee in order to exit its 12-year partnership.The announcement from Kraft, which distributes bags of Starbucks’ whole bean and ground coffee to supermarkets across the US, marks an escalation of a dispute which began early this month when Starbucks declared its intention of walking away from the relationship next March.According to Kraft, the termination of the relationship requires Starbucks to pay a 35 per cent premium over the “fair value” of the joint venture, suggesting a total pay-out of about $1.5bn should Kraft prevail in the dispute.Kraft has maintained that its contract with Starbucks remains in force in perpetuity. Starbucks said in a statement on Monday that Kraft had failed to work closely with it on marketing issues, resulting in “the erosion of brand equity and experience at grocery that Starbucks customers have come to expect”.In a letter sent to Kraft last month, Starbucks lawyers claimed that the food and beverage group had not included Starbucks marketing personnel in decisions involving the promotion of the company’s coffee in large supermarket chains.Starbucks also claimed that Kraft violated the exclusivity provisions of the agreement by promoting its own brand of coffee, Yuban, as “premium coffee” even though the agreement calls for Starbucks to be Kraft’s only “super premium ­coffee”.A spokesman for Kraft dismissed Starbucks’ claims about marketing as ­“trivial”. He said the Yuban brand had been around for decades and that if ­Starbucks was not confident of its ability to coexist with Yuban, it could have brought the matter up at the time of the 1998 agreement.“Starbucks has suddenly made an allegation of breach of contract; we categorically reject that,” the spokesman said.Over its 12-year life, revenues from the partnership between Kraft and Starbucks have grown from $50m to $500m.Assuming the operating margins for the coffee sales are above 20 per cent, the partnership is thought to generate at least $100m in earnings before interest, tax and depreciation annually.Based on JM Smucker’s purchase of Folgers coffee from Procter & Gamble in 2008 for $3.3bn, the value of the Starbucks-Kraft business would be $1.5bn."
639;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-11-22T22:01:17Z;The value of being an underdog;;"Steve Jobs once summed up the spirit of his company by asking: “Why join the navy if you can be a pirate?” The question was a reference to infighting at Apple during the early 1980s, but it set the tone for the company’s future marketing. To buy an Apple product was to join a community of independent thinkers, rebelling against a received way of doing things that was boring and restrictive.More recently, even though Apple has become one of the world’s biggest companies with one of its most valuable brands, it has managed to retain a sense of fun, coolness and irreverence. Apple is, in short, the ultimate “challenger brand”.Only a few decades ago, this concept was relatively simple, says Adam Morgan, author of Eating the Big Fish: How Challenger Brands Can Compete against Brand Leaders. Companies such as Apple, airline Virgin Atlantic and car hire company Avis would depict themselves in “David and Goliath” terms, bravely taking on the market leaders. “However, since then, and particularly in the past 15 years or so, there has not only been an explosion in the number of brands openly adopting a challenger stance but also in the number of different stances they have taken,” he says.Mr Morgan identifies a dozen types of challenger brand, including: the Missionary, which challenges “the belief system underpinning the category to date” (Dove); the Visionary, which challenges the “mundanity of the way the category thinks about its nature and role” (Whole Foods or Zipcar); and the “Enlightened Zagger”, which challenges “a prevailing and commonly or unthinkingly accepted aspect of contemporary culture” (Camper shoes or Foster’s Beer).The downturn has increased interest in the concept, he adds. “Obviously in a downturn there’s the imperative to do more with less …So it makes sense to get inspiration from companies that have been able to amplify small differences and punch above their weight.”The burgeoning appeal of the “challenger brand” goes beyond the business world. “During the 2008 presidential election, we noticed that almost all of the candidates were positioning themselves as underdogs,” says Anat Keinan of Harvard Business School, who, with colleagues Jill Avery, Juliet Schor and Neeru Paharia, has just completed a research study on challenger brands. “As we looked around, we noticed that today’s grocery store shelves and brand websites are filled with stories of humble beginnings and noble struggles against overpowering adversaries, providing underdog narratives for consumers.”The report found that consumers respond most favourably to brands that have a disadvantaged position and that show “passion and determination”.The researchers used a variety of online and live experiments to examine how consumers’ self-image and circumstances affected their reaction to brands perceived as either underdogs or “top dogs” in particular sectors. In a study involving chocolate, for example, they created an underdog narrative for a niche brand that was “small and new, competing against powerhouses like Lindt and Godiva”, and a top-dog narrative for another brand that had a big marketing budget. The result: 71 per cent of subjects chose the underdog chocolate.The team also found that the strategy was more effective among those who see themselves as underdogs – people in traditionally disadvantaged segments, such as women, blue-collar workers and ethnic minorities. “Underdogs are winning at the polls, at the Oscars [Slumdog Millionaire] and on grocery shelves,” Prof Keinan says. “We believe this is because underdog stories about overcoming great odds through passion and determination are particularly resonant during difficult times as they inspire us and give us hope when the outlook we face is bleak.”Another benefit is the galvanising effect on staff of a clearly defined “cause”. Mr Morgan points out that “Walk don’t run” is the fundamental philosophy at Camper, the Spanish shoe company. “They believe the world has gone bonkers and that Camper is there to wake people up to the importance of taking life at a much slower pace,” he says. A challenger’s cause doesn’t necessarily have to be related to corporate social responsibility or philanthropy, he says. It could be as simple as defining “something wrong about the world that they want to put right”.David Buonaguidi agrees. He is a founding partner at Karmarama, a London-based branding agency that is working with UK coffee-shop chain Costa to erode the market share of Starbucks. “I’m only interested in doing challenger brands because they make for a much more exciting and exhilarating workplace,” he says.Karmarama’s campaign for Costa, part of Whitbread, the leisure industries company, was based on research that showed seven out of 10 people who described themselves as coffee-lovers preferred its coffee to that of Starbucks. It used a series of posters to “apologise” to Starbucks for this inconvenient truth. “We knew Starbucks would object strenuously through their lawyers, but all of their complaints were rejected by the Advertising Standards Authority,” says Jim Slater, Costa’s marketing director. The campaign was intended to “prick the consciousness” of people who cared about the quality of their coffee, but might otherwise be unaware that there was much difference between the high-street brands. Mr Slater says that it worked. “Costa sales grew 33 per cent year on year [to September], during a period when most other coffee chains have been struggling.”As companies grow, they can hold on to their challenger status provided they keep on reinventing themselves while staying true to core values, says Mr Morgan.Apple, for example, has challenged all sorts of assumptions, he points out. With the launch of products such as the Macintosh computer in 1984, the iPod in 2001 and the iPhone in 2007, it has repeatedly proved itself to be a “Gamechanger”, challenging the “fundamental drivers and codes of the category to date”. Yet its share of the personal computer market has remained so low (currently about 8 per cent) that it has been able to carry on acting as an “Irreverent Maverick” too. Even in recent advertisements, it personified the Mac as an attractive young man and the rival PC as an overweight and stuffily dressed nerd.Ultimately, challenger brands depend on a carefully maintained narrative – something Prof Keinan and colleagues refer to as an “underdog brand biography”. As Mr Buonaguidi says: “You’ve got to make sure there’s a great story there.” Equally important, says Prof Keinan, is that a brand can credibly call itself an underdog: Microsoft couldn’t describe itself in this way in an attempt to counter Apple in the PC market, for example, though it might be able to do so in the MP3 player market."
640;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-11-14T20:06:05Z;Casual dining;Restaurant chains are on the up but indigestion could spoil the mood;When middle America is in high spirits, it heads out for a delicious seafood brodetto or a classic sirloin with shrimp and Parmesan. Full tables at casual dining restaurants are an indication of improving consumer sentiment, for rather than just grabbing fast food, families make an effort to eat out at mid-range chains such as Olive Garden or Applebee’s.Decisions like those have been infrequent since the crunch. While spending on food has remained steady at about a 10th of disposable income, the proportion going to food for consumption at home has been rising for the past three years, according to Department of Agriculture data.However, the latest Knapp Track report, a widely watched industry survey, indicates that same-store sales for casual dining chains were up on last year for four straight months between July and October. The last time the $35bn industry recorded such a sustained period of growth was in early 2006, before the housing market turned down. The growth itself is still modest, 1.6 per cent in October, matching the pace of retail sales generally. But the improvement is in line with other signs of improving sentiment. Starbucks and high-end grocery chain Whole Foods both reported better than expected results this month.More concerning for investors, though, is that the casual dining sector shares some of the retail sector’s broader problems. After a prolonged period dealing with the consequences of overexpansion, casual dining share prices have rebounded strongly this year and the sector trades at a marked premium to its fast food competitors. Cost inflation is picking up as food prices rise, while consumers remain price-conscious. Competition for feel-good eaters is also intense, with greater spending on marketing and refurbishments required to tempt in the crowds.Indigestion could still spoil the mood.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
641;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-11-12T18:43:39Z;Mid-priced US retailers ring up rising sales;;Three of the largest US department stores have provided further evidence that middle-income consumers are spending more, in spite of high unemployment and depressed house prices.Mike Ullman, chief executive of JC Penney, said on Friday that the mid-price retailer had seen “clear signs of strength in key businesses” during its third-quarter as it reported earnings ahead of Wall Street’s expectations.JC Penney said it expected to see comparable sales rise by 3-4 per cent during the quarter ending January 31, which would continue a slow but steady recovery in spending by its core mid-income shoppers.The department store sector’s monthly sales this year have regularly outperformed both Walmart and Target, the largest mass discounters, who serve a predominantly lower-income customer base.Macy’s, the largest US department store by sales, this week forecast holiday quarter sales growth in the same range, while Kohl’s, JC Penney’s main rival in the mid and lower-price range, gave a 2-4 per cent target.Macy’s, which reported comparable sales growth of 3.9 per cent in its third quarter, highlighted the particular strength of its upmarket Bloomingdale’s chain.Kohl’s reported that sales of its more expensive “Simply Vera” line by designer Vera Wang had grown more than 15 per cent during the quarter.JC Penney said it had seen “clear signs of strength” in sales of cosmetics and fragrances at its 231 store-within-a-store Sephora locations.Similar signs of sales strength during the third quarter have been reported by several retailers whose sales slumped after the 2008 financial crisis, including Whole Foods Market, the organic and natural supermarket, Starbucks, the coffee business, and Victoria’s Secret, the lingerie retailer.Estee Lauder, the upmarket beauty brand business, also said recently that beauty sales at “prestige” department store counters and at Sephora stores, owned by LVMH, had outstripped growth at lower price drug stores and discounters during the third quarter.Macy’s, Kohl’s and JC Penney are all still taking a strongly promotional marketing approach to the holiday shopping season, launching a series of special weekend sales offers in the run-up to the Thanksgiving holiday.But Kevin Mansell, chief financial officer of Kohl’s, said its marketing message this year had moved away from stressing just low prices to a broader focus on value for money.“A lot of the incremental marketing we are doing . . . is around convincing and communicating to consumers why what we give them for the price is of better overall total value,” he said.JC Penney reported third-quarter earnings of $44m, or 19 cents per diluted share, up 63 per cent on the same period last year.Total revenues were almost unchanged at $4.19bn, reflecting a decision to end distribution of its mail-order catalogue on the rise of online shopping.
642;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-11-07T17:40:39Z;Queen in search of Facebook friends;;Facebook boasts more than 500m users but now it can add the Queen to its list of subscribers.From Monday, Facebook social networkers will be able to keep up to date with the movements of the royal family and its speeches, news, photos and videos on a new official page called The British Monarchy.The move is the royal household’s latest attempt to expand its presence online and highlights the growing influence of social media sites.Twitter, Facebook and YouTube are increasingly used by corporations, governments and heads of state. The White House has its own Facebook page, as does Number 10.However, greater openness also has its drawbacks. Dutch politicians were recently urged to stop posting on Twitter during live debates because it was hampering the parliamentary process and aggravating divisions between parties.Buckingham Palace, which has teamed up with Clarence House and the Royal Collection to create the new page, said the decision to join Facebook was a logical step given the royal household already had a presence on other social networking sites.The monarchy launched a page on YouTube in 2007, which shows short videos on royal visits such as the Duchess of Cornwall’s recent visit to Battersea Dogs and Cats Home. The monarchy launched a Flickr page earlier this year and last year it created a Twitter account, which now has about 68,000 followers.As part of the new royal Facebook page, users will also be able to sign up to receive regular updates through their news feed and post comments.The site is an official one and neither the Queen nor other members of the royal family are expected to post comments. Royal watchers will also be unable to send friend requests or “poke” the Queen on the new page.
643;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-11-05T23:46:55Z;US financials up on higher dividends hopes;;Financials surged as investors hoped banks would raise dividends but strong employment data failed to push the wider indices much beyond their two-year high.Non-farm payroll data beat expectations in October and the figures for previous months were revised up. Some investors saw the improvement in jobs as a sign that quantitative easing could be scaled back.“Equity markets have been surging but the potential for reduced QE2 suggests that indices could be in their final upleg for a while, particularly since some have started to bump up against resistance levels that have been in place for years,” said Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets.The S&P 500 closed up 0.4 per cent to 1,225.85, rising 3.6 per cent in a week where confidence was buoyed by further quantitative easing and a Republican victory in the House of Representatives.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.1 per cent higher at 11,444.08, after climbing 2.8 per cent over the five days and the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.1 per cent higher at 2,578.99, after adding 2.8 per cent on the week.Financial stocks climbed 1.8 per cent after it was reported that the Federal Reserve may allow banks to increase their dividends. Goldman Sachs climbed 2.8 per cent to $171.07, JPMorgan advanced 2.9 per cent to $40.94 and Bank of America was up 1.9 per cent to $12.36.“While this [predicted] decision by the Fed will probably provide a positive catalyst in the near term for the banks, we don’t think it is the most prudent of actions,” said analysts at FBR Capital Markets.“Given the current economic environment, we would rather see banks hold on to their capital until economic data, earnings, and credit trends improved more.”Shares in AIG, the bailed-out insurer, rose 1.9 per cent to $45.61 even though it reported losses of more than $2bn in the third quarter. The loss, caused by a writedown in the value of the businesses it is selling and charges tied to repaying rescue loans, compares with a profit for the same period a year earlier.Elsewhere in financials, State Street, the money manager, added 3.5 per cent to $45.47 after it was raised from “neutral” to “buy” by analysts at Goldman Sachs.The analysts cited its many strengths in its core custody business, the highest global exposure among its peers and excess capital.As the earnings season continued, rising commodity prices hit consumer companies. Starbucks managed to beat expectations after it successfully passed on cost increases to its customers but Kraft suffered after some shoppers were deterred by rising prices.The coffee shop chain raised its full-year profit forecast as it increased some drinks prices to compensate for the surging price of coffee. Shares advanced 3.8 per cent to $30.87.John Ivankoe, an analyst at JPMorgan, said he believed the new guidance figure remained conservative. He raised his price target for the company.Kraft Foods’ quarterly results were squeezed by cost inflation.The shares fell 2.2 per cent to $31.08 after the consumer goods company said rising ingredient costs had forced it to raise prices on 40 per cent of its products in North America and more than half of its European products.CBS Corp became the latest broadcast network to beat expectations as profits rose 42 per cent and it announced a $1.5bn share buy-back over 18 months.A rebound in advertising revenue has boosted TV networks in the past few monnths. But total revenue fell as the adverts and subscription fees could not make up for a lack of big syndication sales. The shares dropped 3.7 per cent to $17.01.
644;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-11-05T18:54:26Z;Starbucks;Howard Schultz’s return to the helm appears to be working;Inspirational founder leaves business in the hands of mere managers. Overambition and innovations muddy a company’s clear cultural waters. The founder returns, makes smart decisions and reinvigorates staff. Shareholders cheer.Such stories do not always go to plan, but so far Howard Schultz’s return to the helm at Starbucks appears to be working. Results this week confirmed that the world’s largest chain of coffee shops has its buzz back. Higher traffic and higher prices boosted growth and operating margins. Forecasts were raised.Part of that turnround is due to changes that only someone with Mr Schultz’s credibility could accomplish. Coffee aficionados might have scowled at the decision to introduce flavoured coffees and the introduction of Starbucks-branded instant coffee. But Via notched up $135m of sales in its first year, and the move to end a distribution arrangement with Kraft indicates further take-home ambitions.The group has also learnt to live with competition from the fast-food chains, focusing efforts on customers prepared to spend a little more on their morning coffee. Indeed, McDonald’s efforts to sell cappuccinos indicates expansion of the overall market for quality coffee, ultimately creating more demand for Starbucks’ premium product. Wine and food in some prestige locations may be ways to extract more cash from existing customers.Starbucks’ shares have quadrupled since the 2008 low. On 24 times prospective earnings, they trade on a higher multiple than McDonald’s has achieved at any point in the past decade, even though the burger chain’s 31 per cent operating margin is twice that of Starbucks and sales growth is only slightly slower.

645;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-11-05T00:01:08Z;US shoppers regain taste for ‘luxury light’;;From lingerie and handbags to organic vegetables and lattes, America’s middle-class shoppers are regaining some of their taste for the aspirational and discretionary products that were hard hit by the economic downturn.In a sign of the changing mood, Victoria’s Secret, known for its $50 bras and sexy marketing, said on Thursday that sales at stores open at least a year had risen 14 per cent in October compared with the same period last year.Starbucks, home of the indulgent $3 coffee, saw an 8 per cent increase in comparable sales at its US stores during its most recent quarter, continuing a yearlong revival of its fortunes.Shares in Whole Foods Market, the organic and natural grocer whose sales slumped at the start of the recession, rose 15 per cent to $47.27 after it reported an 8.9 per cent increase in identical-store sales over the past five weeks.Joel Bines, a retail consultant at AlixPartners, said there was growing evidence of a return of what he called “luxury light” spending by aspirational consumers, on top of the recovery at the top-end luxury market seen since the start of the year.“In 2008 and 2009, the aspirational consumer evacuated the segment . . . and then began slowly to creep back in again. They are starting to unlock the purse strings a bit,” Mr Bines said.Neiman Marcus and Saks, the luxury department stores, underlined the continuing strength of demand from the wealthiest US consumers, with October’s comparable sales up 11.5 per cent and 8.1 per cent respectively.Nordstrom, the upmarket fashion department store, reported a 4.8 per cent increase in October same-store sales at its full-price stores.The figures released on Thursday followed the announcement of a strong quarterly performance last week from Coach, the handbag and leather accessories brand, which predicted double-digit sales increases in the holiday season.Blue Nile, the online jeweller, is also forecasting a holiday quarter sales rise of between 3 and 12 per cent.Overall October sales figures from US chain retailers presented a more mixed pattern, with the Retail Metrics monthly index rising 1.5 per cent, its smallest gain since April, with unseasonably warm weather weighing on clothing sales.Additional reporting by Greg Farrell in New York
646;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-11-04T20:27:51Z;Starbucks revenues surge;;Starbucks’ resurgence continued through its fourth quarter as the Seattle-based coffee restaurant chain reported revenues of $2.8bn, up 17 per cent from the same quarter last year.For the full year, Starbucks’ revenues were $10.7bn, up 10 per cent from its 2009 totals.Net income at Starbucks was $278.5m, or 37 cents a share, up 86 per cent from $150m, or 20 cents, in the same period a year ago.In a closely watched metric, Starbucks’s same store sales increased 8 per cent, owing to a 5 per cent increase in traffic and a 2 per cent rise in average customer ticket compared with the fourth quarter of 2009.The company benefited from a 14-week fourth quarter this year, compared with a 13-week quarter last year. On a comparable basis, the company’s revenues were up 8.6 per cent over the previous year.Starbucks said the rising price of coffee would likely drive its 2011 earnings per share down by 8 cents to 10 cents .Starbucks has informed Kraft of its intention to end the distribution arrangement the two companies have had for more than a decade. The details and timing around any transition will be subject to further private dialogue.
647;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-10-28T19:58:12Z;Polarisation in US presents a risk for advertisers;Brand perceptions are splitting along political lines, writes Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson;Whatever their politics, it is hard for people in the US news media not to love elections. Not only do they throw up compelling stories such as this year’s rise of Tea Party candidates, but, every other year, they also offer an autumn boost to advertising revenues in a quiet patch between the September start of the new television season and the post-Thanksgiving holiday shopping rush.The more vituperative and close the election, the better for both editorial and commercial operations, and executives across the industry expect next week’s midterms to set records for political advertising. Kantar Media’s Campaign Media Analysis Group has estimated that almost $3bn will be spent this time, up from $2.5bn in 2008, thanks in part to relaxed rules on corporate donations.This year, however, the news media is becoming part of the election story in a way that many in the industry should find alarming. Hostility to “the mainstream media” has become a recurrent theme for Tea Party candidates such as Christine O’Donnell in Delaware and Sharron Angle in Nevada, while Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor, has rallied crowds with derisive talk of the “lamestream media”.Conservative mistrust of what talk radio host Rush Limbaugh calls the “drive-by media” is nothing new, but the anti-media rhetoric has reached new heights. National Public Radio’s poorly-handled firing last week of Juan Williams, a controversial analyst for both NPR and Fox News, sparked calls from senior Republicans, including Mike Huckabee, to cut federal funding for public radio.Yet, when you examine their audience numbers, it is getting harder and harder to argue that the likes of CBS News, CNN, The New York Times or the Washington Post constitute a clear mainstream. Advertisers and investors are only too familiar with the diminished role such outlets now play as audiences scatter.The defining voices in the national conversation are, increasingly, not the venerable news networks but, depending on the demographic groups, talk radio hosts led by Mr Limbaugh, Viacom’s The Daily Show, Univision’s Spanish language newscasts or the headlines on Yahoo and AOL’s much-trafficked home pages.In short, as the mainstream media struggles, more news consumers are choosing to spin around in their own frothy ideological eddies to the left and right of the mainstream.In spite of the tendency to equate the mainstream media with “the liberal media”, conservative outlets are also faring better commercially. The biggest selling US newspaper, when online subscriptions are included, is The Wall Street Journal, whose opinion pages lean right. Most notably, the conservative hosts on Fox News continue to trounce their cable news opponents at down-the-middle CNN and MSNBC, a home to liberal hosts that has adopted the slogan “lean forward” in a recent rebranding.For advertisers and investors, the idea of a mainstream media is a nonsense. A mass media still exists, as evidenced by the impressive audiences for Sunday Night Football, Glee, Avatar or Dancing with the Stars, but it is not in the news media.If the promise of mass media was a quick route for advertisers to as many potential consumers as possible, the polarisation of American audiences presents a risk for those advertisers.A study released this week by YouGov’s BrandIndex, culled from 200,000 interviews, found that perceptions of individual brands are splitting along political lines. So, while Democrats list Google as the brand they view most favourably, it does not feature in Republicans’ top 10 list. Likewise, Fox News tops the list of brands favoured by Republicans but does not make Democrats’ top 10. The country is similarly divided on Wrangler jeans, Budweiser beer, Starbucks coffee, JetBlue airlines and Barnes & Noble bookstores.This presents advertisers with a dilemma similar to that faced by political candidates: do you concentrate your marketing on a core of receptive fans or try to reach the consumer equivalent of the swing-voter? In practice, few brands would be happy targeting only half the potential market.All politics is, famously, local and according to Borrell Associates, a local advertising specialist, almost two-thirds of this year’s campaign advertising will flow to mainstream local broadcast TV stations. Cable is making inroads, but is expected to take 9 per cent of the pie, on a par with radio. Newspapers should receive about 8 per cent, while online political advertising will account for $45m, or about 1.5 per cent. For now, then, it seems that those who most love to taunt the mainstream media are not putting their money where their mouths are. We will know in a week whether or not that strategy has worked for individual candidates, but if spending is to catch up with voters’ behaviour over the longer term, it suggests mainstream media have more ground to lose.andrew.edgecliffe-johnson@ft.com
648;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;California to weigh legalising marijuana;;The bleary-eyed people coming out of the Green Room marijuana dispensary in west Los Angeles this week did not hang around. Encouraged to move along by a burly security guard, they emerged from the red brick building blinking in the daylight.“I come here on my way home from work … it’s very convenient,” said Audrey, a middle-aged woman who, like others coming from the dispensary, was clutching a small paper bag full of cannabis. The dispensaries have often been the source of controversy – at one point there were more of them in Los Angeles than Starbucks coffee shops – but since the summer their number has fallen from more than 400 to about 40 after city authorities launched a crackdown.That will change if California voters approve the legalislation of marijuana when they go to the polls next month, with licensed pot shops and marijuana farms expected to spring up across the state. Supporters of the Proposition 19 ballot measure say legalisation will generate billions of dollars in tax revenue, free up police resources, and deprive drug dealers and other criminals of income.A recent poll by the Public Policy Institute of California showed support for legalisation slipping – particularly in the Latino community. But other polls have pointed to victory for Prop 19 supporters. With California facing a record $20bn deficit, “people seeing budgets cut for schools understand the benefits of legalisation and the tax revenue it will bring”, says Richard Lee, the biggest financial backer of the campaign and the founder of the “Oaksterdam University” in Oakland, which teaches the growing and cultivation of cannabis.The presence of Prop 19 on the ballot is also likely to help Democratic candidates standing for office in California because it will bring young people to the polls, adds Mr Lee. Some supporters, including the comedian Bill Maher, have said pot legalisation could become a so-called “wedge issue” for Democrats similar to how ballots on gay marriage and abortion helped drive Republicans to the polls. “We’ve already had a lot of Democrats talk about how this is going to be good for them,” says Mr Lee.His company has contributed $1.4m to the $2m raised by the Yes on Prop 19 campaign. In contrast, the No on Prop 19 campaign, which opposes legalisation, has raised about $200,000. The pro-legalisation lobby in California has attracted a broad base of support, including police chiefs, judges, doctors and business leaders such as Sean Parker and Dustin Moskovitz, the co-founders of Facebook. Meg Whitman and Jerry Brown, the candidates to replace Arnold Schwarzenegger as California’s governor in November, oppose Prop 19. The US government is also firmly against the legalisation of the drug, with Eric Holder, the attorney-general, saying last week that US authorities would continue to prosecute “individuals and organisations that possess, manufacture or distribute marijuana for recreational use, even if such activities are permitted under state law”.Most of the marijuana consumed in the US is brought into the country from Mexico. But California is likely to take on a bigger role in the illegal distribution of the drug around the country in the event of legalisation being approved by voters, says Jonathan Caulkins, Stever Professor of Operations Research at Carnegie Mellon University, and the co-author of a report by the Rand Corporation on the impact legalisation in California will have on the Mexican drug trade.“Californian marijuana will out-compete Mexican marijuana in the rest of the US,” he says, pointing to a lower cost of distribution and the higher potency of the drug grown in the state. “That will require some sort of response by the federal government to prevent that from happening . . . but how is the government going to prevent people from driving around the US?” The aggressive stance taken by the White House against legalisation is an indicator of the potential clashes that lie ahead between supporters of California state law and the federal government – assuming Prop 19 passes.But with local police officers employed by the state, it is unclear whether the Drug Enforcement Administration, which has a federal mandate, will be able to adequately police California, a state of more than 35m people. “The federal government can’t change state law,” says Mr Lee.More important is the message legalisation in California would send to other states, says David Shirk, director of the Trans-Border Institute at the University of San Diego. “California led the nation in decriminalising marijuana for medicinal use,” he adds.
649;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-10-22T21:50:19Z;Restaurant goers sign up to pre-paid dining;;"Book a table, turn up, order, eat – then settle your bill: it’s a tried and trusted formula at restaurants around the world. But in recent years, private supper clubs in London have turned the order upside down, asking diners to pay in advance for set meals – and now two Americans are trying to spread the idea.Late this year or early next, Nick Kokonas and Grant Achatz – the men behind Alinea, a restaurant rated number seven in the world by Restaurant magazine – will open Next Restaurant in Chicago, a venture drawing on business models from industries as varied as aerospace and London’s West End.Like theatregoers booking seats, diners will buy tickets to meals rather than pay afterwards. And like Ryanair customers looking for cheap flights from Dublin to Malaga, they’ll find better deals during less popular time slots – lower prices for the same dinner on Tuesday at 9.30pm than Friday at 7pm.“I was a derivatives trader for 10 years,” says Mr Kokonas. “Demand-based pricing seems to make a lot of sense to me.”Not that it’s an entirely new idea: witness age-old early-bird specials. But the attention the Next Restaurant experiment has won in the US (with almost 10,000 people registering interest in a ticket), and the popularity of the private supper-club model in the UK, suggests diners are open to innovation that goes beyond cuisine.The UK restaurant industry is embracing that – in part because it has to. During the recession, many chains relied on vouchers to maintain volumes, but at the expense of margins. Now, as they seek to wean customers off those deals, they need to find more creative ways of offering value. “Pricing is one of the hot topics in the restaurant industry these days,” says Rafi Mohammed, author of The Art of Pricing.Groupon, a website that negotiates deals for users by leveraging group buying power, has convinced as many as 1m Britons to pay for meals ahead of time.The company persuades businesses to offer discounts of at least 50 per cent on the condition that a certain number of potential customers commit to the offer. Users pay Groupon up front and the company transfers that money to restaurants via an electronic “redemption tool”. Les Trois Garçons in Shoreditch, the Supperclub in Notting Hill and Gordon Ramsay’s US venues have all signed up.This has raised eyebrows in the industry, where Groupon partnerships can be seen as a sign of weakness and a dubious route back to health, since you may be simply attracting low-profit dealhunters.But Clarise Faria, who runs The Loft Project supper club in Hackney, east London, says pre-paying doesn’t just serve as a vehicle for discounts and deals. It divorces the dining experience from the less pleasant experience of handing over money; it allows chefs to plan food costs, leading to less wastage; and it protects venues from cancellations. “We can’t afford to have an empty table due to no shows,” she says.Mr Kokonas agrees: “If four people cancel at Alinea at the last minute, that’s 5 per cent of our revenue for the day. Restaurant margins are narrow. You have two no-shows, and our day is shot.”Still, for all its advantages, some industry watchers are sceptical that the mini-trend of advance-pay will spread further. Robert Ancill, chief executive of the restaurant consultancy The Next Idea (no relation to Next Restaurant) points out that dining-out tends to be an impulse-driven activity and that customers want flexibility.In Whitbread’s restaurants division, meanwhile, pre-paying of a sort is happening by stealth – when corporate travel managers add breakfast or dinner to employees’ Premier Inn hotel stays. That advance notice improves efficiency at the buying and staffing levels, according to Alan Parker, outgoing chief executive.And if one UK group was well positioned to embrace the more radical dynamic pricing approach of Next Restaurant, it would be Whitbread – if only because Mr Parker’s replacement, Andy Harrison, arrives after serving as chief executive at the master of the model, EasyJet."
650;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Coffee price soars on low crop fears;Mounting fears of of lower crops in key producing nations;Coffee roasters are considering a second round of retail price rises after the cost of arabica beans surged on Thursday above the key $2 a pound level for the first time in 13 years due to fears of lower crops in key producing nations.“We are on a very tight supply and demand balance for Arabica beans,” said José Sette, a senior official at the International Coffee Organisation in London. He said the arabica coffee market was on a “knife edge”.Officials and traders said that supplies from Vietnam, which produces mostly the lower- quality robusta bean, were lower than expected due to heavy rains. Output in leading high-quality Arabica producers in Colombia and Central America is also feared lower than expected.Wayne Hanscomb, director of commodities at Swiss-based United Coffee, one of Europe’s largest roasters, said the coffee market was driven by concerns about weather-related crop losses.Supplies of Colombia’s prized, hand-picked arabica beans dropped last year to a 33-year low of 7.8m bags, each of 60kg, down nearly a third from 11.1m bags in 2008, tightening global markets. This year, traders were expecting a recovery towards 10.5m bags in 2010-11, closer to the country’s recent average of 11m-12m bags, but most recent estimates put the country’s output at just 9m-9.5m bags.Kona Haque, agricultural commodities analyst at Macquarie, said the biggest concern for coffee retailers was simply securing enough supplies of high-grade Colombian coffee. “Some of the jars on supermarket shelves no longer say pure Colombian coffee. They’re having to blend lower-quality substitutes because they can’t get Colombian coffee,” she said.The industry is also concerned that coffee output in Brazil, the world’s largest producer, will be lower than expected and supplies will drop further next year.Stocks in producing countries, the cushion against supply outages, are at the lowest level since official records began in 1960.In late afternoon trading in New York, ICE March Arabica coffee surged to 204.80 cents per pound, the highest level since June 1997 and 3.3 per cent up on the day.Coffee roaster executives said retail price increases were “inevitable” if Arabica prices consolidated above $2 a pound.Coffee roasters increased their prices this year after wholesale costs surged to 175 cents per pound. JM Smucker, which distributes the Dunkin’ Donuts, Millstone and Folgers coffee brands to US retailers, Kraft and Starbucks have all announced increases.Howard Schultz, Starbucks chief executive, said last month that “dramatically” higher commodity costs had “altered the economic and financial picture” of the industry.In London, Liffe January robusta coffee rose to a two-year high of $1,892 a tonne, up 2.8 per cent on the day.In other commodity markets, oil prices tumbled amid high stocks and a strong US dollar.Nymex December West Texas Intermediate fell $1.98 to $80.56 a barrel. ICE December Brent dropped $1.77 to $81.83 a barrel.Gold prices also moved lower after the dollar rose against the euro. In London, spot bullion fell to $1.324 a troy ounce, down 1.5 per cent on the day.
651;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Whitbread thrives in coffee shops and hotels;;"Alan Parker cannot help but compare Whitbread, the company he will be leaving next month after 18 years, with the pub groups that were once its peers.“We were criticised for being a bit too conservative,” he recalled of the time when pub companies such as Punch Taverns and Enterprise Inns embarked on a period of debt-funded growth while Whitbread was cutting back.But he resisted putting the three companies in the same class today: “When I look and see what has happened to …not rivals, but other companies, I’m glad we didn’t go that route.”Under Mr Parker’s six-year tenure as chief executive, Whitbread has gone from being a pub company with 100,000 employees to a sleeker 35,000-person hotel and coffee-shop operator that has a significant and growing presence in emerging markets.Indeed, Starbucks and Hilton have edged out Punch and Enterprise as the real competition now.The winnowing of Whitbread under Mr Parker kicked off in 2006, when the company sold 239 pub-restaurants.That year it also retreated from non-pub restaurants, shedding its 50 per cent stake in Pizza Hut UK; in 2007, it sold TGI Fridays.Finally it let go of the David Lloyd fitness club business for £925m ($1.5bn) in June 2007 at the height of the market.“It was brilliant in terms of timing,” said Nigel Parson, an analyst at Evolution Securities. And while the group’s strategy was in place by the time Mr Parker took the helm from his predecessor, David Thomas, “a lot of strategy is about execution these days”, according to Mr Parson. “Anyone can come up with a strategy.”Mr Parker – who rose up the ranks through Whitbread’s hotels business – remains sceptical about the restaurant industry, calling it “overbuilt in this country”, and made clear that any expansion by Whitbread of its restaurants – which include Brewers Fayre and Beefeater – would come in the form of joint-site development with Premier Inn hotels.And yet he believes that UK customers will seek out “everyday affordable treats”, including flat white coffees or takeout breakfasts from a revamped Costa morning menu, even in a difficult economy. That means, he says, continued growth at home will serve as a strong base for steady expansion abroad.Therein lies the strategic challenge for Mr Parker’s successor Andy Harrison, the former chief executive of EasyJet.Costa contributed just 8 per cent to group profits in 2008-09 and analysts are more encouraged by its international expansion plans than they are by those of Premier Inn, where growth requires steeper investments – and where the brand is less recognised. Should the coffee chain be cut free?Mr Parker is sceptical. “We didn’t get rid of businesses because they were doing well,” he pointed out, reviewing his restructuring of the group.“We’ve proved without a doubt that Whitbread can run Costa extremely well.”"
652;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;Shoppers get taste of geographic marketing;;British shoppers will soon be receiving money-off offers from Starbucks and L’Oréal over their mobile phones, in the most ambitious deployment yet of new location-based wireless marketing technology outside of Japan.The two brands are both launching promotions on the UK’s O2 mobile phone network, owned by Spain’s Telefónica, the world’s third-largest mobile phone company, using a “geofencing” system that directs text messages to customers when they are in the proximity of stores.Ken Leitch, a spokesman for O2 said: “There’s been talk for years in the advertising world about the possibility of location-based mobile phone marketing. But this is it, now. It’s a reality.”Starbucks will use the system not only around its UK stores, but also around grocery stores, sending numerical codes that can give the recipient 50 pence off its new Via instant coffee.L’Oréal is using “geofences” set up around Superdrug, the high street health and beauty retailer, to promote sales of its Elvive brand hair products.Mr Leitch said other brands would join the service within coming weeks, which is available to about one million customers who have signed up promotions and offers from the carrier’s “O2 More” service.The system uses global satellite positioning technology developed by Placecast, a private US company.Placecast has previously launched brand-specific geofencing systems in the US for North Face, the outdoor clothing brand and retailer owned by VF Corp, and American Eagle, a youth clothing chain.But O2’s base of about a million customers that have opted to receive messages is far larger than previous brand-specific efforts.Alistair Goodman, Placecast’s chief executive, said the company was setting up about 1,500 geofences across the UK for Starbucks and L’Oréal, giving marketers the ability to tie specific offers to specific locations should they choose, or to react to local weather conditions.The targeted locations, he said, would extend beyond the immediate vicinity of the stores.“Expanding the size of the geofences a little is actually more effective …It’s about getting consumers who are in the mood to purchase, who are heading for the high street for their weekend shopping trip.”Its GPS-based service is now vying for attention from marketers with other location-based social networks, such as FourSquare, which can be used to offer promotions to customers who use their mobile phones to register their presence at retail locations.In the US, several leading retailers, including Best Buy, Macy’s and Target, are now testing Shopkick, a system that uses a non-audible audio signal to send promotions to participating customers’ mobile phones when they enter a store.
653;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-10-13T19:49:57Z;Brands get up close and personal;;A Chinese woman squats on a low plastic stool, reaches for the shampoo and begins massaging it into her head, fingers working deep into her scalp in a kind of ritual. She is not the only Chinese woman to use conditioner like this – as testified by hundreds of hours of videotape, all filmed in Chinese bathrooms.Perverse? Pornography? Neither: this is the Holy Grail of fast-moving consumer goods companies seeking to make products that consumers want. To that end, FMCG groups are earnestly studying human behaviour through focus groups, surveys and, more frequently in recent years, ways that are distinctly up close and personal.The business of consumer research is intensifying on virtually every level. FMCG companies, which typically spend 2-3 per cent of sales on research and development, are going further afield geographically and conducting ever deeper research. New media are being harnessed, be it through social networks or blogs.“Traditional research concentrated on the ‘what’. Now we are trying to establish the ‘why’,” says Simon Stewart, marketing director at Britvic, the beverages company. “We are not asking what they think about products and ideas but focusing on what makes them tick.”The spread of digital social networks is one reason for the more sophisticated approach. But changing market dynamics are also behind the new focus. Competition and a weak economy make it ever more important to win customers, particularly in emerging markets. Indeed, so lucrative is the business of understanding what makes the Asian consumer tick that Singapore, never a place to miss a business opportunity, plans next year to set up a government-funded Institute for Asia Consumer Insights.The same dynamics inform L’Oréal’s experimentation in bathroom photography. In similar experiments conducted in other markets, the French cosmetics group discovered that Korean women apply more potions and cosmetics to their faces than anyone else – a total of more than 25 creams and cosmetics at any one time, compared with 20-25 in Japan and more than double the amount used by American or European women. Japanese women may apply more than 50 coatings of mascara at one time, making European women – five to 10 coatings – look mere amateurs.“It all starts with observation,” says Patricia Pineau, who oversees L’Oréal’s consumer insights team, talking about the company’s “evaluation centres”, which involve “labs” decked out as bathrooms as well as cameras in people’s homes.“Observing is necessary to decode exactly what [women] are trying to get and what they are attracted to. Sometimes it is the gesture that will reveal something that they really want to gain,” says Ms Pineau.And what gestures. Japanese women spend a full minute massaging in lotions, patting their faces and eyelids. In Brazil, women change their nail polish every day to match their dress – and are wanton with the brush, painting their fingers along with their nails and relying on a cotton bud to mop up afterwards.Back in the labs, scientists respond in turn. Thus Lancôme’s Génifique Youth Activating Concentrate has a stickier consistency in Japan than in Europe or the US, the better to pat in. Lip gloss is lighter in Japan, the better to allow the constant reapplication beloved of Japanese women.Sometimes, however, gestures are not enough. Hence Nestlé’s strategy of embedding researchers in family homes, taking tea with a multigenerational Indian family or sitting cross-legged on the floor pounding pulses with a group of scarved women and their jeans-wearing daughters in Syria.Chandan Mukherji is a veteran of embedding. The New Delhi-based head of consumer insights at Nestlé India has in recent years watched the lifestyle of the middle classes in towns and cities seep out to the villages and countryside. Seated at the family table, he saw housewives were turning to instant noodles but that they still supplemented them with extra vegetables and garnishes. Nestlé responded by supplementing its own instant noodles with vegetables.“It really is an eye-opener for most of the teams, because they get a real life understanding,” says Mr Mukherji.Also, after witnessing at first hand India’s small kitchens and vulnerability to rodent infestations, the Swiss group reduced pack sizes.Drinks companies take a similarly up close and broad remit – looking not just at what people like to drink but where and how. Take SABMiller, the brewer. In the important market of Latin America, the urge to go out to where its drinks were actually drunk – and especially to mix that favourite cocktail of beer and football – was strong but the availability of venues less so.Rob Priday, managing director of SABMiller’s Peruvian operations, says: “There’s a dearth of pubs in the country. In the terrorist years, people did not go out and now it is over, there are not enough pubs for on-premises drinking.”Research showed that consumers want­ed more choice of places to drink and the results can be seen on the streets of Colombia and Peru. The company worked with local businesses and entrepreneurs to open café-style joints attached to soccer fields, where fathers can down a glass while their children play – or even have a kick-about themselves before sinking a glass or two. There are also bars where customers can play simulated golf or a few rounds of cards.When Nestlé in Peru was debating which new flavour to introduce for its popular Besos de Moza – a marshmallow and cookie confection – it asked sweet-toothed consumers themselves to choose between the lucuma, a local fruit, or strawberry. “The feedback was amazing,” recalls Carlos Velasco, who heads the Peruvian operation. They chose lucuma, and Nestlé went on to sell 56m lucuma-flavoured units in 2009.Asking consumers directly is valuable but FMCG companies also call on a range of experts: historians for historical context (say, the caste system in India), psychologists, anthropologists and ethnologists and even semioticians.Greg Rowland, a semiotician based in London, advises FMCG companies on the messages they need to send to woo customers through their packaging and placing on supermarket shelves.Supermarkets, Mr Rowland says, are a battleground between puritan and hedonistic pleasures – plain fruit and veg stalls as customers first walk in, with the indulgent pleasures of alcohol and chocolate waiting to assail them further down the aisles.We instinctively want to stay on the sober side, says Mr Rowland, so packaging of indulgent items is classily low-key. Hence the naive smiley face on Innocent’s drink cartons or the use of white space on packaging for top-notch biscuits. Or take the heraldic devices on bottles of lager, designed to establish the brewer’s authority in the minds of drinkers. This is serious stuff, the emblems say, none of your “hooch”.For all the time, money and expert investigation FMCG companies throw into understanding consumers, mistakes are made. During research into Japanese skincare, a L’Oréal team was surprised to see a woman supplementing her beauty routine with a tiny razor.She slid it around her nose, below her eyebrows and on the nape of her neck. The reason: she was removing almost imperceptible hairs to get a better effect when powder was applied. As a non-daily ritual, and one that required the woman to bring her own razors (which were not on offer in L’Oréal’s labs), it had until then completely bypassed the ranks of researchers.Delivery can miss a step too: SABMiller, identifying a desire for a sweeter drink for women in Peru, produced the cider-like Red – which turned out to be extremely popular with the men.But for consumers, the question is surely whether they are just victims of clever advertising.As Mr Rowland says: “You may think you are buying and eating this tin of biscuits. But really, the tin of biscuits is buying and eating you.”

655;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-10-10T21:02:10Z;Social networks dominate emerging markets;;Facebook’s twin milestones this year – reaching 500m active users, and overtaking Google’s traffic in the US – have illustrated the importance of social networking to the evolution of the web.But the enthusiasm with which people in countries outside Europe and North America are leaping on to social networks is outstripping many observers’ expectations.Seven of the top 10 countries with the most “highly engaged” internet users are in the Middle East and Africa, along with China, Brazil and Malaysia, according to a large study by TNS, WPP’s market research arm.As the internet becomes more widely accessible around the world, particularly through mobile phones, many people in these fast-growing markets are skipping the most popular forms of digital communication in the US and Europe, such as e-mail and static websites.Instead, people in China, Brazil and India are turning to two-way services such as instant messaging, social media and blogs to keep up with friends and news, TNS’s “Digital Life” survey of almost 50,000 people found.This creates a very different media environment for advertisers used to TV, newspapers and traditional web portals. Many marketers in the US are still struggling to understand Facebook and Twitter.“Because of the different histories of internet access in different parts of the world, the interaction with it is very different, and will continue to be,” says Matthew Froggatt, chief development officer at TNS. “The lives that people lead online are very complex and fragmented – the path to purchase can be radically different.”Even within the faster-growing markets, attitudes to advertising and brands online can vary widely, TNS found. In China, just 9 per cent of those surveyed found brands intrusive on social networks, with 48 per cent actively seeking them out. On the web at least, China’s appetite for brands far outstrips that of European or American consumers.Indian web users, however, are highly resistant to advertising online. Just 4 per cent of people look for brands on social networks, and 69 per cent said they found them intrusive. In spite of – or perhaps because of – the amount of advertising on TV and in the streets, young consumers see the internet as a much more personal space.Yet China takes a more private approach to social networking than most countries.More than 70 per cent use personal instant messaging services such as Tencent’s QQ, while Chinese people have just 68 friends online, well below the global average.Brazil tops the social networking leagues, with half of web users posting messages to sites such as Facebook and Google’s Orkut. Brazilians also have the most friends on social sites at 231, just behind the Malaysians with 233, while the Japanese, Tanzanians and South Koreans have the least number of connections per person, at 29, 38 and 50 respectively.Russians are the most active in posting to micro-blogging services such as Twitter, used by 32 per cent of the online population, while the Chinese spend the most time reading other people’s short posts.Many large brands, including Coca-Cola and Starbucks, are already trying to tap into all this activity by using Facebook as their primary channel to contact customers.Prompted by social media, consumer goods companies Unilever and Procter & Gamble are hiking the portion of their online advertising budgets, even selling products such as nappies or shampoo directly from Facebook.Research about consumer attitudes towards Facebook, compiled by OpinionWay for DDB, an ad agency, found media and entertainment brands had the most popular pages on the site, followed by charities or causes, and fashion or luxury goods.Many of the advertisements sold by Facebook on its site encourage users to “like” a product or brand, meaning they opt into receiving updates in their news feed.DDB’s poll of 1,642 consumers in six countries found people “like” an average of nine brands.The main reasons for doing so include receiving promotions, exclusive content and news about new products, DDB found, while many simply want to share the products and services they enjoy with their friends.
656;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-10-10T18:57:50Z;One restaurant, nine MBAs;;For an intrepid entrepreneur holding down two jobs, Jeff Wei wakes at a leisurely 9am. In his defence, however, he only finishes his second job as a senior project manager for a multinational company after 1am.By midday he is at the Shanghai restaurant, Cheers, which he and eight classmates from his MBA programme opened in July.“It’s a place where everyone knows your name,” laughs Mr Wei, 34, who grew up in Taiwan. “Of course not many Chinese people have seen the TV show but they like the atmosphere here anyway.”So, it seems, do the westerners who make up half the restaurant’s clientele. “Expats like a taste of home,” explains Mr Wei, the restaurant’s chief executive.The expats’ mere presence, according to Mr Wei, attracts Shanghai’s growing middle classes, who are eager to sample a western lifestyle.The nine restaurateurs, eight men and a woman, were all members of the class of 2009 international MBA programme run at the Sauder School of Business at the University of British Columbia and Jiao Tong University in Shanghai. Six of the nine were placed in an original team at the start of the programme to work on various projects and they poached the remaining trio after graduating.“Initially, we didn’t even talk the same language,” says Mr Wei, who speaks English, Mandarin and Japanese. “Some of us are Chinese, others grew up in Canada or the US and another comes from Thailand. By the end of the course though we all communicated effectively in both English and Chinese.”Mr Wei enrolled in the MBA partly to make contact with like-minded students. “Jiao Tong is a prestigious school and going there allows you to meet some of the brightest people in Shanghai. It helps you build connections, which are very important if you’re trying to start a business in China. Even if you already have a basic plan for your venture, the MBA allows you to network with people who will be of incredible value to that plan in the future.”Networking aside, Mr Wei believes the MBA course work is crucial to running a successful business. Financial management, accounting and marketing courses have proved useful, but it is the case studies and projects that have been most beneficial.“One particular project we worked together on stands out. It was a marketing case study on Starbucks. We found it fascinating how they successfully started out their business from a small coffee shop in Seattle and maintained that success and managed to grow the operation in China. During that project, we exchanged many ideas on how to start a successful business in Shanghai.“By working together so closely we discovered each other’s strengths . . . It was probably during that project that we decided to form our partnership to open a business.”Shanghai has an exploding middle class with plenty of money to spend, says Mr Wei and once they had settled on Cheers they knew they needed something different to attract the crowds. “We felt that there was no similar business model in the city and that if we could get it right, we’d be quite successful,” he adds.They contributed Rmb2m ($299,000) to set up the business. All nine stakeholders have an equal partnership, but an executive board runs the business.Mr Wei relies heavily on his MBA colleagues Ivan Sun, the chief financial officer, and Perry Shen, who uses his knowledge as a Shanghai native to get the best deals as the procurement manager. Initially it was difficult to secure the right permits, says Mr Wei, “Which was where Ivan proved very helpful”.The executive board has set a target of Rmb1m turnover for the first six months and wants to grow the business by 20 to 30 per cent in the next two years. The board has also been in contact with venture capitalists.“We plan to open another Cheers by the end of the year. We’ve also spoken to the school’s alumni. They haven’t put up any money yet but some of the alumni are interested in opportunities in Shanghai,” says Mr Wei.After overseeing the restaurant’s operations, Mr Wei heads out at 6pm to begin work as a project manager. “It’s exhausting, but it’s also very exciting. Shanghai is the best place in the world to do business.”
657;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:22:14+0000;Rich Americans for tax increases;;I am in Seattle, where the city’s business aristocracy is divided over a referendum on whether to hit the rich with a local income tax. The division goes all the way to the top of Microsoft, where the chairman and founder Bill Gates is supporting plans for a local income tax on rich residents of Washington state, while the CEO – Gates’s old friend, Steve Ballmer – has contributed to the campaign to defeat the tax proposal: proposition 1098.Gates’s support is not that surprising, since one of the main movers behind the campaign for higher taxes is his father, Bill Gates senior – a very spry 84-year-old. The plan is to hit all people with incomes over $400,000 a year with a tax of an extra 4%. People with an income of over $1m would be subjected to a tax of 9%. Gates senior has even filmed a supportive ad about soaking the rich, which sees him being dunked in a water tank.Other big local employers such as Amazon and Boeing have also come out against the Washington tax-hike.Some believe that this is a fight with national resonance, which might show that it really is possible to increase taxes on the rich in the US. But I am not so sure. Washington is quite a liberal state and Seattle, home to Microsoft, Amazon, Boeing and Starbucks, has been described as America’s only Scandanavian city.
658;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-10-01T20:57:20Z;The art of the bleedin’ obvious is now an art;Overnight, behavioural economists have become interesting;"Behavioural economics, baby; that’s where it’s at these days. Have you ever sat in Starbucks and asked yourself why the logo is that particular shade of green? No, of course not (although you might have wondered why a global coffee chain makes such God-awful cups of Joe).But apparently, thousands of people are content to while away the hours reading books which popularise and address exactly these issues; short tomes with one word names like Nudge, Blink, Think, Bonk and Bosh. It’s almost always one word, although they also have more worthy subtitles, like “How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference” and “The Power of Thinking Without Thinking”. And however slim the volume, it is always 26 times longer than the original New Yorker article, which condensed the idea into nine pages.You can’t blame the authors – after all, they’re behavioural economists, of course they’ll alter their behaviour if there’s money involved. And there’s more than a cash incentive. Overnight, economists have become interesting: women find them attractive; TV producers call. You trade in your specs and calculators for contact lenses and a pair of Converse trainers and all of a sudden it’s “My God, Mr Levitt, but you’re beautiful.”So naturally, I’ve been thinking of getting into this line for a while now. But it was the news that David Cameron has hired his own Nudge unit for Downing Street that spurred me into action.Just in case you don’t know, Nudge essentially posits that small changes to the way choices are framed can lead to dramatically different outcomes. It’s brilliant. Just think about it: if only the US airports had had a better-placed Starbucks on 9/11 the hijackers would have given up their plan and gone for a Danish instead (or maybe sat there wondering why the logo is that particular shade of green). There are other ways to change behaviour; for example, people are heavily influenced by the actions of others. So even if the coffee shop hadn’t worked, large signs saying “99.9 per cent of people don’t crash their planes into buildings” could have had an impact.So, it’s great for economists, but it’s rather depressing to see national leaders falling for it. I’m not saying it’s without merit if you want to shift more beans at Tesco or create a better drink-driving campaign, but reframing the “choice architecture” is not much use in persuading Iran to give up the bomb. “So, Mahmoud: dirty, dangerous nukes or clean, green windmills?”But DC has a personal troop of nudgers to help him set policy. You have to wonder if it’s matched by a Wink unit in the Home Office and the Say No More team at the Treasury. I hear the Treasury team has already been highly productive, building on the work of the Nudgers to come up with a new economic model which concludes that if you look after the pennies the pounds will look after themselves. Teams of “penny-wise guys”, as they call them, are looking into it.To be fair to the government, this sort of thinking can be terribly useful for administrations with a) no money, b) no ideas, and c) no desire to upset anyone. No ideology of your own? Don’t worry, here’s one I picked up on Amazon for £9.99, and it’s only 200 pages long.Still, it’s a little sad. Once we had brave and charismatic leaders who nationalised the railways and built the NHS. Then we had other brave and charismatic leaders who reorganised the NHS and privatised the railways. Now we have leaders who want us to eat more fruit. Even those who wanted to nanny us had to get up and say so; now we just have secret nannies discreetly rearranging the pomegranates at the checkout and we’re all dosed up on antioxidants. It’s not exactly The Road to Serfdom, is it?Anyway, I’m hopping on to the bandwagon. My first book, Duh! Have You Ever Thought of Trying the Bleedin’ Obvious, will be out in time for Christmas, followed next year by Dope: I’m Smart But You’re Stupid. If all goes well, Dosh: Why I’m Getting Richer and You Just Got Poorer will be out for next Christmas. Sorry, that’s the phone; must dash – probably one of the Milibands.robert.shrimsley@ft.com"
659;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:22:14+0000;Churches: Riches in this life, salvation in the next;;The Sunday service at the Daystar Christian Centre, a Pentecostal church in Lagos, is a slick affair. The pastors wear business suits, the security guards wear head mics, and a “multimedia team” films and airs the service live on the internet.On a typical Sunday, Daystar attracts up to 5,000 people to each of its four services. The church also owns a publishing company and recording studio, which sell “motivational” books and CDs, and a primary school.“When I said I wanted to be a pastor, my parents were worried that I would not make ends meet,” says Sam Adeyemi, Daystar’s founder and top pastor.“Pastoring is more attractive now than when I started. People see that pastors are dressed well and have good tools for their job, like a banker.”Mr Adeyemi says he set up his church in 1995 after a conversation with God. The subsequent success of the 43-year-old civil engineer, whose family construction company was in the doldrums by the time he graduated, is by no means unusual.Nigeria’s Pentecostal churches are thriving at home and overseas. Pentecostalism, thought to have begun in the US just over 100 years ago, involves miracles, demons and speaking in tongues.The Living Faith Church, better known as Winners Chapel, is one of the country’s largest such groups. Set up in 1981 by David Oyedepo, Winners says it has 400 domestic branches and also operates in more than 50 countries from the US to Malaysia.Its headquarters near Lagos contain a 50,000-seat church, a hotel and a university.“Kenyan and Zimbabwean churches are not even continent-wide, but the Nigerian churches are like huge multinationals,” says Paul Gifford, an expert on African Pentecostalism at the School of Oriental and African Studies, part of London university.Mr Gifford says Pentecostalism has seen accelerated growth across Africa since the mid-1980s, partly because of a focus on spirits that mirrors traditional beliefs and a promise of wealth that appeals to largely poor followers.The Nigerian groups indeed focus heavily on “prosperity preaching”. Followers who support their God and their church will enjoy both riches in this life and salvation in the next, many pastors say.“I prophesy that you will have financial and material success beyond your imagination. The curse of poverty on Africa – that curse is broken,” Mr Adeyemi cries at the climax of his service. He had warned against society’s obsession with money earlier in his speech – but his final words draw the biggest cheers.The pastors say they motivate largely poor congregations to find ways to earn a living and better themselves. Mr Adeyemi’s church even runs business courses, while his self-help books have titles such as The Parable of Dollars: Proven Strategies for Your Financial Success.A richer flock is also in the church’s interest. Most Pentecostal groups encourage followers to pay tithes, whereby they hand over 10 per cent of their monthly income, as do some other Christian churches. Further voluntary donations take place at services.He estimates that, on average, his followers donate N100 ($0.66) each during a service. This amounts to up to $13,000 a week – tithes, course fees and book sales aside.Critics say that, while the churches amass wealth, few worshippers ever see the promised transformation in their own finances. Upbeat pastors capitalise on poverty, they say, by presenting themselves as a route to change.“The economic life of the pastor is booming, while the economic life of the country is grinding to a halt,” says Augustus Macaulay, director of the United Bible University in Lagos, which trains Methodist preachers. “There must be something wrong there.”The Winners group has two private jets and plans to buy a third for David Abioye, a pastor and its vice-president.The Redeemed Christian Church of God, a movement that claims to have churches in more than 100 countries, also has its own aircraft. The business model of Redeemed is often compared to that of ubiquitous brands such as Starbucks, the US chain of coffee shops.Rather than focusing on a few large churches, Redeemed seeks to set up small branches in as many towns as possible. When a church reaches a certain size, it is encouraged to split.While Nigeria’s Pentecostal pastors behave like canny entrepreneurs, their followers, in turn, behave like fickle consumers. When the hoped-for riches fail to arrive, many worshippers move on in the search for a product that works.“When I was young, fewer people went to church – but they were dedicated,” says Mr Macaulay, who is 73-years-old. “Now people will move from church to church when they hear new promises.”
660;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-09-16T22:29:17Z;China boxes clever on mooncakes;A holiday delicacy is becoming a soft currency;At a branch of Xing Hua Lou, a famous traditional bakery chain in Shanghai, the evidence of the upcoming Autumn Moon Festival is visible. Thousands of boxes of mooncakes are stacked high inside the store and the staff can barely move.Outside the store, meanwhile, touts try to entice customers in with laminated pamphlets offering up to 25 per cent off the listed price.The Autumn Moon Festival – which this year falls on September 22 – is a traditional Chinese holiday. It is feted by the consumption of mooncakes, the roundness of the sweet pastry symbolising the union of family members.According to the Shanghai Confectionery Industry Association, 21,000 tonnes of mooncakes were sold in the city in 2009 – worth Rmb1.85bn ($275m). Sales for the whole of China were estimated at Rmb11bn according to China Reports Hall, a market research firm based in Xiamen.“It’s the time of the year for businesses to show gratitude to their business partners, to the government officials and to their own employees,” says Shaun Rein, the managing director of China Market Research (CMR) Group in Shanghai. “It’s a vital way of building relationships.”However, in recent years the gifting of mooncakes has taken on a new significance in China, where a show of purchasing power and price-indexed gratitude has become more important. “As people get richer, they need more expensive gifts,” says Mr Rein.Food retailers have cashed in on this opportunity with zeal. At Xing Hua Lou, single mooncakes, which typically cost about Rmb5 each, are repackaged in gift tins. The lowest price for a basic boxed set of eight goes for Rmb78, while for those seeking luxury there is a Rmb780 version filled with abalone fins.Western retailers such as Starbucks and Häagen-Dazs have also embraced the seasonal retail opportunity. Häagen-Dazs, whose mooncake vouchers are one of the most circulated in China, offers boxed sets that range in price from Rmb268 to Rmb988 – a steep price tag for many Chinese workers.Kris Kaminsky, the food and beverage manager at the Portman Ritz-Carlton in Shanghai, says the hotel expects to sell about 20,000 of its boxes this year. The value is often not in the mooncakes, he says, but in the presentation. “We’ve created a very nice red box that looks like a jewellery box. It’s a box to be kept after the mooncakes are eaten.”Mooncakes are also the most re-gifted item in China. “Many people give their mooncakes to someone else,” says Shen Hongfei, a well-known food writer. “Not because people don’t want to eat them but because some receive so many gift boxes that they want to offer them as presents. It’s a sign of respect and gives face.”Byron Kan, the general manager of the Shanghai Centre, which houses the Portman Ritz-Carlton Hotel, has chosen to give Häagen-Dazs gift certificates this year to his corporate clients.“[Mooncakes] are indeed vital, must-do corporate gifts,” he says. “But when companies started giving more and more extravagant mooncake gifts, to the point that the packaging and the gifts inside cost more than the mooncakes [themselves], the government decided to step in a few years ago and put a limit on the price.”Now you can no longer buy a mooncake box with a watch as a gift inside or with solid-gold packaging.”Many vouchers are returned for cash, allowing touts and middlemen to make a healthy profit margin. But as with any paper asset with an expiration date, the window for such buy and sell activity is limited. “The value of these mooncake vouchers go up and down according to how close one gets to the final date,” says Mr Rein of CMR.Paul Smith, the president of Costa Coffee China, which expects to sell 8,000 boxes from its 70 outlets this year, offers his own solution. “We honour the vouchers for up to one year after the date,” he says.“So if they don’t get to collect for this year, they can do it next year.”
661;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-09-10T15:34:09Z;Breakfast sales boost JD Wetherspoon profits;;"A continued programme of new pub openings and the increasing popularity of its breakfasts and coffees have helped to buoy full-year sales at JD Wetherspoon, with revenues particularly buoyant toward the end of the summer.Total sales rose just over 4 per cent for the full year to July, although most of these sales increases came from new pubs; the group opened 47 new pubs during the year, taking its total estate to 775 pubs.Like-for-like sales, which exclude the impact of new pub openings, were only up 0.1 per cent during the year. But there was a marked improvement towards the end of the 12-month period, with like-for-like sales up 1.5 per cent in the six weeks to September.Some of the improvement toward the end of the financial year can be attributed to earlier opening hours.In April, more than 90 per cent of Wetherspoon pubs began opening at 7am, allowing the group to serve breakfasts, and in the past year it served 400,000 breakfasts and 600,000 coffees each week. Last year, when the group did not break down the figures, JD Wetherspoon sold a combined 715,000 breakfasts and coffees per week.“The 7am opening has had an encouraging start,” said Keith Down, finance director of JD Wetherspoon.“In breakfasts we’re second only to McDonald's and in coffee we’re third only to Starbucks and Costa Coffee so [breakfast and coffee] is a big area for us.”Pre-tax profits for the year increased 3.4 per cent to £60m on revenues that rose 4.3 per cent to £996m. Excluding exceptional items, pre-tax profits rose 7.3 per cent to £71m. Earnings per share rose 61 per cent to 29.3p. JD Wetherspoon paid a full-year dividend of 19p, 7p of which was a special dividend.Shares in JD Wetherspoon fell 3.6p to 439.9p.The proverbial early bird catches the worm, and for JD Wetherspoon, the early birds have helped the group to turn round falling food sales. At the half-year, before early opening was introduced, the group’s like-for-like food sales were down 1 per cent. But by the year-end, like-for-like sales of food were up 0.1 per cent, a catch-up that was built on a foundation of several million sausages and coffees. This superior food performance compares with sales of drinks that fell 0.8 per cent, and thus marks a reversal of Wetherspoon’s traditional strength in drinks and relative weakness in food. The group’s shares are on a forward p/e of just under 12, compared with Mitchells & Butlers on 10. Growing food sales are being built at the expense of margin in the short term. But investors may judge that the potential of Wetherspoon’s food market and its continued expansion programme justifies this premium."
662;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-09-10T01:46:21Z;Engage those tweeting customers;;From Mr Paul Raeburn.Sir, It’s rare that business leaders are criticised for being too close to their customers ( “Twitter is no way to manage a smelly mess”, September 6), but the sight of executives engaging with customers on social media should not be dismissed as a waste of their valuable time.Whereas previously a chief executive might make a flying visit to a store, speaking to and witnessed by a handful of customers, social media means such interactions can be more regular and potentially “seen” by thousands of others with an interest in the company.Consumers are increasingly sharing honest views on social media, rarely bothering to fill in long feedback forms or make formal complaints. So tracking what is said online can provide valuable insight for a CEO. The sheer volume of mentions for major brands such as Starbucks might seem daunting, but creating teams of people to spot, engage and resolve customer service issues online is now common practice even for banks, with Bank of America and Wells Fargo in the US doing what mobile phone companies such as O2 pioneered.As for the impact of a critical tweet from a celebrity, well, one swallow certainly doesn’t make a summer. But if a few of Armando Iannucci’s celebrity friends were to pile in and agree, suddenly several thousands of people would be seeing criticism of Starbucks from celebrities and public figures that they look up to. Reason enough to engage and manage the situation from the off.Paul Raeburn,Fishburn Hedges, London WC2, UK
663;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-09-05T17:33:25Z;Twitter is no way to manage a smelly mess;Offhand comment triggers corporate overkill;"On the bank holiday weekend, the political satirist Armando Iannucci was driving along the M40 to spend a couple of days in Snowdonia and stopped off at a Starbucks on the way. As he is a man who likes to record all his thoughts on Twitter, he dispatched this message to his 80,000 followers: “Still surprised that, despite their market dominance, Starbucks haven’t eliminated the slight smell of lavatory you get as you enter.”Within minutes, Darcy Willson-Rymer, the UK head of Starbucks, had replied: “Thanks for your feedback. Which store did you visit?”Mr Iannucci confirmed that he was at the Warwick services but that the pong was in several stores. The managing director thanked him again and promised to investigate. The satirist then tweeted: “Good news. Starbucks are now looking into their pervasive lavatory smell.”Social media experts will tell you that this is a perfect example of how companies should reply to customers on Twitter. The response should be made quickly and politely by someone senior. That way, customers get heard and corporate reputations get protected.But to me, this exchange does not seem like a good example of anything. Instead, it shows how social networking is making management focus on the wrong things and boring everyone else in the meantime.Lavatorygate raises three important questions. The first is: does the coffee chain really smell like a lavatory? If it does, the MD should not have been relying on this circuitous and random route to make the discovery. Surely his staff should have tipped him off long ago.The second question is about reputation. Does it matter that a satirist tells his 80,000 Twitter followers that he thinks Starbucks stinks? I doubt it. As far as I can tell none of them responded and I’d be amazed if even one person had coffee that morning at Caffè Nero instead.Still, even if Mr Iannucci’s remarks were potentially damaging, they raise a third question: what should Starbucks have done about it?Mr Willson-Rymer’s “thanks for your feedback” followed the traditional formula for customer complaints, but on Twitter it rings even more hollow than usual. If I were the head of Starbucks and a famous smart alec had just claimed that my stores stank of lavatories, I’d feel more like flushing his head down the nearest toilet than thanking him. More importantly, though, Mr Iannucci’s tweet wasn’t feedback. It was an observation to his followers. It wasn’t addressed to Starbucks and there was therefore no need for Starbucks to reply.And at least by not attending to such stuff, a lot of management time would have been saved. I’ve just searched for Starbucks on Twitter and every minute about a dozen people tweet about the chain, mostly saying things like: “just chillin at starbucks ;)” or “I’m @ starbucks haha”. Floating around in this pigswill were some genuine complaints: about a leaking cup or the odd duff vanilla latte. I contacted these people and asked if they had had replies from the company. They hadn’t.I then looked at Mr Willson-Rymer’s movements on Twitter. And there he was, manfully trying to cope in the deluge, giving directions to the nearest store, dealing with complaints on the Starbucks card, commenting on the size of a tea leaf. Minute by minute, evenings and weekends came the random responses to customer messages.In the past, Starbucks has been criticised for not listening to its customers. But this, surely, is listening gone mad. But then I had a thought: maybe this isn’t really the Starbucks MD himself doing this low-grade traffic management, as he has 700 stores to look after.So I asked if he employed someone to do this awful job for him. “No, all replies and tweets are from me,” he tweeted. “I think it is important to listen to customers and learn from the mistakes we make so I try to respond to all.”And so I thought I’d test the system. I’ve tried to compress my view of the chain – which I once expressed in a 1,000-word column – into a tweet. “Starbucks is a riddle. The coffee is weak and pricey, the decor horrid and the place often grubby. So why do we go on going there?”I tweeted it 20 hours ago but I still haven’t had a reply. Maybe it’s because Mr Willson-Rymer doesn’t know the answer any more than I do. Or maybe because I used a Twitter account that only has 10 followers and so this disgusted, yet loyal, customer doesn’t count.lucy.kellaway@ft.com"
664;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-08-29T19:06:05Z;US consumers split into two camps;;Consumer spending in the US has turned into a tale of two cities in 2010, with an entire segment of consumers splurging confidently on the finer things in life, while another segment, concerned about unemployment and with little or no discretionary income, spends only on bare necessities.This bifurcation of the US consumer has become apparent across the spectrum, from restaurants and grocery stores to products such as coffee and beer.In each case, a consistent trend has emerged: people who have survived the worst of the economic downturn of 2008-2009 with secure jobs are spending the way that consumers normally spend at the tail end of a recession. But unlike the circumstances after previous US recessions, where spending rebounded across the board, an entire segment of American consumers has been left behind.Steven Burd, chief executive of the Safeway supermarket chain, described the situation in an earnings call with analysts last month.“There are some people that still feel challenged and there are others that don’t,” Mr Burd said in response to a question about consumer spending. “There’s an element of the economy [where people] haven’t been laid off, it’s been two-plus years, they’re comfortable it’s not going to happen [and there’s been] some recovery in their investment portfolio.“They feel safe. They’re starting to spend. And then you’ve got another chunk of the economy that isn’t quite in the same position. So I think really consumer behaviour is a bit bifurcated here”.Safeway’s same-store sales declined in the second quarter compared with the year-earlier results. Whole Foods, a pricier chain of grocery stores offering organic products, reported an 8.8 per cent increase in same-store sales for its most recent quarter compared with 2009.“At least over the past year asset prices have rebounded and that helps high income individuals that would seem to align with the gut instinct that the upper end is spending and the lower end isn’t,” says Michael Feroli, economist at JPMorgan.Sung Won Sohn, professor of economics at California State University and vice-chairman of Forever 21, the retailer, describes it as “barbell” shaped behaviour by consumers.“People with money are not accelerating spending but are spending probably at the same levels as they have in the past – Mercedes and BMW are still going well,” says Mr Sohn. “But the middle-income folks in America have become extremely value-conscious.”With the exception of McDonald’s, most low-priced fast-food restaurant chains have posted weak growth in the US in 2010. Large food companies, including Kraft and PepsiCo, have also struggled with domestic sales.By contrast, same-store sales at higher-end restaurant chains such as Starbucks, Panera and Chipotle – where prices are higher than at fast-food outlets – have grown this year.At the high end of the restaurant category, steak house chain Morton’s reported an increase in quarterly sales earlier this year.At a time when US unemployment is 9.5 per cent, and a similar-sized chunk of the workforce is underemployed or not showing up on the unemployment rolls, there’s a huge divide among consumers, says Al Moffatt, chief executive of Worldwide Partners, a network of owner-operated ad agencies.“You’ll be around employed people, and it’s like, what recession?” Mr Moffatt says. “It’s incredibly well disguised. There’s some conspicuous consumption, but people skimp in other areas”.Conventional wisdom holds that in a down economy, cash-strapped beer drinkers are likely to trade down for cheaper malt beverages, but that rule does not appear to be in effect in the US this year.“Selected brands are doing well, but the whole low end is doing poorly now,” says Bump Williams, a Connecticut-based beer industry consultant. So far this year, shipments of beer in the US are down 2.6 per cent, Mr Williams says.The exception is in the high end of the beer sector where selected imports and super-premium beers are growing. The craft brewing segment, which includes speciality beers that come in 750ml bottles, is growing at a 15 per cent clip in 2010, Mr Williams says.
665;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-08-08T20:11:38Z;Best Buy taps promotions into smartphones;;Best Buy, the largest US electronics retailer, has become the first leading US retailer to start sending special offers and deals to its customers’ smartphones when they walk into one of its stores.In a sign of how the new generation of internet-connected phones is set to transform traditional retailing, a Best Buy store in San Francisco has deployed a location-based marketing tool developed by Shopkick, a California-based start-up.Customers who activate the Shopkick application on their phones will automatically receive “kickbucks” credits just for entering the store that can be traded for benefits including gift cards, computer gaming credits or music downloads from Best Buy’s Napster service. They will also receive special in-store offers from the retailer.Best Buy will eventually also be able to use the system to send participants in its loyalty scheme promotional offers that can be customised to reflect their shopping history and interests.Richard Rommel of Best Buy said that “the convergence of location technology and rewards to personalise” shopping was at the heart of the retailer’s current business strategy.Credits or price reductions are then automatically deducted from the bill at the store’s checkouts.Best Buy, with more than 1,000 stores in the US, is expected to test the system at stores in other cities including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. Macy’s, the largest department store chain in the US by sales, is also taking part in the launch of Shopkick.Unlike mobile marketing systems based on a phone’s GPS signal, the Shopkick application responds to an audio signal transmitted in the store. As a result it is far more accurate than GPS-based alternatives which can be off by a few hundred yards, and which raise potential privacy concerns because they are automatically activated.“We can tell whether you are inside or outside the door,” said Cyriac Roeding, who co-founded Shopkick last year.The past year has seen the emergence of a number of location-based social-network systems with marketing applications, including FourSquare, GoWalla and Loopt. They allow marketers to offer credits or local promotions to phone users who actively “check in” to locations such as coffee shops and bars. Starbucks, Burger King and Gap have all run reward schemes linked to “geotagging” applications, in spite of low levels of adoption.In-store mobile shopping applications are likely to become increasingly important to retailers as they seek to close deals with shoppers equipped with smartphones that can search and compare prices at rival stores and online.Separately, Levi Strauss, the denim clothing company, is to use camera-phone readable tags in the in-store marketing for the imminent relaunch of its women’s jeans business in the US. Customers who use their smartphones to scan the black and white pixellated QR tags will be directed to a YouTube video explaining the jeans’ new fit system.QR tags, widely used in Japan, have so far largely been used in the US in advertising in fashion magazines, rather than in stores.
666;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Coffee supplier to increase prices by 9%;;The company behind some of the most popular coffee brands in the US on Tuesday became the first to raise its retail prices after wholesale costs hit a 12-year high.JM Smucker, which distributes the Dunkin’ Donuts, Millstone and Folgers coffee brands to US retailers, said the 9 per cent price increase would be effective immediately.With US unemployment still above 9 per cent, and signs that the economy will remain weak in the near term, it is not clear if retailers will be able to pass along those price increases to consumers, or hold the line on prices and accept lower margins. In either case, sales of private label brands are likely to pick up.Kraft, which markets Maxwell House coffee, declined to comment.Coffee prices hit a 12-year high on Monday of more than 180 cents per pound on the back of low supplies of premium Arabica coffee from Colombia after a string of poor crops in the Latin American country.Wholesale Arabica coffee prices have surged 30 per cent since early June.The London-based International Coffee Organisation said recently that the “current tight demand and supply situation” was “likely to persist in the near to medium term”.Coffee industry executives believe wholesale coffee prices could rise further before the arrival of the new Brazilian crop later this year. “Until October it is going to be tight on high quality coffee,” said a senior executive at one of Europe’s largest coffee roasters. He added: “The industry has been surprised by the scarcity of high-quality beans.”The wholesale price of other agricultural commodities– including wheat and cocoa – has also risen sharply, opening the door for food companies to increase retail prices in the short term.So far, none of the major US coffee shop chains, including Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts, have announced plans to alter their pricing.Starbucks, in particular, is sensitive to the prices it charges. Two years ago, following a string of lacklustre earnings announcements, Howard Schultz returned to the company as chief executive and closed underperforming stores and launched a massive renovation programme for existing stores. One aspect of the renovation involved the company’s “pricing architecture”. In response to the perception that a cup of Starbucks coffee cost $4, the chain lowered the prices of some of its offerings.Tim Hortons, the Canadian chain of coffee houses, which has a large presence in the US, said the chain “books its coffee contracts for at least six months at a time, which protects its restaurant owners and customers from jumps in worldwide future markets”.
667;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-07-26T21:15:21Z;Business diary: Paul Purcell of RW Baird;;Energetic and plain-speaking, Paul Purcell joined RW Baird, the Milwaukee-based mid-market investment bank, in 1994 and took on the chief executive role in 2000. Since then, the 91-year-old bank has expanded across the US and overseas, with more than $78bn (€60bn, £50bn) of assets under management.● Wake at 5.30am at home in the Chicago suburbs, where I’ve lived for 40 years. Get ready for 6am, when my driver picks me up in my Chevrolet van which is equipped with a desk, computer, fax, printer, TV, fridge and three phones. He usually has an Americano from Starbucks waiting for me on the desk.There is a big captain’s chair and a leather bench that seats three other people, so sometimes I hold meetings in the van. I have four offices: Milwaukee – where the company is based – Chicago, home and the van. I’m logged on to the computer before we leave my driveway. I do anything I can do in a normal office – and nobody knocks on your door when you’re going at 65 miles an hour.● When I joined Baird in 1994, we agreed I would not move to Milwaukee, since my loved ones are in Chicago. My brother Phil had already been running Dean Witter in New York for 12 years while living in Chicago. He had a plane, I have a van. I drove myself for the first four years. I’ve had three different vans and covered more than 800,000 miles. I can go to any meeting within four hours’ drive. I’d rather go in the van than fly.● Arrive at Baird head office by 8.15am. I typically spend Monday in Milwaukee and Friday in Chicago and go where I need to go the other days. Start by interviewing candidates for two financial adviser positions in Charleston, South Carolina. I’ve interviewed 175 of the 180 financial advisers we have hired in the past two years. We have hired aggressively during the downturn – mostly people who have left the big banks.We have 2,500 employees worldwide – 1,000 in Milwaukee. I spend a lot of time trying to recruit, mentor and coach people in the firm. I view my job as the head coach.● Head to Chicago in the van for a charity golf tournament organised by my brother Phil. He has seven sons – two have multiple sclerosis so he raises a lot of money for research. I play with one of my sons and two good friends who work for Baird in Chicago.● While golfing I respond to e-mails on my BlackBerry. I get about 150 a day – I return all e-mails and voice messages within 24 hours, even if it is at 4am. I’m not trying to solicit an immediate response so much as to respond in a timely way – we’re in the client service business.● At home by 8.30pm, I catch up on e-mail, read the financial press and check e-mail again before bed at 11.30pm.● Get seven hours sleep and am back in the van by 7am heading for a human capital committee meeting in the Four Seasons in Chicago. Next is an all-day, monthly executive committee meeting of our top 14 people. We meet twice a year in Chicago and the rest of the time in Milwaukee. We have a complete financial and business review that involves a lot of discussion on tax changes. Usually, I spend as little time as possible in meetings – I like to make a decision and move on.● In the evening, we take 25 branch managers, the executive committee and other senior leaders in Chicago to a baseball game – the Chicago Cubs beat the Houston Astros.● Arrive back at the Four Seasons at 9.30pm, where I stay the night because I must give an early morning talk to our branch managers – a “state of the state” presentation on how the company is doing.● At 10am, I rush back to the Chicago office for a meeting with the board of Vera Bradley, a handbag company based in Fort Wayne, Indiana. We’re the lead manager on its $175m initial public offering due to be launched later this year. We’re a middle-market firm, and IPO activity in that sector has been good in the past year.
668;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-07-23T13:21:11Z;McDonald’s menu price cut pays off;;McDonald’s strategy of lowering the price of its menu in the face of high unemployment and a struggling economy appeared to pay off in the second quarter.The world’s largest fast food chain said same-store sales in the US market increased 3.7 per cent for the quarter year-on-year as more customers flocked to its outlets.McDonald’s operating profit benefited from lower costs for the foodstuffs and other materials that make up its basket of goods required for each restaurant.Peter Bensen, chief financial officer, said the basket price dropped 6 per cent in the quarter compared with the same period a year earlier, and forecast an overall decline of 3-4 per cent for the year in the company’s home market.Overall, net profit for the quarter rose 12 per cent to $1.23bn, while sales rose 5 per cent to $5.9bn. Comparable store sales, which are a more accurate barometer of performance, were up 4.8 per cent.McDonald’s reported a 5.2 per cent jump in same-store sales in Europe and a 4.6 per cent gain across the Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa regions.Don Thompson, McDonald’s president, said increased guest counts at restaurants were making up for lower price menus and lower average checks.“This was a very deliberate approach based on economy”, he said. “More than 100 per cent of our comparable sales growth is driven by guest counts.”Operating income was up 10 per cent for the quarter following a robust performance in Europe, where the UK, France and Russia delivered strong results.The company attributed this to continuing modernisation of stores, new menu items and aggressive marketing practices.“While the overall market in Europe continued to decline, we grew market share,” said Mr Thompson.However, the company warned analysts that McDonald’s future performance in Europe was likely to be affected by the austerity measures being imposed across the continent.The company has received a big boost from its roll-out of espresso-based coffee and other high-margin drinks such as frappes. That business is exceeding the company’s goal of adding $125,000 of incremental sales per unit, according to Mr Thompson.McDonald’s beverage expansion was seen as a direct attack on the core business of coffee shop chain Starbucks, but so far the two companies appear to be appealing to different diners.This week, Starbucks said sales at restaurants open at least 13 months jumped 9 per cent in the June quarter, driven by a 6 per cent increase in traffic and a 3 per cent rise in spending per visit.
669;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:00:28+0000;Wall Street bounces back on earnings;;"US stocks were boosted on Thursday by positive earnings news and companies raising their profit forecasts, outweighing worse than expected jobless claims.The S&P 500 closed up 2.2 per cent at 1,093.57, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2 per cent to 10,322.00 and the Nasdaq was 2.7 per cent higher at 2,245.89.All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 bounced back from Wednesday’s late sell-off. The index made its largest leap for two weeks, with industrials, financials and consumer discretionary stocks leading the charge.Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, continued his testimony to Congress. But his comments largely reflected topics covered on Wednesday and did not weigh on sentiment. Investors also downplayed data that showed US jobless claims rose more steeply than expected last week. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits were up 37,000 to a seasonally adjusted 464,000.There was some relief as existing house sales fell less than expected by a seasonally-adjusted 5.1 per cent in June. The S&P 500 housebuilders rose 3.4 per cent.Michael Yoshikiami, chief investment strategist at YCMNET, said: “When you see home sales numbers and jobless claims numbers that go beyond this earnings season, we can see that the next earnings season is going to be the one that’s very difficult.” He added that although companies were raising earnings projections, it was because their original forecasts were “unreasonably negative”.Among stocks in the news, AmeriCredit surged 21.4 per cent to $23.91 after General Motorsannounced it was buying the auto finance lender for $24.50 a share. The $3.5bn cash deal aims to make car-buying easier for subprime shoppers.Dell was flat in after hours trading after the SEC charged the computer maker with failing to disclose material information to investors and accounting fraud. Dell is to pay $100m and Michael Dell $4m in settlement. Amazon fell 16 per cent to $100.85 in after hours trading after it missed analysts’ estimates in its second quarter.In contrast, both Microsoft and American Express beat analysts’ expectations when they released results after the close. But after rising during the session, Microsoft nudged down 0.1 per cent to $25.81 and American Express dropped 1.9 per cent to $42.35 in after hours trading.Caterpillar, the biggest maker of earth-moving equipment, was up 1.7 per cent to $68.00 as it beat expectations and raised its full year outlook. It said its strong order book was defying concerns about the global economy. It posted a second-quarter profit of $1.09 a share, up from 60 cents a share.The S&P 500 industrials sector gained 3.1 per cent as 3M raised guidance. Emerging markets growth helped it report a 43 per cent jump in profits. Its shares rose
3 per cent to $84.75.The delivery companyUPS, seen by investors as a leading indicator for global trade, raised its annual profit forecast and posted better than expected profits. Its shares rose 5.2 per cent to $63.15. Demand for smartphones boosted earnings at AT&T, the largest US phone group and Qualcomm, which makes chips for mobile phones. AT&T reported better than expected profits. Earnings before some exceptional items were 61 cents per share, against average estimates of 57 cents. Its shares rose 2.4 per cent to $25.51.Shares in Qualcomm pushed up 8.2 per cent to $39.11 as it benefited from strong demand for smartphones based on Google’s Android technology which needs more complex, expensive chips.Earnings rose to 47 cents per share from 44 cents per share for the same period a year ago. The S&P financial sector rose 3.1 per cent and the regional banks rallying 3.9 per cent. Fifth Third Bancorp led the way, up 10.4 per cent to $12.45 after posting its first profit in four quarters and announcing lower loan loss provisions.Other companies beating expectations included Ebay, which rose 3.8 per cent to $20.94. Philip Morris International was up 1.9 per cent to $50.84.Starbucks raised full-year guidance after it reported a 37 per cent rise in third quarter profit, in line with expectations. Its shares fell 0.1 per cent to $24.69."
670;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-07-19T16:00:09Z;Case study: Helping Archimedes Pharma to grow;;"Interim managers played a key role in Archimedes Pharma’s evolution from “three guys and an idea” to a successful drugs company.When Charles Marchetti and two colleagues founded the group in 2004 they worked out of a kitchen and would meet clients in a coffee shop in London’s west end: “Our London office was the Starbucks in Piccadilly,” Mr Marchetti jokes. Today, Archimedes employs 150 staff in six countries and has sales of £25m.“Interim managers were an invaluable part of the development of our business,” he says.The founding trio, former colleagues from the pharmaceutical groups GlaxoSmithKline and Shire, initially relied on their own contact books to recruit staff. “But at some point our own networks ran dry,” he notes.They quickly saw the potential to use interim providers. “They have their own network – this is what they do,” says Mr Marchetti, who has built a relationship with RSA Interim, a provider: “Interim managers bring me flexibility and timely resolution in filling resource needs. That has a price, but it’s a price worth paying.”Before each hire, Mr Marchetti draws up a job description to establish the type of person he is looking for. This considers background requirements, the need for specific language or technical skills, as well as other factors such as whether the person is required to work from the office each day: “It depends a lot on the particular duties involved.”Mr Marchetti, who has recruited about 30 interims over the past four years, offers an example of how interim mangers can come into their own: “We were just not staffed up to monitor a clinical trial of more than 600 patients across four continents. And we couldn’t hire up a big department because what would we do with everyone after the trial? We needed medical and clinical project management expertise and we were able to secure that,” he says.Interims are also used to cover long-term illness and maternity leave.Mr Marchetti accepts that hiring through an agency can be expensive but he says recruits tend to be “slightly over-qualified for the role they are coming in to fill”, which means they can “hit the ground running”. Some are employed for a few weeks; one has been with Archimedes for four years.Mr Marchetti admits not every experience has been positive: “You always get one or two disappointments,” he says. “But it is better to have this with an interim than to employ someone and have it not work out.”Now in its sixth year, Mr Marchetti believes the continued growth of Archimedes will lead to a change in its policy on hiring interim managers. “As the company matures our reliance on interims will become less and less. As we get bigger we will have more of our own resources,” he says.Robert Orr"
671;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-07-09T16:12:11Z;London’s new ‘cycle cafés’;;Not too long ago, foreigners laughed at Britain’s efforts in professional cycling and scowled at the terrible instant coffee served in its cafés. Today, Mark Cavendish and Bradley Wiggins are leading riders on the world stage, while a London barista, Gwilym Davies, was last year’s world champion at the coffee industry’s top competition.Might the capital’s new-found confidence in the worlds of cycling and coffee explain why so many “cycling cafés” are springing up? In a single week in May, three appeared in London – Look Mum No Hands!, Micycle and the Rapha Cycle Club – the latest in a string of openings over the past two years. In continental Europe, cyclists have always made time to stop for a caffeine boost at roadside cafés, but these London ventures are more focused, typically offering a bike repair workshop, bike parking space, cycling magazines and a big screen for watching the Tour de France and other races.“We wanted to get away from the slightly surly atmosphere you get in many bike shops,” says Matthew Hilton, an interior designer who founded Micycle with his wife Penny. They rented a shop on a cycle route in Islington, north London, and now use the shaded garden behind it as a free bike-washing, parking and seating area. Customers can borrow tools to fix their own bikes, while an exchange scheme for children’s bikes has proved a hit. Meanwhile, the café serves Hilton’s own blend of coffee beans from Colombia and Papua New Guinea.After years of feeling marginalised by drivers, things are looking up for the capital’s cyclists. New “cycle superhighways” are this month being marked out on key commuting roads, and the citywide cycle-hire scheme launches on July 30. Now cyclists have their own venues for socialising, too.On Old Street, on the northern fringe of the city’s business district, Look Mum No Hands! seems to have achieved overnight success – it is busy from breakfast until it closes at 10pm. Free wifi encourages visitors to linger and enjoy excellent coffee produced by a refurbished Faema machine – a lovely touch, even if you don’t remember that the Milanese espresso machine maker used to sponsor Eddy Merckx.The Rapha Cycle Club on Clerkenwell Road offers a space more akin to an art gallery than a café. Rapha is an upmarket cycle clothing brand and a selection of its products, including gingham shirts specially tailored for cycling, hangs beside shelves of cycling books and big screens. A classic Citroën HY van doubles as a changing room. The “club”, which is in fact free and open to all, also hosts photographic exhibitions, and acts as the start and finish point for weekly after-work rides. A second venue opened on Bowery in New York last weekend.“Coffee is embedded in road-racing cycling culture, from Italian cyclists stopping for espresso to the café owned by Lance Armstrong in Austin, Texas,” says Simon Mottram, Rapha’s founder. And, though the Rapha clubs are “pop-ups” that will close at the end of the summer, the trend continues. New Zealand-based coffee company Allpress, which like Rapha sponsors a pro-cycling team, will open a roasting centre and café in London in September, with one unique attraction. Anyone in Allpress team cycling kit will get their coffee for free.………………….DetailsMicycle, 47 Barnsbury Street, N1, www.micycle.org.ukLook Mum No Hands!, 49 Old Street, EC1, www.lookmumnohands.comRapha Cycle Club, 146 Clerkenwell Road, EC1, www.rapha.ccAllpress Espresso (opens September), 58 Redchurch Street, E2, www.allpressespresso.com
672;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-06-29T12:38:27Z;Chinese buyer to battle Starbucks;;Competition for China’s cappuccino drinkers is to intensify after China Resources Enterprise, a Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by Beijing, pledged to overtake Starbucks and turn a local chain in to the country’s biggest coffee house.CRE, China’s biggest supermarket chain operator, said on Tuesday it would buy 80 per cent of Hong Kong-based Pacific Coffee for HK$326.6m ($42m) and expand on the mainland as it seeks to tap in to China’s growing coffee-drinking culture.Retail coffee consumption in China is set to increase more than 35 per cent to about 45,900 tonnes by 2014, according to CRE, citing Euromonitor.The company said it would expand Pacific Coffee buy putting one outlet “in every one of our major malls.”Pacific Coffee, founded in Hong Kong in 1992, has just five stores in China. Frank Lai, CRE deputy managing director, said among the company’s 2,900 retail outlets in China, about 200 are considered “major malls.”But Hong Kong-listed CRE, which also operates China’s largest brewer by volume, CR Snow Breweries, is likely to face fierce competition.Starbucks, which entered China in 1999, is the country’s number one coffeehouse with about 380 stores, and aims to expand. There are also a large number of cafes serving Taiwanese-style milk tea.But Mr Lai said Pacific Coffee, which opened its first outlet in China five years ago, would be able to grow rapidly by capitalising on CRE’s retail presence and leveraging its customer base.“Chinese consumers are getting ever more sophisticated,” he said. “They are very open to new things. They have developed a taste for the whole experience of going to a coffee shop to drink coffee.”He said the ultimate goal for Pacific Coffee is to become the largest coffee chain in China in terms of size, but did not specify a time frame. He also played down the competition posed by the US giant.“It took us 15 years to become China’s largest brewer. We built the biggest supermarket chain in just six years. It’s down to Pacific Coffee to break that record,” said Mr Lai. “Competition is always intense in China, no matter what sector you are in.”Outside China, Pacific Coffee, previously owned by investment company Chevalier Pacific, operates 83 outlets in Hong Kong. It also has seven licensed stores in Singapore, Macao and Malaysia and said it would continue to use the franchise model to expand overseas. Mr Lai said CRE planned to own most of the chain’s stores in China.Hong Kong-listed Chevalier Pacific will continue to hold 20 per cent of the chain.
673;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-06-25T13:53:59Z;Coke sees ‘phenomenal’ result from Twitter ads;;Coca-Cola saw “phenomenal” results from its first experiment with paid advertising on Twitter, the drinks company’s digital marketing chief told the Financial Times.The US soft drinks company is only the second brand to sponsor a “trending topic”, using Twitter’s “promoted tweets” to tap into online discussion about the World Cup this week.It saw 86m “impressions” or views of the ads in 24 hours, said Carol Kruse, vice-president for global interactive marketing at Coca-Cola, which is an official sponsor of the football tournament.Coke also saw an “engagement rate” of 6 per cent, compared with the approximately 0.02 per cent of people who click on a regular online advertisement.Such enthusiasm from a large advertiser will come as a boost to Twitter’s nascent attempts to generate revenues from its 190m monthly visitors.“The amount of impressions in such a short period of time around our whole World Cup campaign, to me it was a phenomenal time,” she told the FT on the fringes of the Cannes Lions advertising festival. “It made this emotional connection at the time, it was great.”Social media such as Twitter and Facebook have dominated discussions among marketers and ad agencies in Cannes.Twitter first introduced its advertising system in April, allowing companies such as Starbucks and Sony Pictures to pay to display their postings on pages of search results for popular topics.In the second phase of its commercialisation, Disney Pixar last week became the first company to buy an ad within its “trending topic” section.Unlike search results, this form of sponsorship appears on the main page Twitter users see when they are logged into the service, at the bottom of the user-generated list of the 10 most popular talking points on the site.Coke chose to become the second company to sponsor a trending topic during Wednesday’s final qualifying matches, which saw teams from the US and England – two of the biggest nations on Twitter – go through to the next stage of the tournament.“We have formed fabulous relationships with Facebook, YouTube and Twitter,” she said. “We get a lot of first looks and we jumped on that one [promoted tweets] immediately. It is the perfect example of us wanting to learn in this space.”Coke’s Twitter messages congratulated the England and US teams, linked to videos on YouTube and invited people to “share their celebration” of their teams’ success.Although Ms Kruse did not reveal how much Coke had spent on the campaign, she indicated that the test had not been expensive compared with other forms of online advertising.“When it’s something new, it’s hard for publishers to know what the value is,” she said. “We didn’t know how it would work out but we wanted to learn in that space …It could have completely flopped. They [Twitter] also wanted to learn with us.”Twitter is “one of the very few vehicles out there that can give you that kind of volume”, said Gaston Legorburu, worldwide creative officer at SapientNitro, an ad agency that works with Coke. Although Yahoo and MSN also provide “tonnage …it’s not as relevant”, he said.Some Twitter users have voiced concerns about the introduction of advertising. But many advertisers are excited about the potential of social networks to amplify word-of-mouth recommendations of their products.On Thursday, Marc Pritchard, chief marketing officer at Procter & Gamble, told the FT that the world’s largest advertiser was “with Facebook in a big way”.His opposite number at Unilever, Keith Weed, also enthused about social networks, saying that they provided an opportunity to create a deeper “one-to-one” relationship with consumers that was “something you couldn’t imagine doing with traditional media” such as television and newspapers.“I think the capability of pulling together vast amounts of people and spreading messages among vast amounts of people is something different and unique,” Mr Weed said. “These guys are running businesses. They will and they must [monetise them] …How they do it, they have to be careful and they have to be clever.”However, Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, who was interviewing Mr Weed, said the “jury is still out on the effectiveness of digital on brand-building”, comparing Facebook with letter writing.“Traditional media seem to us to still be among the best ways of building brands,” he said. “One-to-one communication seems to us to be a more promotional device – less strategic and more tactical.”
674;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-06-23T19:17:46Z;The perils of a tarnished brand;;In February, Google found itself in an unusual position: out of step with its customers. When the company launched Buzz, its social networking service, it faced a barrage of criticism from users who objected to the way it had automatically enrolled users of Gmail, its e-mail service, into the new offering. Their gripe was that it would make their private contacts public. Google was stung by the uproar but put it down to a mistake made in good faith and quickly made Buzz optional.For a company that ranked second in a recent survey by Fortune magazine of the world’s most admired companies, getting it so wrong with users was uncomfortable. It also begged the question of how a company known for being so intuitively connected to consumers could get it so wrong.Google had established its reputation on the back of the functionality and ease of use of its search engine, a stream of popular innovations and a declared commitment to free access to information and the democratisation of the internet. Estimates vary wildly, but in 2009 one research agency, Millward Brown Optimor, valued the Google brand at $100bn.But, even before the furore over Buzz, there were signs of cracks in the edifice. Google’s reputation took a beating over its decision to enter the Chinese market, where it initially agreed to government demands to censor search results, only to recant and redirect users to a non-censored site in January based in Hong Kong. Observers wondered if the decision to enter China in the first place had compromised Google’s founding values, summed up in its unofficial motto: “Don’t be evil.”Google, of course, is not the only brand to have seen its reputation suffer recently. The public image of Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, has suffered in the wake of the credit crunch with a famous article in Rolling Stone magazine describing the organisation as a “great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity”. BP is widely perceived to have compounded the damage done to its image by the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico through a poor public relations and crisis management strategy in its aftermath.What affects reputations in turn affects brands. It is too soon to say how badly the Goldman Sachs and BP brands will be affected but it seems certain that they will be. And what all of these examples highlight is how hard it is to manage reputations.Rohit Deshpandé, professor of marketing at Harvard Business School, says the pressures to grow mean that some businesses, and start-ups in particular, forget to adapt their strategies as they become bigger. “When you are growing, your focus is on growing rapidly and you tend to be opportunistic about growth,” he says. “You are not thinking about the vision and strategy. You are doing everything, so you have no time to sit back and think about things.”In other cases, companies lose sight of the core values that define their brand. “Brands are attitudes and perceptions in customers’ minds,” says Patrick Barwise, a professor of marketing at London Business School and chairman of Which?, the consumer organisation. Successful reputations, he says, are built on customer experience. Those companies that have built strong global brands, such as Apple and Procter & Gamble, have done so by first creating a strong customer promise and then delivering on that promise consistently.Other companies start out well and then lose their way. Coffee chain Starbucks was a very powerful and successful brand in North America, in part because it became very good at delivering what customers wanted. But somewhere along the way, says Prof Deshpandé, hubris set in. “It was so focused on growth by opening new stores that it lost touch with its core customers,” he says. As a result in some markets, such as the UK, Starbucks saw its image and reputation decline.The company has since taken steps to redress these concerns. In January 2008, Howard Schultz, the company’s founder and original chief executive who had moved to the role of chairman in 2000, retook day-to-day control of the company. He lamented the “commoditisation” of the Starbucks “experience” and promised to return the company to its original vision, by retraining staff and working to re-engage with customers. According to the company, they have had some success.The return of a chief executive who champions and defines the vision at the heart of overall strategy is certainly important. Prof Deshpandé says that many companies make a big mistake by relegating brand management issues to the marketing department.Martin Roll, chief executive of brand consultancy VentureRepublic, agrees. Many companies, he says, think of brands only in terms of advertising and positioning. “Most companies do not put brands at the heart of their strategy,” he says.Another challenge for companies is how to manage their reputations as their operations become more global. It was easier for Google, for example, to adhere to its motto when it operated in open markets such as the US and western Europe but in a more controlled economy, such as China, this proved more tricky.A similar difficulty is faced by Asian companies as they try to grow outside their home markets. The Tata Group, for example, is India’s biggest and most valuable brand but the country’s own brand image is weak in the west. Apart from IT services, India is considered by many to be a source of low-cost, low-quality goods and services. How can Tata transcend that image? One option is to follow the example of Sony and create a global brand that is not country-specific.But there are risks here, too. Tata’s brand is linked to its Indian identity. “To tell a story about Tata is to tell a story about India,” says Peter Unsworth, chief executive of Tata Global Beverages. Cutting the links with its Indian identity could do the Tata brand much more harm than good.How can companies avoid these problems? Prof Barwise advocates a “back to basics” approach. A key element in any successful brand, he says, is trust. Customers have to believe that a brand’s values are real, not just corporate communication-speak.The Tata brand in India has been built on this basis. Indian customers know that Tata products and services will always deliver what they promise. Maintaining trust is key to maintaining the brand. “Our brand represents a framework of fairness and equality,” says Ratan Tata, leader of the Tata group.Corporate communications, such as advertising, play a relatively minor role in this process. It is what the company does, not what it says, that reinforces the brand in the minds of customers. Apple has superb corporate communications, says Prof Barwise, and it is “brilliant at the theatre of product launches”. But the products themselves are what keep people buying Apple products. If they did not deliver on the promise made through corporate communications, Apple would not have a brand.By contrast, BP’s switch to an eco-themed logo in 2000 and a new slogan, “Beyond Petroleum”, to highlight the company’s apparent switch to more environmentally friendly energy, has not protected it from criticism in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. If anything, as with Google in China, it has become a stick with which critics have been able to beat the company.“Brands have to understand that they are service providers,” says Prof Deshpandé. “They no longer shape people’s ideas.”Instead, people engage in what Jonathan Schroeder, a professor at University of Exeter Business School, calls “brand co-creation”. Customers do not just communicate with the company, he says. Increasingly, they also communicate with each other, and it is the stories they share that shape the brand. Companies that recognise this accordingly spend more time listening to customers than talking to them. “It is the stories that consumers tell each other, the experiences and values they share, that really shape the brand,” he says.The rise of social media has only amplified this. Reinier Evers, founder of Trendwatching.com, says the rise of Twitter, the microblogging website, enables companies to monitor what people are saying about them but also help them to engage actively with consumers.“Many companies say they can’t afford two people to monitor and engage with comments, but this is what companies need to do,” he says. “They need to be engaged in a constant conversation so that massive surprises don’t occur.”Above all, brands need a chief executive to be their champion. “Experience shows that if the leader is not involved, the chance of success is greatly reduced,” says Mr Roll. At Apple, for example, Steve Jobs defines and champions the brand.Will Google’s reputation survive the assaults on its image? It is taking steps to remedy perceptions of the company. More important, the warning signs are clear: Google, and other global companies, cannot rely forever on past goodwill to keep them going.As Markham Erickson, executive director of the Open Internet Coalition, an industry trade group of which Google is a member, puts it: “When you’re big, you’re not cute any more.”

Every artwork is scored under categories such as fame, age, size or absurdity.The game taps into an emerging trend that uses smartphones, such as the iPhone and BlackBerry, and location information to create video games played in the real world. Small but growing numbers of organisations are using these mobile services for locally focused marketing.Jane Burton, creative director of Tate Media, says Tate Trumps is designed to attract people who might normally be intimidated by modern art.“We know a lot of the materials we offer people to interpret the collection don’t really work for younger audiences or adolescent boys,” she says. “They don’t really want to read text on the wall, but they are interested in gaming and having a go on an iPhone.”A new wireless network in the gallery will allow Tate visitors to download more games in future.Hide&Seek, the group which designed Tate Trumps, takes its cues from computer games, traditional parlour games and treasure hunts. Alex Fleetwood, director, says he hopes the game will encourage new visitors who are “interested in a more playful experience” than cultural institutions typically offer.“Play changes behaviour and creates engagement,” he says.Mr Fleetwood believes play is going up a level thanks to wider trends: the diminishing effectiveness of traditional advertising; video games’ crossover with other entertainment, such as films; adoption of smartphones; and the huge profitability of video games, which now generate more revenues than movies.The same forces are driving new mobile services such as Foursquare, Gowalla and Rummble, which combine competition, social networking and city guides. Users “check in” to shops or bars on their phone, gaining points and winning virtual accolades for repeat visits. Leaderboards allow users to rank themselves against their friends.Outlets such as Starbucks, Debenhams and Domino’s Pizza offer rewards to heavy users of local branches on Foursquare, which has more than 1.5m users globally. These free coffees or pizzas mimic loyalty cards or promotional vouchers.George Nimeh, European digital director at Iris Worldwide, an ad agency, says the concept of the check-in is one of the biggest trends in digital marketing today, alongside Facebook’s “like” button.“The idea of play has been dramatically underrated as an activity from a marketing point of view,” he says."

Why would the US consumer not embrace the quality of what many of them see when they go to the UK?” he said.Greencore’s ready meals have been a hit with US shoppers with like-for-like sales up 27 per cent in the first half to March, albeit from a low base.Mr Covenay hopes US sales will rise to $500m (£344m) in the next four years, which would make up almost half of the Greencore’s revenues.“We’ve been very, very taken by the market potential, also kind of humbled by the size of the US market,” said Mr Covenay who has decided to focus on the north-east and mid-west, where Greencore’s factories are located.The company is not completely without competition. Local start-ups are beginning to challenge Greencore, and Bakkavor is buying up factories on the West Coast. But Greencore’s deal with Kroger, the second largest supermarket in the US, should stand it in good stead.“Supermarket retailers have needed to introduce more and better products as they’ve lost share to food away from home and lost share to Walmart. They’ve needed to be more innovative,” said Neil Currie, retail analyst at UBS.“They’ve looked around the world and seen the growth in chilled food in the UK, and Kroger has had a bit more foresight in the area to turn to Greencore.”Mr Covenay said it was key to Greencore’s strategy to send out senior managers to give advice on the ground as many retailers need to change their store lay-out and staff training to incorporate fresh ready meals.Those managers have had to adapt to what the US customer prefers.“The portions are larger, the prices are higher and the food is celebrated much more,” said Mr Covenay.
677;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-06-03T19:57:16Z;Dividends;There are more important things for investors to fuss about;Dividends are in the news. On Wednesday two Democratic senators told BP it shouldn’t pay a dividend until the total cost of the oil spill clean-up is estimated. Earlier, European airline Ryanair announced a first-ever cash payment to shareholders. Global coffee shop chain Starbucks also paid an inaugural dividend last month. Few things in finance, however, are as misunderstood and debated as dividends.For all the hoo-ha about Starbucks, or Dow Chemical’s first dividend cut since 1912 last year, investors should recall the classic 1958 paper by Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller, which argued that a company’s dividend policy was irrelevant. There were many assumptions, of course, but simplistically shareholders should be indifferent between a dividend and a stronger share price due to higher free cash flows.If dividends are irrelevant, should investors just ignore the finger-pointing at BP or Ryanair’s first cheque? The issue at BP is that there is a chance (admittedly small for now) that future claims on the company will exceed its ability to pay them. Whereas BP has unlimited liabilities, individual shareholders risk only their stock falling to zero. The asymmetric risk of paying a dividend, therefore, might be seen to be what lawyers call fraudulent transfer. If BP wants to maintain pay-outs, it must argue there is almost zero risk of default.Debut-dividends at the likes of Starbucks are more difficult to interpret. Again, the theory shrugs. But Modigliani and Miller’s model assumes operating cash flows are independent of dividend policy. Some believe, however, that higher pay-out ratios signal that management is short of profitable investment opportunities. Other studies show rising dividends to be bullish. Investors are best advised to ignore the debate and concentrate on a company’s free cash flows instead.E-mail the Lex team confidentially
678;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;From short selling to long frothy lattes;;A new commodity is set to be traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange from Wednesday – lattes.In a further step of the evolution of what was once the centre of the global equity trading system, Starbucks is opening a concession among the trading screens.The move is part of a revamp of the century-old floor, which has increasingly become a brand showcase for the NYSE after the shift of equity trading to computerised systems.While the trading floor still dominates the opening and closing of US share trading, activity falls away in between. This has been reflected in a thinning of the ranks of the once-crowded floor. There are currently about 500 equity traders active on the floor, compared with 1,366 before 2006, which was the set number of traders for many years. If support staff is included, the population on the floor is about 1,200, compared with about 3,000 before 2006.To attract more business, the NYSE has carried out a big renovation of the floor, replacing old cramped wooden cubicles with modern work stations.The pods support multiple computer screens, which enable a trader to transact shares outside of the floor and also bonds, futures and currencies.The new work stations will provide seats for a hundred traders initially and another hundred by the end of the year.The new look contrasts starkly with the traditional sight of brokers standing and crowding around a dealing post.“If you had told me 20 years ago that one day we would be sitting down and able to drink coffee on the floor, I would not have believed it,” said Neil Catania, chief executive of MND Partners and a 29-year veteran of the floor. His firm has 17 traders in one pod and plans to expand to 30 by the end of the year.With the likes of Getco, the high-frequency trading firm, now on the floor, there was a need to upgrade the technology and adapt to a new type of trading, said NYSE traders and officials. About 60 per cent of firms on the trading floor can trade in other venues and financial products outside the NYSE.But the trading posts will still see activity at the crucial open and close to trading where imbalances can arise between buyers and sellers.“We will still need to get up and be at a trading post on the floor at certain times of the day,” Mr Catania said.Lou Pastina, executive vice president of NYSE Operations says the new look floor will encourage firms to transfer staff from offices upstairs where there is room for plenty of computer screens.Additional reporting by Greg Farrell
679;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-05-18T03:50:43Z;Foursquare keeps up the buzz;;When it comes to the long-term success of stand-alone “check-in” services like Foursquare, Gowalla and Booyah, it’s all about incentives.Sure, a few hundred-thousand early adopters might find social value in sharing their location with the world. But in order for checking-in to go mainstream, these companies will have to offer users a compelling answer to the question “Why?”Foursquare is inching towards a meaningful response with a bevy of partnerships, including its latest promotion with Starbucks.Starting today, Foursquare users who become the “mayor” of a Starbucks (that means checking-in more than anyone else at a given location), will receive a coupon for $1 off a Frappuccino. It’s a small gesture, but a meaningful one to the legion of caffeine addicts looking for a novel way to engage with their favourite brand.While the New York-based company has signed deals with the likes of The History Channel, VH1 and The Today Show to offer users special “badges”, this is among Foursquare’s first real coupon promotions. And it will likely be the allure of discounts that drives mass adoption.Foursquare still has not taken a major round of funding, but is rumoured to be in talks with venture capitalists. Talk of an acquisition by Yahoo has quieted down, too. But the service is still gaining users and adoption, recently surpassing 600,000 check-ins a day.Meanwhile, rival Booyah just took$20m from Accel, and Gowalla continues refining its service. Yelp has launched its check-in service, Google Buzz had location built-in, and Facebook’s location feature — which many consider the automatic winner in the category given Facebook’s nearly half billion users — is imminent.But Foursquare’s deal with Starbucks points to an inconvenient truth about scaling a check-in service: for check-ins to have real value, they need to be incentivised. And real incentives come through partnerships laboriously hashed out by a strong biz dev team.That means it’s going to take more than snappy engineers, pretty badges, or even tons of users, for a company to win the war for check-ins. It’s going to take a strong salesforce that can offer users lots and lots of coupons and making checking-in worth their while.
680;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-05-15T01:25:20Z;BP digs in for long haul;;The magazines Field & Stream, Hot Rod and Popular Mechanics are not core reading for BP staff. But, in a sign of the crisis it is facing in the Gulf of Mexico, the British energy group this week ordered copies to be sent to a centre it is building in Venice, Louisiana.The titles are for the recreation room as the company digs in for the long haul to protect both its reputation and the Gulf coast from the oil spill that has been threatening the region since an April 20 explosion on an offshore rig that killed 11 people.The centre comprises huge, white, air-conditioned tents covering an area larger than a tennis court. It is being fitted with two big-screen televisions, books and board games. BP has also leased a nearby building from Venice authorities, on a three-month renewal basis for up to one year. Response personnel have filled the hotels, requiring BP to bring in trailers, while some have been stationed in houseboats.“We’ve developed into a small city,’’ says Slade Brockett, staging area manager for Venice. “We’re feeding twice the population of Venice each day.’’Venice, a small fishing village of about 450 people, has no Starbucks, Walmart or even a proper grocery. It is at the tip of Louisiana and inside the barrier islands that have seen some of the first caramel-coloured clumps of oil come ashore.It is one of 14 staging areas BP has established along the Gulf coast from which to hire locals to go out into the waters each day and reposition the black, orange and white booms laid in the sea. They are its first line of defence against the oil spill.During a helicopter fly-over of the barrier islands late on Thursday, a small group of workers could be seen on a sand bar wearing protective white suits and using cotton wool-type cloths to pick up tar balls the size of small coins and splotches that have made it past the booms. BP says none of it has made it to Venice or other nearby populated areas.Indeed, amid the chorus of criticism about BP’s inability to stop the leak, Tony Hayward, chief executive, is trumpeting the containment effort. “Almost nothing has escaped,’’ he said.The feeling within BP is that if it limits the number of oily birds – it says 20 have been found so far – and the impact on wildlife, the wetlands and the beaches, it will be able to overcome the negative perceptions created by the leak. The company is organising 13,000 workers to protect the shoreline and wildlife across the four threatened states. This includes staff, contractors and volunteers.At the Houma command centre, responsible for co–ordinating the offshore effort, 600 people from BP, federal agencies and state bodies are working round the clock. And BP is picking up the tab for all-you-can-eat meals served from before dawn until after midnight.Coffee flows freely. A chaplain makes the rounds of coastal staging areas.A blown-up note from Mr Hayward to staff is taped to the wall: “We will do everything that we can to prevent a human tragedy from becoming a major environmental disaster.’’The operation has grown to include a 60cm-high, 12km-long dam just off Venice to protect the most vulnerable areas from any oil that washes under or over the booms. Little packages of pre-fabricated, bright orange plastic dams could be seen from the air along the sand bars kilometres from shore, awaiting workers to fill them with seawater and stake them into the ground.The effort is labour intensive but BP is hiring locals – which mitigates the pain of income lost from the closure of oyster, shrimp and other fishing along the coastal areas the authorities fear might be contaminated by oil and dispersants.“We’re here until the job is done,’’ said Mr Brockett, who has decamped from BP’s refinery at Cherry Point, Washington.Among the 2,500 BP staff deployed to the clean-up are employees from Angola and Canada. And Louisiana has activated its National Guard troops to help.“The meetings start at 5.30am and we don’t get back until 10 or 11[pm],’’ said Jason Tieman, a software worker who volunteers with the National Guard. He has been assigned 60 days in Venice working with the US Coast Guard, where he sleeps on a houseboat.“I don’t see my place in the daylight. I don’t know what it looks like.’’
681;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-05-10T11:05:41Z;US unemployment;As mid-term elections approach, there is much talk of job creation;America needs jobs. With a 10th of the US workforce unemployed and mid-term elections approaching, there will be much talk this year of job creation. As small young businesses are responsible for most new employment, it makes intuitive sense to encourage entrepreneurship. Yet the facts suggest that there is little point in trying – since 1977 about 700,000 new businesses have been started in the US every year. The number barely changes from year to year.The 700,000 figure includes both start-ups and new locations (such as a new Starbucks), but research for the Kauffman Foundation finds that other measures of business creation also show remarkable consistency. While an individual may start a business from necessity or by spotting an opportunity, there appears to be a natural level of entrepreneurship irrespective of wider credit conditions or encouragement. Indeed, a ballooning in both venture capital funding and university courses on entrepreneurship since 1980 has had no effect on the rate of business formation.But new firms are essential to recovery. From 1980 to 2005, virtually all net new jobs were created by companies under five years old, and the one- to five-year-olds created two-thirds of jobs. So voters should be extremely sceptical of promises to create jobs through tax cuts, subsidies or spending. Policy in the US appears to have no appreciable short-term impact on entrepreneurship, and so by extension levels of joblessness.The second, sobering, conclusion is that the US unemployment rate will fall only slowly, even with continued economic recovery. And it poses a question for the Federal Reserve, which has a dual mandate that also includes employment. If the Fed has very little control over job creation, why continue to risk inflation by holding interest rates close to zero?E-mail the Lex team confidentially
682;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-05-08T00:45:57Z;'This is real coffee';;"A year ago, few people had heard of a “flat white” coffee. Now they are sold in Starbucks alongside more familiar lattes and cappuccinos, and Britain’s Costa chain is offering customers their money back if they don’t love the newest white coffee craze.Flat whites were quietly introduced to independent coffee shops in Britain about 10 years ago, having been popular in Australia and New Zealand since the mid-1990s, and both these countries claim the drink as their own invention. It is only now, with the big chains serving them, that they are gaining a wider following.But what is a flat white? New Zealander Cameron McClure, part-owner of the Flat White coffee house in Soho, says it is just a regional name for the style of coffee. “Flat white is a term for a type of coffee in Australasia – it’s describing the ratio of espresso to milk,” he explains. “There are many other coffees around the world with different names that you could probably call a flat white.”Flat White opened in Soho in 2005 and was the first of a new wave of coffee shops in London to champion the Antipodean way of starting the day. “In New Zealand coffee is like a religion. For New Zealanders it is an integral part of the day,” says McClure.A flat white, or “flattie”, is an espresso-based coffee served in a small – usually 6-10oz – cup with less milk and froth than either a cappuccino or a latte. The base is a double shot of espresso topped with heated (not steamed) full-fat milk, carefully poured to create a sweet and velvety short coffee: full-fat milk adds a natural sweetness, with texturised milk taking the place of frothy cappuccino foam.Strangely, Starbucks only sells the flat white in Britain (the chain began selling them in London in December 2009 before a nationwide roll-out at the beginning of this year). Costa followed in March.McClure is optimistic about the relationship between the coffee chains and independent cafés: “It just brings more coffee drinkers to the market. In the mass market people were really getting into a Starbucks-type model with really big coffees, syrups and flavourings, which in a way distracted from the coffee. Now it’s coming back to this beautiful idea behind the flat white – keeping it all about the flavour of the espresso.”The laid-back Antipodean outlook has helped many of London’s independent coffee shops to thrive. “London has always been enthusiastic about a new thing,” says McClure. “I think people are aware now that this is real coffee.“A good coffee comes from things like machine maintenance, the blend you’re using, and being in control of the environmental factors. Coffee is a natural product, and the skill of the barista in being able to read all these factors is important.”Peter Dore-Smith is the Australian owner of Kaffeine, which opened last August just off Oxford Street. “In Australia it’s not just about the coffee, it’s also about creating places people can go to drink it. The service, the food, the décor, the atmosphere.”There are now a handful of excellent places to enjoy an authentic flat white in London but, as Dore-Smith says, “Kaffeine is the kind of place you’d find all over Melbourne or Sydney – the UK is really 10 years behind.”So there’s plenty of scope for new entrants in the burgeoning independent coffee shop scene, in London and beyond.………………………………………………………London’s best independent coffee barsFlat White/Milk Bar, SohoBoth venues are run by friendly, knowledgeable staff who pull excellent espressos from beautiful La Marzocco machines.

In 1979, after building a number of successful resorts, he embarked on his most ambitious – Sun City. It became a popular destination, attracting musicians such as Queen, Elton John and Ray Charles.In 1985, it sparked controversy when it became the focus of Artists United Against Apartheid, a music-industry activist group. He sold it at the end of the 1980s. He has since developed resorts in the Bahamas, Mexico, the Maldives and Mauritius.In 2008, he opened Atlantis, a 1,500-room resort on the Palm in Dubai.Describe your job within 10 words.
To conceptualise, build and operate exciting resorts.What are your three best features?
Humility, creativity and a sharp left hook. I used to box as a kid and am still boxing on.And your three worst?
Impatient, short fuse and find difficulty in relaxing.What are you reading?
My Name is Charles Saatchi and I’m an Artoholic. He’s a funny guy and I know him well.Have scandals helped or hindered your image?
I’ve never been too concerned with the way people perceive me.What is your guilty pleasure?
White chocolate, Starbucks skinny cappuccinos and biltong [South African beef jerky].Does money buy taste?
No. But I have spent a lot of money on making my operations very stylish.Was the $20m launch party for Atlantis resort, Dubai, money well spent?
Yes. It launched it to the world. After the fireworks display, I was told it was better than the Beijing Olympics. CNN and Sky broadcast the display. $20m is worth it considering $1.5bn was invested the project.Was Sun City a smart business move?
Yes. I built from scratch a lake, a game park and a resort, Sinatra sung there and Nicklaus played golf. It made sense to have a resort in South Africa – it was a place all South Africans could enjoy irrespective of their race. “Sun City” [the anti-apartheid song] was a cheap shot. I met Nelson Mandela after he was released and asked him what he thought of Sun City. He said: “I thought, creating thousands of jobs would be very useful and would help when I get released.” I’d do it all again.Who has been your biggest influence?
My dad. I wasn’t academic and wanted to be a mechanic, but with his help I developed confidence to get through university.What is your golden rule?
Honesty and recognising the people who work for you.Have you ever praised an employee and not meant it?
Definitely not. It’s more important people know where they stand.Have you ever lied at work?
No. My father beat that out of me.What is your most hated business expression?
That’s impossible.Has your job made your personal life suffer?
I have been called a workaholic but I like what I do.If you hadn’t been in business what would you have done?
Been a very bad mechanic. I can’t even use my mobile phone.What’s the worst thing anyone’s ever said to you?
I don’t think anyone would do that.How do you deal with criticism?
I don’t. I have a saying: “The dogs bark and the caravan moves on”.How do you want to be remembered?

684;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-05-02T18:14:09Z;US oil spill stresses local labour market;;"Brent Frelich is an oyster fisherman who boosts his income loading trucks at a fish factory. With both jobs at risk from the oil spill, Mr Frelich, 21, the sole provider for his pregnant wife and two children, is worried.He wanted to go out this weekend and dredge up what he could from the
oyster beds before the oil flowed in. But the rough weather made that impossible. “I have to have my income,” he says. “If I don’t have it, I have no place to live.” It will not be easy to find other work. “The only thing we have is fishing and the oil industry.”Venice is a small town at the tip of Louisiana. There is no Starbucks or Walmart here. People order deep-fried pickles, raw oysters and alligator meat at the Cypress Cove marina. They get crayfish at Maw’s sandwich kiosk. And they drink beer with deep-fried soft-shell crabs, shrimp and onion rings at the big, open-air bar at the Venice marina.The moratorium on new drilling permits in the Gulf means no new oil jobs. And the suspension of fishing in affected areas means Mr Frelich will not be able to sell his oysters. After a seafood meal with friends, diner Mary Ann Hatter says: “I feel like I ate my last shrimp for a long time.”There are 400 licensed oyster fishermen in Louisiana and hundreds more from out of state who fish in its waters. About 30 per cent of the beds open for fishing have been shut and more may follow. “It has the potential to hurt a lot of people,” says John Tesvich of the Louisiana Oyster Task Force.Oysters are a two-year crop, he says, so the oil could cost the industry two years of fishing. Dispersants could do extensive damage in the oyster beds, and residual oil could have long-term effects, especially on the flavour. “It’s really a taste test to determine when those beds will reopen,” Mr Tesvich says. “It would just have an odd flavour.” Hundreds of local fishermen have lined up for BP’s training class in boom-laying and clean-up operations. Among them was Bret Ainsworth, a crabber. “They told us we couldn’t drink water found in bottles, we had to wear gloves that fit, don’t pick up syringes and don’t pick up animals that look dead as they might be dangerous,” says Mr Ainsworth. “It was stupid. It’s stuff I already know.”What he did not hear was how much he would earn for his help.But most fishermen were more intent on setting off to catch what they could before the oil flowed in. “We hope the government will put pressure on the operators to . . . offset the loss in income of the fisheries,” says Mr Tesvich.BP’ has said it will pay all legitimate claims. But until that money comes, Mr Ainsworth will have a hard time making ends meet. He put 900 traps in the water two days ago but may pick up only 200 because of rough weather. He expects they will be seized as contaminated once the oil nears the shore. “Will BP pay me?” he says. “Will I be okay?”"
685;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-04-27T23:54:04Z;Analysis: All about emerging markets, trust and price;;"The growing importance of brands from emerging markets is one of several themes picked out by compilers of the 2010 BrandZ Top 100 ranking.Seven of the 13 emerging-market brands on the list come from China, two each from Russia and Brazil, and one apiece from India and Mexico. New entrants include Baidu, the Chinese search engine, along with ICICI and Telcel from India and Mexico respectively. Both these last two are their country’s first representatives in the Top 100.ICICI, the big Indian financial services group, makes its debut in an impressive 45th place, with a brand value of $14.5bn.Joanna Seddon, chief executive of Millward Brown Optimor, praises ICICI’s chairman, KV Kamath, for championing ATMs throughout India as a way of breaking down the country’s traditional hierarchical barriers – everyone has to wait in line, whether they are a cleaner or a bank executive. ICICI scores a high nine for brand momentum because of its potential in India and elsewhere – it already operates in 18 countries.Just outside the Top 100, but included for the first time in the Technology Top 20, is Infosys Technologies, the big Indian IT group. Ms Seddon says it is an interesting brand because of its co-founder Nandan Nilekani and his espousal of the “flat world” concept – that is, servicing customers through outsourcing anywhere in the world (as popularised in the bestseller by Thomas Friedman, The World is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century).Both Mr Kamath and Mr Nilekani feature in another theme identified by MBO – the chief executive as brand leader.Many of the top 100 have been built – or revived – by leaders with brand vision. They include Carlos Slim of Telcel, Apple’s Steve Jobs, Lou Gerstner of IBM and Starbucks’ Howard Schultz, who returned to a day-to-day role as chief executive two years ago to revive the fortunes of the company he nurtured from infancy into a global brand.Mr Schultz’s vision for Starbucks was all about making human connections, says Ms Seddon.“He abdicated from running it and what did they do? They went into drive-throughs. Now, if you’ve got a brand that’s about human connections, maybe a drive-through doesn’t quite fit. They expanded very fast, and kind of lost the brand essence, and he’s come back again and the brand is doing better [its brand value rose 17 per cent in the latest Top 100].”Peter Walshe, MBO’s global BrandZ director, says some of the visionaries are no longer chief executives but their successors are following the same vision as a unique aspect of those companies, with great success.Examples of the successors include Sam Palmisano at IBM and Michael Geoghegan at HSBC, whose chairman, Stephen Green, is an ordained minister in the Church of England and author of Serving God, Serving Mammon.Legal addiction – whether of the long-established variety (cigarettes) or modern (playing with mobile phones or BlackBerry) – is another theme picked out by the ranking’s compilers. Marlboro, ever present in the top 10, has seen its brand value grow at an average compound annual rate of 10 per cent over the past five years.Overall, the latest Top 100 list “tells you that people in their stressful lives want to do something to relieve the stress, fiddling with their hands”, she says. “They are either smoking, or they’re twiddling on their BlackBerries, and we have an example: if you have a really stressful job, like president of the United States, you may feel the need to do both.”In mobile phones, the world’s top 10 operators are all in the top 100 of the BrandZ rankings, says Ms Seddon, along with Apple, BlackBerry and Samsung, and a lot of this is down to the phenomenal growth of mobile applications or apps – “everything from Sudoku to Find a Mechanic to BrandZ”, she says.Mr Walshe adds that two key things drive brands – trust, which is the historic brand value that has been built up, and current user recommendation. “What’s interesting about this category …is that the brands are particularly high in user recommendation. They’re not particularly driven by trust,” he says.Some of the most valuable brands are underpinned by both trust and recommendation – another key finding from the rankings.While IBM is driven hugely by trust and Apple by recommendation, research by MBO has shown that Pampers and Tide, two consumer/household products, are the top trusted and recommended brands (Tide has slipped out of the Top 100 because of the influx of oil companies).Brands that are high on both criteria are either visionary or benefit from having built up a heritage, based on historic performance, says Mr Walshe. “And they are delivering it today, together with innovation, and keeping themselves relevant…particularly in recent times, as politicians and banks lose credibility, trusted brands become more and more valuable.”The role of price, and the fact that the strongest and most valuable brands are more price-resistance, is a further important finding from research by MBO.Because of the desire they create from consumers, they tend to command a healthy price premium, even in recessionary times, and the Top 100 brands get the balance right between pricing and the power of the brand.Data from BrandZ show that only 7 per cent of consumers buy on price alone; under a third make a compromise between price and brand; and brand is an important influence for nearly nine out of 10, while more than half take little notice of price."
686;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-04-27T23:54:04Z;Big names prove worth in crisis;;"For companies whose financial value depends heavily on the health of their brands, the severity and abruptness of the recession was a challenge.The abruptness with which many consumers stopped spending, and large companies reduced capital investment and wound down capital investment, caused a shock to the system. Many companies experienced not only the financial crisis, but also a crisis of confidence.Marketers and advertising agencies preach the gospel that the companies that emerge best out of recessions are those that maintain their marketing budget and protect brands when the going gets tough. In practice, few companies were certain enough of the future to comply.Yet some of the Doomsday scenarios about the value of brands in a new, less leveraged world, have not come to pass. Emerging from the recession, luxury goods companies and many other consumer brand companies are enjoying a rebound.The underlying value of any brand – the premium commanded by products and services with strong reputations and identities – has not been eliminated by the crisis. Even those companies that did not invest heavily in their portfolio in the worst times are regaining some confidence.Indeed, this year’s BrandZ brands survey suggests that, even if the value of brands is below its 2007 peak, it has rebounded more sharply than the S&P 500. Millward Brown Optimor, the WPP subsidiary that compiles the ranking, calculates that a portfolio of the top 100 brands – updated each year as a new list is compiled – is 18.5 per cent up from its level four years ago, compared with an 11.5 per cent fall in the S&P 500.The premium for the top 100 brands was squeezed as many countries went into recession but it opened up again coming out. In other words, the outlook for brands has not been fundamentally altered as a result of the recession; instead, it looks familiar.“Brands outperform in good times and when there is a recession they do go down, but they come out the other side with a sustainable advantage,” says Joanna Seddon, chief executive of MBO.The nature of brands continues to evolve. Technology rather than marketing is now the defining characteristic of seven of the top 10 brands, with Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and Marlboro making up the other three.Google remains the world’s most valuable brand, but edging up close behind it are two other technology companies, IBM and Apple. Both of these outrank Microsoft, whose brand value was stable during the year.Meanwhile, China Mobile, General Electric and Vodafone occupy the lowest three places in the top 10, which comprises the same brands as last year’s ranking. Although GE’s brand value fell by 25 per cent from $59.8bn in the list published a year ago, due mainly to its difficulties with GE Capital, the technology and infrastructure-related parts of its business retain their strength.The resurgence in Apple under Steve Jobs, through the iPod, the iPhone and now the iPad, continues unabated and, on present trends, it could be pressing Google for first place within a year or two. That is a tribute to a company that inspires devotion among customers.It may also be a reflection of the value of inspirational leadership, and the way in which consumers identify some of the world’s most valuable brands, such as Oracle and Starbucks, with founders who embodies their qualities. Larry Ellison of Oracle and Howard Schultz of Starbucks are not only the founders but keepers of the flame.This broad shift towards technology is a reflection of the importance of the internet and communications in the fortunes of many companies, including Telcel, the mobile phone group controlled by Carlos Slim Helu. Telcel is the first Mexican company to enter the top 100 (in 69th place).The social media boom led by companies such as Facebook and Twitter – as well the rise in smartphones led by Apple – has had a broader impact on the top 100. It has boosted mobile operators such as Verizon and AT&T, despite the complaints of iPhone users about AT&T’s 3G coverage.Although mobile phone companies are struggling to upgrade their data networks, the trend towards the mobile internet is giving them valuable revenue opportunities. “Everyone is twittering and sending pictures on iPhones, and data is what makes money,” says Ms Seddon.Yet technology can also disturb traditional brand values and make it easier for young competitors to break into markets. The best example of that at the moment is the media industry, where technology companies such as Google, Amazon and Apple dominate distribution.That is causing problems for media conglomerates with old-established brands in film, television and print. They are facing similar problems to the consumer goods companies that confront powerful discounting distributors, particularly Walmart.Apart from the influence of technology, the biggest secular shift in brand value is the continuing rise of emerging market brands. Some 13 of the top 100 brands now come from emerging markets, with seven of these from China. In the 2006 ranking there was just one emerging-market brand – China Mobile.For the moment, most of these brands tend to be based on finance or resources, with banks such as ICICI of India and China Construction Bank, and energy companies such as PetroChina and Petrobras combining both financial value and a large domestic market.One reason for the two latter groups’ debut in the latest BrandZ Top 100 is that MBO has used new research to reflect the upstream brand value of oil companies for the first time. Previously, only the downstream distribution arms of energy groups such as BP and ExxonMobil were fully reflected in the brand rankings.This has had a significant effect, with BP being allocated a brand value of $17bn and entering the top 100 at 34 while ExxonMobil comes in just behind it in 39th place, with brand value of $15.5bn. It is an illustration of how brands matter not just to customers but in a business-to-business context.As ever, the year included examples of famous brands having difficulties – the most notable being Toyota, the Japanese car company. Problems with the brakes on some models led to product recalls in the US and damage to its reputation for quality.Toyota’s brand value fell from $29.9bn in the 2009 ranking to $21.7bn in the latest one, and the effect of the product recalls may not yet have fully worked its way through. Toyota joined Home Depot, another well-established brand that lost its way, falling from a brand value of $18.3bn in 2007 to $9bn this year.Many analysts expected problems for luxury clothing and goods makers, which faced a wave of discounting by retailers at the end of 2008, and fears about whether consumers would continue to be extremely high prices for a luxury image.In practice, however, well-established luxury goods brands such as Louis Vuitton have kept their value, even if they have not seen the kind of growth they might have hoped for. The value of the Louis Vuitton brand, at $19.8bn, is 2 per cent up on the previous year.So, despite the shock that many experienced following the financial crisis, brands are playing their traditional role of giving companies some cushion against market pressures. They have proved their capacity to retain loyalty among consumers even through downturns.Many brands will experience crises, or simply stagnate, in the coming year and have to claw their way back but the aftermath of the crisis has proven once again an old lesson. Brands may suffer, but they are hard to destroy altogether."
687;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-04-27T23:54:04Z;Social media: Big names are all a-Twitter over Facebook;;When first faced with the prospect of marketing on social networks, many people ask a reasonable question: how many people want to be friends with a brand? The answer – surprisingly, perhaps – is: millions do, on a daily basis.More than 10m people each day become a “fan” of a brand on Facebook. The world’s largest social network – with well in excess of 400m members globally – plays host to more than 1.4m branded fan pages on Facebook. BrandZ Top 100 brands such as Coca-Cola and Starbucks, along with other smaller brands outside the Top 100 such as Adidas (brand value or BV of $3.3bn in the latest MBO list), have each “befriended” millions of people.“A lot of our best brand builders are also some of the best companies using social media,” says Joanna Seddon, chief executive of Millward Brown Optimor, which compiles the BrandZ ranking. “A lot of the leadership in social media is really centred in the top 100 brands.”Social media has matured rapidly in recent years. Sites such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter offer scale and reach to rival Google – still the most dominant single site for online advertising – and many television channels. The best advertisers use social media alongside these traditional channels for a combination of brand-building, direct sales, customer service and PR. The worst simply ignore them, blissful only until they realise the complaints and accusations that disgruntled customers are telling other would-be consumers.“Social media have given consumers a voice to respond, as well as hundreds of channels through which to do so,” says Debbie Klein, joint chief executive of Engine, a UK-based agency group. “These websites have fundamentally transformed marketing from a monologue to a dialogue. Brands cannot hide.”Eurostar, for instance, faced criticism last December for ignoring Twitter messages – which, unlike most Facebook posts, are usually made public for anyone to read – from angry customers trapped on trains between Paris and London. Eurostar had failed to grab its brand name on Twitter, and its main presence on the site – named “little_break” to tie into a wider marketing campaign – was still showing special offers rather than information on the disrupted service for some hours after the problems began.In the fast-paced, “real-time” environment of Twitter, just a few hours is long enough for such criticism to spread widely, be chewed over by its denizens and, if it reaches a certain volume, be picked up and amplified further by the mainstream media. Kevin Smith, a film director, caused a similar Twitter storm when he complained to more than 1m followers that Southwest Airlines threw him off a flight for being overweight. Southwest later made two public apologies on its blog.But for every Eurostar or Southwest, there is a success story that proves social media need not be just for moaning and crisis management. Dell, another Top 100 brand, claims to have generated several million dollars in sales from Twitter alone, where it regularly posts special offers on its computers.Facebook likes to point to the example of Adidas, the sportswear maker which has more than 2.7m fans on its Adidas Originals page. Each fan is estimated to be worth around $100 a year in footwear, making its fan page a community worth more than $200m with which it can communicate directly all year around, for only the cost of maintaining the page. Becoming a fan of a brand on Facebook means agreeing to allow a company to send messages into that user’s main “news feed” – the part of the site in which Facebookers spend around two thirds of their time.The new forms of social media are also generating new creative possibilities for brands. Ahead of the launch of its new Fiesta, Ford (BV up 19 per cent this year to $7bn, just short of the cut for making the Top 100) gave 100 “internet celebrities” the latest model and gave them freedom to document their experience online. Millions of YouTube viewings later, they had sold 10,000 cars in six days and had ready-made content for the TV ad officially launching the car.Last year, Burger King’s “Whopper Sacrifice” offered a free hamburger to anybody who deleted 10 of their Facebook friends. Each sacrificial victim was sent a message explaining what had happened, and so the message spread (at least, until Facebook made Burger King tone down its application after more than 200,000 such sacrifices were made).But although social media can be used to achieve high impact with much lower investment than traditional media, seasoned observers note that many ostensibly “viral” campaigns have had more than a little nudge along the way.“The beauty of social media is that they are accessible across a large range of budgets,” says Jason Klein, co-president of LBi in New York, a digital agency. “[As for Facebook] pages with hundreds of thousands of people, some [companies or products] have brand equity to attract that but a lot, I would assume, have been driven up with some form of media buy … Facebook has been shrewd about building a platform that makes it very difficult to grow groups organically.”Facebook’s “engagement ads” are one way for companies to buy traffic for their fan pages. Twitter has recently introduced advertising in its search results, in the form of “promoted tweets”, which have seen Starbucks’ messages appear when people search for “coffee”.But Mr Klein warns against using follower counts or group size as a measure of success in social media. “People don’t know what they want to get back so they have to hang their hat on the number of posts, friends or comments. We have tried hard to educate our clients that even though these aren’t the exact metrics to know something is successful, to focus just on the numbers takes your eye off the ball a bit. Would I rather have thousands of people believe in my brand than hundreds of thousands signing up because they got a free key chain?”Navigating the constantly evolving world of social media will claim more casualties yet.Simon Clift, until recently the chief marketing officer at Unilever, has warned of a “lost generation” of marketers who do not understand the social web, either because they are too old, or too young to learn from their children.“There is no question that social media of all the challenges in media is the hardest one,” Mr Clift says. “You have to listen rather than impose, which is difficult for all marketers.”Meanwhile, in another sign of the times, Facebook has made its own debut in the BrandZ rankings. With a BV of $5.5bn, it is not yet in the Top 100, but slips in as 20th in the Technology Top 20.
688;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-04-27T23:54:04Z;Across the sectors: brand value rankings for 17 business categories;;Reflecting last year’s less volatile business environment when compared with 2008, the rises and falls in the aggregate brand values of the 17 categories covered by the 2010 BrandZ ranking are less marked.Whereas the biggest risers in the 2009 ranking were mobile operators, up 28 per cent, and soft drinks, up 24 per cent, the steepest rise this time is just 12 per cent for financial institutions, reversing the 11 per cent decline a year earlier.At the other end of the table, cars and insurance are still battling for the wooden spoon, but at least this time both sectors have stemmed the decline. After a whopping 48 per cent decline in brand value in last year’s ranking, insurance has fallen just 7 per cent this time, while cars are down 15 per cent, compared with 22 per cent a year ago.Financial Institutions12%Beer10%Technology6%Fast Food1%Retail-1%Soft Drinks-1%Mobile Networks-1%Bottled Water-2%Gaming Consoles-3%Spirits-3%Luxury-3%Apparel-4%Personal Care-4%Coffee-6%Insurance-7%Cars-15%Here are briefing notes on all the categories, with comments from Joanna Seddon, chief executive of Millward Brown Optimor, Peter Walshe, MBO’s global BrandZ director, Nick Cooper, senior vice-president of MBO in the UK and Europe, and Cristiana Pearson, an MBO director. (NB: to produce the top 10s and in some cases top 20s, many brands are included that are too small for the Top 100. So, while all constituents of the financial services Top 20 are in the Top 100, none of the bottled water Top 10 are anywhere near big enough to get in. The Coffee and Games Consoles categories have only eight and six constituents respectively).ApparelPearson: “Not much movement but Nike has taken back its number one position from H&M”. Seddon: “People are no longer totally shopping at H&M, they’re not feeling quite as poor.” Pearson: “Next is a recovery brand, it was down 40 per cent last year so has recovered its value. It has tried to adopt the Zara/H&M model of quick turnround of trends and moving its products fast through the stores. It has also adopted a strategy of moving from the cities to larger spaces in retail parks, which has been quite successful.”BeerPearson: “As last year, light beer brands are growing faster. Corona, the Mexican brand is also doing well, helped by its “Corona tu espacio” concept of having a moment alone with your Corona. Skol is benefiting from the merger of Anheuser-Busch and InBev, and from its strong position in Brazil where it is very involved in cultural events, music festivals, things that young people really bond with.”Bottled waterPearson: “The only brand really going up is Evian, with its Roller Babies campaign which was very successful.” Nick: “Evian’s Live Young campaign suggests and communicates a benefit and that there is actually a point to drinking water, which I think has perhaps helped the brand.”CarsPearson: “Toyota is no longer top, as a corporation it has been affected by the recalls, so that has impacted on the financials [which form an element of the brand value formula]. Walshe: “Millward Brown did some research in the US in January, which said, not surprisingly, that people’s perception of Toyota as a reliable brand had slipped, and also it wasn’t to be trusted as much as their domestic brands. But when you split that out between users or owners, and non-owners, with the owners there was only a very slight slip, so there was an inherent loyalty there, which is to do with what the brand has done in the past. Toyota is trying quite hard now [to rebuild its reputation] with advertising, inviting owners to contact them, saying that all the cars have been checked, and guaranteeing it all. Now, I think it’s a brand that might have a greater chance of being believed simply because of its strength in the past.” Seddon: “All the brands are down except for Ford, VW and Audi in the top 10. Ford, apart from having the best social media campaign ever, has stepped into the hole left by GM. Ford dealt with the whole [crisis in the US car industry] beautifully from a brand and reputation point-of-view.”CoffeePearson: “The same story as last year, Nespresso is the big winner. It continues to do incredibly well for the same reasons as before – it’s affordable luxury. It continues to introduce new flavours and new machines.” Seddon: “Otherwise, everything’s down apart from Starbucks, and of course this brand now includes coffee sold at supermarkets.” Pearson: “Because of the recession Starbucks has introduced different packages which are more like value packs, so you pay less for bigger packs and this has worked quite well, especially in the US.”Fast foodSeddon: “Look how dominant McDonald’s is. It hasn’t particularly grown [brand value is actually down 1 per cent] but it’s a fabulous brand.” Pearson: “Last year was the fast food year, [the sector rose 16 per cent in the 2009 ranking, but only 1 per cent this time] and a lot of that was driven by McDonald’s.” Seddon: “Burger King is down quite sharply, it claims that the reason it is are not doing so well is because of the weather and swine flu.” Pearson: “Compared with McDonald’s Burger King is very much more exposed to the US, even though it is opening a lot of stores outside the US.” Seddon: “Subway is worth a mention – it has a really healthy reputation but it’s the $5 Footlong which has really benefited it. The Footlong was supposed to be temporary when Subway launched it and it has been incredibly successful and kind of turbocharged Subway’s performance.”Financial InstitutionsSee separate article.Games ConsolesPearson: “This is all about a technology switch as new generations of consoles come in. Nintendo’s Wii is still growing, as is PlayStation 3, but next year we’ll probably not see PlayStation 2 at all. Also the at-home consoles are doing better than the portable ones like Nintendo DS because the hardcore and serious gamers don’t really use handhelds.”InsuranceSeddon: “This category is all over the place [brand value changes range from a 19 per cent rise at State Farm to a 47 per cent fall at ING]. Pearson: “State farm has a top score of 5 in brand contribution so it is very trusted.” Seddon: “ING won’t be in business next year [last October ING unveiled a radical break-up forced on it by the European Commission that will see the Dutch financial services group sell off its insurance and investment management business following the state bail-out in 2008]. Walshe: Zurich Insurance have done a big branding campaign in Europe, which has been successful.LuxuryPearson: “This category is a bit of a mixed bag again. Louis Vuitton, Hermès and Gucci were the three brands that rose [apart from Tiffany] and these really are the traditional, staple luxury brands.” Seddon: “It was generally a bit of a dismal year for luxury but those three brands stuck to their knitting, they all said ‘We are the classic luxury brands, we’re not compromising. They are real, classic luxury brands. The other brands are not so classic. People have been drinking less champagne – all those investment bankers, there’s fewer of them.”Mobile operatorsSeddon: “Here we’ve got the modern, legal form of addiction in mature markets. All the top 10 mobile operators are in the top 100, and a lot of this is because of apps – it’s all that data flowing through, which increased the arpu (average revenue per user). Verizon Wireless has done a very good job, part of this is about the fact that AT&T had the iPhone and, big though their network was, the iPhone apps were too popular, leading to reception problems, and Verizon took that on, head on, and went with Google’s Android [mobile operating system]. The positioning is very different, it’s more techy and less fluffy and social, but Verizon have done very well. For AT&T the iPhone was too popular for its own good. Elsewhere, very few companies have two of their brands in the Top 100, but Spain’s Telefónica owns both Movistar and O2. Movistar has been doing very well – that is really about growth in Latin America. O2 has been very successful in monetising the brand through apps and use of the phone, so for example it has got a platform called O2 Money, which is enormously successful. It has also got one of the best music downloads. And it has successfully grown the brand outside the UK in Ireland, Germany and the Czech Republic. O2 has also gone into fixed line with ADSL [asymmetric digital subscriber line] quite recently. Finally, China Mobile’s brand value went down. It has been enormously successful, but now it has new competition in China, as China Telecom has been licensed to compete with it.”Oil and gas brandsSee separate article.Personal careColgate is the only brand to have achieved a rise of 10 per cent or more in this category, and across the Top 15 there are more fallers than risers. Dove, the Unilever brand which is outside the Top 100, also did well, while Avon and Nivea are the biggest fallers.RetailersSeddon: “Amazon is the top performer in this category. It continues to take business away from Ebay [the biggest faller in this category by a long chalk] and in fact is every retailer’s biggest competitor now. Amazon’s biggest competitor is Walmart, that’s who it is targeting. If you look at Amazon’s sales, it is general merchandise – the stuff that Walmart sells, that is rising fastest. So Amazon has really branched out from being just a book and media merchandiser to being Walmart on the internet. And don’t forget the Kindle [e-book] which has been enormously successful – I’ve seen people reading Kindles on public transport everywhere from the Moscow metro to New York.” Pearson: “The other important thing is that, a year ago, we were talking about people buying online to save money in the recession, but in fact I think there’s a long-term shift on the way people are shopping. Amazon is also constantly innovating, so last year it was Amazon Prime, in which you pay once a year and get free delivery. Now it is allowing individuals to sell their products online without charging a fee, and that is a direct challenge to Ebay.” Walshe: Best Buy [just outside the Top 10] is also doing well, it has benefited from the closure of some of its rivals.Soft drinksPearson: “There is still the theme that diet and light brands are doing better than staple products – we see that in Diet Pepsi. Although Diet Coke is down, there has been a big rise in Coke Zero’s brand value.” Seddon: “Coke Zero has been the most successful launch that Coca-Cola has had in 22 years – it’s ‘bloke Coke’.” Pepsi’s fall is for financial reasons although the brand contribution is relatively stable, while Gatorade’s brand contribution increased significantly, offsetting the slightly negative financial results. This brand is outside the Top 100.SpiritsPearson: “This is terribly unexciting, not much has happened at all. It has been a tough year in general for spirits brands, it is a difficult category to innovate in because it’s all about flavours and bottles and packaging.”TechnologyThis is one of the biggest categories, with huge variations in performance across the top 20. The three biggest risers, Samsung, Baidu and Hewlett-Packard, are covered in the Risers and Fallers article. Then come Apple and IBM with a 32 and 30 per cent rise respectively. Walshe: “All the brands in the Top 100 are either extremely trusted or highly recommended by their users, and a lot of them are both. Both companies’ brand values have risen by about $20bn, so they are the top actual value growers in the rankings. IBM is driven hugely by trust whereas for Apple it is recommendation.”Seddon: “IBM has done has done a very, very good job of buying up software companies. Whenever it sees there’s a need in the marketplace it finds a software company that’s doing it and then pumps it through its brand marketing machine with fabulous branding, fabulous marketing and that’s what you get. So, it’s very much a branded story, it was “e-business” now it’s “a smarter planet”. It’s a company that was turned around by Lou Gerstner, very much on the idea of brand. It’s also a global brand with global executions, it shows you the power that you can get from leveraging one brand globally across the world.” Seddon: “BlackBerry has been one of our enormous growers and over the past five years its brand value has more than doubled, but that has slowed off. It’s a great device and it’s become a great brand, but does it have as strong an emotional connection with the users as, say, Apple’s iPhone? Maybe not. It’s marketed more as a device than as an enabler of your life. And the growth of the iPhone has probably stopped BlackBerry growing as fast as it could, because consumers want the exciting apps [that the iPhone offers]. Seddon: “Another interesting one is Oracle. Oracle has bought Sun but its brand value doesn’t include Sun because it has not rebranded Sun, so they are separate. Oracle is famously aggressive, is ruthlessly controlled from the top, global and it’s in both business productivity, software as well as in databases. Oracle is also interesting because it comes back to one of our themes this year, the brand that is driven by the chief executive. SAP is Oracle’s biggest competitor, and since SAP’s founder retired it has been losing market share to Oracle.”Three of the four worst-performing brands in this year’s Top 100, Nokia, Intel and Siemens, are in this category and are covered in the Risers and Fallers article. Another poor performer this year was Dell, down 24 places at 66th after a 23 per cent fall in brand value. Seddon: “Dell was the biggest, number one in PC market share, but HP has come back from the dead and taken over that position. Also, Dell has traditionally only sold direct and there is a fundamental love that people have for wanting to twiddle with technology before they buy. [If you sell direct and focus on low prices], it’s not a sustainable positioning because the Chinese brands, the Acers of this world, will come out and underprice you. So, I think there’s a brand building story under way, hopefully.”Finally, scraping in at No. 20 in the Technology Top 10, but not yet in the Top 100, is Facebook, with brand value of $5.5bn. Walshe: “A few years ago Facebook would have been in the Top 100 with a value at that level.” Pearson: “The structure has changed because Facebook’s users were young people, originally, but there was a shift last year and older people and businesses are on it now. That is what happened with Twitter, too.”
689;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;S&P in late recovery to reclaim positive territory;;US stock prices staged a late comeback on Thursday to end the session higher following a well-received speech by President Obama on financial reform.A benign producer price index, falling jobless claims figures and decent existing home sales gave some support. Growing worries about Greek debt woes and a number of disappointing earnings and forecast announcements, however, weighed on the market.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent at 1,208.67, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1 per cent to 11,134.29 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 2,519.07.“The news has been pretty bullish overall [in this earnings season] but yesterday evening that changed and turned much more mixed, with high profile companies like Ebay and Qualcomm guiding the market down,” said Nick Kalivas, vice-president of financial research at MF Global.Ebay an online retailer, was one of the session’s worst performers, down 5.7 per cent to $24.78 as it stood by its previous full-year earnings outlook, disappointing those who had expected it to be raised in the wake of improving e-commerce trends.Qualcomm lost 7.7 per cent to $39.35 as the chipmaker forecast lower-than-expected revenues for the full-year and said pricing was still “a challenging environment”.The pharmaceutical sector was the worst performer. “The market is very disappointed in the pharma sector. Several companies have said the healthcare bill is expected to hurt revenue growth and profits,” said Mr Kalivas.Abbott Laboratoriesfell 1.3 per cent to $51.12, Johnson & Johnson was 0.9 per cent lower at $64.78 and Eli Lilly lost 1.8 per cent to $35.38. All have said the bill will adversely affect their earnings.Verizon Communications declined 1 per cent to $29.28 on the back of weaker-than- expected first-quarter figures, with disappointing wir eless subscriber growth. Verizon’s first-quarter net income fell to $409m, or 14 cents per share, from $1.6bn, or 58 cents per share, in the same quarter last year.Soft drinks and snacks group PepsiCo slipped 1.9 per cent to $64.76 as its first quarter revenues missed estimates. However, earnings were better than Wall Street was expecting.Starbucks rallied 7.3 per cent to $27.25 as the world’s largest coffee shop operator posted strong revenues and lower costs in its first quarter results released after Wednesday’s close and raised its full-year guidance.Philip Morris tumbled 1.4 per cent to $51.24 as the tobacco group that sells Malboro cigarettes internationally reported first-quarter earnings that missed analysts’ average estimates.
690;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-04-21T23:09:47Z;Starbucks plans instant coffee marketing push;;Starbucks plans to spend the majority of its $40m marketing budget to promote its Via brand of instant coffee and Frappucino drinks through grocery stores over the next few months, a significant break from its general aversion to traditional advertising and marketing.Troy Alstead, chief financial officer, revealed the company’s plans during a conference call in which the company fiscal second quarter earnings of $217m, almost a tenfold increase over the $25m earned during the period last year.Mr Alstead said the marketing budget, which would be rolled out in the next quarter, amounted to about 5 cents per share of the company’s earnings. The company declared EPS of 28 cents on Wednesday on its quarterly earnings.Starbucks reported a 9 per cent jump in revenues for the quarter, to $2.5bn, driven by increased store traffic and a higher average spend by customers.The revenue growth suggests that the Seattle coffee company’s strong performance in the previous quarter—from October through December 2009—was not a fluke but the beginning of what Starbucks has described as a turnaround.“Starbucks’ second quarter results demonstrate the impact of innovation and the success of our efforts to dramatically transform our business over the last two years,” said Howard Schultz, chief executive, in a statement. Mr. Schultz said the introduction of Via, an instant coffee, contributed to the company’s strong performance, along with the opening of new stores in the US, Europe and Asia.After sensational growth in the 1990s, the coffee chain continued its expansion this decade across the US and internationally, even as same-store sales began to lag. After a disappointing 2007, Mr. Schultz—who nurtured the company’s growth in the 1990s before retiring—returned as chief executive, with a promise to refocus the chain and improve its operations.For Starbucks’ fiscal second quarter—January through March—the chain’s US operations reported $1.8bn in revenues, a 5 per cent increase over the previous year’s tally. Internationally, Starbucks reported $534m in revenues, a 23 per cent improvement, stemming from improved sales and favourable currency translations.In a conference call, Mr Schultz described the company as a “leaner, vastly more efficient structure” and added, “Global retail expansion will be achieved by combining coffee leadership with operational excellence”.“Via is not a product or a promotion”, said Mr Schultz. “It’s a significant new platform for the company”. Mr Schultz said Via would be available in 30,000 stores this quarter and that Via could grow to be a billion-dollar brand for the company.
691;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-04-13T21:30:40Z;Twitter branches out to instant advertisers;;For a service that has been so long in development, Twitter’s advertising platform, announced on Tuesday, feels remarkably familiar.Twitter is closely following Google’s game plan of slowly building a user base, before gently introducing a system of advertising that seeks to match commercial messaging with individuals’ interests.By showing that advertising can be relevant and useful to users of its search engine, Google made sponsored results the internet’s main form of advertising.“Promoted tweets”, as Twitter is calling its twist on the model, will allow brands to place a short message at the top of the list of search results when users of the microblogging website look for information about a particular product, company or news event.The ad will be persistent, so that it is not lost in the hourly deluge of tweets with only one ad appearing on each page of search results.Biz Stone, Twitter co-founder, said promoted tweets would be a “powerful means of delivering information relevant to [the user] at the moment”.The scheme is Twitter’s first serious effort at generating revenue after building up an estimated 50m regular users of its service, which started in 2006.That has left some observers questioning quite why it took Twitter so long.“It hasn’t really caught us by surprise,” said Norm Johnston, global digital leader for Mindshare Worldwide, a media buyer.“It’s a good step . . . It’s not Second Life, but nor is it Google.”Twitter will be hoping to avoid the fate suffered by Second Life, the hugely hyped virtual world that failed to provide a lasting destination for brands.“As this is the first introduction of advertising directly to the Twitter audience, they are clearly being very sensitive to how these new promoted tweets are shown,” said Chris Clarke, executive creative director at LBi, a digital marketing agency.Building the software systems that can ensure promoted tweets are relevant – or, as Twitter puts it, “resonant” – is crucial to ensuring users do not decamp to another social networking platform.The waning fortunes of Bebo and MySpace, which secured valuations close to Twitter’s purported $1bn equity value, attest to that risk.“This is high-performance computing – to do targeting on that level from scratch is a pretty big engineering task,” says Jonathan Nelson, head of Omnicom Digital.“If we are advertising for a travel client, we are going to look at how many ticket sales it leads to.”Although Twitter’s first paying advertisers are brand names such as Starbucks and Red Bull, emulating Google’s model means it will largely attract advertisers looking for an instant response to an ad.That contrasts with Facebook, a much larger social network, which is hoping to attract consumer-goods advertisers.But Twitter’s ability to advertise in a highly time-sensitive way also makes it a unique location for certain kinds of promotions.“It’s like Lastminute.com on steroids,” said Mark Read, head of digital at WPP, allowing hotels to sell vacant rooms or airlines to fill a plane at very short notice.“To date it’s been used by a lot of clients without [having to pay] Twitter . . . Giving advertisers a [better] way to communicate with consumers could help [Twitter] to become more mainstream.”As well as advertisers, Twitter is hoping to win over the many companies who make tools based on its constant stream of information.That includes software such as Seesmic and Tweetdeck, which are used by heavy Twitter users to read and post comments, and analytics sites such as Habit Stream or Tweetminster, which aggregate the mass of tweets into more digestible data.On Tuesday, a day ahead of Twitter’s Chirp conference, 20 of the main developers were gathering in San Francisco to discuss the raft of changes Twitter has unveiled in recent days, including its purchase of mobile developer Tweetie.Twitter’s move appeared to threaten the business model for TweetUp, a site offering advertising around tweets that launched only this week.But in spite of potentially competing with some of their products, developers welcomed Twitter’s pledge to share ad revenues with third-party clients.“It was Google’s great strength that it helped other people make money,” said Saul Klein, an investor in Tweetdeck through the Accelerator Group. “It’s a good thing for the Twitter ecosystem that it has a business model not only for itself but that it can share.”
692;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-04-13T05:40:33Z;Twitter unveils ad platform;;Twitter has unveiled its long-awaited monetisation plans. Through a programme called Promoted Tweets, the company will allow businesses to bid on keywords, similar to Google’s highly successful AdWords system.Twitter gave details to the New York Times and AdAge, which posted their stories late on Monday night San Francisco time.According to those reports, the system will allow advertisers to bid on keywords on a CPM basis. When a user searches for a term on search.twitter.com, one ad will show up at the top of the stream and be identified as a “promoted” tweet. Initial advertisers include Starbucks, Virgin America and Best Buy.The move comes a day ahead of Chirp, Twitter’s inaugural developers conference, which begins on Wednesday in San Francisco. It also follows by a day the debut of TweetUp, a company that was seeking to use a nearly identical approach to cash in on tweets.It was just on Friday that Twitter bought Tweetie, a popular iPhone client. With Twitter now in the business of search ads and building clients for multiple platforms, developers at Chirp will likely be looking for answers as to what part of the Twitter ecosystem they should focus on.
693;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Dividends on the rise as market recovers;;The improving outlook for markets is welcome news for income investors hunting for higher yields. In a sharp reversal of the situation in 2009, dividend payouts from shares in some companies are set to rise by more than 5 per cent this year, advisers predict.The revival in dividend payments follows many barren months. The credit crisis had a severe effect on companies across a range of sectors in 2008 and 2009, forcing many to cut or suspend quarterly and annual dividend payments.In 2009, payouts fell by 20 per cent in the US and 15 per cent in the UK, with cuts and suspensions reported by a number of UK banks, as well as key dividend payers including mining and natural resources group Anglo-American, British Telecom, retailer Marks & Spencer and mining group XStrata.The first four months of 2009 were the worst quarter in history for dividend payments, with 367 US-listed companies cutting payouts and an overall reduction of $43.8bn in dividends, according to ratings and research group Standard & Poor’s (S&P). Meanwhile, dividend payments from companies listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange – excluding investment companies – fell by 15 per cent to £56.9bn ($88.7bn) in 2009, according to Capita Registrars.But S&P revealed this week that just 48 of the 7,000 or so companies it tracks reduced their dividends in the first quarter of 2010. So far this year, at least eight companies listed in New York, including coffee chain Starbucks, hotel group Marriott and entertainment group Time Warner have raised or introduced dividend payments.“Improved market conditions reduced economic pressures and permitted more companies to loosen their grip on cash expenditures during the first quarter,” says Howard Silverblatt, senior analyst at S&P.The weakness of sterling is also expected to help boost dividends from companies that report earnings in US dollars or euros, such as resources group BHP Billiton and household products giant Unilever.Ted Scott, head of UK equity strategy, at F&C Asset Management claims that oil companies such as BP and Shell, which both pay over 5.5 per cent on a historical basis, could even raise dividends if the crude oil price, now breaking above $85, keeps climbing.Utilities groups such as National Grid, which pays 5.5 per cent, will not raise dividends because of regulatory requirements for capital. But utilities groups are still attractive because many offer yields that are index-linked against the retail price index, a key measure of inflation. So, their returns will not suffer erosion if prices rise higher across the UK, Scott predicts.Scott also favours pharmaceuticals company GlaxoSmithKline, which pays 4.8 per cent and is expected to increase its dividend by 7 per cent this year and 6 per cent in 2011, as well as tobacco group BAT, which outperformed the market by a factor of close to 10 until early last year. Another sought-after income stock is Vodafone, which pays 5.3 per cent.“Remember, with the ‘magic’ of compounding by reinvesting the proceeds of the dividends, the returns will be much higher, something that is not applicable to the good-performing lower yielding shares,” Scott wrote in a note to investors earlier this year.But to diversify portfolios, more income investors are looking for yields overseas. The top 10 dividend payers in the FTSE-100, led by BP, Royal Dutch Shell, HSBC, Vodafone and GlaxoSmithKline, still account for 60 per cent of total expected dividend payouts for the entire UK market. This level of concentration is considered a drawback.One country on investors’ radar is Brazil, where many listed companies maintain dividend policies that allow them to reach the minimum cash distribution of 25 per cent of their net income, according to Ryan Bransfield, an analyst with the research group Markit. Vale, the materials company, and Gerdau, the steel maker, are recommended stocks.Tony Nutt, manager of Jupiter’s High Income fund, argues that income stocks are now a better bet for income than corporate bonds, which saw large inflows last year but have suffered falling yields in recent months. But Nutt thinks some retail investors are still reluctant to switch out of fixed-income holdings. “We’ve had a real shock to the dividend paying system, led by the banks, and I think confidence will be rebuilt slowly,” he says.UK equity income funds have underperformed the market in the past 12 months, returning 45 per cent against a 53 per cent return by the FTSE All-Share index. In the past five years, the best-performing UK equity income funds have been Invesco Perpetual High Income and Schroder Income, both up 52 per cent.Justin Modray, director of the advisory group Candidmoney.com, attributes the sluggish results to managers’ positions in defensive sectors such as pharmaceuticals, oil, tobacco and utilities, which have lagged behind the stock market rally. But Modray points out that such stocks tend to perform better in uncertain times, so the tide may turn if markets go sideways.However, Silverblatt warns that the recovery in dividend payments will be slow and hinge on economic improvement and stabilisation in the jobs market. “We believe that it will take until 2013 for the broader dividend market to return to 2007-08 levels,” he says.
694;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-04-04T19:35:54Z;Dividend theory;There are two classic management mistakes investors must watch for;Nowhere do actions speak louder than words than in business. One of the best ways to understand whether a company is being run efficiently and in the best interests of shareholders is to watch what it does with its cash. What to make, therefore, of Starbucks’ announcement last week that it intends to pay a dividend for the first time since it went public?Assuming tax neutrality, investors in theory should not care whether companies pay a dividend or not. (That is why a share price falls when a stock goes ex-dividend). All other things being equal too, companies should be indifferent as to whether they hoard cash or raise equity. What matters, therefore, is opportunity cost. Would the internal rate of return generated for shareholders be larger if cash was put to work by management or paid out?Timing is everything. Forget the hogwash that rising dividends are a positive signal. Sometimes they are, sometimes they aren’t. If a company has been growing rapidly with low pay-out ratios and suddenly increases its dividend, investors should question whether management is running short of investment ideas. This is what should be asked of Starbucks – now targeting a 35-40 per cent pay-out ratio – although management swears it still has plenty of cash for investment.There is nothing wrong with a company going ex-growth provided it recognises the fact by running its businesses for cash and, if it wishes, paying it out. There are two classic management mistakes to watch out for, however. First is a growing company upping dividends and buy-backs while not reinvesting enough in its business. Here investors should make sure capital expenditure-to-sales ratios do not start falling. The second, more common, mistake is mature or declining companies deluding themselves that they are still growth stocks. Starbucks appears to have avoided both extremes. Beware companies that do not.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
695;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;US consumers display stronger vital signs;;Rosalind Wells, chief economist at the National Retail Federation, has been among the keenest observers of Americans’ spending patterns for more than 30 years.Nothing in her long career watching US consumers, she said, compared with the impact of the last recession. “Consumers were in hibernation,” said Ms Wells. “People were really scared. Even those who had jobs and income were worried.”But Ms Wells, a former chief economist at JC Penney, a near-ubiquitous presence in US shopping malls, said there were signs Americans were finally buying goods and services again. “They are coming back to life a little.”Her cautious optimism is supported by recent government data, which suggest that consumer spending could grow at a rate of 3 per cent or more in the first quarter. That would mark a big jump compared with the 1.6 per cent rise in consumer spending during the fourth quarter of 2009, and the measure’s best performance since the start of 2007.Reports by corporate America are also comforting. At Home Depot, the largest US home improvement retailer, customers are again buying kitchen counter tops and bathroom cabinets. At Kroger, the supermarket chain, shoppers are putting bunches of cut flowers in their baskets, and selecting better wines. Red Lobster, the casual dining restaurant chain, has reported its first positive sales growth for two years. Starbucks and Whole Foods Market, both popular with middle-class shoppers, have seen their sales begin to increase again. “It’s a direct result of people feeling they can spend some discretionary money,” said David Dillon, Kroger’s chief executive, this week.Renewed strength among consumers would provide a big boost to the US economic recovery, which has to date been led by higher business spending and by slower inventory depletion. More evidence of the strength or weakness of the recovery is due on Friday when the US publishes non-farm payrolls data.Many economists think any consumer spending upswing remains limited. Persistently high unemployment, now at 9.7 per cent, as well as high debt of many US households, and housing market woes, are seen as structural barriers to spending that would be hard to break down. A fresh concern is gasoline prices – rising by some 15 per cent, to $2.82 per gallon, during the past six months.To drive the recovery, US consumer spending would have to increase to at least 4 per cent this year. Most economists believe that after the first quarter consumer spending could weaken slightly to rates closer to 2 per cent. “I don’t think we should expect the consumer to be a leader at any stage in the recovery,” said Nigel Gault, chief US economist at IHS Global Insight.Chris Donnelly, retail consultant at Accenture, said: “The good news is it’s not getting worse and it has stabilised. But you still have so many economic issues …weighing on US consumers. I think you will see a prolonged period of slow growth. It’s better than uncertainty and decline – but it’s not robust growth.”Some see reasons to be optimistic. This year’s surge in US equity prices has opened wallets of more affluent consumers, boosting sales of luxury goods.Joe Lavorgna, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank, said the recent consumer spending increase occurred even without much activity in “durable goods” such as cars, appliances, furniture and electronics. He argued there is a lot of “pent-up demand” for these which may support retail sales later.Low interest rates are a third factor. Americans’ bank accounts generate very little income, offering scant incentives to save.
696;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Weak housing figures damp US sentiment;standardise;"Mounting worries about the European sovereign debt situation curbed risk appetite, sending Wall Street stocks lower on Wednesday, with negative economic data also weighing on sentiment.New orders for durable goods in the US in February rose 0.5 per cent but missed analysts’ consensus projections for a 1 per cent gain.Sales of new homes in the US dropped for the fourth straight month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 308,000 – the lowest since records begun in 1963.“Housing is the weakest link in the recovery story,” said Howard Ward, portfolio manager of Gamco’s global growth fund. “Real estate makes up about 50 per cent of bank assets. A lot of these mortgages are going delinquent. It’s one area I find troubling, which is why we have a low exposure to financial stocks.”However, Mr Ward regards the broader economic recovery as “very resilient”.At the close, the S&P 500 was down .06 per cent to 1,167.72, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.5 per cent to 10,836.15 and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.7 per cent lower at 2,398.76.One bright sport for the US housing market was Lennar Corp, the third-
largest US housebuilder by revenue, which rallied 3.7 per cent to $17.69 after reporting better quarterly earnings than were expected. Its loss was significantly lower than expected at 4 cents a share versus consensus analyst expectations of a 30 cents a share loss and better than its 98 cents a share loss last year.Gross margins surged to 19.2 per cent from 6.5 per cent a year earlier as the company cut incentives for potential buyers.“Virtually every metric outperformed our expectation,” wrote Stephen East, analyst at Ticonderoga in a client note. “No matter how one cuts it, this was a strong report.”Adobe Systems was one of the session’s biggest risers, advancing 3.7 per cent to $36.51 as the world’s leading graphic design maker forecast significantly stronger second-quarter sales than analysts were expecting.The company said it would launch a new version of its most profitable software – Creative Suite, which comprises design software such as Photoshop – on April 12.Market analysts expect Adobe profit from pent-up demand for the product as many customers avoided upgrading to the current version during the recession.Two tech stocks staged successful debuts, raising hopes for the still struggling initial public offerings market. MaxLinear, a maker of broadband chips, rallied 33.6 per cent above its initial listing price to $18.70 while Calix Networks, a telecoms equipment company, surged 16.2 per cent to $15.10.The oil and gas sector was broadly lower as the price of crude oil fell. Chevron lost 1.1 per cent to $73.93 while ExxonMobil retreated 0.7 per cent to $66.50.ConocoPhillips, the third- largest US oil company by market share, bucked the trend to close flat at $52.53 as the company announced plans to sell half of its 20 per cent stake in Lukoil, Russia’s second-largest oil company, in the next two years.Coal and natural gas producer Consol Energy added 1.9 per cent to $45.70 as the stock was upgraded from “neutral” to “overweight” by John Bridges, an analyst at JPMorgan, with a nine-month target price of $53 a share.AK Steel gained 0.7 per cent to $23.33 after the steelmaker said it would record a non-cash charge of about $31m resulting from the US healthcare reform legislation. It is one of the first companies to take such a step following the passage of the bill on Sunday.MF Global rose 10.4 per cent to $8.08 as Jon Corzine, former New Jersey governor who ran Goldman Sachs from 1994 to 1999, was appointed chief executive of the New York-based futures and options broker.General Mills slipped 1.9 per cent to $72.18 despite the food conglomerate posting solid quarterly earnings, aided by new product sales, a focus on cost-cutting and lower input costs.Starbucks, the world’s largest coffee shop chain, fell 0.5 per cent to $25.29 after announcing a quarterly dividend of 10 cents a share, its first since going public in 1992."
697;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-03-21T22:12:42Z;Return of the barista-in-chief;;Sitting in his spacious but modestly furnished office at Starbucks’ headquarters on an industrial lot south of Seattle, Howard Schultz claims he is nothing more than a purveyor of high-quality coffee beans. “What I really am is a merchant,” he says, flashing a smile. “I have a sense of what people want.”“Merchant” is rather a modest job description for the 56-year-old New York native, who returned to a day-to-day role as chief executive two years ago to revive the fortunes of the company he nurtured from infancy into a global brand. Some see Mr Schultz as a visionary leader, rallying a despondent workforce against the mediocrity that had gained a foothold in the company.One thing it is impossible to deny is his passion for the company. Asked why he came back as chief executive, he replies: “The reason is love …I love this company. I love its 180,000 people. I feel a responsibility to them and to the shareholder base.”When Mr Schultz replaced Jim Donald in January 2008, the company was in disarray, a victim of overexpansion. From 2000 to 2007, it swelled from 9,000 stores to 15,000, with a presence in 43 countries, but it was stumbling badly in the US, posting like-for-like declines across many stores.Worse, Starbucks’ competitive advantage throughout the 1990s – its position as the “first mover” in the coffee shop category – had evaporated. At the high end, US chains such as Peet’s and other speciality shops pecked away at Starbucks’ premium position, while in the mass market, rivals such as McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts improved the quality of their offerings and undercut Starbucks on price. McDonald’s even purchased advertising space on billboards, skewering Starbucks’ high prices with lines such as “four bucks is dumb” and “large is the new grande”, lampooning Starbucks’ Italian-language sizes.In 2007, as the recession took hold, Starbucks’ sales eased. Soon the company came to be seen as a poster child for the frothy excess of a bygone era.Mr Schultz took the criticism personally. “When you love something and someone tries to take it away from you, you fight,” he says. Over freshly brewed coffee, he recalls the slights from the analysts and pundits that Starbucks’ “best days were over”.Mr Schultz’s history with Starbucks – which holds its annual meeting this week – goes back to 1982, when he left his comfortable position as a sales executive with a home-supply company to become marketing director at Starbucks, at that time a chain of four coffee bean stores in Seattle. The following year, in Milan, he had an epiphany when he witnessed the showmanship of Italian baristas and the sense of community those baristas engendered at Italian coffee bars.His pleas that Starbucks should serve fresh-brewed coffee fell on deaf ears, so he left to start Il Giornale, his own coffee bar. But in 1987, he raised $4m from investors that backed Il Giornale to buy Starbucks and refashion it as a chain of high-quality coffee stores. Five years later, he took it public and launched it on its meteoric rise. He vacated the chief executive position to become chairman in 2000.Mr Schultz went on to buy the Seattle Supersonics, a professional basketball team, promising to bring a championship to the second-tier team by running it like a business. He quickly realised he had made a mistake. “I knew early on that I had jumped into the deep end of the pool and I didn’t like the temperature,” he says.After several disappointing seasons, Mr Schultz sold the team to out-of-town investors who moved the squad to Oklahoma, transforming him into a pariah in his adopted city.Meanwhile, Starbucks had started to stumble. In February 2007, in what is now known as the “Valentine’s day memo”, Mr Schultz ripped into what he perceived to be the “commoditisation” of the Starbucks experience. The memorandum undermined Mr Donald but struck a chord among long-time store managers, who had witnessed the erosion of the Starbucks “experience”. The following January, when he reclaimed the chief executive role, Mr Schultz decided it was important to acknowledge the company’s errors, and his own role in them. “We had to sit and admit to ourselves that we had made mistakes,” he says. “Even though I wasn’t the CEO, I was the chairman.”In 2008, the company announced that it would close 600 underperforming stores and lay off 12,000 people. It also embarked on a productivity campaign designed to wring costs out of its stores while improving customer service. Mr Schultz says his status in the company meant he had more leeway – from employees, shareholders and analysts – to make drastic changes.More important, Mr Schultz also articulated a vision of where he thought Starbucks should be heading and blasted out memos to the entire workforce sharing that vision. “I had to overcommunicate in ways I have never done before,” he says.To read the memos now, which were labelled “Howard Schultz Transformation Agenda Communication #1” and “Howard Schultz Transformation Agenda Communication #2” and so on, is to enter a world where the chief executive had become a kind of “dear leader”, inspiring his charges. In “Communication #4”, under the heading, “What I Know to be True”, Mr Schultz wrote: “We will not be deterred from our course – we are and will be a great, enduring company, known for inspiring and nurturing the human spirit.” Finally, in a flourish worthy of Napoleon on the eve of battle, Mr Schultz vowed: “I will lead us back to the place where we belong, but I need your help and support …My expectations of you are high, but higher of myself.”Such exhortations might seem corny but in a company where Mr Schultz is regarded as a messiah, the missives set an important tone. Quality improved across the chain, the company took $580m of costs out of its expenses and like-for-like sales in the US picked up 4 per cent in the last quarter compared with the same quarter a year ago. Globally, the company has annual revenues of about $10bn (€7.3bn, £6.5bn).But not all costs were slashed. Mr Schultz drew criticism for flying 10,000 US store managers to New Orleans for a three-day leadership conference in October 2008. At the time, the capital markets were trembling from the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and the bail-out of AIG and the nation’s biggest banks.Mr Schultz spent what he describes as “tens of millions of dollars” to bring Starbucks staff to a city that was still recovering from hurricane Katrina. Employees volunteered more than 50,000 hours of labour to help non-governmental organisations fix up houses and clean roads. Then they gathered in a big auditorium where Mr Schultz talked about the “crucible” they were all in, and how they would make their way out.“That was one of the smartest things we did to reinstall the values of the company,” says Mr Schultz of the New Orleans retreat. By reorienting the workforce, Starbucks recouped the cost of the adventure many times over, he insists.It is a message, he adds, that must continue to be reinforced. After the Financial Times interview is over, Mr Schultz speaks at a conference of 50 store managers across the street from its headquarters. After congratulating them for their role in “one of the most historic turnrounds in corporate history”, he warns against complacency. “We can’t allow mediocrity to creep back into the business. The worst thing we could do is not understand what happened three years ago.”
698;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-03-19T22:57:32Z;Mr Espresso taught the world how to drink coffee;Emilio Lavazza, coffee entrepreneur, 1932-2010;The notion that only an Italian can make the world’s greatest cup of coffee seems to have been around since creation, so universally is it accepted today. Yet it is actually a fairly recent phenomenon. Emilio Lavazza, who has died aged 78, can claim much of the credit. He taught the world not only how to make coffee, but also how to drink it. That may explain why Italy has no Starbucks, and doesn’t seem to feel it’s missing out on anything.He was known as Mr Espresso, but it is said that Lavazza’s favourite coffee was a ristretto, the concentrated espresso that is Italian coffee at its simplest and most stimulating. He could be seen at the Caffé Platti in Turin, his hometown, stirring his ristretto, talking, planning, and dreaming up new ways of selling the idea of a cup of Italian coffee.Emilio Lavazza was born in 1932 and was a leading figure in the generation of Italian businessmen who joined their family firms in the 1950s and began to expand rapidly, first around the country and then abroad, as Italy enjoyed its long postwar economic expansion. This was the generation that sowed the seeds for what today has come to be called “Made in Italy” – the cluster of sectors and brands that make the household and consumer products, from fashion to food to furniture, that are identified with craftsmanship and the elegant Italian lifestyle. Lavazza ensured that coffee became an inextricable part of that heritage.Luigi Lavazza SpA, as the Lavazza business is known today, had its origins in a corner grocery store founded in Turin in 1895 by Emilio’s grandfather. He joined in 1955 as a door-to-door coffee salesman. By the time he became chief executive in 1971 it was already established as the country’s leading maker of coffee brands after it pioneered the concept of vacuum-packed ground coffee. This made coffee available in supermarkets and meant that café-quality coffee could be enjoyed at home just as much as in the corner café.It was the first of three crucial commercial breakthroughs for Lavazza, and also an important moment in the life of the nation. As the republic grew in confidence and became more prosperous from the 1950s onwards, its many riches were to become available much more widely across the country. Despite the tremendous regional variations in food, one can always be assured of getting a Turin- quality coffee no matter where one travels around the country.Lavazza’s second commercial breakthrough was more striking. Like many Italian entrepreneurs, he was a master salesman. In the 1950s advertising was introduced to Italian television, and he exploited it to the hilt. Between 1957 and 1977 RAI, the state broadcaster, set aside a 15-minute slot each evening for advertising, in a segment known as Carosello. (“After Carosello you must go to bed,” Italian parents used to admonish their children.) The programme carried advertising for up to five products, and the innovative and quirky style of the presentations made it a proving ground for young film-makers. It was here that Lavazza, in collaboration with Marco Testa, developed the charming and oddball animated characters Carmencita and Caballero, engaged in a complicated, coffee-infused courtship. (So popular were they that they were revived a few years ago for a soap opera.) Later the men would coin the catchphrase: “Lavazza coffee – the more you down, the more it picks you up.”The third breakthrough was international expansion. As the desire among Europeans and Americans for all things Italian expanded in the 1970s and 80s, Lavazza set out to satisfy it. Vacuum-packed Lavazza coffee was soon available in France, Germany, the UK and the US, and Italian-inspired cafés flourished. Much of this development had to do with the greater availability of the technology needed to make an espresso, which was another trend that Lavazza exploited.Today, Luigi Lavazza SpA is a sizeable company: it had turnover of €1.1bn ($1.5bn, £990m) last year and claims to have a 48 per cent share of the Italian coffee market. It has a presence in 90 countries, and recently moved into India and Brazil. As a buyer, Lavazza always favoured Brazil, travelled there often and spoke Portuguese.The company now has 4,000 employees worldwide and claims 14m cups of Lavazza coffee are served daily. This year it broke more than a century as a provider solely of coffee when it bought an Italian maker of chocolate drinks.Luigi Lavazza SpA remains a relentless marketer: for the past 18 years it has produced the Lavazza Calendar, a glossy, high-concept fashion and advertising campaign in collaboration with such celebrity photographers as David LaChapelle and Annie Leibovitz.That sounds like a long way from Turin. In fact, Lavazza, like most Italians, had a deeply sentimental attachment to his hometown. Signor Emilio, as his staff used to call him, became something of a grand old man of Italian business, including becoming a member of the emeritus board of the Bank of Italy between 1996 and 2002. He was also a prominent figure in the European food industry, chairing several cross-border associations.In 1991 he became a Cavaliere del Lavoro della Repubblica, an honour secretly coveted by every Italian businessman and granted to relatively few. He remained president of Luigi Lavazza SpA until 2008 when he handed it on to his own children and grandchildren, five of whom work for the company. He wanted the company, he said, to follow the principles he had inherited from his own father and grandfather, where everybody got on together in perfect harmony.He is survived by his wife, Maria Teresa, and his children Giuseppe and Francesca.

It plans to open at least 70 more in 2011.Mr McMeikan said that while organic expansion was the priority, it had also considered acquisitions when regional bakers, such as Mathieson’s in Scotland and Ainsley’s in Leeds, had gone into administration and would still consider the right deal.A restructuring programme that centralised the business and reduced costs, as well as rising demand for budget baked goods during the recession, improved net cash from £2.1m to £34.6m.Diluted earnings per share rose 11 per cent to 34p and the total dividend rises 11 per cent to 16.6p via an 11.4p final. The pay-out has risen every year since Greggs listed 25 years ago. Darren Shirley, analyst at Shore Capital, said: “I don’t think that there’s anyone else with that kind of consistency.”The retailer, which has a market capitalisation of £454.4m, also announced a share buy-back programme in which it will purchase £15m of shares over the next year.The shares rose 18.3p to 455.3p.——————————● FT CommentGreggs may not be the most glamorous retailer but that does not stop it from splashing its cash. Fortunately it is spending wisely on expansion and giving back to shareholders with a hearty dividend and a share buy-back. The baker trades on a forward p/e of about 13 times based on forecast earnings per share of about 35p – the same level as the food retailer sector average. Although its plans for expansion are ambitious, it seems to be undertaking them at an achievable pace and maintaining net cash. As long as it doesn’t depart too dramatically from its well-established model, the shares look good value.
700;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-03-17T17:18:01Z;I have arrived in China, a surprisingly familiar place;;We have just arrived in Beijing for the first leg of a two week trip to China.Our trip will take us to visit Xi’an, Chengdu and Shanghai as part of the Global Initiatives in Management class.Leading up to my flight to China I had two hectic weeks finishing group projects and a St Patrick’s weekend of finance finals.Beijing has been a surprise to me so far, with wide roads packed with brand new high-end cars. Apart from the relatively small historic area, the architecture and atmosphere strangely reminds me more of a modern version of an eastern European city, rather than a chaotic and dynamic emerging city such as Mumbai. The clearly very wealthy inhabitants downtown drink at Starbucks on their way to work in the morning and shop at Ikea over the weekends, it all feels too familiar.After sleeping off our jet lag last night, we took the short ride from our hotel past the Lamborghini, Ferrari and Aston Martin garages to Tieneman Square and the Forbidden City this morning. I was expecting to see droves of tourists marching around in large groups with cameras and I wasn’t disappointed.What was less expected though, was that the vast majority of these were Chinese tourists from all over the country. According to our guide the rapid economic development has given the opportunity for many rural Chinese to now make the long trip into Beijing to see some of their best known national treasures.We are now headed to the Great Wall of China to round off a leisurely tourist start to the trip. We will stay in Beijing until Friday, visiting local companies and exploring the city some more.I suspect over the next couple of weeks my impression of China will change significantly as we adventure away from the immaculate entry point of the Middle Kingdom to some of the less explored areas.
701;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;KKR in $200m Indian coffee shops deal;;New York-based private equity firm KKR is leading a consortium to invest about $200m in Coffee Day Holdings, the Bangalore-based operator of India’s largest coffee house chain, Café Coffee Day.The deal, one of the largest private equity transactions in India in the past year and a half, will give KKR and its partners, Standard Chartered Private Equity and New York-based New Silk Route, exposure to India’s fast-growing coffee house culture.The cash infusion will help the Indian company, which now has 800 Café Coffee Day outlets, expand ahead of potential competition from Starbucks, the US-based coffee group, which has eyed India for more than five years, but has yet to enter the market.“They stand pretty strongly, even if Starbucks were to come in,” said Raghav Gupta, president of Technopak, a retail consultancy. “But if they can get up to 1,500 cafes, it increases their consumer connect.”A person familiar with the deal said KKR would invest about $100m, while a Standard Chartered spokesman confirmed it would invest $50m, with New Silk Route picking up the balance.Café Coffee Day was founded in 1999 in Bangalore – the hub of India’s youth culture. Its brightly lit outlets with their plush oversize chairs are found in cities and small towns across India, where they are widely seen as safe places for socialising in a still traditional, and closely regulated, society.With its slogan “a lot can happen over coffee”, the shops make up a key element of India’s fledgling dating scene among teenagers and young adults, but are also patronised by older customers.“What they have done magnificently is create a non-threatening environment,” said Suhel Seth, a brand adviser with Counselage. “Café Coffee Day has been positioned as a broad spectrum hang-out joint. There is no pressure for you to consume and leave.”Café Coffee Day also has about 700 coffee kiosks in airports, train stations and hospitals, as well as thousands of coffee vending machines in offices.In south India – which has a local tradition of coffee consumption, Coffee Day Holdings operates a chain of about 400 Fresh ’n Ground retail stores, which sell filter coffee blends and accessories.Indians are famed for drinking endless cups of strong, sweet, milky tea.But coffee consumption is growing strongly, driven by Café Coffee Day and its primary local rival Barista, which was founded in 2000, and acquired by Italy’s Lavazza in 2007. It now has about 230 outlets.According to India’s Coffee Board, domestic coffee consumption rose from 50,000 metric tons in 1998 to 94,400 metric tons in 2008.UK-based Costa Coffee, and the US-based Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf have also recently established themselves in India through local partners.In the year to date, private equity firms have undertaken about $319m of deals in India – not including the Coffee Day deal, according to Dealogic, the data company. This is already more than half the full-year total in 2009 of $714m of transactions.

Bad weather in the northeastern and southern US damped construction.Housing permits also fell 1.6 per cent but are running ahead of starts, usually a sign that new building is set to rise in the future.After the closing bell, the S&P 500 was up 0.8 per cent at 1,159.46 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent to 10,685.98.The Nasdaq was 0.7 per cent higher at 2,378.01 – its highest level since August 2008.General Electric, the infrastructure, finance, and media company, led the Dow higher, gaining 4.5 per cent to $18.07 – its highest price in two years – on positive broker comment and news that it would resume paying a dividend to shareholders in 2011.The company has “earnings momentum slowly building” and “for the first time in more than 10 years, the pieces are in place for earnings upside”, said JPMorgan in a note to clients.Limited Brands was 4.2 per cent higher at $24.71 as the company, which owns the Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works retail chains, said it would issue a special $1-a-share dividend and start a $200m share repurchase programme. The stock is at its highest level since July 2007.Starbucks was up 3.6 per cent to $25.29 as the global coffee shop chain was raised by UBS to “buy” from “neutral”, citing strong earnings growth expected for the next two years at least.The broker raised its earnings per share forecast to $1.34 from $1.27 to reflect “the growth potential from international cost savings opportunities, the global roll-out of Via [instant coffee] and licensing of Seattle’s Best Coffee”.The Japanese steakhouse chain Benihana surged 8.8 per cent to $6.40 on reports that the company is the target of a bid by Russell Glass, a former Icahn Associates executive. It is reported that he has offered $7 a share.Ford rose 0.7 per cent to $13.49 on comments by Alan Mulally, the company’s chief executive, that he expected the carmaker to pick up market share in the US as Toyota grapples with a global product recall of several of its models.Also, UBS raised the stock’s target price to $15 from $13 and retained its “buy” rating.Harley-Davidson firmed 7 per cent to $28.35 on renewed speculation that the motorcycle maker may be acquired in a leveraged buy-out. The company has not commented on the proposed takeover.Genpact, an outsourcing company spun off by General Electric, lost 6.7 per cent off its shares to $14.91 as it forecast lower current-quarter sales than analysts were looking for.Cliffs Natural Resources, a leading iron-ore producer in North America, rallied 4.9 per cent to $66.27 as the stock’s target price was raised from $65 to $85 by Deutsche Bank.Intel Corp was one of the best performers in the Dow, gaining 4 per cent to $22.01 as the chipmaker said it had already shipped more than 100,000 units of Xeon 5600, a server chip that went on sale on Tuesday.Oriental Financial Group rose 5.8 per cent to $12.25 as it announced it had placed a 7.6m share offering at $11.40 a share. The Puerto Rico-based lender expects net proceeds of about $87m from the offering. The offer is at a 2 per cent discount to the stock’s Monday closing price.
703;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-03-04T00:17:16Z;Starbucks to sell instant coffee across UK;;Starbucks will roll out Via, its instant coffee mix, across the UK starting next week and launch the product in Japan next month, signalling the company’s belief that soluble coffee will be a platform for international growth.Starting on Monday, Via will be available in the UK’s 700 plus stores.The decision to introduce the product in Britain comes after a test marketing programme in 32 Starbucks stores in London’s West End last year delivered positive results.“This almost took us by surprise, the extent to which Via exceeded its targets last year,” Brian Waring, the company’s marketing director in the UK, said.Mr Waring said that initial sales showed customers buying triple packs instead of 12-packs, presumably for the purposes of trial.By the end of the year, sales of 12-packs accounted for 80 per cent of unit purchases.“That demonstrated to us that the consumer response and satisfaction was driving demand and repeat purchase,” he said.The Seattle-based coffee group tested Via in select North American markets last year before rolling it out across the US in October.Via sales accounted for about half of the group’s 4 per cent jump in same-store sales for the most recent quarter, or about $35m.In the US, Via is sold at more than 25,000 sites including Costco and Target as well as Starbucks stores.In Japan, Starbucks is skipping the test marketing programme and going straight to launch on April 14 across the country’s 875 stores.Japan is considered a strong market for instant coffee since it accounts for approximately $2.9bn of the category’s $21bn in annual sales.“This is a category that hasn’t had a significant innovation in half a century,” Howard Schultz, Starbucks chief executive, said in an interview.When the product was first tested in the US last year, critics declared that Starbucks’ introduction of instant coffee was a sign of desperation from a company that had stumbled by opening too many stores.Mr Schultz, who returned from retirement two years ago to right the company, said he was satisfied that Starbucks had solved the challenge of how to create an instant coffee that tasted good.“I knew intuitively that Via would be a winner,” he said.Taking a page out of the US playbook, Mr Waring said Starbucks would use a taste test to promote trial of Via across the UK between March 12 and 15.A similar challenge in the US last year is credited with boosting sales of Via in the quarter ended December 31 2009.Traditionally, Starbucks has not spent much on advertising, but Mr Waring said the company planned to promote the UK launch of Via with advertisements in newspapers, on radio and in digital media.
704;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-02-26T19:56:02Z;US economy;No wonder it doesn’t feel like the good old days have returned;Having lost the equivalent of about three years of real growth, the US economy is making up for lost time. Revised data released on Friday put annualised fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth at 5.9 per cent, the fastest expansion in more than half a decade. This looks impressive but the economy has still only returned to the size it first reached back around May 2007. No wonder it doesn’t feel like the good old days have returned.This difference between rates of change and absolute levels of activity may help explain the mixed bag of economic data of late. In the past week, for example, the Chicago purchasing managers’ index was stronger than expected, as was Friday’s GDP figure. But existing home sales for January fell 7.2 per cent month on month – the second-worst reading ever. Durable goods orders for the same period, ex-aircraft and defence, grew at only half the rate forecast and the consumer confidence index was a shocker. Jobless claims are also surprising many by ticking up again.Not only are there mixed signals within the economic data but the big picture often disconnects with stories from the ground too. For example, the expectations component of the consumer confidence survey plunged to a level consistent with real spending declines of 0.5 per cent year on year, according to High Frequency Economics. Yet retailers from Saks and Starbucks to Safeway and Home Depot report seeing signs of a rebound in discretionary spending. All are upbeat about growth.Perhaps it is unrealistic to expect statistical consistency when the future is so uncertain. Loose monetary policy is good but it has to end sometime. Stimulus spending helps but who is going to pay for it? If the data are confused, it is only because everyone else is too.Post a comment below or e-mail the Lex team confidentially
705;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-02-26T00:19:38Z;Gap to open store in Milan;;Gap, the American casual clothing retailer, plans to open a store in Milan, the home of Italian high fashion, later this year, in a further sign of its growing confidence after a multi-year slump.The company said it would open two Gap and Banana Republic stores next door to each other on Milan’s Corso Vittorio Emanuele, with additional openings in other Italian cities, including Rome, to follow in 2011.The move marks a return to market expansion in western Europe, where it has stores in the UK and France, after it closed lossmaking stores in Germany in 2004. Gap is also planning to open its first store in China next year.Under Glenn Murphy, who became chief executive in 2007, the retailer has focused on developing its international business, primarily through franchise agreements with more than 130 new stores in the Middle East, south-east Asia and Russia.Gap gave more details on Thursday of plans to start an e-commerce business in Europe from a distribution base in the UK, to serve the UK and nine other western European countries. It is also launching an e-commerce business in Canada.At the same time, it will further trim the size of its store footprint in the US, expecting a 3 per cent cut in square footage. Over the past two years it has been shifting to smaller sites and reducing its inventory to increase store productivity.Gap said on Thursday its fourth-quarter net earnings ending January 30 2010, had grown 45 per cent to $352m, or $0.51 per diluted share, against the same period last year, while net sales increased 3.9 per cent to $4.24bn. The results were in line with Wall Street’s consensus forecast.Its comparable store sales increased 2 per cent, as a 7 per cent increase at its low-cost Old Navy stores offset falls at its North America Gap and Banana Republic stores of 1 and 2 per cent, respectively. Its international comparable store sales fell 2 per cent.It plans to increase capital expenditure in 2010 by more than 70 per cent to $575m, including on store remodelling, and to expand inventory levels during the first quarter in an expectation of stronger demand.• Safeway, the US supermarket group, said on Thursday its customers were beginning to “trade up”. Steve Burd, chief executive, highlighted rising sales of fresh flowers and more expensive wines and better trade at its licensed Starbucks coffee counters.“There seems to be a gradual improvement here in consumer confidence,” he said.
706;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Wall Street holds on to risk rally gains;Discount rate rise means markets may change direction;23:00 GMT. The rally in riskier assets continued on Thursday as traders embraced US markets at the expense of the eurozone, where fears extended beyond the periphery that has dominated the news of late.Fiscal woes in Europe are not the exclusive prerogative of Greece. UK gilt yields spiked to a 15-month high as Britain’s public finances deteriorated sharply, joining highly disappointing UK employment figures released on Wednesday as bearish indicators.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 bounced back from a volatile morning to rise 0.7 per cent, crossing the $1,100 threshold it had flirted with in recent sessions. Though a raft of US economic news was mostly negative, broadly strong corporate earnings seemed to buoy the market.The dollar had initially been the main beneficiary of renewed selling in the single currency, with traders contrasting a fairly hawkish stance from the US Federal Reserve overnight with the eurozone’s relatively poor growth prospects and debilitating fiscal difficulties.But the greenback’s rally fizzled out later on, with the dollar ending the US stock trading day virtually flat against an index of six currencies, as traders signalled their willingness to embrace risk: selling dollars and Treasuries and buying stocks and commodities.“When the dollar is trading higher against the euro but lower against riskier currencies, and the S&P is higher, the market is trading up for more risk,” said Jessica Hoversen of MF Global. ”That trade has predominantly characterised 2008 and 2009. It’s a measure of how favourable fundamental news is.”News at the end of the trading day, however, that the US Fed would raise the discount rate sent the dollar and Treasury bond yields higher in after-hours trades. S&P 500 futures indicated markets would open lower on Friday.● European bourses did well, as the FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 0.6 per cent, with a sharp fall in Daimler proving a drag, while the FTSE 100 in London added 0.9 per cent, once again helped by mining stocks.The S&P started the day poorly, reacting to negative economic data. As the day went on, however, markets seemed to discount a lot of that as noise against a broader story of recovery.Though bellwether retail giant Walmart reported a sales drop, good performance from other retailers, such as Whole Foods and Starbucks, suggested consumers were still in good shape. David Rosenberg, economist at Gluskin Sheff, in his daily report reminded traders that 73 per cent of reported earnings this quarter had beaten forecasts.Other analysts were also dismissive of the negative tone of the data. “While there is a risk that February economic data could be temporarily and artificially depressed by recent severe winter storms across much of the mid-Atlantic, northeast and southeast, the latest industrial production figures are currently consistent with our estimate of 4.5 per cent real GDP growth in the first quarter,” said Joe LaVorgna, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank.Peter Newland, economist at Barclays Capital, said that a jump in the producer price index, a harbinger of inflation, was also not a clean signal: “The upside surprise in the core, relative to our forecast, is almost entirely explained by a 1.9 per cent jump in light motor truck prices”.He added: “It is not clear if this jump reflects continued distortion or a ‘real’ price increase, but there may be a case for some negative payback in February”.Asian bourses succumbed to profit-taking following Wednesday’s decent advance. The FTSE Asia-Pacific index lost 0.4 per cent, with the Hang Seng in Hong Kong falling 0.4 per cent and Sydney down 0.3 per cent. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo rose 0.3 per cent. Shanghai remains closed for the lunar new year holiday.● The dollar was initially buoyed by an overnight batch of generally supportive economic data and the interpretation by some that the Fed is closer to removing more of its monetary stimuli. The dollar index, which tracks the currency against six of its peers, looked set to challenge a fresh eight-month peak of 80.75, but it lost steam.The dollar was nearly unchanged against the euro preceding the Fed’s announcement. But by the close of the currency trading day, an hour after the news, the dollar was up 0.6 per cent against single currency, at $1.3520. In the opening minutes of the new session, the euro was again approaching its nine-month low point of $1.3540.● Greek bonds continued to struggle. The yield on the 10-year note rose 15 basis points to 6.52 per cent, taking the spread with German Bunds to 329 basis points. Portuguese benchmark yields rose 2 basis points to 4.39 per cent.Spanish yields were up 2 basis points at 4.02 per cent, with the country’s debt benefiting from the good demand seen for a sale of 15-year notes on Wednesday. “The Spanish 15-year syndication was strongly subscribed, with demand of €12bn for the €5bn issue. The strength in demand for a peripheral syndication could be a positive for a potential Greek syndication, potentially a 10-year, in the not-too-distant future,” said Guy Mandy at Nomura.A much worse than expected set of public finance figures in the UK saw investors dump gilts as fears grew the government would have to boost supply to plug the fiscal deficit. The 10-year yield moved to 4.09 per cent at one stage, up 7 basis points, according to Bloomberg data. This was the highest yield since November 2008 and took the spread with Bunds to 85 basis points, a four-year peak. The pound also struggled on the news.US Treasuries fluctuated as traders were pulled one way by the strong factory gate inflation data and the other way by the rise in initial jobless claims. The 10-year yield was later up 7 basis point to 3.79 per cent, adding to a rally on Wednesday.The discount rate news impacted trading in the final hour. Yields on 2-year Treasury notes spiked to their highest point since January, 0.94 per cent, threatening to further expand an already record-level yield curve.● Gold fell below $1,100 early in the session, before traders absorbed news an IMF sale of bullion was not well received. The precious metal was later up 1.6 per cent to $1,123.Oil continued its recent rally. It rose 2.5 per cent to $79.27.
707;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-02-18T20:02:46Z;Walmart suffers first US sales decline;;Walmart has suffered its first fall in quarterly sales at its US discount stores, underlining the challenges facing future growth in its home market as the economy recovers.In the important holiday quarter ending on January 31, net sales at Walmart’s 3,400-plus US stores fell 0.5 per cent year-on-year to $71bn (€52bn). Comparable store sales declined 2 per cent. Customer traffic also fell.The retailer blamed price deflation in food and electronics for lowering the overall value of its sales, as well as the impact of store refurbishment.The decline contrasted with the strong sales and traffic growth during its first three quarters, as low prices attracted new budget-minded shoppers.Tom Schoewe, chief financial officer, argued that the declines did not mean Walmart was losing some of the customers it had gained during the recession, saying the “modest decline” in traffic was “not in our mind an indication of trend”.He highlighted the cautious mood of Walmart’s largely low-income shoppers, saying there was still a high level of anxiety over unemployment.In contrast, retailers such as Whole Foods Market, the upmarket grocer, and Starbucks reported evidence of increased readiness to spend during the fourth quarter, suggesting that different consumer segments are responding differently in the early stages of recovery.Mike Duke, Walmart chief executive, pointed to stronger-than-expected earnings growth in the quarter but warned that the retailer expected US sales to be “more challenging” in the first quarter, with improvement as the year progressed.In the past, Walmart’s US sales have been supported by aggressive new store openings, which it had begun to rein in before the economy worsened to counter fears of saturation.Last month it announced a restructuring of its US operations aimed in part at improving its ability to take a more flexible approach to expansion.International sales for the quarter were $29.6bn, up 19.5 per cent, with $1.9bn in gains from the weaker US dollar.Walmart said sales growth was supported by strong performances at the UK’s Asda and in Mexico, new stores in Brazil and China, and the acquisition of Chile’s D&S supermarkets.The retailer reported adjusted earnings of $4.5bn, or $1.17 per diluted share, beating expectations. Total sales rose 4.6 per cent to $112.8bn.
708;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-02-12T18:52:36Z;Morgan is back on familiar ground;;After almost a decade in self imposed exile, Steve Morgan decided last March that it was time to put a halt to his “mid-life crisis” and return to the helm of the business he had established 35-years earlier.“I wasn’t at all happy with the way the company was being run and as my family still had a lot invested in it, I felt I needed to go back to protect that money,” Mr Morgan says of his decision to return to Redrow, the housebuilding group he founded with a £5,000 ($7,831) loan from his father.Now, as he prepares to launch Redrow’s first new range since his comeback, Mr Morgan believes that the worst is over.“Owning a home is part of the British psyche, it’s not seen as just an investment, but more like a basic right,” Mr Morgan explains.Housebuilders have suffered a tough downturn, with low consumer confidence and a restricted lending market causing sales of new homes to fall sharply. Housebuilders sold just 111,700 homes in 2009, compared with 178,500 at the market’s peak in 2007, according to the National House-Building Council.However, Mr Morgan believes that as long as land is available and banks gradually ease deposit requirements on mortgage applicants, the recovery will continue.His shock return to Redrow was the culmination of a stealthy stake-building exercise using his Bridgemere and Durcan investment vehicles, which last March revealed that they had accumulated 23.5 per cent of the company’s shares.The announcement triggered a dramatic boardroom coup, in which the chairman and chief executive were forced out.“The business was going in totally the wrong direction and building the wrong kind of homes.” Mr Morgan said he didn’t want to name individuals, but he could “kill them for what they did to the business”.Investors reacted positively to the news of Mr Morgan’s comeback, sending the shares up 88 per cent in the six-months following his return.As well as growing “depressed and frustrated” over the future of the company he built up from a small construction outfit into one of the UK’s largest housebuilders, Mr Morgan confesses to having missed the buzz of business.When he left in 2000, Mr Morgan had become disillusioned with the housebuilding industry, which he saw as being increasingly limited by cumbersome planning laws and an obsession with red tape.Uncomfortable with too much time on his hands, he plunged into a wide range of new ventures including hotels, property developments in Turkey and most notably, his acquisition of Wolverhampton Wanderers, now in the Premier League football club.The demands of holding the position of chairman at the two very different businesses are, Mr Morgan explains, manageable if you have the right people in place to do the day-to-day management and split your time properly.However, launching Redrow’s range of New Heritage homes – luxury family style houses, which he describes as a vindication of his decision to return to the company – Mr Morgan sported a yellow and grey tie adorned with the Wolves’ insignia, explaining: “I was going to wear a red tie today, but we won last night against good opposition and I’m proud of that”.
709;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;US shoppers splash out on luxury items;;More prosperous American shoppers seem to be defying continuing high unemployment levels and economic uncertainty to renew their spending on luxuries such as jewellery, fashion and cosmetics.That is the picture emerging from the current round of US earnings and sales reports.Tracey Travis, chief financial officer of Polo Ralph Lauren, said last week that the fashion brand and retail company had “slowly begun to see the gradual return of our core luxury customer”, including buyers of couture dresses that sell for more than $4,000.Fabrizio Freda, chief executive of Estée Lauder, has said that sales of its beauty products at “prestige” stores – such as traditional department stores – had grown faster than at “mass” drugstores and discounters during November and December, reversing the trend seen earlier in the year.“We view this as a return of the aspirational consumer,” he said.Sales of cognac in the US had jumped 19 per cent by volume during the fourth quarter compared with the same period last year, according to BNIC, France’s trade association of cognac makers.Last week’s January sales figures from leading US chain stores reinforced the picture of growing readiness to spend, with Neiman Marcus, Saks, ­Nordstrom and Bloomingdale’s – the top upmarket US department stores – reporting strong sales growth, albeit from the depressed levels of a year ago.Neiman Marcus, which operates about 43 luxury fashion stores serving the most affluent US consumers, said that its strongest categories included women’s couture clothing and precious jewellery.Abercrombie & Fitch, the youth retailer known for its $60 polo shirts, reported that comparable sales had risen 8 per cent, its first monthly increase for 20 months, in spite of teenage unemployment running at about 26 per cent.The evidence of greater readiness to spend comes in spite of continuing high unemployment, with about 20 per cent of the US population unemployed or working casually or part time.Richard Hastings, retail strategist at Global Hunter Securities, said that roughly half of the 80 per cent of Americans fully employed were not affected by the depressed housing market and were now more ready to spend as they had become less concerned about their own jobs.The strength in the January sales numbers “suggests that sufficient spending is coming from the least affected parts of the consumer universe”, he said.
710;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2010-01-21T01:16:29Z;Starbucks earnings jump as sales increase;;Starbucks posted strong earnings of $242m on Wednesday, a jump from the $64m it recorded during the comparable period last year, demonstrating that consumers will still pay premium prices for its coffee even in uncertain economic times.Total revenues for the quarter were $2.7bn, up 4 per cent from the $2.6bn recorded during the same quarter at the end of 2008. The company attributed the revenue growth to a 4 per cent increase in same-store sales, combined with the weakening of the US dollar, particularly compared with the Canadian dollar.In the US, revenue growth was 1 per cent, to $1.93bn, but based on the strong performance in same-store sales and reduced expenses, operating margin tripled in the period. International revenues increased 19 per cent, to $591m, in part the result of an acquisition in France.Howard Schultz, chief executive, said the company’s US sales were boosted by the roll-out of Via, its instant coffee mix, as well as strong holiday sales, not just in coffee, but in merchandise. Traffic in US stores was flat, but the amount of money spent per visit increased, accounting for the revenue gains. The coffee giant also benefited from cost cuts.The company’s strong performance was helped by favourable comparison to the final quarter of 2008, when coffee sales slumped amid deep uncertainty about the future of the US economy. Starbucks also had certain one-time expenses from that quarter which fed into strong comparable performance.Mr Schultz credited strong operating margins to a “leaner, better and more efficient operating structure”, adding that the US business “is well positioned to continue delivering solid operating margins”.Mr Schultz also said the UK market, which had lagged in recent years, is showing signs of “the beginnings of a turnaround”. Mr Schultz pointed to the introduction of relevant local products such as “flat white” and the success of a non-branded “neighbourhood” outlet on Conduit Street in London as evidence of a resurgence.Mr Schultz and Troy Alstead, his chief financial officer, said they intended to use some of the lessons learned in the US turnround to help grow its international operations.
711;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Calorie-count law a success, says study;;A study of sales at 222 Starbucks coffee shops in New York City has concluded that a law requiring clearer posting of the calorie content of food items has successfully, although not substantially, reduced customers’ overall calorie consumption.The study, by researchers at Stanford University’s business school, is the most comprehensive yet on the impact of posting calorie counts on menu boards, required by law in New York city since April 2008.It concludes that the average calories per transaction at Starbucks fell by 6 per cent, from 247 to 232 calories, which it conceded would in itself not be sufficient to have a substantial direct impact on growing obesity levels.New York City was the first jurisdiction to adopt calorie posting measures that have been followed by similar laws in California, Maine and Massachusetts, and by proposed federal legislation.The Stanford study tracked all sales receipts at the city’s Starbucks stores from January 2008, before the legislation was in force, until the end of February 2009. It also compared the New York data with sales at stores in Philadelphia and Boston, which did not have calorie counts on menu boards.The study found that most of the reduction in average calories per transaction was related to food purchases, which fell by 14 per cent. It concluded that three-quarters of the reduction was due to customers buying fewer items, and one-quarter to them opting for lower-calorie items.The researchers also analysed data from 2.7m anonymous Starbucks cardholders across the US, which provided further information on the varied responses of customers.The card data showed that customers who averaged more than 250 calories per transaction prior to the calorie posting requirements reduced their average by 26 per cent – suggesting that the effect of calorie posting may be higher on consumers who are eating more than the average.However, the researchers say that a 6 per cent reduction in calories, even if mirrored at other restaurants, will “not by themselves have a major impact on obesity”, given that typical weight loss programmes propose reductions of 500 to 1,000 calories per day.But it concludes by arguing that the costs of menu posting are comparatively low, so that even small benefits could outweigh the costs.“There may be public education benefits from the policy: consumers’ exposure to calorie information may make them generally more aware and attentive to the nutritional value of the foods they eat,” it says.The restaurant industry initially opposed calorie posting legislation, but last June agreed to support the effort to pass federal law to create a national standard.A Starbucks spokesman said that the study had “showed us first-hand that menu labeling can work to help consumers make choices”, while adding that Starbucks believed any standards established at a national or global level should be uniform.

Before Apple introduced the iPod in 2001, tens of millions of consumers listened to MP3 digital music tracks on home PCs or no-name, no-elegance portable players. Then Steve Jobs insisted on being no more than three clicks away from whatever song he wanted. The winning industrial design and a marketing campaign of silhouettes and hard rock put those white ear buds everywhere. After the iTunes Music Store came along and latched on to Windows PCs, it gave the music industry a pulse again and reinstated Apple as a major force.WiFi
For years, technologists talked about wireless ubiquity and squabbled about standards. Then it started coming together and a recent-issue computer could work at Starbucks or the airport. Why not have a latte with that term paper?GPS
The Global Positioning System worked its way down, quite literally, from satellite and military navigation to aircraft collision avoidance to cars and smartphones. And a whole genre of excuses for being late evaporated.DVR
Time was, when a show aired on television, many people watched it live rather than wrestle with programming a VCR. TiVo changed all that, and helped people find and record shows they didn’t even know they wanted to see. Cable companies followed suit, bringing DVRs to a broader audience.Flat screen monitors
When components for flat PC screens became more affordable, tales of health risks from old-style displays were mysteriously taken more seriously. Companies started changing over and homes followed. After a brief interregnum, the extra desk space filled up with papers and sweet wrappers.Wii
After years in which gaming consoles from Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo got more powerful and functional, Nintendo set out to do more with less. From 2006, the Wii undercut rivals on price and let movement of the whole controller drive the game, attracting new players.iPhone
Aside from executives with BlackBerries, most people didn’t expect much from mobile phones before 2007. Apple not only convinced carriers to give up control over what programs could run on devices using their airwaves, it contributed an intuitive “multitouch” interface. Less than three years later, there are 100,000 applications for the iPhone and WiFi-enabled iPod touch. Tens of millions of iPhone owners spend more time on those apps than they do making calls."
713;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-12-24T01:02:01Z;Facebook chief operating officer joins Disney;;Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, is to join Walt Disney as an independent director, bolstering the media company’s board at a time when it is exploring a range of new digital business models.Assuming her nomination is approved, she will join Steve Jobs as a non-executive director of the company, which has led its rivals in Hollywood in making content available on new digital platforms.As chief operating officer of Facebook, a position she has held since March 2008, Ms Sandberg is responsible for building the social network’s global operations and managing its sales, marketing, business development, privacy and communications functions.Facebook has 350m members and is firmly established as the world’s largest online social network since overtaking News Corporation’s MySpace last year.“Sheryl has been at the forefront of a technological revolution that’s opened up a world of new possibilities for consumers and which has greatly affected the way we do business,” said Bob Iger, Disney’s chief executive. “Her unique insight, borne of great practical experience, will be of considerable value to Disney’s shareholders.”Mr Iger has made no secret of his desire to produce content that can be distributed wherever consumers want to view it.He counts Mr Jobs, the chief executive of Apple, among his most trusted advisers and is keen to explore social networking opportunities for the company, which is where Ms Sandberg’s expertise will come in useful.The company is currently working on Key Chest, a digital rights management project that will eventually allow consumers to watch Disney content on an array of devices wherever they are.Disney also operates its own social network for children – Club Penguin – which it acquired two years ago.Before joining Facebook, Ms Sandberg, who is also on the Starbucks board, was vice-president of global online sales and operations at Google.She said it was a “tremendous honour” to be nominated to the Disney board, adding that the company had “remained an entertainment icon around the world for over 80 years by enthusiastically embracing change and new technologies”.John Pepper, Disney’s chairman, said that Ms Sandberg had “great expertise in the online world, considerable international experience and a deep understanding of consumer behaviour”.Ms Sandberg is a former chief of staff of the United States Treasury Department.Her previous posts also include serving as a management consultant with McKinsey and working as an economist with the World Bank.
714;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-12-21T23:36:32Z;Business diary: Simon Nixon;;Simon Nixon is a serial internet entrepreneur, who made a name for himself with Moneysupermarket.com, the price comparison website, which floated in 2007. He remained as chief executive until late last year, when he stepped down to focus on the travel guides website Simonseeks.comOne day a week, usually on Monday, I work at Moneysupermarket.com, which I founded and where I was chief executive until recently. I work with it principally on product development, which is what entrepreneurs are most interested in – the sexy, interesting stuff. As CEO, I only got to work on products a tiny amount of the time, which was one of the reasons I stepped down. I was doing a whole load of things I was not so good at, such as investor relations and three-day strategy away-days. Also, I wanted to go off and start another business. An entrepreneur has a need to keep starting new things, partly because we are insecure. We are always asking ourselves, “Could we do it again or was it a one-off?”I think it is probably hard for some entrepreneurs to let go of the businesses they created. If I did not have something else to pursue I would probably be breathing down the neck of the new CEO at Moneysupermarket all the time. Luckily, I now have a new company to build.My new company, Simonseeks.com is based in the north of England, in the centre of Chester. I have always wanted to be able to walk to work. Being in the centre means there is life around us, and if we want to have a brainstorming session, for example, we can pop up to Starbucks. I want the job to be fun.Much of my time now is taken up doing public relations for Simonseeks. With a start-up you have to punch above your weight and get people interested. You have to make the business seem bigger than it is.The biggest challenge on a day-to-day basis is keeping staff motivated. In a start-up you often have to work 12 hours a day. The first people we took on are very good and we gave them the additional incentive of a stake in the business. But many staff expect Simonseeks to be profitable within 12 months because of the success of Moneysupermarket, even though that took more than a year to start making a profit. It is difficult because we are still losing money. I do not think we will break even for another two-and-a-half years, but people want the dividend now, and that is what I have to manage.I spend a half day every week at Simonescapes.com, my luxury holiday property rental business. I am really enjoying that – not because it is the most profitable use of my money but because the properties are good long-term investments and I find the sector interesting. I do not have to work there too often because I recruited a good manager to run it. But I am interested in interiors, and every few weeks I fly by helicopter to look at different interiors for my own properties. I often do this with Jill Stein, ex-wife of the celebrity chef Rick Stein, who is the designer for our new Cornwall property.Getting involved in property means I now check house prices all the time. Our property in Abersoch in Wales has probably lost value since we bought it, even though we have spent a fair amount renovating it.I am the sort of person who will feel guilty if I am not working. In fact, I often wake in the middle of the night worrying about an issue with one of my companies. But at least with Simonseeks and Simonescapes I have managed to turn my hobbies into my job.I see staying healthy as an investment in my own future. I play squash, tennis and badminton once a week each and do yoga three times a week. My dad is 67 and he still plays squash once a week. I am 42 and I want to keep playing into my 70s.
715;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-12-18T20:08:48Z;Growth in Fairtrade towns defies downturn;;"The number of UK towns declaring themselves “Fairtrade” has soared to almost 500 as an expanding movement convinces people to spend on ethically branded goods despite the recession.Bruce Crowther, a part-time veterinary surgeon who helped the Lancashire town of Garstang become the world’s first Fairtrade Town in 2001, said: “We are creating an incredible grass-roots network.”Towns in the scheme commit to five goals, including getting the local council to pass a resolution supporting Fairtrade and persuading schools, shops and churches to use and sell Fairtrade products.By 2004, 77 towns had followed Garstang’s lead. At the end of last year, there were just over 400 nationally, including London, Cardiff and Inverness.Now the concept has moved abroad, with more than 300 overseas towns and cities signing up including Rome, Copenhagen, Dublin and communities across the US.Sophi Tranchell, chair of the committee that made London a Fairtrade City a year ago, says Fairtrade has evolved into a “successful social movement” because it offers an easier route for people to achieve change than traditional politics.“It’s very exciting to see something that began in a little town in England moving across Europe and America,” she said.The marque was created by the Fairtrade Foundation in the 1990s to encourage consumers to pay a fair price for products made in poor countries. Green & Black’s Maya Gold chocolate, Cafédirect medium roast coffee and Clipper tea were the first goods sold in the UK to carry the seal. It can now be found on about 4,500 products, including Cadbury’s chocolate and Starbucks coffee. Nestlé also announced this month that the 1bn Kit Kats sold every year in the UK will be made from Fairtrade chocolate.Fairtrade sales have held up in the recession even as those of other specialist products, such as organic food, have fallen. The amount spent by shoppers on Fairtrade products rose from an average of £1.39 to £1.42 per shopping trip in the 12 months to September, according to market research group TNS.Tammy Stewart-Jones, chair of the Thanet Fairtrade Initiative, said some of the Kentish island’s wealthier residents were sceptical when it became a Fairtrade Island last year.But the organisers converted people by handing out free samples of Fairtrade products and explaining that, while the recession made life tough for people in the UK, at least they had schools and a
welfare system.Jenny Foster, co-ordinator of the Bristol Fairtrade Network, said that while some shops selling Fairtrade products – including Woolworths – have closed in the recession, cafés have continued to serve Fairtrade food. “Once people have got Fairtrade, they stick with it,” she said.Bristol, which became a Fairtrade City in 2005, held a Fairtrade fashion show earlier this year.Farmers appear to be supportive rather than seeing foreign producers as a threat. Joe Human, co-ordinator of the Cumbria Fair Trade network, said both British farmers and those in the developing world have a difficult time competing with large companies. “Fairtrade is not just about a fair price …It’s also about sustainable farming.”"
716;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-12-10T18:54:36Z;Malaysia’s MOL Global buys Friendster;;Friendster, the site that pioneered social networking early in the decade, is being acquired by a Malaysian online payments provider, bringing to an end one of the stranger dotcom sagas.While its star has faded in the US and Europe, Friendster is popular in south-east Asia.MOL Global said it hoped to pair its retail partners and payment platform with Friendster’s large regional network to create a content, distribution and commerce network.Terms of the deal were not released, but MOL is expected to pay at least $100m for the site.California-based Friendster, founded in 2001, popularised social networking in the US. For a time it was among the hottest groups in Silicon Valley, attracting venture capitalists such as John Doerr to its board. But it struggled to win mainstream adoption. Outages plagued the site, which was often slow.When MySpace was founded in 2003, it won users from Friendster by allowing customised pages and a richer media experience, quickly becoming the preferred social network for the younger generation.Facebook has eclipsed both Friendster and MySpace, growing to more than 350m users at a time when social networking has become mainstream.Asian teenagers, however, have continued to embrace Friendster. Out of the shadow of MySpace and Facebook, the group has a presence in the region, with about 75m registered users, more than 90 per cent of whom are in Asia.Richard Kimber, Friendster chief executive and formerly Google managing director for south-east Asia, said: “The new combined entity gives Friendster the kind of financial backing, retail distribution and e-commerce infrastructure that will enable us to accelerate our strategy and create a locally relevant, fun experience for our users in Asia, both on and offline.”Friendster has been preparing for a sale, rolling out a redesign and hiring Mr Kimber.MOL, which has become the payments provider for Friendster, handles more than 60m transactions a year with an annual payment volume of over $200m. It provides systems to collect payments for content and services, such as online games and music, film and video content.MOL’s principal shareholder is Vincent Tan of Berjaya, who owns south-east Asian franchises of Starbucks, 7-Eleven, Borders, Krispy Kreme, Wendy’s and Papa John’s Pizza.MOL said that Friendster, which has raised $45m and has obtained five US social networking patents, was expected to help contribute $110m in annual revenues.
717;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-11-24T22:07:02Z;Wireless internet access;;With expenses under more scrutiny than they once were, many business travellers rightly grouse about the exorbitant rates that many of the big hotel chains charge for Wi-Fi access. But how to avoid them?For starters, it is worth remembering that while many hotels charge for in-room Wi-Fi, it is free in public areas such as foyers and bars. Moving slightly further afield, many high street restaurant chains, including Pret A Manger, offer free Wi-Fi. Starbucks provides the service in the US and the UK and Ireland for loyalty card holders, and in some other countries, too. And, for those who don’t want to spring for a coffee, Barnes & Noble offer it in all its US bookstores.Some cities and towns have free municipal Wi-Fi, although the concept has not taken off as many predicted it might. Nonetheless, even if you have to pay, the signal from outside your hotel is often less than a third of the price of what is available inside, so click “show networks” and shop around.If you travel mainly within your home country, a couple of days on the road a month is usually all it takes to justify the cost of mobile broadband via a dongle that can plug into a laptop or e-book. BlackBerrys and smartphones mean we are less beholden to our laptops for e-mail than we once were.For those in transit, nearly all business lounges have free Wi-Fi and some airports, such as Dubai, Singapore (Changi) and London City, give it away in public areas.In the US, Google recently announced that it would provide free Wi-Fi in 47 US airports until January 15 and the same offer applies on Virgin America flights.
718;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-11-06T22:22:20Z;Wall St shrugs off jobs report;;Gains by General Electric, Starbucks and the world’s biggest video games company, Activision Blizzard, helped Wall Street shrug off disappointing jobs data in choppy trading on Friday.The S&P 500 spent less than 15 minutes in the red after October’s non-farm payrolls report showed that the US unemployment rate had risen to 10.2 per cent.However, stocks soon fell again and the S&P turned negative 15 times throughout the day, finally closing 0.3 per cent higher at 1,069.30.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2 per cent to 10,023.42 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 2,112.44.In spite of volatile trading, Wall Street has closed higher every day this week.A sell-off in the financial sector, both on Monday afternoon and just before the closing bell on Wednesday, weighed on the market but the S&P still managed to cling to positive territory.Disappointing economic data also failed to shake the confidence of investors who remained focused on the gradual improvement in economic conditions.Positive results from Cisco on Thursday added to a rally in technology stocks, giving the Nasdaq its biggest daily gain since July.As a result, Wall Street on Friday recorded its first weekly gain in three weeks. The S&P was up 3.2 per cent on the week, the Dow also gained 3.2 per cent and the Nasdaq climbed 3.3 per cent.“The unemployment number was pretty scary but we’re seeing two different stories here,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Canaccord Adams. “The strong earnings out of Cisco and some more tech earnings today are trumping the unemployment number, so we’re having a rebound. But the question is: when is the unemployment number going to start affecting the big companies? If a lot of people get laid off, they’re going to stop spending.”The industrials sector outperformed the market throughout the day, led by General Electric shares that rose 6.2 per cent to $15.33 after an upgrade from Bernstein.A Bernstein upgrade also boosted shares in Amazon, the online retailer, lifting the stock 4.6 per cent to $126.20.Starbucks also encouraged investors, gaining 7.2 per cent to $21.12 after the coffee chain posted higher-than-expected quarterly profits and raised its outlook for 2010.The Seattle-based group has struggled to transform itself over the past year in the face of tougher competition, changing its product lines and slashing costs.Activision Blizzard rose 3.5 per cent to $11.25 after reporting higher quarterly revenue than analysts had been expecting.The Californian group said strong sales of the “Guitar Hero” game helped to offset an industry-wide decline in video game software sales in the third quarter.However, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the government-backed mortgage finance agencies, were some of the market’s biggest casualties both on Friday and throughout the week.After the market’s close on Thursday, Fannie Mae said it would draw another $15bn of funds from the US Treasury after a ninth consecutive quarterly loss drove its net worth below zero. Its shares were down 7.1 per cent at $1.04 on Friday and off 3.7 per cent from last week.Freddie Mac, which is also backed by the government, was down 1.6 per cent to $1.23.American International Group also weighed on the market on Friday.The government-supported insurer reported its second successive quarterly profit after investment losses diminished.But its shares dropped 9.7 per cent to $35.48 after sales declines at its property-casualty operations, which include coverage of commercial buildings, corporate boards and aircraft, and life insurance divisions
719;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-10-26T18:24:34Z;Rivals take the froth off Starbucks;;In 2003, the café latte entered the UK’s retail price index for the first time. Made with a strong espresso shot and a generous slosh of steamed milk the latte had become such a staple that the Office of National Statistics decided it should be included in the “basket of goods” used to measure average household spending.Today, the UK still boasts more branded coffee bars than anywhere else in Europe, but the company that brought lattes to the masses is grappling with a market that looks very different from those early days of frothy expansion.Starbucks entered the UK in 1998, acquiring 65 Seattle Coffee Company stores and installing its bright, sofa-filled cafés on high streets across the country. By 2005 there were about 200 Starbucks coffee shops in London (more than Manhattan) and about 450 in the UK.However, having introduced speciality coffee to the mainstream, Starbucks also paved the way for some strong competition.Costa Coffee, founded by two Italian brothers in Lambeth in 1971 and bought by Whitbread in 1995, has expanded so fast in the past 18 months that its UK outlets now exceed those of Starbucks by more than 200.While Costa opened its 1,000th store this month and celebrated a 21 per cent rise in sales in the first half of this year, Starbucks is due to shut down 100 “underperforming” international stores, with analysts expecting at least 30 closures in the UK, leading to questions being asked over its recent business model.Jeffrey Young, analyst at Allegra Strategies, says: “Starbucks were applying a global model to the UK. At the height of the recession, Starbucks’ message was ‘summer’s back’ and they were focusing on their frappuccino range.“In contrast, Costa was saying: ‘Try our great value lunch, £4.95 for a sandwich and any drink’. The UK is Costa’s heartland and they’re really in tune with the market. It’s about being nimble.”The UK’s recession proved to be something of a crucible for the big coffee retailers, with one, Coffee Republic, going into administration.According to Allegra research, 47 per cent of European coffee house operators experienced a like-for-like decline in sales in the six months to October, while just 34 per cent achieved positive growth. Starbucks, which reports its full-year results in November, may have seen like-for-like sales fall up to 7 per cent in the year to September, says Mr Young.In contrast, Costa’s tailored marketing to the cash-strapped UK consumer helped push like-for-like sales up 2.5 per cent in the first half of this year, and the chain is now targeting growth in China, Russia and central Europe.John Derkach, Costa’s managing director, says: “Things are going spectacularly well. Although the sector is flat, we’re still growing, which means that our competitors are suffering.”Just before midday at a Costa outlet on Borough High Street in London, Caglar Colak, a 25-year-old student, has popped in for his daily latte.Asked why he chose Costa, he smiles and says:“I don’t like Starbucks. The coffee isn’t strong enough.”Pete, an investment banker, says: “Starbucks is too commercial. Obviously Costa’s a chain as well, but the coffee is a bit different, more interesting.”But Starbucks is now raising its game to counter this image problem, renovating existing coffee houses, introducing a healthier food range and committing to Fairtrade espressos in all its UK and Ireland stores.It says: “We are committed to the UK market and will emerge from the review that we have undertaken with a stronger store portfolio focused on providing the best possible service and value to our customers”.In September it launched a multi-million pound advertising campaign, its biggest in the UK since 1998, and promised a new UK store design “shortly”.The new store decor is expected to be less standardised, more local.But Mr Young says that approach will be increasingly necessary if big brand coffee retailers – not just Starbucks, but Costa and Caffè Nero too – are to retain market share against a new threat: a surge of “edgier” independents in the UK market.He says: “The edgier consumers are tiring of chains, so chains will need to work very hard to get that level of authenticity into their offer”.
720;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-10-23T22:50:44Z;US business group in dispute on reform;;Both sides deny they are conducting a feud. But anyone standing between the White House and the venerable Chamber of Commerce headquarters across Washington’s Lafayette Square should don a flak jacket.“The White House thinks the chamber is not cool and that the cool companies are companies like Google,” says Bruce Josten, the chamber’s head lobbyist, whom George W. Bush nicknamed “Big guy”.“But if you look at the source of the biggest new demand for electricity it’s the companies with the large servers.”The dispute, which has pitted the chamber against almost every big White House initiative, including its plans to tackle climate change, healthcare reform and financial regulatory reform, illuminates how divided US business has become.Ten years ago, the chamber might have spoken uncontroversially for most of its 3m members on climate change or healthcare. Today, many of them dispute its stances.Four companies, including Apple and Exelon, quit the chambers in protest last month over its opposition to the climate change bill, which has since stalled in the Senate.Their disquiet had been exacerbated when the chamber’s senior environmental spokesman likened the debate over global warming to the notorious “monkey Scopes” trial of the 1920s on the teaching of evolution.Mr Josten admits it was a “stupid thing to say”. But he points out that the chamber has long supported action on climate change, which it accepts is man-made. “What we object to is this bill in particular, not tackling climate change in general,” he says. “The White House is trying to divert attention from the fact that the Democratic party is hopelessly divided on all these issues by picking a fight with the chamber.”The fall-out goes beyond words. Since the start of the year the chamber, which is arguably Washington’s most powerful lobbying organisation, has spent $37m (€24.6m, £22.6m) opposing healthcare reform.It has launched a campaign for “American Free Enterprise”, highlighting the alleged dangers to the free market system under the Obama administration, including its plan to change the law to make it easier for workers to join a trade union – a bill that has also stalled.The chamber has also taken a strong stance against Barack Obama’s proposals to set up a consumer financial protection regulatory agency, which probably contributed to the dilution of the bill in the House of Representatives this week.Again, the chamber argues that it does not oppose financial reform in general and has been pushing for rationalisation of Washington’s “gaggle of regulatory agencies” since the Enron debacle of 2001.None of which cuts any ice with Mr Obama, whose officials have infuriated the chamber by depicting it as an “antiquated” lobby group.One official, pointing to the fact that other organisations, such as the Business Roundtable, back climate change legislation and healthcare reform, said: “We leave it to the chamber to evaluate whether their positions on key issues are in line with their membership.”The official added that there was “no feud” with the White House. Yet the president has picked up the habit of meeting the chief executives of companies independently, rather than going through the traditional gatekeeper across Lafayette Square.In the past few months Mr Obama has had three lunches with chief ex­ecutives, representing the kind of new economy companies who backed his campaign.These include people such as Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, Howard Schultz, chief of Starbucks, and even Mike Duke, chief of Walmart, which has turned into an unexpected ally to the Democratic party on healthcare and climate change.So far, Tom Donohue, the head of the chamber, is not among Mr Obama’s lunch guests. “Washington is changing and meeting with business leaders directly is simply to gather their ideas and seek their input,” said the White House official. “There is less of a need for a middle man.”As one Democratic lobbyist puts it: “It is one thing to be attacked. It is another to be ignored.”
721;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T03:31:47+0000;Premium products boost McDonald’s sales;;Growing sales of its higher-end items boosted McDonald’s income in the US and Europe, as the fast-food chain expands its speciality offerings to lure increasingly cost-conscious consumers to its restaurants.McDonald’s reported a 3.8 per cent rise in global comparable sales, with gains in every market and particularly strength in Europe.The gains have been steadily declining – last year global comparable sales rose 7.1 per cent. But the company’s results surpassed analysts’ estimates, with earnings per share growing 10 per cent over the same quarter last year to $1.15, compared with expectations of $1.10. Overall, revenues fell 4 per cent to $6.05bn, due to foreign exchange impact.“Alignment behind McDonald’s long-term business strategy, the Plan to Win, is clear as our growth continues to be a systemwide effort with each area of the world contributing,” said Jim Skinner, McDonald’s chief executive. “McDonald’s global results demonstrate the resilience of our strategies and our ability to execute successfully.”European sales grew 5.8 per cent, as premium products and promotions drove a 10 per cent increase in operating income.In the US, comparable store sales grew 2.5 per cent, boosted by higher-end items, including McCafe coffees, introduced as a lower-cost alternative to speciality coffee chains such as Starbucks, and Angus Third Pounders. Sales of core menu items were also strong.Sales in Asia, Africa and the Middle East grew 2.2 per cent, and opening income rose 21 per cent in constant currencies.Mr Skinner said he expected comparable sales to grow in October, despite the falling global “informal eating out market”.McDonald’s shares rose 2.8 per cent to 59.97 in pre-market trading.
722;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-10-12T23:12:16Z;Retail: Consumers rally with an eye for a bargain;;Eldorado, the Russian electronics retailer, did not expect a scrum when it slashed the price of laptops in one of its Moscow stores on the eve of the new school year.The superstore called the police as terrified sales assistants clambered on to counters to escape stampeding customers. Several people were injured in the incident, which Russian state media said had “turned shoppers into beasts”.Russian shoppers, renowned for their frenetic spending habits before the financial crisis, have turned to bargain hunting as the economic contraction squeezes, bringing to a standstill the longest consumer boom in the country’s history.The crisis was a cold shower for Russian retailers and consumers, says Marat Ibragimov, a retail analyst at Citigroup. “People are becoming much more price sensitive in every segment. They used to behave like there was no tomorrow.”Russian retail sales took off after 2000 as the country’s windfall oil earnings fostered development of a new, free-spending middle class eager to throw off the deprivations of the Soviet past and acquire consumer goods.Rising disposable incomes and bountiful consumer credit spurred a spending boom that transformed Russia into Europe’s fastest growing retail market. “The rally was not just about money, it was about acquiring a completely new, comfortable style of life,” says Mr Ibragimov.But Russian shopping habits have changed since the crisis descended, halting a 10-year economic rally. Retail sales have spiralled downwards this year, falling by 9.8 per cent year-on-year in August – the steepest decline in a decade. Even in the relatively resilient food sector consumers are trading down, substituting imported goods with cheaper domestic produce and shopping more frequently in discount stores and outdoor markets.Experts say the recession is an opportunity for global retailers to establish themselves in Russia, particularly those catering for the cost-conscious shopper. They anticipate a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the highly fragmented and underserved market.AT Kearney, the management consultants, placed Russia in second place – after India and above China – in its latest global retail development index that ranks the attractiveness of emerging market retail sectors for investors. It said it expected Russian sales to increase by a compound annual rate of 15 per cent for the next five years, despite the crisis.In the immediate term the evaporation of cheap credit has put foreign cars and real estate – the most prized acquisitions of Russia’s aspiring middle class – out of reach. Sales of almost all other non-discretionary goods have also fallen as consumers focus their spending on basic foodstuffs.Even Russia’s super rich are spending more judiciously, forcing some luxury retailers to retreat from Moscow.Top British fashion designers such as Vivienne Westwood, Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen have closed outlets in Moscow’s “luxury triangle” of exclusive boutiques this year, saying that dwindling returns no longer justified high rents.Ilona Tsaklova, the owner of TIP, an elite fur and accessories shop, notes that many customers who before the crisis would splash out each year on a new sable – the Tsar of furs – are now settling for minks instead.The crisis made Russian shoppers more rational, says Natalya Smirnova, a retail analyst at UralSib: “They are counting [their money] for the first time. They got rich so fast, but now they realise they can lose it as well.”While luxury retailers take time out, global suppliers of affordable fashion and footwear are still advancing into Russia. Thousands of Russians queued for hours to attend the opening of the first Hennes & Mauritz store in a Moscow mall in May – the first of three outlets the Swedish fashion giant will establish in the capital this year before expanding to St Petersburg in 2010.Payless ShoeSource, whose low-cost footwear shops dot malls across the US, will open its first shops in Russia in 2010 in a franchise agreement with MH Alshaya, the Kuwaiti retail group.Collective Brands, the Kansas-based holding company for Payless and StartRite shoes, says it will launch 90 stores within five years in Russia where it eventually plans to build a network of 300 Payless outlets.Partnership with MH Alshaya, which already operates more than 100 franchise stores for retailers in Russia including Mothercare, Next, Body Shop and Starbucks, will help Payless reduce capital investment and operational risks.Voluminous red tape is a barrier to entry for global retailers, prompting many investors to forge partnerships with locals or buy ready-made businesses. In some cases the opaque ownership structures of Russian companies has derailed equity deals.Carrefour, the French retail giant, launched a first supermarket in Moscow this year, but has so far failed in its efforts to strike an agreement with Seventh Continent, the indebted Russian grocer chain, a move that would propel it into the ranks of the top 10 food retailers in Russia.Walmart, the world’s biggest retailer, has hired an executive to seek opportunities in Russia but no deal has yet materialised.Set against the difficulties is the huge potential of the Russian retail market. “If global retailers want to grow they have to be here,” says Mr Ibragimov.
723;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-10-05T17:13:34Z;Superior Donuts, Music Box Theatre, New York;;"The clock has stopped over the counter of Superior Donuts, the Chicago coffee shop where Tracy Letts’ new Broadway play takes place. Also stuck is Arthur Przybyszewski, the pushing-60 proprietor portrayed with deflated precision by Michael McKean. Arthur’s ponytail and tie-dyed shirt haven’t changed much in the 40 years since he fled the Vietnam draft for Canada. Though he has long since returned home to take over the family business, he remains an ageing hippy resisting change: the Starbucks across the street and the Russian electronics store owner who’s trying to buy him out.At once a requiem for baby boomers, an elegy for working-class neighbourhoods, and a love letter to the Windy City, Superior Donuts brings Letts back from his childhood Oklahoma, the setting of his prize-laden, much more corrosive August: Osage County, to his adult home, Chicago, command central for the Steppenwolf Theatre Company, which first fried up Donuts.The laughs are steady in the first act, especially in the sparring and eventual symbiosis of Arthur and Franco Wicks, the young black man who lands a job at the shop and lusts to score a publisher for his attempt at writing the Great American Novel. Adept at insult, Franco, given a worldly yet vulnerable performance by Jon Michael Hill, challenges Arthur to trivia games: naming 10 African-American poets is the liveliest of them. Charmed by his employee’s hunger for knowledge, Arthur is much less pleased when he discovers that Franco owes a loan shark $16,000.Act One ends when Arthur, in one of several spotlit interior monologues, reveals that his father had called him “coward” when he headed north to beat conscription. In Act Two, Arthur discovers not only the father-within and the lover-within (a lady cop comes courting) but also the fighter-within.If this sounds sentimental, it is, alas. This is an oddly shaped story that could have benefited from a dash of Augustan acerbity. Arthur’s courage-summoning – he fights the loan shark – is staged ineffectually by the otherwise skilful director, Tina Landau.In the altercation, less would have meant more; the lack of subtlety is reinforced by the beautifully played aftermath, when the blond Russian nephew of the electronics-store owner almost wordlessly restores one of the shop’s regulars to her perch at the counter. Heartbreaking in its restraint, the moment is utterly Russian in its display of hope against hopelessness."
724;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Britain does not need a version of Chapter 11;;"If religion is the opium of the people, reform is the double whisky of the legislators. Creating laws gives politicians a nice, warm glow. It makes them feel needed, an elusive buzz in a profession that is as unpopular as banking and journalism. The result is tinkering that is unhelpful to business.It is therefore right to feel suspicious of proposals to adopt elements of the US’s Chapter 11 corporate insolvency regime here in the UK. David Cameron, the Tory leader, suggested the move last summer. A government consultation on Labour measures that borrow from Chapter 11 has just closed. Coming a year after the credit crunch that triggered the recession, the timing is fortuitous. It allows us to draw conclusions over whether our current system is bad enough to need overhaul.Chapter 11 gives US businesses protection from their creditors under the supervision of a court. The idea is to allow a company to restructure, protecting jobs and the value of business assets. Lenders that participate in the rescue may have priority of repayment over existing creditors. Suppliers may be required to continue supplying the business.Arguments over the applicability of Chapter 11 to the UK are tinged with nationalism. Proponents are accused of seeking to impose American business culture on the locals, like Starbucks turning a friendly tea shop into a frothy coffee joint. Opponents risk appearing xenophobic. This aspect of the debate reflects the background of participants.The noisiest cheerleader for a version of Chapter 11 in the UK is the European High Yield Association, whose membership is peppered with hardball-playing, stogie-chomping New Yorkers such as investment bank Goldman Sachs and the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. The official opposition is led by R3, which represents the state-licensed insolvency practitioner, a quintessentially British figure who pedals to creditors’ meetings on a push bike, raising his bowler to maiden ladies as he goes.Such glib stereotypes are undercut by the substantial European businesses of many EHYA members, which are, moreover, as entitled to have opinions on insolvency law as anyone else. Equally, some US-based banks, such as Citigroup, are as wary of a UK Chapter 11 as R3 and its ally the British Bankers’ Association.It is more instructive to study profit motives than nationalities. The EHYA believes that Chapter 11, where a court can knock creditors’ heads together, could help restructure big, struggling UK companies created through leveraged buy-outs. Law firms familiar with Chapter 11 would, one surmises, have an advantage in selling advice on the new process. US-based banks could do good business in supplying “super priority” funding. The BBA is, with equal self-interest, unenthusiastic about this novel form of finance. Insolvency practitioners, meanwhile, fear having their horses – or bicycles – shot from under them. They currently run UK businesses that are in administration. Under Chapter 11, the managers often stay in charge.One constituency is unrepresented in this debate: entrepreneurs who have just started a business. The Labour minister who kicked off the recent consultation wrote folksily of the UK’s “recovery culture”. There was no mention of the benefits of a culture where company failure is accepted as a stimulus to new businesses. But Gordon Brown, as chancellor, recognised that “churn” in the business stock was an essential safeguard to economic efficiency. Chapter 11 favours incumbents at the expense of newcomers. Failed US airlines, for example, used it cunningly to retain market share earlier this decade.Fortunately, Labour is unlikely to change the insolvency system by grafting on chunks of Chapter 11. It has a more pressing priority – saving its own skin. Hopefully, the Tories will also forget the idea. Reform does not promise to deliver benefits that outweigh its costs and risks.There have been more than 26,000 insolvencies since September last year, representing the first distress test of a system introduced in 2002 following complaints that too many viable businesses were wound up in the 1990s recession. So far the system has performed well, with creditors and directors flocking to use administration for corporate recovery.The danger postulated by the EHYA is that the rescue of a large, leveraged company will be imperilled by bickering among creditors and a lack of new finance. The group backs its contention with studies of such complex collapses as Eurotunnel. Even so, its warning sounds like a cry of “Wolf!” Reform is justified by real catastrophes rather than notional ones. When it comes to tinkering with business laws, I would endorse the broader non-interventionist philosophy of Stanley Johnson, father of the better-known Boris, when running for parliament. Asked by voters what he would do if elected, Johnson Senior would reply: “Not much, hopefully.” He lost, of course.jonathan.guthrie@ft.com

725;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-09-29T21:41:36Z;Starbucks vs Nestlé;;If the advertising is anything to go by, a battle royal is at hand or, rather, in cup. Starbucks yesterday launched nationwide sales of its new instant coffee range Via, accompanied with the type of promotional campaign the company has traditionally avoided for its ubiquitous coffee stores. Swiss-based Nestlé meanwhile, the largest maker of instant coffee worldwide, has its own line of ads contending that Starbucks is four times as expensive as Nescafé. Both, naturally, claim superior flavour.The fight is more important to upstart Starbucks, which faces an intractable problem in its core business. The group created a market in the US and then abroad for quality coffee. However, success breeds imitation and thus competition, which squeezes profits. With fast food chains such as McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts getting in on the act, Starbucks faces substantial pressure on prices. Instant coffee could represent a new, and profitable, source of growth.For its part, Nestlé has been quietly attacking the café sector with its range of Nespresso machines that use individual pods to make posh coffee at home. The company estimates that the “portioned” share of the market will have tripled to 12 per cent of global coffee volumes by 2015 (and twice that share by value). Starbucks cannot hope to compete with Nestlé’s marketing and distribution clout in the general retail market. But were it to persuade some connoisseurs to drink instant, Starbucks would threaten Nestlé’s ambitions in the premium coffee segment.Investors already appear to assume that Starbucks can return to growth. Like many stocks, its share price is now half the peak but double the low, leaving it trading on 23 times next year’s earnings. They will be disappointed if instant coffee proves only to be a temporary pick-me-up.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter
726;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
727;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-09-23T16:54:43Z;Starbucks app turns iPhone into a wallet;;Starbucks unveiled a first-of-its-kind app today that lets users pay for in-store purchases using their iPhone, a move that could pave the way for a new generation of e-commerce applications on Apple’s popular phone.With the Starbucks Card Mobile App, users can sync their prepaid Starbucks Card with the app, check their balance and refill it using a credit card. At some stores, they can also use the app to pay for Venti coffees and Frappuccinos.When users select the “payment trial” function on the app, a QR code appears on the iPhone screen. A barista then scans the iPhone, deducting the cost from the Starbucks Card balance, and completing the purchase.The trial is being rolled out at 16 locations in Seattle and Silicon Valley, where there is high usage of both iPhones and Starbucks Cards. But expect the programme to go nationwide soon, and for other retailers to follow.To get its loyal caffeine addicts hooked on the new technology, Starbucks is offering perks like free coffee refills and 2 hours of free wifi for early adopters of the app. Unfortunately, the app doesn’t let you jump to the front of the line or let you order in advance, two services that would doubtlessly appeal to true junkies. The most practical use case scenario would be a customer who forgot their wallet at home, but had their phone on them.The race is on for the “mobile phone wallet”. Nokia is integrating payment system into its phones. PayPal is also plotting an offline expansion. Other, more cumbersome iPhone apps have tried to achieve in-store payments, but required additional additional hardware for the phone — a deal-breaker.In-store mobile phone payments aren’t likely to catch on overnight. Consumers are used to credit cards, which generally work just fine. Besides, if your mobile phone was also your wallet, it would be doubly painful to misplace it.But as the technology becomes more secure, and mainstream consumer companies like Apple get on board, mobile phone wallets could become ubiquitous as, well, Starbucks.
728;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-09-07T20:18:47Z;Labelling helps diners change course;;Anthony Thompson set out to get lunch recently with a group of co-workers, his mind set on a special offer from Subway, the fast-food chain: a foot-long meatball sub sandwich for just $5. But when he landed at the outlet in Rockefeller Center in midtown Manhattan, he changed his mind.“I came to get a meatball marinara and now I have an oven-roasted chicken,” he said. His reason? “Because of the calories,” he explained.According to information posted on the Subway menu board, the meatball sandwich weighed in at more than 1,000 calories, or half the daily 2,000 calorie intake recommended by US nutritionists for most adults. The chicken breast option offered a less challenging 620 calories.“Now I don’t have to run as much,” Mr Thompson said of his changed lunch plans. Julienne Gutierrez, one of his friends, adds: “We talk about the calories all the time.”New York last year became the first US authority to require restaurant chains to list item-by-item calorie counts on their main menus, from the Sbarro mozzarella deep pan pizza (660 calories) to the chocolate chip muffin at Dunkin’ Donuts (630).With similar legislation now before the US Congress, calorie-counting at lunch may become a national pastime, in a move that advocates argue could help stem America’s rising obesity crisis.“Menu labelling is an easy and understandable way for people to cut hundreds or thousands of calories from their ordering with just a split-second decision. It’s certainly easier than going for a run for two hours,” says Margo Wootan, director of nutrition at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which campaigns for menu labelling.Calorie counts and other nutritional information have been included on US food packaging since 1995. But Americans consume on average a third of their calories out of the home and public health nutritionists argue they need clear and accessible information in restaurants too.The restaurant industry initially went to court to try to overturn the 2007 New York law, claiming that menu listings were impractical since the choices involved in making a sandwich with 15 possible ingredients could yield billions of permutations.But after watching New York’s legislative example spread to other cities and states including California, the National Restaurant Association has changed its tune. In a statement, the association said it welcomed the national legislation aimed at chains with more than 20 outlets, saying it “empowers consumers to make choices that are best for themselves and their families”.There are signs that consumers are making healthier choices, or at least digesting the information. New York’s health department says a survey of about 1,600 customers at 51 different food locations showed 60 per cent were aware of posted calorie information, compared with levels of less than 5 per cent seen before the new posting regulations. About 25 per cent of those seeing the information said it affected what they bought.A separate survey by Techtronics, an industry consultancy, found that about 90 per cent of 735 people in the city were surprised by the higher-than-expected number of calories in restaurant meals.Some chains, including Starbucks, have over the past two years lowered calorie counts in menus. But restaurant companies largely have avoided making the connection with the New York initiative and lower calorie choices.New York city’s health department argues that if restaurants can lower average daily consumption by 50 calories per customer, it will lead to 150,000 fewer cases of obesity over five years and at least 30,000 fewer cases of diabetes.But Harry Balzer, restaurant analyst at NPD Group, notes that almost 15 years after it was introduced, nutritional labelling on packaged food has had no impact on rising obesity levels.“There will be people who will see something, and decide to give it up, because of the calorie levels,” he said. “But they won’t give up on it permanently. They’ll be back.”……………Dishing up the calorie catastrophesChili’s Grill, whose 1,290 casual dining restaurants dot malls and shopping plazas across the US, no longer serves its Awesome Blossom dip starter, a combination of piles of deep-fried battered onion rings and cheese sauce.With 2,710 calories, the dish was last year declared one of the “20 worst foods in America” by the authors of “Eat this, not that!”, a regular feature in Men’s Health magazine. While Congress contemplates forcing restaurant chains to list the calorie counts of their meals, popular demand for the information has led to “Eat this, not that” spawning best-selling books, a web community and forthcoming TV series.Six other dishes on the 2008 worst foods list also subsequently disappeared from restaurant menus, in an apparent reflection of the influence of the no-holds-barred style of the ETNT critical reviews.Chili’s Awesome Blossom, for instance, was said to contain “the fat equivalent of 67 slices of bacon”. Romano’s Macaroni Grill Dessert Ravioli, the 2009 “worst dessert” with 1,630 calories, is described as “the quickest way to ruin what may have been a sensible dinner”, and equal to four quarter-pound beef burgers.Other chains on the lists include TGI Friday’s, Uno Chicago Grill, Outback Steakhouse, Quiznos and Baskin-Robbins.
729;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-09-01T17:54:47Z;Payless ShoeSource set to venture into Russia;;Payless ShoeSource, whose low-cost shoe stores dot shopping malls and streets across the US, is to open its first stores in Russia next year under a franchise agreement with MH Alshaya, the Kuwaiti retail group.Collective Brands, the holding company for both Payless and StartRite shoe brands, said it expected five stores to open in Russia next year, increasing to 90 within five years. Collective and Alshaya have a long-term objective of more than 300 Payless stores.The move reflects both the strong interest of US and European retailers and brands in Russia, and the interest in working with franchise partners already established in the market to reduce capital investment and operational risks.Collective started working with Alshaya in the Gulf region in 2008, leading to its first Payless franchise stores opening in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia earlier this year. In Russia, the Kuwaiti company already operates more than 100 franchise stores for retailers including Starbucks, Body Shop, Mothercare and Next.Gap, the US speciality clothing retailer, established its first Gap and Banana Republic stores in Russia this year operated under a franchise agreement by Siba, a Turkish business group that also operates stores in Russia for the UK’s Marks & Spencer.Russia was this year in second place in the global retail development index, behind India and ahead of China, produced by AT Kearney, the management consultants, which ranks the attractiveness of emerging markets’ retail sectors for investment.AT Kearney noted that while Russia had been hit by economic problems this year it still expected to see retail sales growing at a compound annual rate of 15 per cent for the next five years. The market also remains fragmented, with the top five national retailers controlling only about 7 per cent of sales, creating opportunities for international rivals to establish themselves.Carrefour, the French retailer, opened its first hypermarket in Moscow in June, and says it expects to open two more stores in Krasnodar and Lipetsk by the end of the year. Wal-Mart, the US retailer, has opened an office in Moscow, but unlike Carrefour is seeking to enter the market by acquiring a stake in an established local retailer.Matthew Rubel, chief executive of Collective Brands, said he expected Payless stores – which are both fashion-focused and affordable – to find a ready market in Russia: “Russian people love to shop, and have a strong appetite for fashion and footwear and accessories.”The franchise arrangements with Alshaya are part of a drive by Collective to expand international sales that account for about 17 per cent of its business, predominantly through joint ventures in Canada and Latin America.

It has been running marketing campaigns with the slogan: “It’s not just coffee. It’s Starbucks.”In the US, McDonald’s is selling espressos and mochas in its existing stores.In Europe, it is emulating its Australian business and opening separate McCafé counters, operating in or next to its restaurants. The group plans to have 1,200 McCafés in Europe by the end of the year.McDonald’s strongest sales were in Europe, up 7.2 per cent because of the popularity of its “tiered menu” – which offers cheap, middling and expensive options – as well as summer specials such as chicken, bacon and onion sandwiches in France and burgers based on the “great tastes of America” in the UK.These include a “New York special”, which has beef, streaky bacon, smoked cheese, lettuce, onions and onion mayo in a chilli, chive and sesame bun.In Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa – which make up 13 per cent of total profit – sales rose 2.1 per cent. McDonald’s attributed the rise to the “creativity” of its Australian business, which runs marketing campaigns based on a single theme – currently, family – and has introduced apple and cinnamon mini-muffins and spinach feta strudels, as well as opening more 24-hour and drive-through stores.But sales in China, where it has been slowing new store openings, were weaker as consumers favour cheaper local brands.McDonald’s has some 1,000 stores in China and plans to open 150 this year, compared with earlier projections of 175.
731;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-08-09T19:11:24Z;Patchi chocolatiers plan float;;Patchi, the family-owned Lebanese chocolate chain, is planning stock listings in Dubai and London to help fund its global expansion, which could include a line of cafés in addition to its chocolate shops.The group, which is wholly owned by Nizar Choucair, its founder and chairman, has hired financial advisers for a primary listing in Dubai and a secondary listing in London. Up to 49 per cent of the company would be floated.A listing had been delayed by the recession, said Mazin Obeidi, executive general manager of Patchi.But the company, which aimed to have 165 stores globally by the end of next year, is working on corporate governance requirements in the expectation of listing, he said.The company, which is profitable and generated $165m (€116m) in sales last year, is also considering opening cafés internationally that would sell chocolate, coffee and snacks. The cafés would be “like ­Starbucks, but at a higher level”, Mr Obeidi told the Financial Times. It was “very likely” that the first café would open in Lebanon next year.Patchi previously ran a restaurant specialising in desserts through a joint venture in Beirut, but closed it during the 2006 war in Lebanon.The company has been hit by the recession, with sales falling in important markets such as Dubai, Singapore and Hong Kong. It has closed 14 shops since ­September in the US, Canada, Australia and Nigeria.But sales in Dubai are up 2 per cent in the first half and the company is moving ahead with plans to open stores next year in Russia and Japan, where it will open outlets in the Takashimaya department store chain in 12 cities.Patchi said it had pursued the “wrong strategy” in Australia and the US by entering the ­market with just a few shops. This strategy had not worked because fixed operating costs had proved too high, Mr Obeidi said. “The US is like a continent – you need to open 50-plus shops.”Patchi has 135 shops globally, 95 company-owned and the rest franchised. The company says it receives several hundred applications each year for franchises but accepts only a few.Wolff Olins, the consultant behind the London 2012 Olympics logo and the Product Red campaign, recently tipped Patchi as one of five food and drinks brands from emerging markets that had the potential to become global brands.
732;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-08-04T23:13:35Z;Budget-conscious consumers boost Kraft;;"US shoppers are still opting for Kraft’s low-cost macaroni and cheese dinners to save money, but recent results from several US consumer companies suggest the “trading down” trend that emerged with last year’s economic crisis might be starting to level off.Kraft, the largest US food company, reported on Tuesday that sales of its “mac and cheese” dinners again grew by double digits in the three months ending on June 30 against the same period last year, compared to single digit growth before the crisis began.The company also reported continued strength in its US home pizza business, with its DiGiorno brand growing at least 20 per cent. However, it saw declines in sales to restaurants and other food service locations, reflecting the tendency by consumers to save money by eating at home.But in a potential sign of strengthening confidence among more prosperous consumers, Whole Foods Market, the upmarket natural and organic food store, reported the first sequential improvement in its same store sales after six quarters of sequential declines.Same store sales were down 2 per cent excluding currency fluctuations, compared with a 4.1 per cent decline in the previous quarter.John Mackey, chief executive, said the improvement was “driven by both average transaction count and basket size trends” at its more than 260 stores across the country. “It’s green shoots really; it’s signs of momentum, it’s signs of stability,” Mr Mackey said, while warning that “it is too early to call where this is going . . . but there are lots of encouraging signs”.The improved sales trends at Whole Foods, whose higher price stores were heavily hit by consumers’ shift to lower cost alternatives, mirror similar trends seen last month at Starbucks, the coffee retailer, which also saw a sequential improvement in its same store sales in its most recent quarter.Whole Foods’ executives said they had seen a decline in the proportion of own label products sold at its stores from levels seen earlier in the recession, echoing comments from several national brand consumer companies.David Mackay, chief executive of Kellogg’s, said last week that the cereal company had begun to see own label market share in its categories decline in the US and around the world. “While it did have a very strong spurt of share growth, [own label share] is now levelling off a little bit.”But he warned that customers “are still going to be in a mindset of looking for value and trying to extract as much value as they can out of every dollar they spend”, and would remain wary of returning to spending money on dining out.Away from food, Kimberly-Clark, the paper products company, also said last month that own label products either lost market share or remained level for a second consecutive quarter in the US."
733;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-07-29T22:21:50Z;Mind your manners;;BOOK REVIEWThe Cost of Bad BehaviourHow incivility is damaging your business and what to do about itBy Christine Pearson and Christine PorathPortfolio, $25.95, £18.99It’s a mean old world. Cynicism and disrespect characterise public debate. Old-fashioned courtesies are seen as just that. The meek do not inherit the earth – they get crushed in the stampede being led by the aggressively ambitious.Is any of this surprising? People are worried about their jobs and economic livelihoods. In their anxiety, many will look after number one. Is this really such a problem?The authors of this new book say that it is. Christine Pearson, a professor at the Thunderbird School of Global Management in Arizona, and Christine Porath, assistant professor at the Marshall School of Business in California, have been studying the impact of bad behaviour for more than a decade.Their conclusion? Incivility, as they label it, is doing untold commercial damage to many businesses. It is not just that life would be nicer if everybody were nicer. Businesses would be more successful, too.What is incivility? It is, according to this book, “the exchange of seemingly inconsequential, inconsiderate words and deeds that violate conventional norms of workplace conduct”. That casts the net pretty wide. Indeed, a list of examples of incivility printed at the start of the book appears to locate this argument in rather banal territory.“Acting irritated when someone asks a favour” is one of them. So are “spreading rumours about colleagues”, “failing to return phone calls or respond to e-mails” and “leaving a mess for others to clean up”. If this is incivility, there are a lot of uncivil workplaces out there.But, bit by bit, the authors make a strong case that cumulative rudeness or unpleasantness, whatever you call it, does damage the bottom line and should not be tolerated.Why is there more incivility than in the past? Partly it reflects social change, and the more abrasive, less automatically deferential relationships people often have with each other today. But there are economic factors at work here as well.Less permanent working arrangements undermine stability. “Skilled employees …build their own career paths and establish their relationships with employers on their own terms. One consequence is that employees have become more accustomed to getting what they want and more uncivil when they don’t,” the authors say. “When workplace relationships become transactional rather than loyalty based, civility can seem like a giant waste of time.”But how do the authors know that incivility has a financial impact? Because they have actually tried to cost it. Once you start to consider the consequences, the hidden costs become more apparent. The commitment of those on the receiving end of unpleasantness diminishes. They spend more time worrying. They reduce the time they spend at work. They criticise their employer to their friends and family. They try less hard. They look for other jobs. And sometimes they leave, taking their experience and contacts with them.“Unhappy flight attendants told us that they spent their flight time sitting in the back of the plane reading magazines, and disgruntled ramp workers recalled how they disappeared to sleep in the maintenance shack until the next plane arrived,” Profs Pearson and Porath say. It is obvious how this sort of staff dissatisfaction, brought about by incivility, can undermine customer service and the performance of a business.Do any companies have a better story to tell? Cisco is the first organisation the authors know of to have introduced a formal training programme based on civility. Managers at Starbucks are encouraged to monitor staff behaviour and report anything that is in conflict with the company’s founding principles.If this reviewer can enter an uncivil note, the book is a bit short of ideas on what the victims of unpleasantness should do about it. They argue against fighting back in kind. But their other suggestions – including, simply, “leave” – are a little underwhelming. There is also little acknowledgement of the fact that some workplaces, and some businesses, seem to survive and even thrive in an atmosphere of incivility.But these are relatively minor criticisms. The big point of this book is valid. Rudeness may be slowly killing your business. It is time to stamp it out.
734;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-07-27T22:38:23Z;Verizon to offer free WiFi to broadband customers;;Verizon Communications, the US telecommunications group, will provide its FiOS Video and broadband DSL internet customers with free WiFi access under an extended partnership deal it has struck with Boingo Wireless, one of the largest WiFi hotspot operators.The move represents a sudden about-face for Verizon, which unlike some of its biggest competitors has largely eschewed WiFi technology, viewing it as a potential threat to its lucrative 3G mobile data business.Under the terms of an earlier agreement, Verizon has provided WiFi access through Boingo to its business customers, but this will be the first time that Verizon has provided free WiFi to consumers.At least for the moment, however, only Verizon FiOS video and DSL customers will be offered the free Boingo WiFi service, although under the new four-year ‘master agreement,’ Verizon could extend this to its nearly 80m Verizon Wireless customers.That would enable Verizon to counter moves by some of its biggest rivals including AT&T and Cablevision, the cable TV company, which have both embraced WiFi aggressively.Last year AT&T expanded its WiFi reach beyond Starbucks and a handful of other locations by acquiring Wayport, a WiFi service provider that competes directly with Boingo.Meanwhile Cablevision, which is locked in a fierce battle for subscribers in much of Verizon’s New York region, offers complementary WiFi service to its cable broadband customers.Verizon’s decision to offer free WiFi to at least some of its consumer base may reflect its ambitions to expand its bundling strategy under which it offers ‘quad-play’ video, internet wired and wireless voice services to subscribers.It might also pave the way for Verizon Wireless to offer a wider range of smartphones including Apple’s WiFi-enabled iPhone and Palm’s Palm Pre and perhaps the new touch tablet computer Apple is expected to launch later this year.While Verizon Wireless already offers a wide range of smartphones including a number of BlackBerry devices made by Research in Motion, the models it sell do not typically support WiFi.

Its shares ended down 3.6 per cent at $24.45.Bank of New York Mellon also lost ground after reporting earnings slightly below expectations, falling 6.2 per cent to $27.32.The markets followed several banks and bounced back during the day.“Even if you have a few people hitting the “sell” button on results, there are others underneath willing to buy the dips,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets.The markets were also helped by optimism on housing after figures showed an unexpected rise in home prices in May.Mr Bernanke told the Senate he saw a “levelling-off” in house prices, although he added that foreclosures could yet pressure them again.KB Home gained 6.1 per cent to $15.03 while Lennarrose 7.7 per cent to $10.62 and DR Horton climbed 5.6 per cent to $10.38.Starbucks led the consumer sector higher after cost cuts helped it swing to a profit and beat analysts’ forecasts. Its shares jumped 18.4 per cent to $17.39.Resilience in consumer spending helped Applereport much better earnings than expected, with sales and profit margins both beating expectations. The stock picked up 3.5 per cent to $156.74.“The consumer is responding to Apple’s product introductions as well as price cuts, which is a good sign for the rest of the market,” said Bill Shope, an analyst at Credit Suisse.The benchmark S&P 500 index ended 0.4 per cent lower at 954.07, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4 per cent to 8,881.26. But the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 per cent to 1,926.38.Newspaper stocks performed well after Media General reported a quarterly profit and said declines in advertising revenue were beginning to ease. The company’s shares rose 84.3 per cent to $4.33.Of the blue-chip newspaper publishers, the New York Times Company, which reports results today, rose 3.1 per cent to $6.62.PepsiCo slipped as its quarterly revenues disappointed. Even though the company topped earnings expectations, the shares dropped 0.9 per cent to $55.89.In the technology sector, the shine from Apple’s results was dulled by disappointment over results from AMD, the microchip maker.Sliding sales saw the company miss estimates, and the shares gave up 13 per cent to $3.55.But Yahoo was able to overcome weak advertising revenues and beat analysts’ expectations with its earnings. Its shares climbed 3.7 per cent to $17.37.Boeing was the latest Dow component to beat its earnings estimates as it saw growth in its defence programs, but the shares fell 2.4 per cent to $42.Eli Lilly and Pfizersaw mixed fortunes even after both drugmakers reported better earnings than expected and raised their full-year forecasts.Eli Lilly fell 1.9 per cent to $33.79 while Pfizer picked up 1.1 per cent to $15.87.
736;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-07-21T23:49:25Z;Starbucks’ restructuring starts to show results;;"Starbucks, the coffee retailer, reported improvements in its comparable sales and transaction trends during its third quarter, pushing its shares up almost 10 per cent in after-hours trading.Howard Schultz, chief executive, said the results showed that a drive to improve the company’s performance that has included closing hundreds of stores and working to improve its service was bearing fruit. But he remained cautious about the outlook: “There is no victory lap going on at Starbucks . . . we realise how tough the environment is in terms of the economy . . . and we have to be very careful to recognise that the headwind is still in front of us.”Comparable sales at its US stores fell 6 per cent against the same quarter last year, but this was better than the 8 per cent decline in the second quarter. Worldwide comparable sales were down 5 per cent.In addition to closing stores and cutting costs, Starbucks has been trying to drive sales to more budget-conscious customers with lower-cost food and drink combinations and discounts for its loyalty-card holders.It has also been conducting its biggest marketing campaign, aimed at countering what it says is an unjustified popular perception that its prices are too high – at the same time as McDonald’s, the fast-food chain, has been promoting its new lower-cost McCafe expresso coffee offerings.Mr Schultz said there had been an “unprecedented” level of advertising aimed at coffee consumers in the quarter, which he argued had reinforced Starbucks’ own advertising efforts. “I think we are quite pleased with the fact that the things that we are doing in both in store and out of store are beginning to resonate with our customers.”Troy Alstead, chief financial officer, said the company had also seen US comparable sales improve from month to month during the quarter, and had significantly improved its operating margins.“We have created in the company a new discipline . . . in being more cost-conscious,” he said.Mr Schultz said the company was planning a further US marketing push in the autumn around the national launch of its Via instant coffee product, which he said had been
performing strongly in Seattle, New York and London, where it is available.The company has also recently opened the first of three new coffee shops in Seattle that will carry the name of their neighbourhoods rather than the Starbucks brand, which will include alcohol sales and live music aimed at attracting customers in the evening.Net income for its fiscal third quarter was $151.5m, or 20 cents per share, against a $6.7m loss a year ago.Revenues fell from $2.6bn to $2.4bn."
737;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-07-19T22:39:45Z;World’s next top brands set to rise in the east;;"The world’s next Coca-Cola or Starbucks is more likely to emerge from Asia, the Middle East or South America than the US or Europe as global economic wealth shifts.In research prepared for the Financial Times, Wolff Olins, the consultants behind the London 2012 Olympics logo and the Product Red campaign, has tipped five food and drink brands from emerging markets to become global brands.They comprise Juan Valdez Café, a Colombian coffee chain; Almarai, a Saudi dairy and fruit-juice company based in Riyadh; Patchi, a Lebanese boutique chocolate chain; ChangYu, China’s biggest wine producer; and United Spirits, India’s largest liquor group, which owns Scotch whisky Whyte & Mackay.“It used to be possible to be a global brand by dominating the US market,” said Melanie McShane, a strategist at Wolff Olins. “That’s changing rapidly. Now you have to be number one in Asia.”The findings echo research by US business consultancy Bain & Co, which estimated that one-third of the FT Global 500’s companies could come from emerging markets by 2015 thanks to what it calls a “seismic shift” away from developed markets.Satish Shankar, a Singapore-based partner with Bain & Co, said that established western consumer goods brands were being forced to “battle it out” with emerging market brands as they moved eastwards to take advantage of rising demand for branded products. Some are acquiring local brands, with PepsiCo paying $1.4bn last year for Lebedyansky, Russia’s largest juice group, and Unilever buying Inmarko, the country’s biggest ice cream brand.Coca-Cola’s attempts to acquire Huiyuan, China’s biggest juice group, for $2.4bn this year were less successful – Chinese regulators blocked the deal.Others are taking minority stakes or forming joint ventures. UK-based distiller Diageo is in talks with United Spirits over acquiring up to 15 per cent of the Indian company, while PepsiCo this year formed a joint venture with Almarai in Asia, Africa and the Middle East."
738;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-07-17T21:41:33Z;Coffee Republic attracts Arab interest;;The property company behind plans for one of London’s tallest skyscrapers has emerged as the surprise potential buyer of Coffee Republic, the coffee shop chain.Arab Investments, a private property investment company best known for its proposed Pinnacle tower in the City of London, on Friday entered into an exclusivity agreement with KPMG, which is acting as administrator to the coffee shop chain.If successful, Arab Investments intends to put money into developing the Coffee Republic brand in the UK and overseas, and will start expanding the branch network immediately after completing the deal. It is thought to be in talks to acquire about 80 outlets, of which 20 are outside the UK, in countries such as Saudi Arabia and Bulgaria.The chain had been hit by the drop in discretionary spending on the high street during the recession. Some of the less profitable bars also struggled with expensive leases.Although Coffee Republic Plc did not go bust, its three subsidiaries, Coffee Republic (UK), Coffee Republic Franchising Ltd and Goodbean Ltd, were placed into administration.Arab Investments is thought to see the chain as having a strong brand name, which can be grown to challenge larger chains such as Starbucks and Costa. The deal is thought to be largely opportunistic, with the owners of Arab Investments seeing the chance to buy a large chain of leasehold outlets at a cheap price. No financial details of the transaction were provided.KPMG confirmed that it had granted a period of exclusivity to the preferred purchaser of Coffee Republic, but declined to comment on the identity of the buyer.Joint administrator Richard Hill said: “As expected, the huge volume of enquiries from interested parties produced a very healthy level of offers. We have spent the last few days clarifying the terms of the most attractive offers and we have now identified our preferred purchaser.“We have agreed a period of exclusivity to allow that party to carry out some limited due diligence, which should enable us to agree the terms of the sale of the residual business as a going concern during the course of next week.”● Chester Properties, a private investment group, is in talks to buy an £800m portfolio of properties from Aviva Investors in what would be the biggest commercial property deal since the start of the real estate slump in 2007. The group has emerged as the favourite ahead of a shortlist including CIT with backing from Saudi Arabia’s Jadwa Investment. Aviva is also providing debt on the sale.

This is probably the worst recession in 100 years and it’s going to throw us into sharp focus.”The recession has been particularly beneficial for one of the group’s best-performing businesses – Revenue Assurance, which scans utility bills to find instances of underbilling, he said.“The economy is helping with that because people need to squeeze every penny they can.”Revenue in the supply division, which includes the Revenue Assurance business, jumped 53 per cent to £35.1m, while the operating profit margin climbed from 36 to 48 per cent.The company’s small facilities management business, which looks after parts of Waterstone’s’ and Starbucks’ estates, was performing less well. “It’s a tough market out there,” Mr Rigby said. “Nobody’s spending anything.”Revenue for the group as a whole rose from £310m to £386m, while pre-tax profits increased from £15m to £23m, in line with broker expectations.Earnings per share were up from 4.19p to 5.17p, while the dividend increases 25 per cent to 1.5p via a 1.14p final. The shares closed down 1½p at 67¼p.● Mears Group, the social housing maintenance contractor, has won a £200m contract for upgrade and repair work on the 12,500 homes managed by Brighton & Hove city council.The win takes total new contracts awarded since Mears’ annual results in March to nearly £400m, a 25 per cent increase on its year-end order book of £1.6bn. Analysts expect Mears to produce pre-tax profits of £23m this year, against £17m in 2008.The shares closed down 2p at 226p.

So are the pink puffs of cotton candy, strawberry bouquets and chocolate soufflé on the sweet trolley.That does not mean business is booming across the US, but anecdotal evidence in the country’s fourth most populous city suggests consumer confidence is returning and that the economic downturn is coming to an end.“We’re actually seeing it wasn’t as bad as people expected, and people are coming back faster than expected,’’ said Scott Sulma, Tony’s general manager, speaking during the restaurant’s Friday night rush.Indeed, the latest data from the commerce department on Friday supports this sentiment: consumer spending, which accounts for more than 70 per cent of US economic activity, in May increased for the first time since February, rising 0.3 per cent. Furthermore, personal income rose 1.4 per cent.A Starbucks in Houston’s upper-middle-class West University area began to notice business getting brisker weeks ago. Baskin Robbins, one of the more affordable ice-cream shops in the district, said business had never even slowed down.Kimberly Michelle Wiltz, co-owner of Studio 31 Hair Lab, said that, in spite of the premium paid by her customers, business had remained strong with many people regarding haircuts as a form of therapy to counter the recession.She mentioned one client who had come in that day complaining about a pay cut, but had left saying she felt better.The businesses that have felt the most pain are those that people feel are extras they can do without.Steve Proto, owner of Beautique Day Spa, said massages and other body treatments had taken a hit. Yet takings in his hair salon were down only slightly. Hair, like skincare and waxing, is seen as more essential. Pedicures and manicures have done better than massages.Mr Proto said: “People view massages as expendable luxuries.’’Most people are just not ready to pay for something without obvious benefits.Michael Markley, co-owner of M. Markley Antiques, said sales had done better than expected; he has sold not only tables and cabinets but also an oriental rug.“It’s a hell of a dance to sell an oriental rug, especially on the internet,’’ Mr Markley said. “It takes a lot of hand-holding.’’He believes people buy antiques because they want something they can trust to hold its value, when even shares in blue-chip companies have disappointed. Also, antiques are functional, while other safe investments, such as gold, must sit in a vault or under the floorboards. And then there is the comfort they bring.“What we are selling are remnants of the past,’’ Mr Markley said. “The past was safe, and people could understand what was happening. That’s not [the case] now. It’s not clear what the future is going to be. There is a kind of longing for the past.’’He has been contacted by the interior designer for a boutique hotel in Miami to furnish 40 rooms, adding up to several years’ worth of sales. In spite of the pull of the past, he says: “Somebody has faith there is going to be a future in South Beach.’’However, George Corona, operating chief at Kelly Services, a temporary staff agency, has yet to see any increase in hiring, which is a leading indicator. People do not want to commit to taking on staff until they know the recovery is under way.That said, he explains that in this downturn companies have tended to reduce hours rather than let workers go. They are likely to give employees more hours before they hire additional, temporary staff, which could be why the rush to hire has yet to begin.For now, there is only one certainty: the ease with which one has been able to get a table at Tony’s in recent months is coming to an end.www.ft.com/recession"
742;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-06-08T17:45:54Z;McDonald’s benefits from budget-conscious climate;;McDonald’s, the world’s largest fast food chain, reported another strong month of sales in May, as its low-price menus continued to attract budget-conscious consumers in the US and Europe.The group’s global comparable sales rose 5.1 per cent year-on-year in May, supported by a 2.8 per cent increase in the US, and a 7.6 per cent increase in Europe. Comparable sales in Asia rose 6.4 per cent, in spite of weakness in China, where its western-style restaurants have lost out to cheaper, traditional competition.Before the recession hit the US last year, McDonald’s had already achieved a successful sales turnround after several years of slow or falling sales. But its business has strengthened further in the current economic climate, in which there has been robust growth in demand for low-cost fast food at a time when more expensive “family” restaurant chains such as Denny’s and Applebees have struggled.In the US, McDonald’s said sales had been boosted by the expansion of its McCafé espresso-based coffees as well as by demand for its regular burgers and french fries. The coffee programme, which is now being extended to regions in Europe, is part of an ongoing drive to increase morning and breakfast traffic at its more than 14,000 US restaurants.The low-cost McCafé programme is one of the factors behind a drive by coffee chain Starbucks to reinforce the value image of its more expensive cappuccinos and lattes with the most extensive marketing blitz in its history. Starbucks’ US comparable sales have been declining since the start of the downturn.In Europe, McDonald’s said sales growth had been supported by “everyday affordability initiatives”, as well as by efforts to extend sales into breakfast as well as lunch and evening. It said that it had seen “strong performance” in the UK, France, Germany and Russia.In spite of the strong sales growth, the company said that worldwide sales revenues for the month in dollar terms declined 0.4 per cent, due to the strengthening of the US currency, although overall sales were up 7 per cent.The company also warned investors that if the dollar continued at current levels, it would lead to a reduction in overall earnings of 8-9 cents in the second quarter compared with a year ago, and a 20 cent impact on earnings for the full year.McDonald’s shares were down more than 2 per cent at $58.52 at noon in New York on Monday.
743;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-06-08T17:37:27Z;McDonald’s continues to defy downturn;;McDonald’s, the world’s largest fast food chain, on Monday reported another strong month of sales in May as its low-price menus continued to attract budget-conscious consumers in the US and Europe.The group’s global comparable sales rose 5.1 per cent year-on-year in May, supported by a 2.8 per cent increase in the US, and a 7.6 per cent increase in Europe. Comparable sales in Asia rose 6.4 per cent, in spite of weakness in China, where its western-style restaurants have lost out to cheaper, traditional competition.Before the recession hit the US last year, McDonald’s had already achieved a successful sales turnround after several years of slow or falling sales. But its business has strengthened further in the current economic climate, in which there has been robust growth in demand for low-cost fast food at a time when more expensive “family” restaurant chains such as Denny’s and Applebees have struggled.In the US, McDonald’s said sales had been boosted by the national expansion of its McCafe espresso-based coffees as well as by its regular burgers and french fries.

744;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;McDonald’s set to mug Starbucks in Europe;;McDonald’s is aiming to overtake Starbucks as Europe’s biggest coffee chain, with plans to open several hundred McCafé stores selling pastries and cappuccinos this year.While Starbucks – which has 1,300 stores in Europe – has been scaling back on its European expansion, McDonald’s has ambitious growth plans for its branded cafes on the continent.The fast food chain wants to expand its chain of McCafés, which operate within or next to regular McDonald’s restaurants, to 1,200 in Europe by the end of the year.McDonald’s has yet to open any McCafés in the UK, where about half of Starbucks’ European stores are based.“We can become the biggest seller of coffee in Europe,” Jerome Tafani, chief financial officer for McDonald’s Europe, said.He added that McCafés were attracting new customers by creating a “cosy” atmosphere at the group’s restaurants and targeting people looking for breakfast on their way to work.The chains emerged in Australia in the early 1990s and were introduced to Europe in Ireland in 2002. Nearly half of Germany’s 1,200 McDonald’s restaurants today have McCafés, while some 20 per cent of restaurants in Russia and Italy have them. The chain is opening them in France and Austria.McDonald’s has installed coffee machines from high-end manufacturers in its McCafés in an effort to win over sceptics. It is selling different blends of coffee supplied by Kraft in each market to suit local tastes.Cappuccinos are priced at €2 to €2.50 ($2.80 to $3.50) per cup.The growth of the McCafé chain adds to a resurgence of fortunes at McDonald’s, which has seen sales for its core hamburgers and fries rise on the back of renewed demand from cash-poor consumers in the recession.McDonald’s has launched an advertising campaign in the US promoting its cappuccinos and lattes in its restaurants and drive-throughs.The group claimed its strategy of opening McCafés in existing restaurants in Europe – at a cost of €60,000 to €85,000 per café – allowed it to recoup its investment more quickly than Starbucks, helping it break into difficult markets such as Italy.“Our business case is not the same as Starbucks,” Mr Tafani said.
745;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-05-20T22:58:35Z;Target misses the mark;;Target, the US discount retailer, on Wednesday underlined how far it has slipped behind its larger rival Wal-Mart in the recessionary economy, which has fuelled its fierce proxy battle over board seats with Bill Ackman, the activist investor.The retailer said comparable sales at its 1,700 US stores fell by 3.7 per cent during the first quarter, compared with the 3.6 per cent increase reported by Wal-Mart’s 3,600 US stores last week.The results mark the fifth consecutive quarter in which Target’s sales growth has trailed Wal-Mart, starting in the winter of 2007 as the economy weakened. For the previous four years, Target’s sales growth regularly outperformed its rival.In another sign of the reversal of fortunes, Target also reported flat gross profit margins, as the mix of products its customers bought included a greater proportion of less profitable food, beauty and pharmacy items.Wal-Mart, in contrast, reported an improvement of 52 basis points in its profit margins as a result of selling more discretionary goods, such as clothing, electronics and home furnishings – categories in which Target outperformed Wal-Mart before the recession.Target argued on Wednesday that it was not losing customers to Wal-Mart or anyone else. Kathy Tesija, head of merchandising, said most of the declines in its business came from its most prosperous customers, who were making fewer discretionary spending trips, rather than spending money elsewhere.She said the company was continuing to focus on expanding food offerings – one of the areas highlighted in the campaign waged by Mr Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management – including introducing small fresh-food selections at up to 100 stores by the end of the year.Target’s net quarterly income fell 13 per cent to $522m, or 69 cents a share, a smaller decline than expected, sending its shares up more than 3 per cent.Its revenues were flat at about $14.8bn.It also said its credit card portfolio made a profit during the quarter and had outperformed larger credit card businesses – another area where its strategy has been criticised by Pershing.Mr Ackman is challenging the re-election of four Target directors at the annual meeting on May 28. On Tuesday, Risk­Metrics, the leading US proxy advisory service, recommended voting for two of Pershing’s candidates – Mr Ackman and Jim Donald, the ex-chief of Starbucks.
746;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Fresh support for Ackman in Target battle;;"Bill Ackman, the activist investor, has scored another victory in his battle to win seats on the board of Target, the discount retailer, after winning support from RiskMetrics, the leading US proxy adviser.RiskMetrics recommended on Tuesday that clients vote for Mr Ackman and Jim Donald, the former chief executive of the coffee chain Starbucks, in board elections at Target’s annual meeting on May 28, where four members are up for re-election.But Glass Lewis, another leading proxy adviser, said it was endorsing Target’s four nominees.Target said it was “disappointed” with RiskMetrics’ opinion. Gregg Steinhafel, chief executive, said in a statement: “We believe RiskMetrics reached the wrong conclusion …We urge Target shareholders not to cast their votes solely on the basis of RiskMetrics’ report and to undertake their own analysis.”D. F. King, the proxy solicitor working for Pershing Square, estimated that more than 40 per cent of Target’s institutional shareholders vote their shares with reference to RiskMetrics.RiskMetrics called the proxy battle “atypical”, given the experience of both sets of board nominees, and the fact its management “appears to be universally respected”. “Unlike the majority of other contests, the object of the dissident’s campaign is not a ‘broken’ company,” it said. But it argued Target’s board would “benefit from new blood and incentives to ensure the company is able to quickly capitalise on future opportunities”.It also highlighted Mr Ackman’s criticism of the low level of Target shares held by its board, and lengthening board tenures.It cited Mr Donald’s food retailing experience and Mr Ackman’s track record as an investor in endorsing them, but did not support the other three candidates nominated by Mr Ackman’s Pershing Square fund.In backing Target’s slate, Glass Lewis said it believed Mr Ackman remained focused on proposed real estate transactions that the board had rejected.It also raised Mr Donald’s troubles at Starbucks and questioned whether he was more suited to the board than Target’s nominee, Mary Dillon, McDonald’s global chief marketing officer.Other board members up for re-election are: Richard Kovacevich, chairman of Wells Fargo; George Tamke, a private equity investor; and Solomon Trujillo, chief executive of Telstra.Proxy Governance, a third adviser, last week recommended shareholders vote for two of Mr Ackman’s candidates: Mr Donald and Michael Ashner, a real estate executive."
747;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-05-15T12:13:17Z;First Person: Winter;;"In 1997, I was working as a computer programmer in the Dallas area and used to hang out in a Starbucks store near my apartment. I used to talk with the baristas and I got the idea of visiting every Starbucks in the world. I visited all the Starbucks in Dallas and in Houston; then I drove to Las Vegas and southern California. I had a lot of fun. From then on, I was totally committed to the project – although I didn’t realise how time-consuming it would be.I set up a few simple rules. At every Starbucks I visited, I wanted to drink a non-decaffeinated coffee. I would only worry about stores operated by the company or by a primary licensee. I also wanted to write a blog. When I started, Starbucks had about 1,500 stores. I was aware that the company was growing, but I didn’t anticipate how fast. A year after I started, I saw that the company had opened several new stores in areas I had already visited. It sounds stupid, but I hadn’t foreseen this happening. I realised then that my project might never end.Over the years, I’ve spent about $100,000 on my project and visited about 9,000 stores worldwide. On the road, I usually drink 10 coffees a day, and once I even drank 29. I felt awful.My parents were worried and asked me to focus on my job and save money. Some people supported me and gave me donations. Others said I was crazy and wasting my time. Starbucks released some neutral statements about me, but I wouldn’t like to be sponsored anyway. Look at the swimmer Michael Phelps and what happened after he was accused of smoking marijuana. I want to maintain my freedom.The first question people usually ask is: why? Why am I spending so much time and money? Visiting every Starbucks in the world is an abstract goal with no concrete meaning. You could almost call it meaningless. But I feel more at peace with myself since I started. Before, I worked 60 to 70 hours a week and spent the rest of the time hanging out at Starbucks. Sometimes I suffered from depression and spent days in bed. I wasn’t working towards anything.The Starbucks project gave me a goal. I had an idea that was unique – nobody else was doing it. It was a goal that I had defined for myself and nobody had imposed it on me. I want to stand out and do things differently. That’s why I feel satisfied. Besides that, I also enjoy the lifestyle. Sometimes I work as a contractor to earn money, but I spend the rest of the time on the road. Before 1997, I had never done a road trip on my own and I discovered how much I enjoy driving around, seeing new cities, new sites, new people. The project also fits with my collector’s instinct. As a kid, I collected baseball cards, coins and comics. Today, I collect Starbucks stores.The project made me realise how little I need in life. I don’t need a stationary home, I don’t need possessions, I don’t need certain people around me. When I’m on the road, I sleep in the back of my hatchback. People wonder if it is comfortable, but it’s good enough for me – and a lot more spacious than Japanese mini-hotels.I’ve had several girlfriends and flings since the project started, but it’s hard to combine a relationship with my mobile lifestyle. I rarely feel lonely, and I don’t want to make any sacrifices. I wouldn’t change my route just to see my girlfriend. An attachment is also a limitation. The less you need, the freer you are.Because of the recession, Starbucks is closing branches. For me, this is horrible because I don’t have enough resources to see all the stores before they close. But if Starbucks realises it wasn’t a good idea to grow so quickly, I will reach a point where I will have seen most of the stores and will only occasionally travel to visit new ones. It will give me more time to focus on other hobbies."
748;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
749;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-05-14T23:05:08Z;Target’s rebel investors win proxy support;;"Target, the US discount retailer, has suffered a setback in its efforts to stave off a challenge to its board by activist investor Bill Ackman, after a leading proxy advisory services endorsed two of the dissident candidates.Proxy Governance recommended that its clients vote for two of the five nominees supported by Mr Ackman’s Pershing Square funds – Jim Donald, the former chief executive of Starbucks, and Michael Ashner, a real estate executive.It also advocated voting against Target’s proposal to reduce the size of its board from 13 to 12 members. Since shareholders have to choose between two competing proxy ballot cards, it argued that they should only return the Pershing Square card, in effect withholding votes from Target’s four nominees for re-election.Target has proposed the re-election of Mary Dillon, chief global marketing officer of McDonald’s; Richard Kovacevich, chairman of Wells Fargo; Solomon Trujillo, chief executive of Telstra; and George Tamke, a private equity executive.Target has accused Mr Ackman of launching a proxy campaign for board seats in order to advance what it calls his “risky” real estate restructuring proposals that the Target board rejected last year.Mr Ackman’s proxy battle has unusually focused not on the performance of Target’s management, which he has repeatedly commended, but on the make-up of the board, accusing it of being “isolated” and insufficiently independent.Proxy Governance’s recommendations suggest that Mr Ackman’s focus on the composition, expertise and length of incumbency of the existing board has been effective.“The real strength in the dissident campaign…lies in the nominees,” the firm said, arguing that their professional experience “seem to be under-represented in the board as currently composed”.“We believe that Jim Donald, with retail grocery experience, and Michael Ashner, with commercial real estate experience, would add meaningfully to the board’s ability to assess and meet emerging strategic challenges in these two aspects of the company’s operations,” it added.Target said it was disappointed by the recommendation but highlighted positive comments made by Proxy Governance about its existing board. It also drew attention to the recommendation of a smaller proxy advisory firm, Egan-Jones, that had recommended supporting two of the four sitting board members up for re-election, and none of Pershing’s candidates.“We are pleased that ProxyGovernance recognises the vision and nerve of the Target board of directors in its report and we welcome the support of Egan-Jones,” a spokesman said.RiskMetrics, another leading US proxy advisory firm, has yet to give its opinion on the contest and held an open forum for the two sides on Thursday. During the event, Gregg Steinhafel, Target’s chief executive, repeated the retailer’s view that a change in the board was not necessary, “nor in the best interest of our shareholders”.Target’s shareholders are due to vote on the board at the company’s annual meeting on May 28."
750;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-05-11T16:24:22Z;Coffee has grounds for optimism;;Call it a caffeine rush, but the growth of coffee shops shows no sign of being dragged down by the recessionary gloom on the UK’s high streets. Openings are up and prices are kept high.Allegra Strategies, which is holding a coffee industry summit next week, estimates that there are now 3,712 branded coffee outlets across the country, an increase of 3.7 per cent on last October and 6.4 per cent on the year.The rush to set up is being led by Costa Coffee, Starbucks and Caffè Nero. Costa alone added more than 150 outlets across the UK last year and plans to open another 100 in the coming 12 months.John Derkach, Costa’s managing director, said: “There are lots of parts of the country where people cannot get Costa Coffee.“More people are going because the coffee shop experience is enormous value for money. For a couple of pounds you can get 45 minutes of peace and quiet in a nice environment.”Upmarket independents are also enjoying good times.The queue outside Monmouth Coffee Company on Borough Market in south London snakes out of the door most mornings, despite the management’s decision to keep its prices high at £2.30 ($3.50) for a basic cup of cappuccino.Sean, who comes in every morning, said: “This is my daily pampering.”James Hoffman, the 2007 world barista champion, started Square Mile Coffee last June to supply independent coffee shops across London with superior blends. It recorded its first monthly profit just nine months later.“We only work with people who are willing to put the effort into serving a good cup of coffee,” Mr Hoffman said. “That is a small percentage of the independent market.”Greg Feehely, head of research at Altium Securities, claimed the British were now “hooked” on their daily brew.“People might not buy a new car or washing machine but they will keep buying their coffee,” he explained.This is not to say that the market is not difficult for standard shops, which have found themselves squeezed between the upmarket independents and the large chains. The big losers are the “greasy spoons”, pubs and independent cafés who sell an average cup of coffee for an average price, according to Mr Feehely.“The pubs should have moved with the times,” he noted. “One of the reasons that this £1bn coffee industry emerged is that the pub market didn’t keep pace.”Those in the coffee business are also not immune to the credit crunch, however.Alan Wright and his wife Linda, owners of Calypso Coffee, have been supplying coffee shops across the country with beans and machines for the past decade from their base in Norfolk.Sales are up 20 per cent this year and they are seeking planning permission to treble their workshop and showroom to 3,000 sq ft.However, profits are down because the Wrights have been forced to provide financing for customers that have been refused loans to buy coffee machines.“I actually do the funding for the bank,” Mr Wright said.
751;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-05-10T21:30:33Z;Ackman steps up Target seat battle;;"Bill Ackman, the billionaire hedge fund investor, will on Monday step up his campaign to win seats on the board of Target, the discount retailer, in one of the largest and most expensive proxy battles in US corporate history.Unusually, the battle over one of America’s best-known store chains is focused on the quality and composition of the incumbent board, rather than management performance.At an open meeting for investors in New York, Mr Ackman will argue that a lack of relevant expertise among independent board members has contributed to Target’s underperforming its larger rival Wal-Mart during the current recession.“This is not a poorly managed company,” he told the Financial Times in an interview. “This is really just about improving the board.”Mr Ackman, whose Pershing Square funds control 7.8 per cent of Target shares, is also highlighting the length of the incumbency of board members. Three of the four Target directors are up for re-election, having served a decade or more. Solomon TrujIllo, outgoing chief executive of Telstra, has been on Target’s board for 15 years.“Is he the single best person that should be renewed for another three years? But they put him up anyway because they’ve been friends for years and they don’t want to say, ‘It’s time for you to step off’,” Mr Ackman said.Target has about 1,700 stores across the US and is roughly three times the size by market capitalisation of Heinz, the food group at which Nelson Peltz, the activist investor, won a bitter proxy contest in 2006.Mr Ackman says he expects his contest to cost Pershing Square about $15m. Each time information has been sent out to shareholders it has cost $1.6m.Pershing Square is pressing shareholders to elect to Target’s board Mr Ackman and four others: Jim Donald, former Starbucks chief; Richard Vague, co-founder of First USA bank; Michael Ashner, a real estate executive; and Ron Gilson, an academic who specialises in corporate governance.Mr Ackman, who has waged shareholder campaigns at McDonald’s, Wendy’s, and at Ceridian, the payroll processing group, took a stake in Target two years ago. Last year the company rejected his proposals to restructure its real estate holdings.Target has told its shareholders it believes Pershing Square is attacking its board “in an effort to divert attention from [its] risky real estate agenda”."
752;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Dear Economist: Should I pay more for a guilt-free smoke?;;"I notice that my tobacco packet includes merely a helpline number for people who want to quit, and not a grotesque picture of someone in the advanced stages of a smoking-related disease. This leads me to conclude that I might be prepared to pay more for my tobacco if its legally required guilt trips were in text form rather than pictures. Am I on to something?
Ms Lovegrove, OxfordDear Ms Lovegrove,I think you just might be. The pictures you describe are a form of “product sabotage”, a tactic used by companies with some pricing power. Some customers are very sensitive to price while others pay less attention to it. The sensible business, then, will try to separate the two groups and charge them different prices for similar products. This can be easier if the cheaper product is given some additional defect that the price-sensitive customer will swallow and the price-blind customer will not.Examples abound. Tesco Value products are cheap, but the packaging reminds me of an emergency food drop from the United Nations. The “short cappuccino” from Starbucks is cheap – and not advertised on the menu. Most software packages have a cheaper version in which features are disabled at the vendor’s expense. Some hardware does, too.The government could allow the sale of tobacco under two different conditions: the current version, with tax and disturbing pictures, and a “guilt-free” version with no pictures but a higher tax. The effect would be something to test, but I would expect school children and the poor to choose the traditional version, while older and more affluent smokers would buy the premium version. I would guess that with two different schemes available, the government should be able to discourage more smokers while also raising extra cash.Or perhaps I am just smoking something.Questions to economist@ft.com"
753;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-05-06T19:15:29Z;Retail suppliers chase the value in a shift to thrift;;"Starbucks this week launched an advertising campaign in US newspapers as the first blast in what will be a long-term multimillion dollar effort by the coffee chain to put some froth back into customer demand.Under the slogan, “It’s not just coffee. It’s Starbucks”, the advertisements are an implicit challenge to cheaper espresso-based drinks offered by fast food chains such as McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts. The campaign highlights the company’s employment and sourcing policies as well as the quality of its brew, claiming “anything less is going to leave a bad taste in your mouth”.Starbucks is not the only company arguing that “value” goes beyond price. Producers of such mundane items as nappies, kitchen towels and toilet paper are also focusing on “performance-based value metrics”, telling customers that their products work better, even if they do cost more.Amid a global recession and a much tighter availability of consumer credit than in recent years, almost everyone’s customers are adopting different habits from before – shopping at lower- priced stores such as Wal-Mart or Aldi to save money, using more discount coupons and buying retailers’ own-brand products instead of branded goods from companies such as Procter & Gamble and Unilever. In the US, for one, sales of low-cost macaroni cheese dinners are up; sales of bottled water are down.“The consumer has changed. He has to make ends meet at the end of the month,” says Paul Bulcke, chief executive of Switzerland’s Nestlé. “We have to show empathy.”But for consumer companies the question is whether these changes are merely temporary. At a macroeconomic level, most analysts expect US consumers to continue saving more and paying down debt, with a likely knock-on effect on their consumption. The US personal savings rate in March was running at 4.2 per cent, compared with a 1.8 per cent average in 2008. Chris Donnelly, a partner in Accenture’s US retail practice, notes that the historical level of US savings is about 7 per cent, suggesting it is returning to more sustainable levels.Although opinion remains divided over whether this will translate into a long-term change in shopping behaviour, a growing consensus within the marketing industry accepts that the focus on “value” will persist.Patrick Coveney, chief executive of Greencore, the Irish group that is the UK’s biggest manufacturer of sandwiches and own-label chilled meals, says: “Even when the economy picks up, you will still see some resilience in terms of value offerings.”At EuroRSCG Worldwide, the marketing company, Andrew Benett argues: “The pendulum is swinging back very rapidly to the consumer we once knew about two generations ago …smart and savvy, not necessarily because they had to be but because they knew it was the right thing to do.”Joan Lewis, head of consumer and market research at Procter & Gamble, expects that in both developing and developed markets, some of the changes seen will remain “for a long time”. In particular, she says the downturn is likely to accelerate a global trend towards “consumer engagement” – people asking more questions as they seek to assess for themselves the value of the products before them.“I think the economic crisis has accelerated trends towards consumer self-reliance,” she says, “People do not have as much trust in institutions.”EuroRSCG has also been telling its clients that customers feel “betrayed by the institutions we trusted most”, leading to pressure for businesses to be more transparent. The trend towards “engagement” is likely to influence everything from packaging and labelling to the growth of peer reviews on websites, the marketing group predicts.But Mr Donnelly at Accenture argues against those who claim that this recession is going to have the same kind of long-term impact on the habits of future generations as the Great Depression in the 1930s, which supposedly instilled the quality of thrift and a fear of scarcity into the subsequent few generations. Modern consumers, he says, have become accustomed to a culture of consumption” and are surrounded by far more powerful marketing forces – including those currently stressing the “value” of paying more for coffee or kitchen towels.Some US companies continue to profit from the US consumer’s appetite for new products even in hard times. Colgate-Palmolive launched a disposable breath-freshening mini-toothbrush system in March that took 3 per cent of the total toothbrush market in the last week of the month. A Colgate liquid soap product, Softsoap Spa, launched with the tag “affordable style for every sink”, increased the company’s overall liquid soap market share in March, although it is more expensive than private label alternatives.McDonald’s is also banging the value drum in product launches such as Little Tasters, which in Europe include wraps and hamburgers at €1.50-€2.50. It sees the downturn as an opportunity to take market share from more expensive food chains, including Starbucks in coffee. To this end, it is opening hundreds of McCafes (which sell cappuccinos and pastries to attract people looking for breakfast on the run).“Companies around the world have become very adept at marketing and convincing people in various ways that they need to consume,” says Mr Donnelly. “Never underestimate the savviness of modern marketers and their ability to separate people from their money.”"

But most agree that a good start towards a dream job, deal or love is a winning smile. Hence perhaps the continued resilience of Colgate-Palmolive, polisher of the world’s grins.The maker of toothpaste and soap on Thursday reported first-quarter earnings which illustrate that point. While the strength of the dollar knocked overall sales – only a fifth of turnover is now taken at home – volumes were flat and profits higher than a year ago. Colgate achieved that through a combination of higher prices – for instance pushing through a rise of 16 per cent in Latin America, its largest market – and lower costs. Like fellow consumer goods heavyweight Procter & Gamble, also reporting results on Thursday, Colgate has been able to cut its advertising costs as the recession deepens.However, while P&G is struggling with consumers trading down, Colgate operates mainly in areas where private-label penetration is relatively low. Indeed, P&G pointed to central and eastern Europe as among the hardest hit areas. Colgate, meanwhile, is taking toothpaste market share and increasing volumes in Russia.In fact, the only real concern is the long-term effect of cutting advertising and promotion budgets. Investors should be wary of earnings today that come at the expense of future returns. Colgate maintains it will benefit from lower spending by competitors, greater on-shelf marketing and the fact that advertising dollars go much further this year thanks to the troubles of the media industry. But turning the screws now while competitors are struggling would be one way to raise future profits.Even so, Colgate’s dividend yield, at 2.8 per cent, is at its most generous since 1993. The group trades with the market on just 14 times forward earnings, its lowest valuation since 1990. That should bring a smile to the face of any investor looking for value.There was mixed news for consumer companies, as weak sales at rivals Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive subtracted from stronger than expected results at both Starbucks and Kellogg.Procter & Gamble, which makes consumer products from Head & Shoulders to Pringles crisps, reported better profits than analysts’ estimates and reaffirmed its full year profits outlook. But its shares fell as it warned that full-revenues might come in below expectations as the company foresaw another quarter of destocking by retailers.Colgate-Palmolive reported rising profits which were in line with Wall Street’s expectations. The company successfully raised its prices and cut its costs to report earnings of $0.97 a share, but its stock fell as sales remained weak.Starbucks also beat analysts’ expectations as efforts to slash costs compensated for an 8 per cent fall in revenue. The company has come under pressure for customers from cheaper retailers such as McDonald’s and Dunkin Donuts, but its shares rallied on Thursday as Howard Schultz, its chief executive, promised a marketing campaign focusing on value.Kellogg was another company involved in food to suffer falling sales during the first three months of the year, but its cereal division showed some strength, helping its profits rise.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

755;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Chrysler failure sparks rally for Ford and GM;;US stocks gave up early gains on Thursday afternoon after President Barack Obama announced car maker Chrysler was to file for bankruptcy protection.The news triggered a one per cent fall in equities as investors worried about the effect on the wider economy.But the benchmark S&P 500 closed the month with a gain of 9.4 per cent, the best month since March 2000.Other troubled carmakers benefited from Chrysler’s news, with investors betting they were now more likely to survive. GM picked up 6.1 per cent to $1.92 while Ford gained 9.7 per cent to $5.98.But some analysts warned the bankruptcy could prove a turning point in the recent rally. “The market has absorbed some bad economic news recently, but you could see a pull back after a major event like today’s,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com.Earlier in the day, several better-than-expected earnings announcements had led a strong rally. Industrial group Dow Chemical led the materials sector ahead of every other on the S&P after reporting a surprise profit as spending controls helped the company overcome falling sales. Its shares jumped 18.4 per cent to $16.The S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent lower at 872.81 points and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.2 per cent lower at 8,168.12 points. But the Nasdaq Composite index rose 0.3 per cent to 1,717.30 points.Banks had gained earlier after a bullish note from Anthony Bolton, president of investments at Fidelity International, on the position of banks to lead equities out of the slump. But after the news on Chrysler, they fell back. Citigroup closed 2.2 per cent down at $3.05, while JPMorgan lost 4.3 per cent to $33.The early gains came amid mixed economic data, as personal income and spending both fell more sharply than predicted. But investors were buoyed by figures showing the number of people claiming jobless benefits continued to fall for the first time last week, even though the number continuing to claim such benefits reached a new record high.“It seems like we have turned a corner this week,” said Ian Griffiths, a dealer at CMC Markets. “There has been some pretty bad news, which the market has ignored to remain bullish.”There was also mixed news for consumer stocks, as weak sales at rivals Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive countered better-than-expected results at Starbucks and Kellogg.P&G and Colgate both met or beat analysts expectations with first-quarter profits. However, investors fretted over falling sales at each, and P&G lost 1.9 per cent to $49.44 while Colgate dropped 1.2 per cent to $59.Starbucks beat expectations as cost cuts compensated for sliding sales. The company has come under pressure from cheaper retailers, but its shares rallied on Thursday as chief executive Howard Schultz promised a marketing campaign focusing on value. The shares rose 5.6 per cent to $14.46.Kellogg also saw falling sales, but its cereal division showed strength, lifting profits and sending its stock up 6.6 per cent to $42.11.Changes to the number of people watching television led to mixed results for Comcast, the cable TV provider and Viacom, the media group that owns the MTV network.Comcast added subscribers and raised profits, helping to lift its share price 1.4 per cent to $15.46.Viacom found its viewing numbers under pressure though, which, added to slowing revenues from advertising, and saw the company report falling revenues and profits. But the market had predicted even worse and its shares picked up 5 per cent to $20.66.Meanwhile, Visareported rising revenues as more customers used the company’s debit cards. Cost cuts also helped boost profits above the level analysts had predicted and its shares gained 2.3 per cent to $64.96.There was good news for Expedia, the online travel agency, which has suffered recently as investors feared the outbreak of swine flu would discourage travel, after it announced its profits had not fallen as far as expected. Its shares surged 28.5 per cent to $13.61.ExxonMobil, the world’s largest publicly-traded company, reported lower profits than expected, as the recession weighed on demand for oil. Exxon shares fell 2.6 per cent to $66.67.
756;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-04-30T15:27:50Z;Banks and earnings fuel optimism on Wall St;;Wall Street continued rising above the three month high set during the previous session on Thursday morning after another bullish analyst note on banks added a sheen to several better-than-expected earnings announcements.Industrial group Dow Chemical led the materials sector ahead of every other on the benchmark S&P 500 index after reporting a surprise profit as low materials costs and tight spending controls helped the company overcome worse sales than expected. Its shares jumped 18.2 per cent to $15.97.Banks added to the earnings optimism after Anthony Bolton, the UK-based executive at Fidelity International, said he thought the recent equity market gains marked a bull market rather than a bear market rally. He added that beaten-down financials could lead the way out of the slump. This came the day after Fox-Pitt Kelton said any dilution to shareholder value resulting from capital raising following the government’s stress tests on the banks was already priced into banks’ shares.Citigroup gained 2.9 per cent to $3.21. Meanwhile Bank of America, where Ken Lewis was replaced as chairman on Wednesday night while keeping his role as chief executive, rose 4.3 per cent to $9.05.In the first half-hour of trade, the S&P 500 rose 1.3 per cent to 884.86, while the Dow gained 1.2 per cent to 8,281.94 points and those the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 1.9 per cent to 1,743.69 points.The gains came amid mixed economic news, as personal income and spending both fell more sharply than predicted.

But its shares fell as it warned that full-revenues might come in below expectations as the company foresaw another quarter of destocking by retailers. The stock lost 3.5 per cent to $48.64.Colgate-Palmolive gained however, after reporting rising profits which were in line with Wall Street’s expectations. The company successfully raised its prices and cut its costs to report earnings of $0.97 per share, but its stock fell as sales remained weak, losing 1.2 per cent to $59.Starbucks also beat analysts’ expectations as efforts to slash costs compensated for an 8 per cent fall in revenue. The company has come under pressure for customers from cheaper retailers such as McDonald’s and Dunkin Donuts, but its shares rallied on Thursday as Howard Schultz, its chief executive, promised a marketing campaign focusing on value.

Comcast was able to add subscribers and boost profits, helping to raise its share price 5.8 per cent to $16.13.Viacom found its viewing numbers under pressure though, which, added to slowing revenues from advertising, saw the company report falling revenues and profits. But the market had predicted even worse from the group and its shares picked up 3.2 per cent to $22.43.Meanwhile, Visa, the credit card company, reported rising revenues as more customers used the company’s debit cards. Cost cuts also helped boost profits above the level analysts had predicted and its shares gained 3.8 per cent to $65.90.Health insurer Aflac also beat estimates, with a 20 per cent rise in profits being helped by the strength in the yen. The company, which gets most of its revenue from Japan, has fallen over 36 per cent this year as Wall Street worries about the quality of its investments. The shares rose however, gaining 1.3 per cent to $29.50.There was good news for travel stocks, which have suffered recently as investors feared the outbreak of swine flu would discourage people from travelling, after Expedia, the online travel agency, announced its profits had not fallen as far as expected. Its shares surged 24.7 per cent to $13.21.But Exxon Mobil, the world’s largest publicly traded company, fell after reporting lower profits than expected, as the recession translated into falling demand for oil. With oil prices also falling back from the previous session, the company gave up 1.3 per cent to $67.53.European stocks were up early on Wall Street, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index gaining 2.1 per cent to 833.50 points. Asian equity markets closed mainly up, as the FTSE Asia-Pacific index rose 3.5 per cent to 172.10 points.Bond yields were lower, with the yield on the two-year Treasury note falling 3 basis point to 0.922 per cent and that on the 10-year Treasury note losing 1bp to 3.1 per cent.The dollar was mixed against major currencies early in New York, and lost 0.5 per cent against the yen to $0.0102.Gold was trading $1.57 lower at $883.88 per troy ounce.Oil prices were down early in New York. US crude prices were $0.35 lower at $50.62 a barrel.
757;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks gloom continues;Comparable sales drop 8 per cent;Starbucks, the global coffee-shop chain, on Wednesday reported further falls in comparable sales amid the global recession, but said its efforts to improve operating margins were beginning to take effect.The retailer said comparable sales fell by 8 per cent during its second quarter, following last year’s 9 per cent drop, due to a 5 per cent decline in the number of customer visits and a 3 per cent decline in average transactions.Net sales fell 7 per cent to $2.3bn, while net earnings fell to $25m, from $108.7m, or 3 cents per share, due in part to the impact of $152.1m of restructuring charges. However, the company said it was encouraged by the stabilisation of its operating margins, excluding charges, at 8.4 per cent, and said it was making “good progress” towards its goal of cutting costs this year by $500m.Starbucks announced plans earlier this year to close 800 underperforming US stores, while pulling out of Australia and closing 100 stores in the UK and Canada, as it struggles with slumping global demand and the affects of its previously rapid expansion.During the quarter, Starbucks closed 123 US company-operated stores, bringing to 507 the number closed in the US this year. It has also pulled out of Australia, where it had 61 stores and closed another 64 international stores.Its difficulties were aggravated during the quarter by the impact of the stronger US dollar on its international operations, which contributed to a 12 per cent fall in international revenues to $433.7m.International revenues were also affected by a three per cent decline in comparable store sales, due to a two per cent decline in the number of transactions and a one per cent decrease in the average value per transaction.It sales of packaged coffee to supermarkets and other retailers also declined, due to discounting and lower orders from retailers.
758;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-04-28T21:00:37Z;Stop making excuses and get started;;"In my travels, I meet quite a few would-be entrepreneurs. Some of these characters have a vision of starting or buying a business, but always seem to find reasons to do nothing. Their excuses as to why they have not created an enterprise sound convincing, but in truth none of them really stands up to close examination.First on the list tends to be a lack of capital. There are lots of solutions to this one. My first business, when I was 18, was a venture with an Oxford nightclub where student friends and I promoted themed evenings and took the door money, while the venue owners kept the bar takings. The operation needed no capital at all – always the best type for absolute beginners.Other situations may need some funding, but often less than founders think. I am often impressed at how first-time restaurateurs seem to fit out premises on a shoestring – using second-hand equipment, helping out themselves with the refurbishment and so on.Most things can be done on a budget if your life’s dream depends on it. And even now there is equity backing out there. There are all sorts of pockets of institutional and private cash for a sound project, from government agencies to angel investors. It has never been easy to tap these sources of finance, so you need to be good – and persistent. Howard Schultz, founder of Starbucks, did more than 250 presentations to raise the early-stage funding to really kick-start his coffee bar chain.A second imagined obstacle is income: people get addicted to a nice safe salary as an employee, and are unwilling to give it up for the uncertainties of the entrepreneurial life. It is true that plenty of the self-employed earn less than they would working for others – and may put in longer hours. But they do it because of the freedom and fulfilment it brings – and because they refuse to give up on their hopes.During my early 20s I took little time off – when I wasn’t working for others, I ran sideline businesses at weekends and during holidays – until I felt able to finally break free and become a full-time entrepreneur. In some ways I wished I had not delayed, but had taken the plunge straight from university.I accept that there are those who have heavy domestic responsibilities – a mortgage, family obligations and so forth. But anything really worth having requires sacrifice – do you want to deny yourself opportunities and live a life of regrets? Right now many are facing redundancy, so there may not be any salary coming in anyway – what have you got to lose?A third reason is the idea: too many wannabe entrepreneurs are waiting for a breakthrough concept to arrive one day, fully formed and ready to launch. But capitalism is not like that.Most new businesses do something pretty similar to many others – they provide familiar services or products, fulfilling a definite demand – with perhaps an incremental improvement. You do not need an earth-shattering invention to achieve success.Those triumphs are rare, and usually happen after immense heartache. What you want is a solid proposition that generates sales and cash quickly, using the skills you already possess, with economics you understand, and serving a known market.A fourth reason is risk aversion. Too many people fear failure more than they want to win. Of course, your start-up might prove a vain attempt at the prize, so you may lose money, time and pride. But 2009 is, in fact, a great time to fail. All around us companies and institutions are going wrong, including many of the world’s largest and grandest. Everyone who has achieved much has suffered setbacks. And you know what? No one really notices or cares. As Confucius said: “Our greatest glory lies not in never failing, but in rising every time we fail.”I predict that many great companies will be started in the next year or two, by those brave enough to believe in the future, energetic enough to seize the day and optimistic enough to deny the possibility of defeat.There is never a perfect time to begin the journey. But if you have ambition and are willing to apply the effort, stop making excuses – get out there and start battling.lukej@riskcapitalpartners.co.uk

759;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-04-27T21:48:20Z;Entertainment limited to humble pie;;Over the past decade, there have been some truly spectacular examples of expensed lunchtime excess, including a group of Barclays Capital bankers who managed to spend £44,000 on lunch at Petrus in London’s Knightsbridge to celebrate a deal. There have been stories of bottles of wine priced in the high thousands and financiers spraying venues with bottles of vintage champagne, Formula One style – meaning you pay for not only the fizz, but also the cleaning bill. And, across the board, especially in London, £100 ($146) a head for lunch started to seem unexceptional.But in these more austere times, what is appropriate when it comes to business lunches? Should you be heading to Petrus for à la carte or trading down to Pret a Manger for sandwiches? Is a £2 coffee at Starbucks the new £100 lunch?The banks are cagey about their lunching policies. Several say they still entertain clients over lunch and that they have always had spending guidelines – the main difference is that now they are enforcing them.A similar attitude of prandial pragmatism prevails in the professional service industries. “It’s certainly more moderate and we’re seeing a lower key approach to corporate hospitality,” says Simon Johnston, senior partner at the law firm Nabarro. “We’re not stopping – it’s an important time to be talking to clients and contacts, and you need to get out. But you have to be sensitive too. If someone down the corridor’s just lost their job, then big ticket stuff feels very inappropriate.”Mr Johnson adds that Nabarro now makes far more use of its in-house dining room, and that one big plus of this is that, unlike with restaurants, confidentiality is assured.At M&C Saatchi, client entertainment budgets have been cut by about 30 per cent. But Moray McLennan, the advertising agency’s chief executive, defends lunches as a relatively cost-effective way of nurturing client relationships – far more so than events such as Wimbledon. He adds that the easiest way to keep lunches relatively economic, wherever you dine, is to drink in moderation.“In a relationship business it’s hugely important to get into an environment where you can have a conversation,” he explains. “Of course, it does depend on who’s doing the entertaining and I wouldn’t encourage everyone to go to Scott’s. But the worst thing you can do is act like a rabbit caught in the headlights – you have to be out there and you have to be visible.”These views are borne out by research by expense management firm GlobalExpense. “If we’re talking about entertaining clients, it’s still going pretty strong,” says David Vine, the managing director. “But sales meetings have been knocked on the head and staff entertaining is way down.”The other changes he has seen are sectoral: “Financial services still seems to be going pretty strong, but we’ve seen a significant tightening of belts in retail.”Mr Vine says that one rather radical development he has seen recently is the naming and shaming of those who abuse their expenses.However, while many businesses may still be willing to entertain clients, there is a question over whether their clients will be as receptive, says Mike Atherton, managing director of mobile travel service provider Mantic Point. “We haven’t cut down on our lunching. But the thing I have noticed is that getting into customers’ or prospects’ diaries to have lunch is harder.” Most people, he says, are working harder in the downturn, and taking a couple of hours for lunch can be difficult. “It can be a lot easier to go for a sandwich or a coffee.”Of course, for those who are lunching, there are some fabulous deals available, even at Michelin-starred restaurants – and getting a table is a lot easier than it once was.“Caring for clients in tough times will not be forgotten,” advises Robin Jay, author of The Art of the Business Lunch. However, she acknowledges that the cost both in terms of time and expenditure can be onerous when budgets are cut to the bone. If this is the case, she says “the answer is simple: take your clients out for breakfast instead”.
760;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-04-26T18:28:05Z;Masks go on in Mexico City as flu fear strikes;;"María Isabel Guzmán Guardarrama knows better than anyone that only the most extreme of events can derail Mexicans’ eating habits.In normal times, she presides over a thriving Sunday stall on the corner of a Mexico City neighbourhood that sells borrego, a local delicacy in which an entire sheep is boiled, chopped and then wrapped in greasy cornflour pancakes with chilli, cilantro and plenty of onion.But on Sunday morning, the outbreak of a new type of influenza virus that has claimed the lives of up to 81 people so far has stemmed the typical torrent of customers to a trickle.“I’ve been here for 25 years and this has never happened before,” she says from behind a white surgical mask.“If it carries on like this we are going to have to give away a lot of food at the end of the day.”All over Mexico City, one of the world’s biggest metropolitan areas, people are changing their routines on fears that the virus, a hybrid of animal and human flu types that specialists have never encountered before, may infect them.Beatriz Ceveño and her partner are one of the few couples who have ventured out to Antara Polanco, a normally bustling shopping centre filled with Sony, Nike and other brand-name stores.But they look far from happy as they wrestle with an unwieldy combination of Starbucks coffee and face masks.“This is very uncomfortable,” concedes Ms Ceveño, a bank employee.The centre-right administration of President Felipe Calderón has called for calm and has reassured Mexico’s population of about 108m that it is taking all necessary precautions.On Saturday, José Angel Córdova formally declared a state of alert as the number of deaths from flu-related illnesses rose from 68 to 81, with a further 1,324 reported cases.All schools from kindergartens to universities in three states, including the capital, will now be closed until May 6 – a measure that will affect millions of Mexico City’s predominantly young population.Public events, including political meetings and even football matches, have been cancelled. Sunday’s two big soccer games in the capital will now be played before empty terraces for the first time.On Saturday, only the Catholic Church seemed adamant that things would continue uninterrupted.Later that day, however, Mr Córdova extended
the quarantine measures
to include even mass.The fears have prompted a run on surgical face masks, and by Saturday morning many pharmacies were reporting that stocks had run out. At VYR Moliere, a drug store in the Polanco neighbourhood, one employee said they had sold 3,000 masks in less than a day.At the Sanborns department store across the road, it was the same story. Jessica Murrillo, who works at the pharmacy counter, said that their stock of 200 masks sold in a matter of minutes on Friday evening. “We’ve never sold so many of them,” she said.To compensate for the shortfall, members of Mexico’s armed forces and federal police on Friday began distributing 2m face masks at various points around the capital.That night, hundreds of teenagers mingled on the street after receiving their masks together with the news that a concert by The Rasmus, a Finnish rock group, had been cancelled."
761;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-04-23T18:50:21Z;A deal to organise;;"The Cintas commercial laundry in Islip, on New York’s Long Island, stands in a typical modern American landscape – a neat brick building in a nondescript business park adjacent to a shopping mall, with neighbours including a database analysis company and a manufacturer of bathroom fittings.Only the small signs in the parking lot, warning against “trespass, solicitation, or distribution of literature”, indicate that Cintas, a business services company, is also the focus of a big national organising effort launched six years ago by the Unite Here union.“I want to be in a union because a union would bring us many benefits and a sense of security, where my voice counts,” says Adela Viera, one of the laundry’s workers, speaking in Spanish during an interview at a nearby Starbucks. Ms Viera earns about $9.80 (£6.70, €7.50) an hour after working at the Islip laundry for almost 12 years.She and her fellow workers – washing and folding uniforms in pursuit of the American Dream – could also be in the vanguard of a revival of the US labour movement, if new efforts in Congress to strengthen the ability of unions to organise become law. “Getting a reform of labour law, restoring workers’ rights to organise, is essential for the country, the economy and the labour movement,” says Bruce Raynor, general president of Unite Here.Unionisation has been falling since the 1940s, in line with the decline in traditional manufacturing industries. Only one in eight of the workforce is these days a member; in the private sector it is one in 12. But trade unions spent hundreds of millions of dollars to support Democrats at last year’s elections and, with their party now controlling Congress and the White House, they see it as payback time.Mr Raynor argues that reforms envisaged by a labour bill before Congress, relaxing constraints on a union’s ability to secure recognition in a workplace, would lead to an “explosive growth” in union membership among workers such as Ms Viera in the service sector, as well as in manufacturing, distribution and retailing. If it is passed, unions and big business agree, the change would be the most substantial since 1947, when the 1935 Depression-era labour relations act was amended for the postwar environment.But employers are arguing that US business cannot afford to deal with union demands at a time of economic crisis – an argument that has found some traction with wavering congressional Democrats (see below).Blanche Lincoln, a Democrat from Wal-Mart’s home state of Arkansas and a previous supporter of the bill, said this month that now was not the time to pass it. “Now that we need all hands on deck, including business and labour, to get our economy moving again, this issue is dividing us,” she added.Amid the recession, unions even in the most strongly organised sectors find themselves under greater than usual pressure. One test will come at General Motors, the beleaguered carmaker, whose unions are being asked to accept reduced benefits.Yet the debate also comes at a time when public anger at the excesses of corporate America is prompting wider sympathy for trade unions. Employers in less unionised industries are therefore nervous about the implications.The proposed legislation – dubbed the Employee Free Choice Act by its supporters – would remove employers’ right to demand a secret ballot supervised by the National Labor Relations Board. Instead, it would require recognition of a union if more than half the workers have signed union cards. Orrin Hatch, a Republican senator from Utah, told a meeting of Efca opponents at the US chamber of Commerce this month the measure “should be called the Employee Coercion Act of 2009”.Employers say the secret ballot is vital to stop union organisers pressuring workers to sign up. “Workers won’t decide. Union organisers will decide,” says Richard Hankins, a lawyer at McKenna Long & Aldridge, who represents businesses on labour issues. “That does concern a lot of people.”For their part, the unions say employers can use the period between calling the ballot to browbeat workers with compulsory education sessions and intimidatory tactics. Mr Raynor argues that in general, “no unions use the current system in the US any more …because it doesn’t work”.The UFCW grocery workers union, for example, abandoned efforts to organise at Wal-Mart, the largest US private employer, in 2003. Instead, it has conducted a broad political campaign against the retailer, highlighting its low-wage model and challenging its healthcare benefits.The UFCW also points to its effort to represent a group of 10 Wal-Mart meat workers in Texas who voted to unionise in 2000. Wal-Mart subsequently closed its store meat-cutting counters. Last year – nine years after the vote – a federal appeals court upheld an NLRB ruling that Wal-Mart should start to negotiate with the union on behalf of the former meat cutters. “If ever there was a case that demonstrated how utterly bankrupt the current system is, the Jacksonville Wal-Mart case is it,” says the union.The bill would also increase the penalties for dismissing employees for engaging in union activity – currently, violators are required only to provide back pay, with no punitive damages. “[Even] when they are punished by fines, they know they can make more money. But unfortunately management can use my experience to put more pressure and harassment on my co-workers,” says Evangelina Orozco, a Unite supporter who eventually received $29,000 in back pay from Cintas after being dismissed in 2005.At Cintas, Unite Here and the Teamsters are trying to organise about 17,000 of the group’s 34,000 employees in a bitter battle that switches between the lunch rooms and parking lots of its laundries and the hearing rooms of the NLRB and the court system.In January, the NLRB ruled in favour of the union complaints, accusing Cintas of restricting workers’ rights to organise at two laundries. The board required the employer to post notices advising workers of their rights. On the other side, a federal court last year ordered the union to pay at least $5m in damages to Cintas workers whose car number plates were photographed in 2004 by organisers who wanted to use the data to get the home addresses of workers.The struggle has been intensified by the death of a Cintas worker in 2007 who was dragged into an industrial dryer at a laundry in Tulsa. The company agreed in December to pay $2.76m in damages and to add safety features to its plants. The union argues that proper worker representation would have dealt with the threat before the death happened.Cintas, which has unsuccessfully tried to sue the union under racketeering laws, says it abides by NLRB regulations. It also insists that it is not anti-union and that it respects “our partners’ rights to choose what is best for them and their families”.Not surprisingly, the company is an active opponent of Efca. Other large employers including Wal-Mart and Home Depot have been organising efforts to bring pressure to bear on local members of Congress.Although President Barack Obama – a co-sponsor of a card check bill as a senator in 2007 – has voiced support for the legislation since his election, he has not spent time on the issue. Suspicions remain that he would prefer the bill to be killed in Congress so as not to be faced with signing legislation that business leaders argue would kill jobs amid a fierce recession.Given the diverse support he attracted during the campaign, Mr Obama may ultimately be less dependent on the unions than previous Democrat presidents. “He’s the first Democratic candidate who has not relied on the turnout mechanism of organised labour,” notes a business lobbyist. “He comes in probably more ideologically aligned with organised labour, but owing them less.”Whatever the final fate of Efca’s card count recognition clause, the labour movement can still expect to see benefits from the Obama presidency: Hilda Solis, the new labour secretary, is regarded as an ally. This month, her department speeded up regulations designed to prevent a lung disease thought to be caused in popcorn manufacture. A campaigning issue for unions, the step had been held up by the previous administration.The card check battle could end with a compromise that includes the tougher penalties for anti-union intimidation and compulsory arbitration for the first contract negotiated between an employer and a new union.So for would-be unionists at the Cintas laundry and across the country, there is still the prospect of a rebalancing of labour laws. For employers scared of a pro-union administration, the apprehension lingers on.DEMOCRATIC DIVISIONS: ‘CARD CHECK’ BECOMES A REALITY CHECK IN A WARY CONGRESSThe election of President Barack Obama and the increased numbers of Democrats in Congress gave hope to trade unions that some of their most sought-after measures might become reality, writes Tom Braithwaite.After eight years in which the National Labor Relations Board exerted a pro-business stance under the administration of George W. Bush, an Employee Free Choice Act to make unionisation easier remains top of activists’ wish-list.But three months after Mr Obama’s inauguration, prospects for the law have faded even though Democrats, backed by hundreds of millions of union dollars, are under pressure to push forward with a union-friendly agenda.“We have the president on our side,” says Richard Trumka, secretary treasurer of the AFL-CIO union coalition. True, Mr Obama has backed publicly the so-called “card check” legislation – requiring a union to be recognised if more than half the workers have signed union cards – and as a senator he supported a previous version of the bill in 2007. But the suspicion remains that the administration, like some Democrats in Congress, would prefer that the bill went away as the country grappled with the recession.Since the legislation was introduced last month, both unions and employers – led by the US Chamber of Commerce – took up arms on what Arlen Specter, a centrist Republican senator, called the “most heavily lobbied issue I can recall”.Wearied by calls to back the law and under pressure from his own party, Mr Specter decided he could not vote in favour and mooted a weaker compromise. His decision dealt a potentially fatal blow to the legislation.Even if all the Senate’s Democrats vote in favour, they need one Republican to join them to reach the 60 votes necessary for it to pass. Though risking union wrath, not all Democrats will. Last week, newspapers in neighbouring Kansas and Colorado took aim, coincidentally, at the unwillingness of local senators to state their position.To come out against card check in its current form – the stance of Blanche Lincoln, a senator for Wal-Mart’s home state of Arkansas, and Dianne Feinstein, senator for California – is a risk for most Democrats, so important is the unions’ financial fire-power and ability to get out the vote.But either way, centrist Democrats tread a delicate path, such is the opposition to the bill from business groups and the difficulty of assessing the public’s view. The AFL-CIO points to a poll that shows 73 per cent of Americans are in favour of card check but other polls are less stark or turn the other way.“The biggest challenge in polling on an issue like Efca is that so few Americans are aware of the actual bill or the conflicts between organised labour and management,” writes Mark Blumenthal, editor of Pollster.com, on his poll analysis website. He points to a Gallup poll that shows 53 per cent of respondents in favour of a law making it easier to organise workers. But the polling organisation acknowledges that an “exceptionally low” number say they are following the issue closely.If card check fails, there is likely to be a day of reckoning for Democrats whose support wavered. The price of continued union backing is likely to be some sort of compromise measure as well as the formation of a more liberal National Labor Relations Board and pro-union executive orders from Mr Obama, which would not have to navigate a doubtful Senate.“It’s premature to pop the Champagne corks,” says Steven Law, chief legal officer of the Chamber of Commerce. On the other side, unions are hoping their own celebration is not on ice for too long."
762;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-04-17T18:07:30Z;Outside Edge: One nation, under tea – or not;;"The crawl on the cable news channel was positively alarming: “White House north lawn evacuated after tea bags thrown over fence”. It begged an immediate question; is Orange Pekoe our current colour-coded state of emergency?It was just a conservative stunt, dreamt up by lobbyists and frantically fanned by the Fox network. April 15, when Americans confront the Internal Revenue Service, had been dubbed Tea Day, for “taxed enough already” and in homage to the Boston Tea Party of 1773, a precursor to the war of independence. It was supposed to be symbolic, though in Washington it was also very wet.Still, the affair made me wonder: has America, weaned on coffee, become a tea-drinking country? (By tea, I mean the black stuff consumed by the British, stewed to the point that a spoon can stand unsupported in the middle of a cup of it.)Diligent research suggests it might have, or not, depending on whether one shares my definition. Our very own kitchen cabinet, stocked by the other (American) half, reveals eight different substances described as tea. Admittedly, they are dwarfed in quantity by several tons of PG Tips and Five Roses, smuggled from South Africa in dirty socks to avoid detection by US airport dogs.The Starbucks online menu advertises no fewer than 19 alleged teas. They include Vanilla Rooibos Tea Latte, Tazo Green Tea Shaken Iced Tea (lemonade optional) and the immortal London Fog Tazo Tea Latte (“delicate floral Earl Grey tea with Italian bergamot, vanilla and lavender”).But this cornucopia is rendered feeble by Celestial Seasonings of Boulder, Colorado, which boasts 90 “delicious varieties”. Among them are Canadian Vanilla Maple Decaf Black Tea, Powerfully Plum White Tea and Sweet Clementine Chamomile Organic Herb Tea, plus other “zingers”.All this is a far cry from the days when an innocent in America might ask for it and be served a jug of hot water and a single Lipton tea bag. High teas are now available in trendy establishments where the bill for a pot of whatever, scones, jam and cream can run into Madoff-esque money.Of course, tea does have healthy properties, attracting Americans confronting crippling medical bills. The University of California’s Wellness Letter has just reported “if you drink tea, you may be reducing your risk of stroke” – by 21 per cent if three cups are sunk daily (lattes presumably excluded). This was clearly ignored by most Tea Day participants (and Fox anchors), who were visibly apoplectic.Dr Johnson said it all, confessing to be a “hardened and shameless tea drinker …whose kettle scarcely has time to cool, who with tea amuses the evening, with tea solaces the midnight and with tea welcomes the morning”. He wrote that 16 years before it was dumped into Boston Harbor and now it seems all America is similarly addicted – depending, of course, on what we take the meaning of tea to be.The writer is a former FT Washington bureau chief"
763;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-04-16T21:58:49Z;Ethical consumers give Fairtrade a boost;;Britain’s ethically conscious shoppers are gathering acolytes around the world as more consumers make purchasing decisions based on how manufacturers treat the people who make their products.A new report from Canadian research group GlobeScan report, undertaken at the end of last year as the economic downturn deepened, claims that more than half of the 14,500 consumers surveyed in 15 countries are “active ethical consumers” with high expectations of companies’ social, economic and environmental responsibilities.The report, commissioned by Fairtrade Labelling Organisations International, was designed to assess consumer interest in the Fairtrade mark, which was first launched in the Netherlands in the late 1980s.British shoppers have given the warmest reception globally to the Fairtrade mark, with more than 80 per cent acknowledging familiarity with it last year as sales rose to record highs of more than £700m.Fairtrade has moved from a niche segment of the market into the mainstream, said Chris Coulter, vice-president of GlobeScan. “The behaviour change in consumption is such that the Fairtrade offering is at the right moment and at the right time.”Multinational companies such as Starbucks, Cadbury and Mars acknowledge that they are under increasing pressure from consumers and employees to show they are paying farmers fairly and sourcing raw materials sustainably.A blog set up by Cadbury last month after it said it would use the Fairtrade mark on its Dairy Milk brand garnered favourable responses, with some consumers saying they would return to the Cadbury brand. “I have literally stopped buying it because of my commitment to Fairtrade, and advocating for children (often exploited in cocoa farming),” one post read.Rob Cameron, chief executive of FLO, said the Fairtrade mark appealed to peoples’ sense of justice and made it easy for consumers to “express their values”.Consumers in the UK, Austria and Finland are most familiar with the Fairtrade mark, but less than 30 per cent of Italians, Canadians and Australians are.Global sales of Fairtrade products rose 25 per cent last year and are forecast to increase between 10 and 15 per cent this year.
764;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Home-brewed cool;;"Coffee or tea? Black or white? Regular or decaf? No matter how you take your brew, you’re now more likely to be drinking it in the comfort of your own home, rather than at a Starbucks or local tearoom.According to research from Euromonitor International, home coffee machine purchases are on the rise in many countries around the world. Britons spent nearly twice as much on them last year as they did in 2003, while US consumers upped their spending by nearly a third over the same period. Even in Spain and Italy, countries long associated with café culture, coffee machine sales have roughly doubled over the last five years. And, across the board, ground coffee sales have increased in tandem. The UK Tea Council reports impressive growth in its market as well, with sales of specialty teas such as Earl Grey and Lapsang Souchong up by 25 per cent over the last five years in Europe. Meanwhile, in the US, tea now accounts for $7.1bn in annual spending, up from $1.8bn in 1990, with sales of speciality varieties more than quadrupling.Experts say it was the prevalence of double-shot-extra-hot-soya-latte-pushing coffee chains such as Starbucks and, later, the advance of upscale hotel and speciality tearooms that pushed consumers to appreciate the drinks and want to recreate the experience at home. “You can’t underestimate the importance of the café culture when it comes to home machines,” says Brema Drohan, managing director of Nespresso UK. “Twenty years ago you were asked: ‘Would you like coffee?’ Now it’s: ‘What kind of coffee would you like?’ And people can quote three or four different kinds. They want to emulate that barista experience for themselves and for their guests.”This is not just about taste. It’s also about the look of your coffee machine, your kettle and your tea service, whether they are sleek and modern or chunky and retro. It’s also about the welcoming smells – just as good as baking bread but easier – and the comforting sounds – the whistling kettle, the gurgling milk, the thump of old grounds being banged out and the swoosh of hot liquid being poured into delicate china.“We’re getting more interest from people in things like roasting their own beans. These days they even want to know how to create designs on top of the milk,” says Gail Reed, manager of the London School of Coffee, where increasing numbers of non-professional home brewers are attending its courses. “People like to be able to talk about the drinks they’re making.”When it comes to modern coffee machines, the market leaders are Gaggia, with the traditional barista set-up requiring grounds to be measured, and Nespresso, which also has pod or capsule systems and, in keeping with home-brewing’s cool new image, George Clooney as a spokesman. “We do particularly well with [pod machines], which I’m sure has something to do with convenience, less mess and ease of use,” says Paul Martin, buyer for small electricals at the UK’s John Lewis department store chain, who has seen coffee machine sales climb 16 per cent over the last six months. “For similar reasons we are also very strong with ‘bean-to-cup’ machines, those with built-in grinders where you literally pour the beans in the top and the coffee comes out the bottom.”Richard Cockburn, a 35-year-old Londoner who runs energy consultancy Powerisk Limited from his house in Dulwich, recently invested in a Gaggia machine. “It takes longer than putting instant coffee in a mug but when I’m working I enjoy the break and friends really appreciate a good cup of coffee,” he says. Plus, “I’m used to good coffee when I’m out, so why shouldn’t I have the same at home?”In fact, Gaggia reports that 90 per cent of its UK sales are now for home use.As for at-home tea products, both John Lewis and the Conran Shop, which has stores in London, New York, Tokyo and Paris, have seen modest upswings in sales of teabags, tea leaves, teapots and cups, as have specialist dealers in tea paraphernalia, such as I Franks. “The huge Victorian tea services are less popular at the moment but there has been a spike in demand for older pieces,” says Jonathan Franks. “We’ve sold a lot of silver teapots from the 1790s. They normally go for around £1,000, whereas a piece from the 1730s might reach £4,000.”Contemporary designers are getting in on the act too. London’s Contemporary Applied Arts gallery recently hosted a selling exhibition called “Tea’s Up” that nearly sold out. Designed by David Clarke and priced from £120 to £5,000, the subtly subversive pieces included a willow pattern cup and saucer bearing the image of a fighter jet; an elegant teapot that was smashed and reassembled; and a double-ended teaspoon. “Tea is about sitting down and relaxing with things like napkins and cake stands,” Clarke says. “In the workshop we stop and sit down for tea every day. It’s a guilty pleasure but we reckon everyone deserves it.”"
765;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-04-10T19:30:21Z;Employee Free Choice Act;;"US business leaders won’t be laughing if comedian Al Franken wins the legal wrangle keeping from taking his seat in the US Senate. He may be the deciding vote in over-riding Republican objections to the Employee Free Choice Act, a law that would make it far easier to unionise workplaces.But controversial provisions that would discourage secret ballots and possibly allow unions to pressure undecided employees have business groups crying foul. They face an uphill fight. Unions are harnessing populist anger over the economy and Democratic control of both Congress and the White House to push aggressively for the passage. The 10 largest unions alone have given politicians about $280m since 1990, with about 95 per cent going to Democrats. Unions are also the largest supporters of so-called “527 groups” that skirt campaign contribution limits. A victory could usher in a union renaissance. Nationwide membership among workers has dropped to 12 per cent from more than 20 per cent a quarter century ago, with only the public sector ranks experiencing growth. Some 42 per cent of local government employees are unionised, against 8 per cent of private sector workers.There is a stark geographic split, too, with southern states eschewing unions as much as ones in the northern Rust Belt seem to lionise them. Only 4 per cent of North Carolina’s workers are members, compared with 25 per cent of those in New York. This may be one reason why industrial jobs have flowed disproportionately to the south.Three retailers, Costco, Whole Foods and Starbucks, have floated a compromise that would contain many elements of the EFCA, while still allowing a secret ballot to join or to decertify a union. This sensible position sadly stands little chance of success as labour sees no reason to settle for less than complete victory.

766;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-04-08T22:31:24Z;Value of ethical stance remains in companies;;"In the worst global recession in decades, it would be understandable if food companies tried to dodge their ethical obligations.Instead, they are falling over themselves to prove just how socially aware and environmentally friendly they can be.Mars’s move to spend millions of dollars on making sure the cocoa that goes into its chocolate comes from farms that meet a range of “sustainable” conditions – including paying farmers a minimum wage, conserving water and running ecological pest management programmes – shows how corporate reputation is seen as more important than ever.Fiona Dawson, managing director of Mars UK, says: “Consumers would be unforgiving if we cut our quality at a time when we’re under economic pressure.” She adds that the issue of sustainable sourcing cannot be ignored by food companies because it is “here to stay”.Although sales of organic food have been dropping as people choose cheaper kinds of food, they are buying more food that has been
certified as sustainably sourced by one organisation or another than ever before.Peter Melchett, policy director for the Soil Association, a UK-based certification organisation for organic food, says: “People are not ditching their green or ethical concerns.”In the UK, sales of Fairtrade food were up 47 per cent in 2008 on a year earlier. Companies that have boosted their commitment to Fairtrade products include Starbucks, the coffee chain, as well as supermarket chains such as J Sainsbury and Waitrose and sugar producer Tate & Lyle.Sales of McDonald’s coffee rose 10 per cent after it started using beans certified by the Rainforest Alliance in 2007, while Unilever is spending €5m ($6.6m)
certifying all Lipton Yellow Label and PG Tips tea bags sold in western Europe by 2010 and all Lipton tea sold globally by 2015.Tensie Whelan, the executive director of Rainforest Alliance, says the increased demand for certification marks comes as a new generation of corporate managers emerges.“The CEOs are younger,” she points out, adding that many were recognising that their businesses were operating with “outmoded business practices and globalisation is aggravating them”.Most food companies were taken by surprise when agricultural commodity prices soared in 2007 and 2008.As well as developing more sophisticated hedging programmes and hiring more risk managers, they are trying to ensure there will be enough farmers and fertile land to grow their crops. “We can’t make more land,” says Howard Shapiro, global director of plant science and external research at Mars."
767;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;It’s time to wake up and smell the coffee;;"I’m not a coffee drinker but even I couldn’t help notice that back in February, coffee prices suddenly shot up, putting Starbucks in a bit of hot water.Against this backdrop, I also noticed the launch of some coffee funds by specialist hedge outfit Eiger Trading Advisors. These four funds – two trackers (long and short), one managed alpha fund, plus a green/sharia-compliant fund – aren’t likely to feature in many readers’ portfolios as the minimum investment is $1m. But I think the launches are notable for a number of reasons.First, coffee is a specialist commodity that lives up to its reputation as a non-correlated asset. In 2005, a couple of US academics released a paper called Facts and Fantasies about Commodity Futures 2005 (Gorton and Rouwenhorst) that spelled out why commodities as an asset class could be so useful. The key observation was the low correlation of commodities with equities.A subsequent study by researchers at Ibbotson Associates for Pimco, the US bond firm, backed up this point, suggesting that commodities should have some benefit for most portfolios. It even went so far as to put an estimate of the benefit – 133 basis points.Sadly, as we’ve recently discovered, many commodities have been anything but negatively correlated to equities, as investors have sold those with cyclical vulnerability. Oil has plummeted in value, closely followed by coal and just about anything industrial. Coffee, however, has remained resolutely independent, rising and falling in line with factors such as the weather, or whether or not futures traders have got their sums wrong.Which brings me to the second reason why I think we should take some interest in the Eiger funds – the two new index funds are not based on futures prices but the spot price (although the tracking itself is done using derivatives and futures).This is important in my book because I sense there’s something rotten in the land of commodities and it’s called the futures market.I’ve received countless e-mails from readers who have a hunch about where commodities prices are going in the next few weeks, months or years. These e-mails usually proceed to mention one of the ETF Securities commodity trackers (called ETCs) that they intend to buy or sell.The problem that I see is that the ETF Securities funds (along with the smaller number of more general commodity trackers from Lyxor) track the futures markets.There isn’t anything wrong with this as such (in fact it makes the tracking easier), but investors should be aware that there isn’t a straightforward overlay between futures and spot markets and vice versa. Futures markets have a curious internal dynamic based around the move between contango (when futures prices rise above spot prices) and backwardation (when futures prices fall lower than spot prices). The Eiger family of funds, by contrast, deliberately only track the spot price.“We’re trying to avoid a lot of the inefficiencies of the futures markets,” says Eldred Buck, the fund manager.To understand what Buck means, I suggest logging on to FT Alphaville or the excellent US investment blogging website www.seekingalpha.com. Look up the articles “A Self-propelled Pyramid” (FT Alphaville) and “Death by a Thousand Contangos” (SeekingAlpha), which brilliantly remind private investors of the risks of commodity markets – and especially futures markets for oil.Some parts of the problem are well known – the huge US oil tracker fund USO is now so big that when it rolls over its investment in the underlying futures contracts it causes the main market to move violently.Both articles quote Stephen Schork of the Schork Report on recent moves in USO. “The USO held sway over the market, i.e. these funds (USO, S&P GSCI et al) are artificially skewing the front of the Nymex curve; putting downward pressure as they sell a massive percentage of open interest in the spot over the course of a few sessions”.Also, private investors have to factor in the movement back and forth between contango and backwardation – as well as consider the impact of any move in Treasury Bill yields.Add it all up and you begin to understand why some academics maintain that between one and two thirds of all long-term returns from futures-based indices come from these complex factors. In the US, for instance, Van Eck Global Research estimates that, in the 1980s, the cash yield from Treasury Bills contributed annualised returns of more than 9 per cent while spot prices returned -1.37 per cent.And for coffee itself – what are the prospects? Well, it has rallied recently and it will probably fall back again, but the point is that spot prices move relatively independently of equities and that diversification has real value. The growing consumerism in the developing world that’s pushing up demand for meat-based diets must also spill over into increased coffee consumption. And even if it doesn’t in the short term, my experience of recessions so far is that they result in people spending a lot more time in coffee shops talking about what they’re going to do next!"
768;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-03-16T20:16:02Z;Ackman signals Target battle;;"Bill Ackman, the activist investor, is launching a proxy battle at Target, the fifth largest US retailer, by nominating himself and four others to Target’s board.Target responded by saying it was “disappointed that Pershing Square has decided to pursue a costly and disruptive proxy contest”, despite the dialogues previously held with the company.Mr Ackman’s Pershing Square funds control almost 8 per cent of the retailer’s shares.His four additional nominees are: Jim Donald, the former chief executive of Starbucks; Richard Vague, the former CEO of First USA Bank, Michael Ashner, a real estate executive; and Ronald Gilson, a business law professor.Pershing Square took a significant stake in Target two years ago, and initially pushed the company to sell off its credit card portfolio and to put its store leases into a real estate management trust.Target subsequently sold half of its credit card business to JPMorgan Chase in May last year in a $3.7bn deal, but the retailer has dismissed Mr Ackman’s real estate proposals as “speculative”.Mr Ackman has argued that his nominees would bring expertise that Target’s board currently lacked in the three areas of grocery retailing, credit card development and real estate.“If you look at the board the only executive with retail experience is the CEO,” he said.Target said in a statement that it had recently met with Mr Ackman to discuss his proposal to nominate two new board members, including himself, but said its nominating committee had determined against the proposal. Instead, Target is nominating four existing board members for re-election.“Target’s Board, with its breadth of relevant and diverse experience, is comprised of 12 highly qualified directors, 11 of whom are independent,” the company said.Target’s board includes Mary Dillon, global head of marketing at McDonald’s; Anne Mulcahy, CEO of Xerox; Solomon Trujillo, CEO of Telstra; Mary Minnick of Lion Capital; and Richard Kovacevich, chairman of Wells Fargo.Mr Ackman’s move comes as Target is battling with declining comparable store sales, reflecting its greater dependence on discretionary products such as fashion and home furnishings. The retailer has responded with an increased focus on low-prices for national brands, and more aggressive promotions such as giving away five dollar gift cards, and online coupons.Mr Ackman has repeatedly praised the management of Target under Gregg Steinhafel, its chief executive, a company veteran who took over the top job last year.Target’s shares have lost over half their value over the past two years, and are now trading just under $30. Wal-Mart’s shares have gained almost 30 per cent over the same period.On of Mr Ackman’s funds, Pershing Square IV, which is entirely devoted to leveraged investment in Target, reported a 90 per cent loss last year, and allowed investors the option of pulling out. Mr Ackman called the fund’s performance ”one of the greatest disappointments of my career to date.”"
769;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-03-07T00:25:29Z;‘Ninety per cent of the loft is my work’;;"Designer Karim Rashid, 48, has had more than 2,500 objects put into production and has worked with more than 500 companies, including Prada, Alessi, Audi, Citibank and Veuve Clicquot. His work is in the permanent collections of 14 international museums and last year Dirt Devil sold 2m of the Kone cordless vacuum cleaners he designed. He lives with his Serbian wife, Ivana, in Chelsea, New York City.When did you move to the area?
I’ve lived in this area since I moved to New York 15 years ago. My office is around the corner on 17th, opposite the Maritime Hotel. For 10 years I lived above my office, so my commute was 10 seconds (I always said I’d install a fireman’s pole but I never did). Six years prior to that, I had my office in my loft. So now the idea of walking a few blocks to work is quite strange. I’m not used to this condominium style of living, where you actually have neighbours on the hallway. Now I have to say hello to people and put garbage in the little chutes.How has Chelsea changed?
It has changed phenomenally. The rents are so high that all the streets are losing the small, independent shops. Only the people who can afford the rents are moving in, so now the Chelsea strip that’s 8th Avenue, which used to be restaurants, clubs and cool little shops, has become banks, Starbucks and condominiums.What do you like about your apartment?
I looked at about 40 lofts in this area before I found this one. What I love is that it’s on a south-west facing corner, which means light all day. The problem with New York is you only get windows on the south or north side and lose a lot of space with corridors and stairwells. I’m 48 and for the first time in my life I have a view. It’s calming looking at all the water towers, which are iconic of this city.Why did you move?
Last year I spent 230 nights in hotels, so I thought it was a bit extravagant to have this big loft that just looked like a showroom. I’d spend most of my time living in 80 sq metres out of 250 sq metres. So I expanded my office from two floors to three. The staff are thrilled. It’ll be much more airy.How do your homes differ?
The funny thing is they don’t. I have apartments in Belgrade, Mexico, Milan and a country house near here. They differ in the sense of context, that’s all. They’re all filled with different objects that I’ve done. Now I’m doing a lot of work in Berlin and I’m contemplating buying something there.Where have you lived previously?
I was born in Cairo and we moved to Alexandria, Rome and Paris before I was four years old. Then we moved to London, where we stayed until I was six or seven, all five of us in this one-room basement apartment off Piccadilly. I vividly remember the cockroaches. Then we moved to Montreal, then Toronto, where I was more or less brought up.Why did you move around so much?
My parents were very global and met in Paris. They had this notion that they wanted to absorb different cultures. Although my mother was British, she seemed much more attached to countries like Greece and Italy. My father was Egyptian but he was the black sheep of the family. He studied in Europe and became a large format abstract painter. The rest of the family were doctors and lawyers. He designed film sets as a way to survive and bring up a family. When you’re brought up like that, it doesn’t matter where you end up; your influences are international.Why did you want to design?
I applied late to university because I was torn between architecture and fashion design. By the time I did, the programmes were full but they had a place on the industrial design programme. I didn’t know what that was, although as a child I was obsessed with drawing household things. I arrived at the department thinking “this is not what I want to do”, then after a year I realised it was completely what I wanted to do. My first job was working in Toronto as an industrial designer. Our clients included Black & Decker.How much do your own designs filter into your home?
Ninety per cent of the apartment is my work. It’s the first time in 15 years I’ve felt like I have a home and it feels extremely comfortable – very right.Why is pink so prevalent in your designs?
You can’t say there’s a single pink; there are thousands. I was obsessed with the colour as a child. It gave an energy, a sense of feeling alive. I love colour in general, which comes from my father.
On one canvas he’d have 2,000 hues. If you look around this apartment you’ll see almost every colour you can think of and it’s not overwhelming; it depends how you put it all together. It’s like that Monty Python sketch where they interview Shakespeare and ask how he writes such wonderful prose. He says: “Well, all the words are out there; it’s just about getting them in the right order.”What materials do you like?
High-performance materials. The floor is Lonseal, which is historically used for gymnasiums, basketball and ballet. It’s got good traction and a bit of a cushion. The minute you put it over a concrete floor, you get better acoustics and it’s warmer. I’ve always liked rubbery materials. I just did a hotel in Brighton, [south-east England], and all the bathrooms are made of rubber.Do you collect?
Yes, I have about 5,000 objects by other designers: a vase by Marcel Wanders, a watch by Marc Newson, candlesticks by Arik Levy. I gave up collecting 10 years ago, when I came to the conclusion that everything is temporary. I’d rather have a few really beautiful things in my life."

The company raised prices last year, partly to absorb the cost of the move to Fairtrade.Harriet Lamb, the chief executive of the Fairtrade Foundation, said Cadbury’s move, which represents £200m in retail sales, would “throw down the gauntlet” to other big chocolate manufacturers. “It’s an iconic British brand …This does really set the pace for the mainstream industry.”Peter Melchett, policy director for the Soil Association, a certification organisation for organic food, said the move showed the recession was not causing consumers to abandon ethical concerns. “It’s surprising how continually committed people are,” he said.Although Fairtrade sales have been running at record highs, rising 47 per cent last year to £700m, most sales to date have come from specialist Fairtrade companies, such as Divine Chocolate or Traidcraft, or from supermarket chains’ own-label coffee, tea and sugar.Tate & Lyle is among the few household brand names to have already adopted the mark. The company is switching all its retail sugar to Fairtrade by the end of the year. Starbucks, the coffee chain, is also shifting its coffee purchases to Fairtrade this year, a move it claims will make it the biggest buyer of Fairtrade coffee.Todd Stitzer, Cadbury’s chief executive, said on Tuesday he was not trying to “pull the rug out” from smaller Fairtrade companies. “If there are only small players in Fairtrade, it’s sort of self-defeating …If big businesses get behind it, you can have a much greater impact on agricultural societies.”The move will heighten debate on what certification systems are most appropriate, with some food companies having already adopted the US-based Rainforest Alliance mark, including Unilever, which asked the group to certify all its tea farms in 2007, and McDonald’s, which started using the group’s certified coffee beans the same year.Unilever said on Tuesday it had chosen Rainforest Alliance as a certification mark because it covered a broader range of standards than Fairtrade, including worker protection and environmental sustainability.“There is a potential competitive benefit to it because consumers are increasingly looking behind the brands to see how their products are brought to their tables,” Unilever said.Fairtrade said it was the only certification mark to pay a guaranteed minimum price to farmers. Cadbury will pay an extra $150 a tonne for Fairtrade cocoa to ensure farmers receive a minimum price, which is $1,600 a tonne. It buys nearly two-thirds of its cocoa from Ghana.Ms Lamb said: “If times are tough for us, they’re desperate for small farmers …they really cannot get access to credit right now.”
771;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;How Fairtrade coffee can help the connoisseur;;"Fairtrade coffee has become a familiar sight in British supermarkets and cafés. Its intentions are admirable, as it guarantees a minimum price for coffee growers, and it would be a callous soul who argued against a better deal for these farmers – in 2007 the Fairtrade logo adorned £117m of coffee sold in the UK.In November last year, the Starbucks coffee shop chain announced that by the end of 2009, all espresso coffee sold in its stores in the UK and Ireland would be Fairtrade certified.Harriet Lamb, executive director of the Fairtrade Foundation UK, said: “The partnership between Fairtrade and Starbucks is good news for farmers, good news for coffee lovers and a wake-up call to the wider coffee industry.”Yet significant sections of the coffee industry are convinced that Fairtrade fails to address growers’ problems. The nub of the issue is that selling coffee on the Fairtrade model exposes farmers to the vagaries of a faraway commodity market. A Fairtrade contract guarantees that the grower will earn at least the Fairtrade minimum price, set by the Fairtrade Labelling Organisations International. If the market price is higher that this guarantee, then grower will receive the higher amount, plus a Fairtrade premium of 10 US cents per pound (in weight) sold.Unsurprisingly, the coffee farmers are market-savvy; smallholders listen to the latest news on a wind-up radio, and the BlackBerry is as omnipresent for the owners of larger estates as it is anywhere else in the business world.Looming over the offices of DR Wakefield & Co in Southwark, south London, there are two screens with the latest market information from the New York and London exchanges. This company is the leading commercial importer of Fairtrade coffees in the UK, and managing director Simon Wakefield grew up in the family business.He visited his first coffee plantation aged six and takes great pride in how Fairtrade coffee has moved from a niche product to one that competes in the mainstream market.Fairtrade is not the only label in this market. Other “certified coffees” are those grown organically and Rainforest Alliance accredited beans, a scheme which protects the environment.Selling “certified coffees” now makes up 70 per cent DR Wakefield’s turnover. Wakefield is enthusiastic about the benefits to disadvantaged farmers from the Fairtrade premium and the anecdotal evidence in support of the programme is strong.But, as he picks up a market report, Wakefield says: “Wouldn’t it be nice if, just maybe, there was some coffee news to move the coffee market?” The vagaries of the commodity market are always going to hamper the Fairtrade label.Some coffee experts believe the way forward is to educate coffee drinkers. We are used to buying Fairtrade coffee because it is the “right” thing to do, without thinking about the quality. The next step may be to encourage us to buy and taste coffees in the same way as we buy wine – looking for particular locations and growers, and learning to taste the differences.The idea is that this will help generate better, more sustainable business for farmers, encourage them to offer quality coffee, and establish supply chains and premium prices, away from the unpredictability of the commodity markets.One of the champions of this new business model is a former commodity trader. Stephen Hurst was an executive director of coffee trading at Goldman Sachs for 11 years. He founded coffee importers Mercanta in 1996 and turned his back on the commodity markets. “I check the price once a day,” he says “because it is useful for me to know the bare minimum price that my producers might get.”Mercanta aims to supply speciality roasters with beans sourced directly from the growers. He deals only within the top 2 to 3 per cent of coffee production, prizes long-term buying relationships and – crucially – pays prices relative to the quality produced. Last year, the average price paid by Mercanta across the entire spectrum of coffee origins, grades, and varietals exceeded minimum baseline Fairtrade prices by 20 per cent.Hurst is a passionate advocate for the “Cup of Excellence” competition, which began in 1999 and is now run in nine coffee-producing countries, from Brazil to Rwanda.Growers submit their best lots, which are tasted (“cupped” in the professional jargon) by an international expert jury. Winning lots are then submitted for an internet auction where they command stratospheric prices (often more than 10 times the minimum Fairtrade guaranteed price – the top lot in the 2008 auction in Guatemala fetched 75 times the going commodity rate).“It is the absolutely highest echelon of quality coffee,” says Hurst. He is a past chairman of the competition and five of his eight staff at Mercanta are judges. “More than anything else it is a great opportunity for growers to meet roasters and talk about their coffee – it is a vast discovery programme for previously unknown coffee producers and regions.”Simon Wakefield is sceptical of the elaborate tasting notes which accompany the Cup of Excellence auctions: “It is clever marketing. But after the beans have been roasted, ground, kept on somebody’s kitchen shelf, made into coffee, and then milk and sugar have been added can you really tell me that you can taste a difference?”At the moment there are just a few places where interested coffee drinkers can start to educate themselves, most notably at the Monmouth Coffee Company which has two London branches, in Covent Gartden and Borough Market.AJ Kinnell, Monmouth’s coffee buyer, is adamant that speciality roasters do not have to be elitist. She says: “If you spend an hour in the shop you will see all sorts walk through the door. People come to us because they like the taste of the coffee.”This is still a minority interest, but an enjoyable one, and at the buzzing Monmouth shop in Borough Market it’s possible to try several coffees at any one time, and buy your favourite beans to take home.I go in and sample coffee from Finca San Francisco Tecuamburro in Guatemala. There are solicitous notes on hand (“Milk chocolate flavour with medium body and soft acidity”), and I savour a blend of three different varietals, grown at altitude on the slopes of a dormant volcano. And as I taste, I learn.……………………………………………………DetailsSpeciality coffees

772;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
773;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-02-20T19:18:38Z;Bloggers fight for Hollywood supremacy;;With one day to go before the Oscars, some tense races are nearing the home stretch. Will the best-picture winner be the favourite Slumdog Millionaire or The Curious Case of Benjamin Button? Is 2009 going to be Kate Winslet’s year or will she lose out to Meryl Streep?Far away from the red carpet in deep cyberspace, a different kind of battle is playing out as bloggers, news organisations and polemicists fight for supremacy in their coverage of the Hollywood goldfish bowl.With its egos, scandal and intrigue, the film industry’s lifeblood is news and gossip. For the past 100 years it has relied on in-depth coverage from its two venerable trade publications, Variety and The Hollywood Reporter.But with those titles struggling with the transition to digital media and losing readers and advertisers in a declining market, a new generation of energetic bloggers and online journalists has leapt into the breach.Two new digital services have launched in recent weeks. The Wrap, run by former New York Times reporter Sharon Waxman is backed by Howard Schultz, the chief executive of Starbucks. It aims to reinvigorate coverage of the entertainment industry with news, comment and analysis.The other new site is Big Hollywood, the latest online venture from Andrew Breitbart, who has worked on some of the internet’s most popular news sites. A co-creator of the Huffington Post, he has also had a long-term editorial relationship with the Drudge Report, one of the most visited websites.Mr Breitbart aims to redress what he says is Hollywood’s liberal bias. His site uses the “group blog” model and has already attracted plenty of offerings from conservative Hollywood thinkers who Mr Breitbart says have been unfairly marginalised in the film industry because of their views.“There are people out there who have been ignored by Hollywood,” he says. “The mainstream media – and Hollywood is complicit in this – has created an intellectual status quo.”Mr Breitbart is targeting different users to Ms Waxman but he says the impact of new Hollywood sites that reach highly targeted audiences so beloved of advertisers could be dire for Variety and the Hollywood Reporter. “There’s an opening here to blow them out of the water.”The Wrap, meanwhile, is hoping to win readers disillusioned with the level of Hollywood coverage in the print media. “Variety and the Hollywood Reporter don’t seem to be interested in breaking news and are worried about biting the hand that feeds them in terms of losing advertising from the studios,” says Ms Waxman.But she has her work cut out if she is to dislodge Nikki Finke, the reigning queen of Hollywood news. Ms Finke is the scourge of Hollywood publicists with an unrivalled network of high-level industry contacts.Since launching her Deadline Hollywood Daily site three years ago she has earned a reputation as the best connected reporter in the industry. “Sometimes I hear things about our company and five minutes later it’s on her site,” says one Hollywood talent agent.Ms Finke is also unafraid to express her opinions. “She’s someone who generates a lot of controversial judgment,” says Ms Waxman. “The way we cover the news is different. The Wrap will be doing deep dives into the serious topics that are part of this industry.”Ms Finke says Ms Waxman and The Wrap are “not on my radar right now . . . I break news and she doesn’t.” She says Ms Waxman “seems to be more interested in publicising herself than getting attention for journalism . . . I don’t think that kind of cult of personality works in Hollywood.”“People [in Hollywood] want you to tell them what they don’t already know,” she adds. “That’s what my site is all about. But I wish her well.”The media industry, at least in Hollywood, is thriving online.
774;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Reaching for the Starbucks;;The decision of Starbucks to begin marketing Via, its own brand of instant coffee, is a powerful symbol of something – either of the unexpected resilience of innovative companies or the collapse of the whole logic of the consumer economy.The struggles of Starbucks are well known. Its stock lost half its value last year, and store sales were off 9 per cent in the most recent quarter. The company announced in January that it would shed 6,700 jobs and close 300 more outlets, after shuttering 600 last year. Other espresso chains are nipping at its heels, some with better services (such as Caribou in the US, where high-speed internet is free), some with lower prices (such as Dunkin’ Donuts). Home-grown competitors are rising in important markets – for example Costa Coffee and Caffè Nero in Britain. People differ on whether Starbucks has expanded too fast – losing sight of the bohemian ambience that was its main selling point – or whether peddling coffee for several dollars, or pounds, a cup is a non-starter in this straitened economy.Whatever the problem is, it is hard to see how instant coffee could be the way out of it. One prong in the Via marketing strategy is to sell it through the discount retailers Target and Costco for about $1 a sachet. That is a lot of money. While there is a logic in selling premium coffee at a premium, there seems to be little in selling so-so coffee at five times the price of other so-so coffee. The second prong is to sell it, starting in March, in Starbucks stores in three cities – Seattle, Chicago and London. That makes sense: 81 per cent of the coffee drunk in Britain is instant, and the world instant coffee market generates $17bn (€13.5bn, £11.9bn) in sales. So perhaps Starbucks can sell enough in prestige markets to convince shoppers elsewhere to buy it in bulk.That would be in character. Ever since it began expanding, Starbucks has worked by paradox and misdirection. It is supposed to be a chain of espresso bars but, in the US at least, it has been years since most Starbucks have stocked proper espresso cups. A shot of espresso comes as a little puddle rolling back and forth at the bottom of a pint paper cup meant to hold some other concoction, most likely one with lots of steamed milk and syrup. Starbucks is basically a malt shop and this should not surprise us. Creamy foods are always popular in booms. The great food fad of the 1920s, the historian Frederick Lewis Allen tells us, was “Eskimo Pie”, and US ice cream production rose 45 per cent in the seven years to 1926. The genius of Starbucks is to keep its identity as a coffee shop, letting its customers feel more virtuous than if the place they habitually nip off to at 10:15am were called the Dairy Tub, or something like that.This makes the shift to instant coffee easier. If you are selling milkshakes, the quality of the coffee is not that important, any more than the quality of scotch is important to someone whose favourite drink is scotch-and-coke. But there is a problem with instant, too. Part of what Starbucks founder Howard Schultz calls “the Starbucks experience” has always been a matter of class. Starbucks has managed to give its customers the feeling they are “in” in two ways.The first is through its reputation as a “responsible corporate citizen”. Starbucks offers health insurance to employees who work 20 hours a week or more and has been punctilious about trading only with ethical coffee growers. These choices are defrayed through higher retail prices. Since people who care about corporate responsibility tend to be well-educated, and hence well-paid, caring is a class marker. Corporate responsibility and conspicuous consumption are near relations. You can “feel good” about ordering Starbucks in more ways than one.The second link to class is through real estate. This may hold the key to the company’s difficulties. Starbucks has had a genius for sizing up properties and picking locations. The company starts, according to the writer Taylor Clark with “a database ranking every US metropolitan area according to the qualities Starbucks found especially desirable – high income, high population and high education”. In plotting its expansion this way, Starbucks not only collected information but generated it. An up-and-coming neighbourhood would have a Starbucks: a superficially similar but stagnant one would not. In the very act of its site selection it became a sort of rating agency. One extraordinary side-effect of Starbucks’ retrenchment is that, as outlets have closed – particularly in struggling cities such as Newark, New Jersey – protests have arisen to “Save Our Starbucks”. Naturally! A closed Starbucks signals a downgrading of the neighbourhood. But picking real-estate winners is not as lucrative now as it was a couple years ago.Starbucks may have come up against the limits of its model. The chain will have to serve a different function in the bust economy than in the boom. Maybe espresso bars could thrive as purveyors of “cheap luxury”, the way cinemas did in the 1930s. A lot of people thought that the collapse of phoney equity values would make people turn to healthy, high-value food. But, really, that almost never happens – the natural food craze of the late 1970s was a cultural coincidence, not an economic effect. As this paper has reported, people today are turning to fast food, fish and chips and other comfort foods. “The less money you have, the less inclined you feel to spend it on wholesome food,” George Orwell wrote in The Road to Wigan Pier. “When you are unemployed, which is to say when you are underfed, harassed, bored and miserable, you don’t want to eat dull wholesome food. You want something a little bit ‘tasty’.” The taste for the kind of sweet drinks Starbucks serves is unlikely to wane any time soon.The writer is a senior editor at The Weekly StandardMore columns at www.ft.com/christophercaldwell
775;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Swearing: the best of a bad job;;Was an explosion of expletives what Gordon Brown had in mind when he charged Lord Mandelson with overhauling Labour’s message on the recession? No sooner had the business secretary been given the tricky brief of co-ordinating the government’s utterances on the economy – to be both realistic and upbeat – than he blew up. Lord Mandelson ripped into Howard Schultz, Starbucks’ chief executive, for his description of the UK economy as being in a “spiral”.“Why should I have this guy running down the country?” Lord Mandelson is reported to have said. Then he used a four-letter word that is banned in the FT. But does swearing do a politician any harm?The headlines devoted to his tirade followed reports of Boris Johnson’s rant at Labour MP Keith Vaz. Both episodes show that, more than 40 years after the BBC was forced to issue an apology over critic Kenneth Tynan’s use of the F-word on live television, swearing still has the power to cause waves.The Daily Mirror ran a story on Thursday about a teacher who asked his 10-year-old pupils to write a list of the worst words they knew. While some delighted in reeling off filth, quite a few wrote that the worst name they could be called was “peanut head”.Alastair Campbell wrote in his blog that Lord Mandelson knew exactly what he was doing by swearing – “the spirited counter-attack” by the business secretary “meant that he made the best of a bad job”, deflecting attention from the substance of the Starbucks boss’s comments.In fact, occasional bouts of swearing may, according to Henry Hitchings, the author of The Secret Life of Words: How English Became English, make politicians “appear endearingly human and accessible”. Hearing the mayor of London swap “crikey” for stronger stuff made him appear surprisingly serious-minded. Though there is a line between the occasional outburst and bullying verbal attacks.Leon Trotsky believed that a critical element of workers’ accruing consciousness was to repudiate swearing. Once capitalism withered and died, he said, so would foul language. Capitalism may be buckling but swearing sure as hell is not.Nostalgia’s powerAsda reported this week that the strength of the sales of brands such as Bird’s Custard and Fray Bentos marked a wave of “nostalgia” shopping. Nostalgia is always with us. But as Robert Opie, the founder of the Museum of Brands, Packaging and Advertising, says, it peaks in a downturn. Brands in the Depression sought to associate themselves with a bygone, supposedly happier era. The makers of Quality Street chocolates daubed them in Victoriana, beating the art deco-clad Black Magic.Patient ValentineWas your eye drawn, like mine, by a rather large Valentine’s message in Saturday’s edition of the FT? In it the anonymous author, identifying himself only as a banker, set out 15 commandments to his “princess”, a “paediatrician and philanthropist”. These included pledges to “be invisible and silent when required” and “tolerate your tempers and accept you are a lady with few words and little time”.It was tantalising. Why did he need to be “patient with the current situation”? I made contact with him.Clearly the point of an anonymous message is that we do not identify the author, although I can reveal he works in mergers and acquisitions in the City. The advertisement was accompanied by 101 roses – “last year I gave her 100 roses – I thought the increase was a fair guide to the real inflation rate”.The two have known each other for years but because of their schedules sometimes see each other only for a couple of hours a week: “She’s super busy at the hospital and for me the market is very desperate,” he explains.The idea of placing an advertisement in the FT had been in his head for some time but he was worried about her reaction. “Being a banker, I decided to sit down and do a list of the pros and cons, very much like a business proposal,” he told me. The intention was to set out a list of guidelines for himself and demonstrate commitment (“I wanted to lay it on the table because I like to be straightforward, that’s what I’m like in business”). After deliberation, he decided to take the risk – a trait, he points out, that is part of his professional make-up.The gamble paid off. She told me she is gratified to have such an “exceptionally understanding and supportive” boyfriend.When will he propose?

776;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;FT interview: Schultz on Via;;"Howard Schultz has talked a lot about the “magic” of authentic coffee brewing at the global chain since resuming as chief executive just over a year ago. So Starbucks’ decision to launch its first instant coffee – at a premium price – may be a little hard for some coffee enthusiasts to swallow.But Mr Schultz is eager to argue that the company’s Via brand, to be launched at its stores in the UK and the US, remains true to its brand identity – because of the patented process behind the product. He said: “We begin with the exact same coffee that goes into every cup of coffee. This is Starbucks coffee.“This is not your mother’s instant coffee although it is instant. It’s instant coffee that has never been created before.”The Via brand – in two blends – will be launched initially at stores in Seattle, Chicago and London, with a nationwide launch in the autumn across the US. It is packed in individual sachets, in boxes of three and 12, with a per cup price of 82 cents in the US or 33p in the UK for the large pack that puts it above conventional instant coffee.But Mr Schultz sees the category as a “very significant” opportunity for Starbucks, both internationally – where most of the world’s $17bn of instant coffee is drunk – and in the US, where the market is worth only about $350m.“People talk about Starbucks having reached saturation both in the US and abroad. But, when we look at the size of the prize, this is the most significant opportunity that we can look at in terms of growth.”In the US, Starbucks says it intends to expand the use of instant coffee by targeting the “on-the-go market”, trying to persuade consumers that good instant coffee is
better than bad brewed coffee.“We began to uncover consumers talking to us about new-use occasions,” he says of the extensive US consumer research.In the UK, where instant coffee accounts for about 80 per cent of coffee drunk, the company is planning direct sales to offices as well as selling from its own stores, with supermarket distribution expected to follow.“We’re not pioneering instant coffee in the UK. We’re going to have to tell the story about quality because this is going to be more expensive than traditional instant coffee.”Mr Schultz will also be encouraging frugal-minded US consumers to compare the new drink with the cost of brewed coffee.“At less than a dollar a cup in America, that’s a very strong story around value,” he claims. To drive testing, Starbucks says it will be giving samples of the new coffee away at its stores.“We believe very strongly that we can go where perhaps no other coffee brand can go because of the trust people have.”Future plans will include new packaging formats and new blends. For the sceptics, Mr Schultz says that he’s heard doubts before about extending the Starbucks brand away from the stores when the company launched its “ready to drink” coffees and its bottled Frappucino drinks, a franchise now worth almost $1bn.“When we launched our ready-to-drink, they said ‘are you kidding me’?” says Mr Schultz. “Ready to drink coffee did not exist before Starbucks – we have 90 per cent of that market today.”The instant coffee strategy, he says, is “similar, obviously more radical, perhaps more risk attached to it, but the size of the prize is much bigger.”Additional reporting by Jenny Wiggins in London"
777;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-02-04T20:55:57Z;US company earnings hit by FX turbulence;;US companies increasingly cite currency fluctuations among the reasons for slumping sales and profits as volatile foreign exchange markets hit corporate America with fourth-quarter earnings season in full swing.In recent years, US businesses have become steadily more exposed to foreign exchange risk as they draw more business from beyond America.Standard & Poor’s estimates that companies in the benchmark S&P 500 index made almost 50 per cent of their sales outside the US by the end of 2007, up from 30 per cent in 2001.The list of companies that have reported the pinch of currency risk in recent weeks is long and distinguished.Procter & Gamble, often thought of as a recession-resistant company, cut its full-year profit forecast last week as unfavourable foreign exchange movements reduced net sales by 5 per cent and the dollar appreciated versus the euro, sterling and Canadian dollar.Mattel’s fourth-quarter net sales were down 11 per cent from last year and included an unfavourable impact from changes in currency exchange rates of 5 percentage points.At Starbucks, international total net revenues fell 8 per cent compared with the same period last year, primarily as a result of the stronger dollar relative to sterling and the Canadian dollar.McDonald’s, Kimberly-Clark and Wal-Mart also lowered earnings guidance in December because of currency fluctuations.As a result of this greater impact of currency swings, companies are starting to put greater emphasis on trying to hedge their foreign exchange exposure, according to a recent survey from JPMorgan.US companies estimated that 42 per cent of their forecast foreign income was hedged in December, up from less than 7 per cent in April, the survey of clients found.A variety of instruments, including simple forward contracts, are used to hedge currency risk. Other instruments are futures, options and collars – a protective options strategy.The JPMorgan survey also estimated that G7 currencies would fluctuate by an annualised 20 per cent this quarter, double the average since 2000, emphasising the growing need to hedge against potentially adverse currency movements.However, even those that have actively hedged in the past may have been caught out recently. “There have always been active hedgers and most companies have at least had an awareness of this,” said George Nunn, head of foreign exchange and rates structuring for the Americas at BNP Paribas.“In terms of risk management, the typical process is for companies to estimate future revenues and decide on the basis of that estimate how much they will hedge.”Because the recession meant that, in most cases, revenues had been over­estimated, Mr Nunn said, many companies found that they were overhedged “and so are being forced to unwind trades”.The process of corporate deleveraging was still not over, he said, and unwinding some of the overhedging was part of that process.“Company earnings are clearly going to get hurt as a result of this alongside other factors,” Mr Nunn added.Additional reporting by Jonathan Birchall in New York
778;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Free breakfasts on Denny’s menu;;Denny‘s, the family restaurant chain that is an icon of middle-America, on Tuesday caught the recessionary spirit of the times by giving away an estimated 2m free breakfasts to customers, as it strives to revitalise its flagging fortunes.Denny’s said it would serve its popular “Grand Slam” eggs, bacon, sausage and pancake breakfast for free between 6am and 2pm in what is believed to be one of the biggest promotions of its type ever.“Free works today far more than any other offer in this economy,” said Nelson Marchioli, its chief executive.Early-morning queues were reported outside locations from Dayton, Ohio, where customers braved sub-zero temperatures, to Fresno, California, where the franchisee posted a security guard at one restaurant to ensure orderly behaviour.Jeremy Kraus, manager of Denny’s in Colorado Springs, told the local television station in his crowded restaurant that “Christmas is normally our busiest day of the year. This surpasses that”.Denny’s, which has more than 1,500 full-service restaurants, has faced a decline in sales over the past two years as a result of the slowing economy, changing eating habits, and competition from McDonald’s and other fast food restaurants for its core breakfast business.Mr Marchioli said the free breakfast promotion was a way of “re-acquainting” people with Denny’s as a low-cost dining option. “People are having a tough time in this economy . . . they are jumping all the way to fast food, or back to the grocery store . . . we’re telling them they don’t have to do that.”He argued that the huge media response, with more than 100 stores attracting television reporters, had justified the expense.“I wish every marketing dollar I’d spent had been spent this wisely,” he said.The chain is also handing out coupons aimed at bringing customers back for future visits.Denny’s decision to give away a main meal is the most dramatic example so far of what has been an increasingly popular marketing strategy in the food service industry.In 2006, Starbucks, the coffee chain, launched an annual “free coffee break” in mid-March, giving away about half a million cups of coffee between 10am and noon. Its stores also gave out free coffee on election day, and recently offered free coffee to customers who volunteered to do at least four hours of community service.Caribou Coffee, Starbucks’ smaller rival, also launched a wave of free decaffeinated coffee last Friday.Since 2006, International House of Pancakes, one of Denny’s chief breakfast rivals, has started marking Shrove Tuesday, or Mardi Gras, by giving away pancakes, and suggesting customers make donations to a children’s charity.
779;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-02-02T19:31:04Z;Grounded by the recession;;When the chief executives of America’s big three automakers flew last year in separate corporate jets from Detroit to Washington to ask the US government for a bail-out, there was widespread outrage. It prompted US congressman Gary Ackerman to ask: “Couldn’t you all have downgraded to first class or jet-pooled or something to get here? It would have at least sent a message that you do get it.”Corporate jets have now joined bankers’ bonuses as objects of unlimited opprobrium to become the worst symbols of executive excess. Since the backlash against the automakers, companies have been trying rather harder to prove they do “get it”. Last month, Citigroup, the bank, abandoned the purchase of a $50m (€40m, £36m) jet after a storm of negative publicity and Starbucks, the coffee chain, announced plans to sell its new corporate jet less than a month after it had been delivered.In addition there are obvious environmental concerns. As Greenpeace points out, the amount of of CO2 emitted per passenger travelling by private jet compared to a commercial airliner is significantly higher.Graeme Weston, chief operating officer of the shared jet ownership business NetJets Europe, says the three Detroit CEOs were guilty of bad judgment: “They were bozos – there are times when flying privately is inappropriate and when you’re being saved by the government is one of them. If I was in their shoes I’d have jumped in a hybrid car and driven 1,000 miles.” Yet he insists there is a good financial case to be made for private aircraft, pointing out that few care about Steve Jobs’s corporate jet use “because he delivers extraordinary value”.The use of a private jet (anything from £1,100 to £10,000 an hour) by senior business executives is relatively easy to justify in terms of the cost of their time. Ed Bolen, CEO of the US-based National Business Aviation Association, believes most use of private jets is justified in terms of cost: “There is a story to tell and it’s that business aviation makes companies more flexible and productive – it’s an ordinary business tool and people need to take the time to understand that.” Any company that runs a corporate aircraft, he believes, “does it by running the numbers. You have to remember that companies which own airplanes also buy $12bn worth of airline tickets a year”.David Savile, CEO of Air Partner, a jet charter broker, insists business jets are cost-efficient. “What we have in the western world today is hugely creative business people who need to be very mobile. For instance, you have people who make million-pound deals on a daily basis and you can either read reports or visit the site in question, which will give you a much clearer picture and increase the quality of the decision you make. Business jets make that possible.”One key benefit for business leaders of corporate jets over commercial flights is the ability to fly direct. This may not be a consideration if you are going from London to Paris, but it is if you are going from London to a gas field in Kazakhstan. It can also make sense in large countries such as the US where having to transfer is far more common.What is more, on a private jet the time in the air can be spent productively in a way that it cannot if you are on a commercial flight. For example, you can have a meeting on a private jet or spend the time on the phone. Mr Bolen believes the benefits of business aviation lie chiefly in increased productivity. “It helps companies to do more with less, and to be more nimble. If you want to visit a remote location, you can do it in 22 hours, or 11 if you fly direct. You can visit multiple sites in one day and you can discuss proprietary information en route.”In spite of such arguments, Mr Savile believes it will be some time before the public is persuaded of the benefits of corporate jets.“If you look at the times that most private jets fly, they leave at 7am and come back late at night. People get up at 5am to be on those flights.” What needs to remembered, he says, is that although flying privately is a luxury if you are doing it to go on holiday, it is not if you are doing it to stretch your work day. He adds that we cannot expect so much of our top business people and then have them kicking their heels for hours in departures. “You’d be horrified if you went to Heathrow and saw the prime minister and half the cabinet in Terminal 4. Well, most people would be.”
780;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-02-02T19:13:29Z;Business jets;;When’s the last time you spotted a top executive or A-list celebrity at the airport? Aside from all the other ways that flying commercial has become less pleasant and less glamorous, the surge in private aviation has left it the preserve of the hoi polloi. From under 3,000 in 1994, business jet sales were on a pace to crack 20,000 last year. But now the industry is in a dive. So, if one’s idea of consolation for long queues and inedible meals is rubbing shoulders with that bank or auto executive you saw on TV being abused by Congress, you are in luck. Jets have lately become a symbol of greed and excess, turning what should have been only a bout of turbulence into the perfect storm for jet makers and operators.Companies such as Citigroup, General Motors, Starbucks and Royal Bank of Scotland are scrambling to unload jets into a saturated market that has seen prices drop an estimated 30 per cent since the summer. Russian oligarchs and hedge fund titans are suddenly selling too. Exacerbating all this is shrivelling demand from a new class of flyer below the super-rich. Fractional ownership had allowed the swelling ranks of the merely wealthy to live like billionaires. It also turned NetJets, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, into the largest private aviation group in the world with 813 planes. If it were a commercial airline, this would give it one of the largest fleets plying the skies.Public outrage aside though, business jets are a great productivity tool. Warren Buffett may have nicknamed his “The Indefensible”, but the reality is that boards that lavish tens of millions on a top executive would be squandering resources by asking them to spend precious hours in security-obsessed airports adhering to commercial timetables. Private jets can provide good value for money, even if there is no doubt that the system is at present abused in many companies and needs reform. The industry will surely rebound as the comfort and convenience of private jets is now an affordable luxury for many. The odds of sitting next to Angelina Jolie on your next flight remain nil.
781;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks to cut 6,700 jobs amid falling sales;;Starbucks is to close more stores, sell a newly delivered $45m corporate jet and cut headquarters staff and worker benefits as it battles a slump in sales that has tracked the broader collapse in global discretionary spending.The coffee retailer said on Wednesday that it would shut 300 more “underperforming” locations – 100 of them outside the US – after a 9 per cent fall in comparable sales in the last three months of 2008. It announced a first wave of 600 US store closures last summer.The move will result in about 6,000 job losses, while an additional 700 corporate and support jobs will also be cut – half of them at its Seattle headquarters.Howard Schultz, chief executive, said that since early December the company had seen a far more rapidly deteriorating global economy than it had expected before the holidays.“The data shows that by virtually all statistical measures the pace of weakening in the business environment and global economy we were anticipating has been accelerating,” he said.Mr Schultz has asked for his salary to be cut to less than $10,000 – from more than $1.2m previously – and the company is selling two of its three corporate jets, including a Gulfstream 500 delivered in December.US comparable stores sales fell 10 per cent during the quarter, as fewer customers spent less on their visits.International comparable sales also turned negative for the first time, with the biggest slowdowns seen in the UK and Canada, its two largest international markets. Starbucks has about 670 company-owned stores in Britain, and around 7,000 in the US.The company said that it was also further reducing its planned new store openings in 2009, with 140 new US stores, down from its previous target of 200, and 170 new international stores, down from a previous target of 270. It is also cutting back on plans for new licensed stores.The reduced opening plans will cut its capital expenditure for the current fiscal year by around $100m to $600m. Starbucks expects the cost cuts to save an extra $100m, on top of a targeted $400m in savings announced in December.Starbucks’ overall net revenues for its first quarter fell 6 per cent to $2.6bn. Earnings fell to $64.3m, down from $208m in the same quarter last year, including a $75m charge largely from store closing costs.Diluted earnings per share fell to 9 cents, worse than Wall Street expected.
782;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-01-28T23:58:52Z;Democrats force through stimulus bill;;The House of Representatives on Wednesday night approved its version of the proposed US fiscal stimulus with overwhelming Democratic support but, in an early setback for Barack Obama, not a single Republican backed the $825bn plan.The president has spent much of his first week in office reaching out to Republicans in a bid to forge a bipartisan consensus behind the stimulus but the House vote indicated that opposition is hardening.The White House welcomed the 244-188 vote as an “important first step” towards final legislation, which Mr Obama wants to sign into law by mid-February, but the president also made clear he was open to changes as debate shifts to the Senate.“I hope that we can continue to strengthen this plan before it gets to my desk,” Mr Obama said in a statement. “But what we can’t do is drag our feet or allow the same partisan differences to get in our way.”The president on Wednesday rallied support from business leaders for the stimulus in a meeting at the White House with chief executives from 13 large companies, including Eric Schmidt of Google and Sam Palmisano of IBM.Speaking afterwards, Mr Obama said the barrage of heavy job cuts at large US companies this week demonstrated the need for Congress to move quickly, with Boeing and Starbucks the latest to announce thousands of lay offs on Wednesday.“The businesses that are shedding jobs to stay afloat cannot afford inaction or delay,” he said. “They are looking to Washington for action – bold and swift.”Republicans have praised the president for trying to work across party lines but have accused congressional Democrats of ignoring Mr Obama’s calls for ­compromise.Mike Pence, the third-ranking House Republican, complained that the bill ­contained too much wasteful spending and too little tax relief.“What House Democrats have done here is get out a dusty old wish-list of liberal spending priorities, dump it all in a bill, and throw in a few token tax cuts on top of it,” he said. “That’s not going to create jobs.”Mr Obama intervened this week to persuade House Democrats to remove an item that would have provided hundreds of millions of dollars for family planning services, but Republicans on Wednesday seized on other surviving measures, including an anti-smoking programme, as evidence of misplaced priorities.Business leaders who attended Wednesday’s White House meeting – including David Cote of Honeywell, Sam Palmisano of IBM, Greg Brown of Motorola and Anne Mulcahy of Xerox – offered broad support for the stimulus in a joint appearance with Mr Obama afterwards.But business associations have echoed Republican criticism that the House bill contained too few incentives to spur job creation and too much unfocused government spending.“President Obama and Congress are right to take swift and bold action on the stimulus, but it is just as important to get it done right as it is to get it done quickly,” said Bruce Josten, chief lobbyist for the US Chamber of Commerce. “The good news is we expect a number of changes in the Senate version.”The Senate finance and appropriations committees passed their drafts of the bill this week, but Senate rules allow considerable leeway for the bill to be changed.The Senate bill is likely to see another struggle over “Buy American” provisions which restrict federal spending to goods and services produced by US companies.The current version of the Senate bill contains no such restrictions, but senators such as Sherrod Brown from Ohio are pushing for spending to be kept at home.“Buy America provisions will ensure that US taxpayer dollars go toward the creation of US jobs,” Mr Brown said on Wednesday.
783;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Order online, pick up at the drive-through;;The residents of Joliet, a small city on the outskirts of Chicago, already have a drive-through McDonald’s, a drive-through bank and a drive-through Starbucks. Later this year they should have a drive-through Kmart store as well, as the third-largest US discount retailer begins a radical experiment in serving its online shoppers.Kmart, part of Sears Holdings, is transforming its old 85,000 sq ft store in Joliet into a drive-through location – under the name My Gofer – with four-fifths of the store area devoted to warehousing space. Sears told the city council that the new store would be a “marriage between online shopping and bricks and mortar”, allowing online shoppers to pick up merchandise without leaving their cars.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, is working on its own new generation of e-commerce enabled stores. Eduardo Castro Wright, head of Wal-Mart USA, said last year that the smaller, “high-efficiency” stores the retailer is developing will include a “very large” commitment to its pick-up service. He also indicated that the stores could include a drive-through area for online orders.Both retailers are building on the broadly positive response from US shoppers to existing site-to-store pick-up services, which leading retailers have introduced for both online-only and in-store items. Those who can overcome the logistical challenges of the service can expect a receptive market.Denis Baldwin, a shopper in Tampa, Florida, enthusiastically described a visit to Sears in his MyTampa blog earlier this month. “Placed the order at 9.18 this morning, thinking I could pick it up in a couple of weeks. At 10.23, I get a note saying: ‘Your order is ready to pick up.’ That fast? Really? Wow.”At the local Sears, Mr Baldwin parked in an area set aside for pick-up customers, walked in to a service desk and scanned his e-mail receipt and credit card at a computer terminal, waiting briefly before receiving his purchase, a drill. “Total transaction time from the time I put my credit card in until the box was in my hand was only 19 seconds,” he wrote.Yet there are considerable difficulties for retailers in setting up an in-store pick-up system, particularly if they try to mimic Best Buy and the late Circuit City in guaranteeing same-day availability.Even if a retailer’s website is able to check the inventory of a store, same-day customers can be left disappointed if records are inaccurate or if the item in question cannot be found or turns out to be damaged. Even shipping to store requires a workable system for verifying orders, payments and cancellations, and keeping track of ordered merchandise.Staff also need to be more responsive than the average check-out clerk, since pick-up customers generally have higher service expectations.Most retailers do not provide separate figures for pick-up operations, but Circuit City, the now-defunct consumer electronics retailer, reported last year that almost 55 per cent of its online sales were being picked up in-store. Raul Vazquez, chief executive of Wal-Mart.com, said in November that its site-to-store service was seeing “very, very healthy” growth rates, without giving details.But along with their new store formats, Wal-Mart and Kmart are also looking at expanding their services to lower-cost everyday items and food. Such a move could lead to increased demand for services and present a new challenge to competitors.In most parts of the US – unlike in western Europe – fresh food and groceries cannot be ordered online for home delivery, reflecting the difficulties of running profitable services given low population densities and other factors.Together with its pilot store format, Kmart is testing a new web service, MyGofer.com, that will allow customers to order a wider range of items for in-store pick-up than are currently available on its regular website, including milk, eggs, fresh food basics, and low-cost items such as detergent, mascara and toothpaste. Orders placed before noon can be picked up at a local store on the same day, allowing shoppers to collect goods on their way home from work.Wal-Mart focuses its site-to-store service on merchandise that is only available online. But last year its website started listing, but not selling, packaged and perishable groceries and health and beauty items, with a “find in store” search linked to local store inventories, as a possible step towards an expanded store pick-up service.Mr Castro Wright’s comments suggest that Wal-Mart’s new high efficiency outlets will still feel like stores, even with a big online presence. Kmart’s pilot, however, seems closer to the warehouse showrooms of Service Merchandise, a US retailer that folded in the late 1990s, or to Britain’s Argos chain.The concept continues to gain supporters including, in the past year, leading US retailers Coach, Nordstrom and Container Store. In Britain, Tesco is also testing online pick-up and storage areas in some of its new Homeplus stores.Lauren Freedman, whose Etailing consultancy monitors retail e-commerce initiatives, notes that the service remains comparatively new, with only 24 out of 60 leading US retail sites offering in-store pick-up.In many cases, she says, they still deliver a less than satisfactory experience, as retailers struggle not just with the logistical and IT challenges of creating a system that works but also with what it feels like for the customers.“Sometimes you have to drive down an alley behind the store and there’s nowhere to park…and then the guy runs off to search for your camera on a shelf somewhere,” she says. “The question is, are you visiting a store or are you visiting a warehouse?”
784;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:15:58+0000;US consumers seeking value options;;The frugal mood of the US consumer was underlined on Monday by quarterly results from McDonald’s, the fast-food chain, and Kimberly-Clark, maker of leading household brands including Huggies nappies and Kleenex tissues.McDonald’s said that comparable sales at its low-cost US restaurants increased by 5 per cent during its fourth quarter, maintaining steady growth as other more upmarket rivals, from Starbucks to Denny’s, have been reporting consistently falling sales.In contrast, Kimberly-Clark reported a 10 per cent decline in sales of its leading Huggies nappies in North America, as well as in sales of its Viva and Scott paper towels.Its leading bathroom paper brands saw a 7 per cent fall in volumes, while Kleenex sales dropped 3 per cent.The company said the impact of the economic slowdown on its business had been “more anticipated”, with customers in the US and Europe choosing not to restock household supplies, and trading down to lower-cost alternative brands.Tom Falk, chief executive, said the company was looking at ways to lower prices on nappies and training pants, where it faces intense competition from store brand rivals.Kimberly-Clark’s overall sales fell 3.4 per cent to $4.6bn, in spite of price increases due to higher commodity costs, as the strength of the dollar added to pressure from falling sales volumes. Earnings dropped by 8.1 per cent to $419m, or $1.01 per diluted share.The strength of the dollar also hit McDonald’s net sales, which fell 3 per cent against a year ago to $5.56bn.Globally, McDonald’s saw comparable sales increase by 7.2 per cent, with a 7.6 per cent rise in Europe and 10 per cent in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa division.Jim Skinner, McDonald’s chief executive, said “today’s market conditions play to our strengths” and highlighted growth in Europe in the UK, France and Russia.“Our model remains recession resistant,” Mr Skinner said.
785;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-01-20T19:25:25Z;‘This makes us more united as a people’;;"LaSonya Chapple, a single woman from Detroit, was wearing her late grandfather’s sweater vest under all her other layers of coats and scarves. Most of those clothes were to keep her warm, but the vest was to help her remember.“It’s not just about me being here,” said Ms Chapple, 41, a proud homeowner with a good job at Pfizer pharmaceuticals. “I represent those who were lynched; those who sat at the back of the bus.”Snacking on Starbucks oatmeal, she said she had found herself thinking about the history of the Obama family’s new home: “Slaves built the White House. Never before have we lived there. I’m even excited for Sasha and Malia. This makes us more united as a people – more truly a United States.”As in the campaign, Barack Obama made only a couple of glancing references to his race and to how he had made – and changed – US history simply by taking the oath of office. But for many in the cheerful throng that descended on Washington this week, the ascent of an African-American to the nation’s most powerful job was in itself a powerful reason to celebrate.“It is history for the whole country, but it is really special for us – for my people,” said Teonna, a 29-year-old cleaner from Charlotte, North Carolina, who came to the capital to party, and to earn some money – she hoped to top $1,500 (€1,160, £1,075) – by selling Obama T-shirts.That sense of expanded personal possibility seemed to be shared by Americans spanning what an earlier generation of black politicians liked to call the country’s rainbow coalition. Seventeen-year-old Alyssa Alberts, from the Fort Bertold Indian Reservation in North Dakota, was touring the city resplendent in beaded, fringed native dress, and a sash that declared her to be Miss Indian Nations.You could not get very far in the city without encountering the new president’s beaming smile on a T-shirt, button or billboard. But for all the national adoration of its chosen one, what was also striking was how strongly Mr Obama’s message of collective responsibility had resonated with the crowd.In his call on Americans to “set aside childish things” and shoulder the hard work of restoring their country to greatness, Mr Obama evoked the cold, desperate moments at Valley Forge and urged his countrymen to recall them during “this winter of hardship”. That provoked a few rueful smiles among the shivering listeners. But the general mood was one of collective euphoria.Social scientists may worry that Americans have started bowling alone, but Tuesday was a moment when they took great pleasure in shared celebration. “I heard there was a party here,” Ron Butkiewicz, a 28-year-old data specialist from New Jersey, explained of his decision to travel to DC. “We are here for the vibe, for the energy. We are coming out of our apartments and home to be with other people.”Andy Widner, 38, a commercial banker from Michigan who worries he may soon be laid off, was hoping that the vibe might help revive the economy. “As soon as consumers shut down, it’s over,” he said as he walked to the mall with his wife and two young daughters – decked out in Obama woollen hats. “Maybe this optimism will change people’s disposition. I think this new regime, this inauguration, may help us to find the bottom.”At least for the happy merchants of Washington, the inauguration seemed certain to be a stimulus package in itself. That surely will not be enough for the wider US economy. But, for all the jubilation on Tuesday, the crowds, like their new president, seemed to appreciate they were in for tough times. No one spoke of quick fixes, but everyone seemed to think that optimism could help.“Hope is a form of substance,” said the Rev Jesse Jackson, the veteran rights campaigner, at an inauguration party on Monday. “Competence is coming with this. People around the world are being buoyed by this. We can’t get out of this alone.”"
786;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2009-01-20T18:07:14Z;Obama’s inaugural anti-climax;;Well, I’m sorry but that was a bit of an anti-climax. Straining to be generous in my column this morning, I wrote that I was sure that Obama would “blow them away”. Actually, I don’t think he did.Of course, it was impossible to live up to the wildly-inflated expectations. The “Daily Show” nicely satirised these by predicting that Obama’s oration would be so brilliant that it “makes the Gettysburg address seem like a series of simian grunts.” But the actual speech was a bit flat and predictable.Parts of it sounded like they were written by a 27-year-old sitting in Starbucks – perhaps because they actually were written by a 27-year-old sitting in Starbucks , one Jon Favreau. Some of the lines didn’t even make sense. We will “roll back the spectre of a warming planet.” Sorry, but how do you roll back a spectre? Sounds like frustrating work. There was also a bad case of mixed metaphors – “We have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter…” Mr President, you can do better than that.As for the actual message of the speech, I think it was broadly as I predicted this morning. Sacrifice, responsibility, take our inspiration from our forefathers – and so on. On substance, I was surprised by how much sub-Bushian rhetoric there was about vanquishing terrorists – but maybe he needed that to balance the fairly clear repudiation of the excesses of the “war on terror”. I thought it was bold to say that the US is a nation of “Christians and Muslims”. There was a swift kick at greedy bankers, but that’s more or less obligatory these days. And there was a promise to work with the rest of the world. Nothing objectionable there, but nothing too remarkable either.Or have I completely missed the point?
787;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-12-15T16:25:51Z;Supply strains are source of problem;;In the past three years, it has become commonplace for large public companies to have a climate change strategy, usually involving improvements to their energy efficiency and cutting their greenhouse gas emissions. Few companies, however, have a water strategy.That may soon start to change. Water receives less attention than other environmental issues such as the climate and pollution, but the problem of water scarcity is at least as important – and, arguably, more pressing – than that of global warming. Water has never been more under threat in modern history: pressure from a rising global population, industrialisation, pollution, and climate change itself are all putting fresh water supplies under strain.“Water is the single most important chemical compound for the preservation and flourishing of human life,” says Neil Hawkins, vice-president for sustainability at Dow Chemical. “Water is also one of the key enablers of the creation of wealth – and yet today, essential agricultural and industrial processes are impacted by water scarcity.”More than 1bn people lack access to clean water, and about 2.6bn are estimated to have no sanitation. This situation is getting worse. At the same time as we need to feed and clothe a growing world population, which will require much more fresh water for agriculture, drinking and washing, we are diminishing our water supplies through pollution and wastage.People tend to use more water as they become more prosperous, but this can spill over into wasteful practices, because in most parts of the world wealthy people pay less for their water than its true worth – even, in developing nations, while the poorest may have to pay many times as much. The overuse of water is evident in countries such as Spain, where golf courses have been blamed for sucking up water and leaving rivers to run dry.Water subsidies, especially to the agricultural sector, also distort the economics of water, and can encourage wasteful practices – such as spray irrigation, which loses much of the water to evaporation, when drip irrigation would be much more efficient. Corruption in the water industries of the developing world is another serious problem, preventing people having access to water, according to the campaigning group Transparency International.As if this were not enough, climate change also threatens to cause havoc with water supplies, bringing less water in areas where it is most needed and too much where it is not. Some already dry parts of the world are likely to experience more severe droughts, while other regions will suffer more floods.Climate change could also mean that developed countries start to face the kind of water problems more familiar in poor regions – floods can easily overwhelm water delivery and sewage services, leaving people without water services, and droughts are also likely to become more frequent, necessitating water-saving measures for households and companies alike.The result of all these pressures is that many more people now face a scarcity of water, lacking enough to cater for their basic needs – and the situation is deteriorating, say forecasters. “By 2030, the world will use 40 per cent more water than today and nearly half of the world’s population will face severe water stress,” says Michael LoCascio, senior analyst at Lux Research.If we are to safeguard our wealth and prosperity, taking care of our water supplies will be essential. Agriculture is by far the biggest user of water in the world – about 70 per cent of our fresh water supplies are used in farming. The food and textiles industries are most obviously exposed to problems if their supply dries up: it takes 2,400 litres of water to make a hamburger, and 11,000 to make a pair of jeans.But other industries also depend heavily on water, for their processes. Semiconductor manufacturers, for instance, are among the biggest industrial users of water. Power generators also require plentiful supplies of water for cooling, and other manufacturers use water for purposes from cleaning to cutting materials.Moreover, water is a massive business opportunity in itself. The water services industry had a global turn-over of $385bn in 2007, while a further $64bn went to companies selling water-related equipment, according to Lux Research. It predicted that the total revenues from water-related businesses, including bottled water and desalination as well as water and sanitation services, would rise to $961bn by 2020.“There is a boom in the construction of new assets, and of outsourcing [water management to private companies],” says Antoine Frérot, chief executive of Veolia Water. “The assets are also more complex and more technical than before.”He sees many opportunities for private companies in the sector, in which they still have a relatively small market share – the majority of water and sanitation systems around the world are still in the hands of the public sector.Privatising water is often a contentious political issue, however, and some campaigning groups are wary of private companies taking more of a role in delivering water in the developing world, as they say companies are interested only in serving the wealthy sections of the population, leaving the poor without access to water and sanitation. “The private sector has not been interested in poor people,” says Vicky Cann, policy officer at the World Development Movement.But Mr Frérot argues that private companies are best placed to make the investments required, and that public sector officials can manage the contracts with private companies in such a way as to ensure their social aims are met. “If you have the political will, you can build an equitable model,” he says.Investors are also taking more interest in the sector, with a crop of water-related funds springing up to help investors gain exposure to the sector.For instance, this year, Four Winds Capital Management launched the Aqua Resources Fund, the first London-listed fund dedicated to global investments in water, raising €60m (£54m, $81m). Kimberly Tara, chief executive of Four Winds, says the rapid economic growth of countries such as China and India is opening up many opportunities in the water and sanitation sector.Companies, too, are gradually waking up to the opportunities in better managing their own water usage. Starbucks in the UK and Ireland was attacked by the Sun newspaper this year for its practice, in each outlet, of leaving a tap running constantly for cleaning. It has since stopped.Other companies have found they can save money by saving water. In the UK this year, a group of 21 of the biggest food and drink companies agreed to cut their water use by 20 per cent by 2020. They included Birds Eye Iglo, Cadbury Schweppes, GlaxoSmith-Kline, Nestle UK, Premier Foods, Tate & Lyle, Unilever and United Biscuits. They are expected to save about £60m in water bills.B&Q, the retailer, says it managed to save 13.6m litres of water a year and cut its water bill by £25,800 using water metering technology in some of its Scottish stores. Andy Francis, energy manager, says: “As individuals we are all aware of the ways we can use less water – turning off taps, noticing and stopping any leaks, and investing in water-saving devices such as water butts. It is equally important for businesses to take stock and understand the improvements they can make in the way water is used.”
788;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-12-12T11:43:05Z;The trouble with Starbucks;;"On a dark December morning three years ago, Howard Schultz bounded into a coffee shop in Dublin and started shaking hands with people in red T-shirts and green aprons before peppering them with questions. “Are you all new with Starbucks?” he asked the staff. “Who are the customers, and have they been to Starbucks before?”The store was the second Starbucks to open in Ireland, and Schultz, a tall, lean, energetic man who had bought the Starbucks brand more than two decades earlier, was in town to find out what the locals thought of his empire. Watching his customers order espressos, lattes and cappuccinos as the morning sun slowly lit College Green Square, Schultz explained why the ubiquitous coffee brand had become so successful. “The story is kind of boring,” he said. “We keep doing the same thing, year-in and year-out.” And that thing wasn’t really about coffee. Starbucks’ rapid expansion, which saw it open more than 10,000 stores in three dozen countries, was sustainable, Schultz argued, because of the unique experience people had at the stores. “The one thing I think is really important,” he said, “is the sense of community and human connection in every Starbucks store you go into.”In 2005, Schultz had every reason to be confident about the future of the coffee chain that he had joined back in 1982 (when it comprised just four stores in Seattle). That December, Starbucks’ stock was trading close to historic highs of about $30 a share. Its sales had risen by more than a billion dollars over the preceding year, as it opened stores in its home market twice as fast as it had in previous years. In its annual report, the company set itself a long-term target of owning 15,000 stores in the US, as well as “at least” another 15,000 internationally. Investors were told to expect earnings per share – a measure of profitability – to increase by 20-25 per cent annually over the next three to five years. Starbucks’ objective, the report said, was to become the most recognised and respected brand in the world.Was Schultz worried that the anti-globalisation activists who had attacked his stores in Seattle during the 1999 meeting of the World Trade Organisation might have done the brand permanent damage? Or the critics such as author Naomi Klein whose 2000 book No Logo accused the company of taking a generic product and “branding it so completely that it becomes a spiritual/designer object”? “Perhaps we have the opportunity to be a different type of global company…” he said simply. “One that makes a profit, but at the same time demonstrates a social conscience.”Starbucks was “the quintessential experiential brand”, he claimed, which made it different from other big names such as McDonald’s or Coca-Cola. The group didn’t need to advertise on television because people found out about it by word of mouth. “The rules of engagement about building a consumer brand are very different from 10 years ago,” he said. “That’s why the power of the Starbucks brand is so solid, because it has been built on experience and not advertising and promotions.” Anyway, Schultz has always been more interested in what he could do with coffee than in coffee itself. As a child in Brooklyn, he watched his parents drink instant – although they switched to percolated when they had guests. When Schultz describes his mother making the coffee, he talks about what it looked like rather than how it smelled or tasted: “I can remember with fondness the visual of the coffee perking and the little bulb on top.”He first discovered the taste of good coffee in 1981, when he was 28 and living in New York, managing the US operations of a Swedish company that sold kitchenware. He was puzzled as to why a small Seattle company, Starbucks Coffee, Tea and Spice, was ordering large quantities of an unusual kind of coffee filter – a plastic cone on top of a thermos – so he decided to pay it a visit. At the group’s original store, in Seattle’s historic Pike Place market, he was given a mug of coffee made with freshly ground beans from Sumatra. In his autobiography, Schultz says he was “hooked” by the third sip. “I realised the coffee I had been drinking was swill.” As well as the coffee, he liked the people who owned Starbucks: Gerald Baldwin and Gordon Bowker, former college roommates from the University of San Francisco who had founded the company 10 years earlier and still only sold coffee beans, rather than coffee by the cup. On the plane back to New York, Schultz was already thinking about how he could become part of Starbucks. “Maybe,” he thought, “I could help it grow.”A year after pitching to Starbucks’ founders his vision of it as a national coffee chain, Schultz was hired and put in charge of marketing. (Baldwin and Bowker were initially reluctant to take him on for fear his “energy” would destroy the company’s mellow culture.) A year into the new job, Schultz had an epiphany which proved instrumental in forging the Starbucks we know today – the Starbucks in which “experience” is meant to trump all. On a business trip to Milan, he discovered what he calls “the romance of the Italian coffee bar”. He started thinking about what Starbucks could become if it were to sell cups of coffee as well as beans. “It crystallised in my mind that coffee brought people together… and that as far as I could envision, at the time there did not exist in the US a place that brought people together with coffee as the conduit.” But his vision caused the Starbucks founders to baulk – and Schultz had to leave the company to achieve it. He opened his own espresso bar, which he named Il Giornale, in 1986. Little more than a year later, he was back knocking on Starbucks’ door – this time to buy the company. He merged their six stores with the three Il Giornale bars he’d established and dropped the Il Giornale name for the more recognisable Starbucks brand. From there, it grew and grew, and, 20 years later, in a cosy corner of Dublin, Schultz appeared to have achieved his dreams.…Two months ago, Schultz was back in Europe, this time in London. Starbucks was holding a two-day conference for more than 1,000 British and Irish store managers in the city’s Barbican centre, and Schultz was making a surprise appearance to boost morale.Now 55, he was as slim as he had been three years earlier, and retained a neat, simple sense of style: white shirt tucked into grey trousers. But his face was paler than before, there were deeper lines on his brow and dark circles under his eyes. His hair, brushed back, was greying at the temples. He walked on stage at the Barbican Hall to cheers, applause and wolf-whistles. “Wow!” he said, and then, to friendly laughter: “Before I begin, is it possible to turn on the house lights so I can see you all?”He stood very still, in the centre of the stage, hands clasped in front of his chest, as he assured the assembled employees that he had not come to give them a speech. Instead, he said, he had come “to talk from my heart”. He began a story about a Starbucks customer he had met in a store in downtown Los Angeles a few weeks earlier: a plainclothes policeman with a gun in a holster on his waist. The man’s name was Officer Kevin Coffey. “This is honest-to-God his name … C-O-F-F-E-Y.”Coffey’s partner on the beat had been killed in a train accident three weeks earlier. The pair used to stop at Starbucks daily, and it had been her last stop-off before boarding the train. The man told Schultz that when his wife had asked him to consider giving up Starbucks in an effort to cut costs, he’d told her: “This store meant so much to us …I can’t give up Starbucks, because it’s not only about the coffee.”The story was hackneyed – and one Schultz had told me half an hour earlier, in an interview – but it seemed to work. A sombre mood emerged in the auditorium as Schultz talked about the “humanity of Starbucks” and how it was more important than ever for store managers to create an experience that “values and respects” customers. Schultz needed to get his audience’s attention. For the first time in the company’s history, the number of people coming through its doors was falling rather than rising. It was losing money – this summer, it reported its first quarterly loss – as was Schultz, who had watched Starbucks’s stock-price drop to $7 a share. Six hundred “underperforming” company-owned stores in the US (where more than 10,000 stores today contribute three-quarters of its sales) and most of its stores in Australia faced closure, and thousands of jobs were to be lost.What had gone wrong? Like many retailers, Starbucks was hit by the economic crisis as people tried to stem their spending. This year’s annual report, instead of boasting about predicted profits, warned of “an extremely challenging” 2009. But the credit crunch wasn’t the only problem – or even the core problem: Starbucks’ woes had begun long before the financial crisis emerged in late summer, as early as the late 1990s. As the company’s stock price took off, management – who received large chunks of their compensation in stock options – succumbed to pressure from Wall Street analysts and investors to accelerate growth, sacrificing the brand’s integrity in the process. When Starbucks held a meeting for the analysts who covered the company in October 2006 it was “like an adoration fest of Wall Street” said one analyst who attended.…In January this year, Schultz unexpectedly returned to the helm of the company, resuming the chief executive role he’d left in 2000. If he was going to put Starbucks back on its feet, he’d have to rethink what it stood for. Part of that process would be a look within: Starbucks has been Schultz’s life work. He is fond of telling the story – a boy from the Brooklyn projects sees his father, a blue-collar worker, struggle to feed the family and determines to build a better life. “I grew up literally on the other side of the tracks … I had a healthy respect for how I grew up but I wanted to improve on that. I didn’t want to wind up in public housing.” Asked what drives him today, he still says “insecurity”.As a boy, Schultz wasn’t interested in business: he wanted to be a professional athlete, and went to Northern Michigan University on a football scholarship. He graduated with a degree in communications and worked in a ski lodge for a year before getting a place as a sales trainee at Xerox. “I walked out with a healthy sense of self-esteem,” he says in his book. He spent several years in sales, doing a lot of “cold calling” before joining the Swedish kitchen goods company, Hammarplast, in 1979.Although Schultz’s initial idea was to build a chain of espresso bars where people could drink coffee standing up – like they did in Italy – he soon realised that customers, who could increasingly afford to drink $2.50 lattes as the economy boomed, liked sitting down and lingering. A tweaked vision emerged: Starbucks could become the American equivalent of the English pub, the German beer garden and the French café. The company began building bigger stores, with more seating. And as laptop computers became commonplace accessories, the shops became a destination for people who wanted to work as well as socialise.By 1990, Starbucks was profitable, and a year later it was offering stock options to all its employees (which is when it started calling them “partners”) – in addition to full healthcare, even for part-time staff. In 1992, it listed on the New York Stock Exchange and by the mid-1990s, the coffee-shop experience was so common to Americans that it played a central role in the decade’s hit television series, Friends. Starbucks had spotted what people wanted before they knew they wanted it.But as Starbucks pursued growth, the company got lazy, and, some say, greedy. To make lattes and cappuccinos more quickly, it replaced its labour-intensive La Marzocco espresso machines, which required baristas to grind and press coffee for every cup. In their place, it installed Verismo automatic machines, where the barista’s role was reduced to pressing a button and watching the coffee flow out. (Starbucks’s baristas complained of being “de-skilled”). And it wasn’t just the taste of the coffee – Schultz’s coffee-house experience was also suffering. To help maintain sales momentum (the company was very proud of its record of increasing comparable store sales by at least five per cent, year-on-year) it diversified away from coffee and started selling hot food, CDs, books and DVDs. Meanwhile, the company opened so many stores, so quickly, with the same design (often getting rid of plump armchairs and couches and replacing them with hard wooden chairs), that by 2007 even Schultz was describing them as sterile.At the same time, competitors were emerging, some of them from unexpected places such as the world of fast food: McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts both realised they could draw in more customers by selling good coffee – customers primed by drinking Starbucks’ brew. Dunkin’ Donuts runs a website, DunkinbeatStarbucks.com, which encourages people to e-mail virtual postcards bearing messages such as: “Friends don’t let friends drink at Starbucks.” McDonald’s encourages similar “interventions”: “Click here to help a friend kick their snobbish habit,” reads one window at its website, Unsnobbycoffee.com. Enough people clicked, and soon Starbucks was feeling the business equivalent of caffeine withdrawal symptoms.…Before Schultz stepped off the stage at the Barbican, he told his employees that Starbucks had created many of its own problems. “The question is,” he said, “are we going to be able to right the ship?”To do so, Schultz is doing more than telling stories. He is also making serious changes to the product, trying to claw back some of the ground lost in the past decade, when perceptions of Starbucks coffee went from being the best on the block to the high-street equivalent of instant. To start, he is spending tens of millions of dollars on new coffee machines. One, called the Clover, makes brewed coffee – for which Starbucks will charge a premium because the Clover requires both more beans and more labour (the beans are “scooped, weighed, ground and brewed to order”). Another machine, called the Mastrena, makes espressos. Although baristas are still only required to push a button, it grinds coffee fresh for each cup, and is smaller and prettier than the Verismo machines now in use, allowing customers to see the baristas making their drinks.That detail hints at what Schultz knows as well as anyone – that just making better coffee is not the answer: it’s the experience, stupid. But Schultz is more radical: “It’s not enough to reaffirm our coffee position and embrace the heritage and tradition of the company… it has to be linked with innovation so we stay ahead.” He refers to Steve Jobs, Apple’s co-founder (whom Schultz knows and for whom he says he has “a healthy respect”), and asks: “Who would have thought, five to 10 years ago, that Apple would reinvent itself?”He also knows that Starbucks cannot be as complacent as it once was – in a harsh economic climate, it needs to give people a good reason to make Starbucks part of their day. It has to advertise on television. It has to offer “value” by running promotions and loyalty schemes, such as a “Gold Card” that will give customers a 10 per cent discount on store purchases for a $25 annual membership fee. “These were things that were never part of our DNA in the past, that need to be now,” he reasons.But he rejects the idea that it is time for Starbucks to give up its aspirations to be more than a mass-market consumer brand. “I think it’s really important for the leader of an organisation of any size to create a vision and a picture for people to aspire to be part of. The question isn’t whether or not it’s realistic, the question is: do people want to be part of that?”And there’s the crux of the comeback – and where Schultz is taking a gamble. Can he create an experience as inviting as the Starbucks of the 1990s, but suited to a world in recession? It’s a cliché of credit-crunch analysis to point out that unemployed bankers will soon lose their taste for $2.50 cups of coffee, no matter how comfy the in-store sofas. Is it one Schultz can prove is unfounded? Brand consultants say cups of giant, milky, overpriced coffee were something of a fad that coincided with the bull market. Now that consumers are more fussy about how they spend their money, they are questioning why they went to Starbucks in the first place. “Starbucks needs to seriously and rapidly re-evaluate what the brand stands for, what it sells, and what the consumer experience should be,” says Don Williams, chief executive at London-based brand consultancy Pi Global. “Far from exuding an air of everyday indulgence, the often slightly dog-eared assembly line that is your average Starbucks store is suffering the double whammy of being both too familiar and overpriced.”…Starbucks is not the only big consumer brand to have run into trouble. McDonald’s successfully turned itself around after both its sales and stockprice dropped sharply in the early 2000s. It redesigned its restaurants and came up with healthier menus. But McDonald’s does not pretend to be more than what it is: a restaurant chain that sells cheap food fast. Although it has made minor additions to its menu such as salads and organic milk, it knows its core business is selling hamburgers.Some of Schultz’s turnaround measures are purely pragmatic. He wants to reduce the company’s dependence on the US: “2009 will be the first year in our history where we will have opened more stores internationally than in North America and I suspect that trend could continue for a couple of years,” he says. Focusing on other markets will allow Starbucks to keep meeting Wall Street’s demands for continued growth even as sales fall on home soil. Still, it will be no mean feat – sales are dropping in Canada and the UK, too. And as its experience in Australia showed, where a mature and sophisticated coffee-consuming market, educated by the country’s Italian immigrant community, rejected the brand, Starbucks cannot assume that people will embrace its coffee culture.Like other chief executives trying to slim bloated organisations, Schultz has been getting rid of layers of senior management, and phasing out “non-core” products – such as smelly hot sandwiches in the US (to be replaced by sandwiches that don’t interfere with the coffee aroma), and some of the books and CDs it sells. Stock analysts say Starbucks can push changes through quickly because Schultz’s opinions are respected. “If it had been anyone other than Howard, there may have been more resistance,” says Sharon Zackfia, an analyst who tracks the company at US investment group William Blair & Co. “He invites opinions but at the end, what he says goes.”…Some Starbucks-watchers think the real key to the company’s future lies in its ability to meet less prosaic needs. Nancy Koehn, a professor at Harvard Business School who published a case study on Starbucks earlier this year, believes that when the financial turbulence under way in many parts of the world eases, a new set of consumer values could emerge. She predicts that after the “shock and awe” of the recession dissipates, Starbucks has a good chance of re-engaging with consumers who want to buy products from companies with a social conscience. “This brand,” she argues, “has much more room in it to absorb these new values than McDonald’s or Dunkin’ Donuts.”Schultz, who seems more humble than he was three years ago, takes personal responsibility for pushing Starbucks too far too fast (“I’ve said to people, if you want to blame anyone, blame me”). He says he still thinks it is possible to create a different kind of company while pursuing growth: “It is vitally important that we maintain our commitment to the basic fundamental value of what Starbucks stands for, whether it was Fair Trade yesterday or the Red campaign we’re launching in the US [Starbucks is donating money from some of its Christmas drinks sales to African Aids programmes as part of the Product Red campaign]… I take great personal pride in the fact we are now the largest buyer of Fair Trade coffee in the world – we couldn’t do that when we were small.”Maybe. Schultz seems to believe it, and he has little reason to fool himself: “I’m the largest individual shareholder, so I’ve lost a tremendous amount of equity myself, more than any other individual,” he says. “I’ve lost almost a billion dollars. So I’m personally very motivated.” And there’s a bigger motivation than just money. “It’s the respect,” he says. “The legacy.”There are signs that Schultz is close to figuring out what that legacy could be. A few days after the US election, he wrote an article for The Huffington Post, a liberal news website, telling business leaders not to leave the problems of fixing the US economy to the president-elect. “Now is a time to invest, truly and authentically, in our people, in our corporate responsibility and in our communities. The argument – and opportunity – for companies to do this has never been more compelling,” he wrote.The piece struck a chord, and Schultz was swamped with interview requests. “I wasn’t prepared for what was going to happen,” he says earnestly. “I wasn’t looking for a platform. I wrote it as much for our people as I did for the general audience; the responsibility of business is not to turn inward during this time, that’s what responsible capitalism means.” Some responses were critical: “Corporate social responsibility,” wrote one, “is somewhat of an oxymoron, especially coming from Starbucks, [which] put the little guys, the neighborhood coffee-houses and shops out of business, took the individual feel away and replaced it with a cold, green, retail coffee shop with weak and bitter coffee.” But he also received support: “Great ideals and I hope they are not just empty words,” read another post. “Large companies evading their social responsibility is at the root of the current problem.”Schultz has been here before. Starbucks was attacked for being a faceless corporate entity more than a decade ago, and ever since Schultz has struggled to persuade people that’s not the case. But he is a remarkably zealous man; the kind who is so focused on thinking about what to do next that he doesn’t see the problems in front of him. He describes himself as being “ultra-curious”: “I’ve always felt like I have the inherent ability to see things that were either under the rock or around the corner.”Schultz never wanted Starbucks to become a “soulless big chain”. But he allowed it to happen, perhaps because he was so driven (he sleeps only five hours a night) that he didn’t know when to stop. Now that he has been forced to slow down, the question is what he will do with the time he has been given. He has come close to realising his goal of making Starbucks the most recognised brand in the world. Does he still have a chance to make it the most respected, or even the best loved?Jenny Wiggins is the FT’s consumer industries correspondent"
789;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-12-11T16:48:20Z;Christmas shopping: Picking the pitch of the festive ringing tills;;Christmas has come early for consumers, with high street retailers holding sales in November and December in an attempt to encourage consumers to spend.But the measures are not expected to be hugely successful, with retail analysts forecasting the worst Christmas sales figures on the high street for years. Quite how badly retailers have been affected will not be known until after the Christmas period – so spread betters can have a flutter now on how the high street will fare.They can either take a bet on retailers that will do well, or try to predict who will lose market share – or combine the two in a pair trade.Joshua Raymond at City Index says spread betters are very well placed to profit from falling retail sales. “Spread betters can certainly profit from this. A key advantage of spread betting is the ability to profit from a falling market – and the retail sector has fallen 70 per cent in the last 18 months alone,” he says.One trend that is expected to continue is that of shoppers trading down – buying similar products but at cheaper shops. “Discounters and those with clear value messages will resonate well with shoppers and are likely to gain market share at the expense of their peers,” says Rahul Sharma, a director at Martin Currie.This was most recently seen after Tesco announced its third quarter results at the beginning of December. The shares rose after the supermarket said its sales had risen slightly due in part to a focus on discounted goods.Mr Sharma points out that Asda’s owner, Wal-mart, thrived during the last recession in America, and is already doing so again both in the UK and the US.He believes that Morrisons is well positioned because of its no-nonsense value image, as is TK Maxx. McDonald’s could also be a good bet for a company that may benefit from trading down, says Mr Sharma. It has been offering healthier foods such as salads, as well as trying to make its branches more appealing as cappuccino destinations – meaning it could grab market share from companies such as Starbucks.Retailers perceived as being expensive or offering superfluous products are likely to suffer.The shares of luxury retailers have fallen by 62 per cent over the past year, compared with a drop of 29.4 per cent from budget retailers, according to recent figures from DigitalLook.com, a financial information website for private investors.This compares with a drop in the FTSE 100 of 36.1 per cent, at the beginning of December, meaning that budget retailers actually outperformed the stock market.Morrison shares have fallen just over 20 per cent in the past year and Sainsbury’s has fallen more than 35 per cent.High-end food retailers have fared much worse – Marks and Spencer has seen a 60 per cent drop, while Whole Foods has fallen nearly 80 per cent.Mr Sharma suggests going short in luxury brand companies such as PPR, which owns Gucci, or LVMH, which owns Louis Vuitton and Moët Hennessy and whose shares have fallen nearly 50 per cent over the past year.Of course, just because a company is in the budget space does not mean it is necessarily a good buy. Andy Yates, director of DigitalLook.com, points out: “The Woolworths saga shows that for a company successfully to exploit the budget end of the market, it still needs a compelling business model, excellent execution and first class financial controls.”Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads, says that traders could even sell retail stocks now with the hope of buying them back cheaper in the New Year.But he warns: “Going short on retail stocks at this time of year would be a risky strategy considering that historically they perform very well in December. It might be worth waiting for the New Year to see whether their downward trend is still in place before shorting retailers.”He adds that in three of the past four years, the retail sector has rallied an average of 5.1 per cent in December – so it is normally not the best month to take a short position in a retail share.Gary Thomson, head of sales trading at CMC Markets, argues: “Individual stocks have been sold off so hard that the likes of WH Smith, Tesco, M&S and Morrisons are all trading well below analysts’ forecast prices. So unless there are horrific surprises here post-Christmas, a rebound could be in order.”This means that there may be more opportunities for traders to bet on a rise in retail stocks than a fall, at least over the short term.Tim Hughes at IG Index says: “The question of how to profit lies in exactly what to short. At these valuations, the risk is that even over a miserable trading season, many retailers may manage to beat expectations – simply because those expectations are so low.”He suggests betters use common sense to decide on pair trades. If they think shoppers are likely to trade down, they could go long on Morrisons and short M&S. And if they think the illiquidity in the housing market will encourage people to do DIY on their homes, they could go long on Kingfisher.Mr Raymond says it will not just be luxury brands that are hit. He thinks consumers will refrain from big buys – which could include electrical goods such as tele­visions. Consequently, he thinks DSG, the second biggest electronic retailer in Europe, will suffer.He recommends Game Group, which he thinks will profit from consumers opting to stay at home rather than spend money going out.“Games consoles also prove to be a popular Christmas gift and we may see an increase in demand, as consumers cut back from other luxuries,” he says.
790;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-11-28T14:35:50Z;Ülker: Ambitious confectioner snaps up Belgium’s Godiva;;In 1944, Sabri Ülker, a 24-year-old whose family fled to Turkey from Communist troops in Crimea, opened a small bakery in Istanbul. His goal then was to produce 250 kilos (550 pounds) of biscuits a day.Sixty-four years on, the company he founded, Ülker, is Turkey’s largest chocolate and biscuits producer, with exports to more than 100 countries, 29,300 employees and $9.1bn in sales last year.But being a local heavyweight is apparently not enough. After focusing on Turkey, the Middle East, Balkans and Africa, Ülker has now set its sights on becoming a global player.Last December, it made headlines by fighting off competition from Nestlé, Starbucks and Mars to purchase the luxury chocolate brand Godiva from the Campbell Soup Company for $850m. The sale marked the first-ever acquisition of a well-known international brand by a Turkish company.“We are market leader in Turkey and the surrounding region. But there are other places to go now, namely Europe and the US,” Atilla Kurama, chief executive of Ülker’s parent company Yildiz Holding, says at the company’s headquarters in Istanbul.“Three factors converged for us with Godiva. Campbell announced it would sell the firm, global financing conditions were favourable and it fitted our strategy. In terms of branded packaged goods, I can’t think of a better known name than Godiva.”The appetite for globalisation is part of a vision introduced by Murat Ülker, the company’s US-trained chief executive who took over from his father Sabri in 2000. While biscuits and chocolates remain a core business, Yildiz Holding now has 82 companies in food, beverages, finance, computers and electronics.It is vertically integrated, producing its manufacturing machinery, packaging, and raw materials. Nine of its 33 factories are outside Turkey.Under the youthful scion, Ülker has launched joint ventures with Kelloggs cereals and Hero baby foods and professionalised its brand management.“We’re trying different partnership models,” says Mr Kurama. “We’re open to new business but it needs to add something, to create shareholder value. Through know-how, new customers or innovation.”The goal, says Mr Kurama, is to improve on the company’s worldwide position as 16th-largest chocolate and confectionary producer. Following the Godiva deal, in August, it announced the purchase of UK chocolate maker Lovells. The addition of strong brands has led to fresh emphasis on the parent company, Yildiz Holding. “Ülker is our flagship brand, but not the only one,” he says.The Godiva purchase moves the company into uncharted waters. The Belgian-founded chocolatier’s elegant truffles and gold-wrapped pralines are a world removed from Ülker’s business model.“We are a mass market-oriented business,” says Mr Kurama, “but Godiva is a boutique, artisanal, high-end brand. We’re managing it as a stand-alone entity.”Last week, Godiva held its first post-sale board meeting in Brussels with new appointees – former Burberrys CEO Rose Marie Bravo, Boston Beer director Jay Margolis and Body Shop chief executive Peter Saunders – brought in by Murat Ülker to help map out strategy. Godiva sales are strongest in the US, a market of which Ülker has little knowledge.“Ülker buying Godiva isn’t just an economic exchange. There’s an exchange of global vision going on,” wrote Eyup Can, editor of Referans, a Turkish business daily.The acquisition is also interesting in light of Ülker’s reputation as a conservative firm with Islamic values. Father and son are pious Muslims who maintain a low public profile and avoid appearing in society pages – traits which set them apart from Istanbul’s business elite. But where Sabri Ülker was conservative and focused on expanding eastward, his son has other plans.“The group’s founder Sabri and current director Murat might carry the same genetic code, but the company is not the same,” says Mr Can. “Until very recently, Ülker would never have thought of producing chocolates with liqueur in them. But they didn’t hesitate for a second in buying Godiva.”Mr Kurama, who has a background in Islamic banking, shrugs off questions about the company’s alleged religious orientation.“There are very few households in Turkey that don’t use an Ülker product of some kind,” he says. “Whatever Turkey is, that’s what we are, too.”

Its shares surged 38 per cent to $6.90. This led the S&P homebuilders index to steep rises, ending up 20.3 per cent at 182.65.Other sectors performing well included semiconductors and materials. Construction stocks fell.Technology sector bellwethers Cisco Systems, which fell 6 per cent to $15.42, and Yahoo, down 1.4 per cent to $10.07, weighed on the Nasdaq Composite index. Research in Motion fell 8.3 per cent to $41.50 on a research note it may sign up fewer subscribers than expected in November due to short supply of its Storm handset.Concern over the stability of the technology sector continued to apply downward pressure on shares.But Google bucked the trend in the wider sector, rising 9.6 per cent to $282.05 after reports that it plans to scale down the number of contract workers that
it uses to augment its workforce, but not the number of its full-time employees.Hewlett-Packard shares fell 5.9 per cent to $33.60 after it posted a 2 per cent dip in fiscal fourth-quarter net income as demand for hardware slipped.The Federal Reserve on Tuesday morning unveiled a new facility aimed at boosting consumer credit and the market for mortgage-backed securities. As part of the term asset-backed securities loan facility (Talf), the latest attempt to provide liquidity to the credit markets, the Fed will extend up to $200bn in non-recourse loans to holders of securities backed by consumer and small business loans.By the close in New York, the S&P 500 was up 0.7 per cent at 857.41 while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent lower at 1,464.73. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.4 per cent higher at 8,479.86.Starbucks shares fell 7 per cent in pre-market trade after it warned following the close of the previous session of an “extremely challenging” fiscal year and a slump in sales.

792;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Case study: Pizza chain welcomes VAT cut;;Edin Basic, a former pizza chef and area manager for Starbucks, set up Firezza, an upmarket pizza chain and delivery service in 2001.The business employs 120 people across eight branches and turnover this year will be over £3m.He welcomes many of the fiscal stimulus measures announced by the chancellor on Monday, particularly support for smaller businesses like his.Bank lending has not been a problem for Firezza, which recently renewed its overdraft with the terms unchanged. However Mr Eden appreciates any lending support since he may borrow more in the next few months to help fund a £1m expansion beyond the M25.He plans to use the cut in VAT to increase his margins, which have been eroded by other government measures, such as the recent increase in the minimum wage rate.“A few pence off the price of a pizza is not going to make people buy a lot more,” he says, adding that Firezza aims to pass on some of the benefit the business receives through discounts for existing customers and the creation of a loyalty scheme.However, Mr Basic claims that he will not prosper through price competition alone.“People are shopping around more so you have to be the best in your game, not just having special offers but raising your game in terms of service,” he says.Mr Basic is most concerned about the rapid drop in the value of sterling because he imports many of his ingredients from Italy, including a tonne of a particular mozzarella cheese he cannot find in the UK.“One way we differentiate ourselves from others is the ingredients we use,” he says.VAT may have dropped in the UK, but the Italian government still levies 21 per cent VAT on the tomatoes and cheese he buys.Last year’s capital gains tax changes did not affect him because this is his first business and he was not expecting his final return to exceed the £1m cap on the entrepreneurs’ relief scheme.“If we make £1m at this stage we will be happy,” he says.He is most concerned about a revival in consumer confidence, but is uncertain as to whether any of these measures will achieve that goal.“The question is whether they will go out and spend money because of the tax breaks or save more.”
793;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-11-23T19:01:39Z;How to reinvent the Republican party;;"It is always depressing to see Starbucks deploy its Christmas-themed cups at the beginning of November. In much the same way, one does not wish to be reminded that the next US mid-term elections are just two years and one recession away. Still, facts must be faced.Two years after the election of Bill Clinton in 1992, the Republican party seized control of Congress. The Democratic administration henceforth had to work with the enemy. What can the Republicans do to make this happen again?The Republican triumph of 1994 was due to unforced errors on the administration’s side (gays in the military, the hubristic overreach of Hillary Clinton’s healthcare plan) and remarkably effective Republican leadership in Congress (Newt Gingrich and the “Contract with America”).Barack Obama faces challenges far more difficult than the ones that confronted President Clinton. This gives greater scope for momentous errors but the politics works to Mr Obama’s advantage: the country knows that the problems he faces are not of his making. The Obama team is cautious and shrewd. The missteps of the first two Clinton years are branded on its collective memory and unlikely to be repeated.Politically, the economy helps in another way. The time is not ripe for an ideological assault on activist government. Even if it were, assertive leadership in Congress of the sort the Republicans demonstrated in 1994 is very unusual. In opposition, US political parties are less than the sum of their parts. Discipline is weak to non-existent. Leadership is divided.In the past 15 years, both of Britain’s main political parties reinvented themselves in opposition; strong reform-minded leaders overcame resistance to change. In the US, that kind of top-down direction in opposition is alien. Between the election of 2000 and the nomination of Mr Obama this year, who led the Democratic party? In the British sense, the job of “opposition leader” exists only for a month or two before each presidential election.So repositioning the Republican party will not be easy and some repositioning is needed.In my view, the challenge for the party is not, as many argue, to decide whether it is a movement of social conservatives, of fiscal conservatives, or of soft libertarians. To win elections, the Republican party has to gather support from all of those groups. If any one faction comes to dominate the party – as social conservatives have lately threatened to – its prospects are diminished. To get along with each other, nevermind with the independents and uncommitted liberals whose votes the party needs, Republicans first need to develop their capacity for tolerance.Social conservatives are suspected, often with reason, of wishing to impose their values on everyone else. For the sake of their own electoral prospects and to build alliances with other segments of opinion, they need to quell that instinct, insisting only that others do not try to impose their values on them. “Live and let live”, together with a lively scepticism about government-imposed solutions, is the watchword that can bring the strands of Republicanism together. It is a distinctively American creed, as well. This centre-right nation still resonates to it.Two other things are necessary. First, the party needs to prioritise competence. In some ways this is the obverse of a more lightly worn ideology – but, in any case, necessary after the serial bungling of the Bush administration. The wide middle of the US electorate venerates results over theories. This is a pragmatic country, interested in what works.As far as possible, therefore, Republicans need to get behind the new administration’s efforts to revive the economy, helping to improve them where they can and avoiding automatic opposition for its own sake. This is a grave economic crisis, a frightening and extraordinary situation. For the next year or two, the country’s impatience with brainless partisan mud-slinging will be far more pronounced than usual.Tolerance, competence and the third thing is empathy. One of the McCain campaign’s lowest points was when a top economic adviser criticised Americans for grumbling about the economy. Astonishing. The Republicans need to show that the interests of ordinary Americans are uppermost in their minds, something they have often failed to do. Their argument with Democrats should be about how best to serve those interests: their endless willingness to cede ground on who cares more is very perplexing.A case in point: the Republicans should have gone into this election with a national plan for universal market-based healthcare (something that Republican governors in Massachusetts and California are trying to implement). If the Obama administration makes progress on this, it will be all the more necessary next time, but how stupid to have yielded the advantage.It is too early to say who the Republicans should nominate in 2012, although not to say who they should not. Sarah Palin has been a popular governor, gets a passing grade for tolerance and high marks for empathy, but in national politics she has failed the competence test beyond any hope of recovery. The party has other good governors of well-run states and some senators of promise, so this is not the problem: a strong candidate can be found. The challenge is for all Republicans, leaderless though they are. The party can unite and strive to widen its appeal, or apportion blame, purify its thinking and contract to irrelevance. After a bad defeat, never underestimate the appeal of that second course.Send your comments to clive.crook@gmail.com"
794;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-11-20T01:27:55Z;Business fights for tougher emissions rules;;Five leading US consumer companies have launched a campaign to press for ambitious regulation designed to combat global warming, as a policy battle looms in Washington over president-elect Barack Obama’s agenda on climate change.The founding members of the Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy (Bicep) coalition include Nike, Starbucks, Levi Strauss, Timberland and Sun Microsystems.The companies are backing targets that include a proposed US “cap-and-trade” emissions trading system that would be based on auctioning carbon allowances, rather than granting them free to cover a company’s existing emissions.The group also wants an end to the building of new coal-fired power plants that do not capture and store carbon emissions, and aggressive targets for both emissions reduction and the development of renewable energy sources.The objectives go far beyond those of the US Climate Action Partnership (USCAP), hitherto the main business voice on climate change policy issues.USCAP, launched in January last year, supports the introduction of carbon limits and trading. But it was set up by energy companies and industrial manufacturers such as GE and Alcoa that would be directly affected by new regulations, and reflects their views.Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, the environmental advocacy group that helped organise the Bicep coalition, said its members wanted to bring an additional business perspective to the debate.“These are consumer companies that reach millions of people a day. I think this group dug in and took a hard look, and decided that a stronger public policy position was needed from the business sector,” she said.Mr Obama said on Tuesday that the US would “engage vigorously” in climate change talks and pledged, despite the financial crisis, to stick to plans to reduce emissions sharply by 2020. He has said he will set annual targets that would reduce emissions to their 1990 levels by 2020, and 80 per cent below by 2050. In contrast, the new Bicep coalition is calling for emissions to be 25 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020, with the same 2050 target.USCAP wants far more modest targets. It also argues that “a significant portion” of emission allowances should initially be distributed free.Ben Packard, head of corporate responsibility at Starbucks, said the company had been highlighting the potential threat from climate change for several years.● Europe’s first auction of carbon dioxide permits took place on Wednesday, with the UK government reaping about £54m ($81m) from sales of 4m allowances to emit carbon under the European Union’s emissions trading scheme.The permits fetched £13.60 per tonne in an auction that was four times oversubscribed.Electricity producers were expected to be the main buyers, as they had their free allocation of permits cut by 30 per cent in the current phase of the EU scheme, which runs from 2008 to 2012.
795;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-11-18T22:44:34Z;Devicescape’s easier wi-fi aids operators;;Wi-fi can be a hard thing to figure out for a user on-the-go – all those networks, signal strengths, passwords and WEP encryption keys.While popularising wi-fi with its Centrino chipsets for laptops, Intel did a pretty poor job with the software, in my opinion, making it impossible for me to log on to some networks from my corporate notebook.So I’m glad they’ve now handed the job to someone else, in the shape of Devicescape, a Silicon Valley company backed by VC firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, among others.Its software is now used in most Intel-based laptops, as well as a host of other devices.For example, I downloaded its popular Easy Wi-Fi application for the iPod touch and entered my login details for AT&T Wi-fi. Now, when I go into a Starbucks coffee store, I just press a button on the app screen to instantly connect. Before, I had to fire up the Safari browser and re-enter all my details on the AT&T website to get online.David Fraser, Devicescape’s chief executive, tells me it should be even easier than that. As more smartphones, such as the iPhone, incorporate wi-fi chips, manufacturers are embedding Devicescape’s software to switch seamlessly between 3G and wi-fi, without the user noticing.“We’ve moved from text messaging to watching YouTube videos on the phone and this explosion of data traffic can cause problems for carriers,” he says.By shifting users onto wi-fi, where available, operators can ease any congestion. Devicescape’s technology is used in Blackberry, Motorola, Nokia and Palm smartphones. As more categories of devices include wi-fi, the company sees its market expanding – it is in the new Nintendo DS handheld console and sees opportunities in personal navigation devices and digital cameras.The company maintains a database of thousands of networks, enabling easy connections to hotspots, municipal wi-fi and services such as Meraki and Fon.The San Bruno start-up, employing 30 people, was known as Instant 802, before Mr Fraser joined four years ago and rebranded the company. It is now at cash flow break-even and is hiring staff, at a time when everyone else in the Valley seems to be cutting back.
796;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-11-17T19:35:16Z;US auto sector;;"As it scrambles for a share of the bail-out funds designated for financial firms, the US auto sector is engaging in some public relations overkill. Take the letter sent to Congress by a group of parts suppliers asking for their cut of any cash given to the sector, pointing out their much larger workforce – 590,000 people or more than double the “Big Three”. A lost job at Dana or Visteon is no less of a shame than one at General Motors or Ford, but the lobbying effort raises the question of where Washington’s gravy train should stop. How about auto dealers, who employ 1m people? Would Starbucks baristas, similar in number to GM workers, then merit a bail-out?Detroit’s lobbying blitz is aided by greater public sympathy for auto workers than Wall Street bankers, but the sector seems to be crying wolf. An industry-funded report recently grabbed headlines estimating that a “collapse” of the industry would cost 3m jobs and result in a total government tax loss of $156bn, making a mere $50bn bail-out a good deal. This assumes a highly unrealistic shutdown of every US car and car parts factory, including those that supply foreign companies, as if Michigan were hit by a cosmic blast. That imagery is used in a video posted on YouTube by GM itself, showing shockwaves engulfing Detroit before spreading across a map of the country. It also cites the “grave” threat to national security that somehow was never an issue when outsourcing auto production to China.Public sympathy may shift in the face of such hyperbole, particularly as pundits discuss the lavish wages and benefits of unionised auto workers, equal to $73.20 an hour according to economist Mark Perry. Far from a “collapse”, Chapter 11 would be painful, but it would hasten the restructuring needed to make the industry viable. It is time for some tough love.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

797;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-11-14T23:00:26Z;Have equities bottomed or are we shellshocked?;;It has been a depressing week. UK companies have cut 17,000 jobs, the Bank of England issued its bleakest assessment of the economy in 15 years, sterling sank to a 13-year low and, internationally, profit warnings from Starbucks, Intel and Nokia were among the lowlights.Surprisingly, the London market seems to have taken the bad news relatively well. The FTSE 100 may have fallen 3 per cent in the past five trading sessions, but it is still 9 per cent above October’s 5½-year low.All of which has left commission-starved brokers asking if the market has finally bottomed out. After all, equities have in the past started to recover when the economy is on the floor and many months before there has been any sign of an upturn.So have we reached the moment where bad news can’t shock anymore? When the dismal economic outlook is fully reflected in share prices and investors start to look forward to better times?The first point to make is that just because markets have bottomed in the middle of past recessions before does not necessarily mean they will do so again. As the small print of any financial document will tell you – past performance is no guide to the future. And, in any case, have we reached the middle of this particular downturn?Every recession is different and this one is the result of serious bubbles in the housing and credit markets, which took many years to build up and could take many years to unwind.In a study of 17 developed economies over three decades, the International Monetary Fund has found recessions preceded by a financial crisis tend to be deeper and longer than others and they tend to be worse again if the crisis is in banking, rather than in equities or foreign exchange. The current downturn certainly fits those criteria.In this week’s quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England’s central growth forecast suggested the year on year drop in national income would hit 1.9 per cent in the second quarter of 2009 and, for the year as a whole, the economy would shrink by 1.3 per cent, before recovering in 2010. If that estimate is correct, the economy is not yet at a floor.There have already been several false dawns. Since June 2007, there have been six bear market rallies, according to Philip Isherwood of Dresdner Kleinwort, all of which were based broadly on the same thinking – equities were cheap by historical standards, all the bad news was known and the dismal economic outlook was discounted.However, Mr Isherwood is still not convinced that equities are that cheap. If this recession is similar to the one seen in the 1980s, he says, we should expect to see similar valuations. And that would require a further downward leg in share prices.“Forget the 10.5 times earnings that the UK and European equities traded at in October 1990, or the 7.5 times and 8.3 times available today – try 6 and 7 times instead,” he says. “That would mean that, from what are meant to be ‘once-in-a lifetime’ valuations, the market could still derate by another 20 per cent.”But, as mentioned earlier, every recession is different. The 1980s recession was the worst UK downturn of the last 40 years, with a peak-to-trough fall in real gross domestic product of 6 per cent. Interest rates were much higher than now – they peaked at 17 per cent in 1980 – as was inflation.“Investors should be wary of drawing too many comparisons between the early 1980s recession and today as the macro backdrop is significantly different,” says Graham Secker of Morgan Stanley.Certainly, there is a lot for contrarian investors to get excited about – a 34.4 per cent decline for the FTSE 100 this year, the fact that most investors are bearish not bullish and valuations are at levels not seen in 20 years.But while there remains so much uncertainty about the length and depth of the recession, there is little incentive to jump in. Forget trying to pick the floor of this crisis. The best thing to do is wait until the recovery is underway even if that means missing out on some early gains.neil.hume@ft.com
798;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-11-11T21:47:58Z;Wall Street beset by economic fears;Commodity prices help push market down;Further signs of difficulties facing companies in a range of sectors conspired with lower commodity prices on Tuesday to push US stocks sharply lower for a second successive session. Materials was the worst-performing sector, down 4.2 per cent, on fears over the health of the global economy.Alcoa became the latest aluminium producer to cut production, with plans for a reduction of 350,000 tonnes a year. Its shares lost 7.1 per cent to $10.94.“More cuts might be needed,” said Friedman, Billings, Ramsay, which halved its price target on the stock to $10 and cut its recommendation to “market perform”.The energy sector was also a big loser as crude oil slid below $60.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 2.2 per cent at 898.95 points after volatile, Veterans Day thinned trading, as once again the commodity price declines afforded other sectors scant relief.Down as much as 3.7 per cent, the market pared losses in afternoon trading and the financial sector briefly entered positive territory after regulators unveiled plans to limit home foreclosures through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Still, the sell-off left the S&P 500 only 50 points away from the five-year low the market hit two weeks ago.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2 per cent lower to 8,693.96 points and the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 2.2 per cent to 1,580.90 points.In financials, which stood 2.4 per cent lower by the close, American Express fell 6.6 per cent to $22.40 even though analysts broadly welcomed the credit card group’s move to become a bank holding company, which could cut its borrowing costs.“Funding . . . was not our primary concern,” wrote Oppenheimer analysts in a note. “Consumer credit losses have been.”Goldman Sachs gained 4.9 per cent to $74.68 after a sharp fall in the previous session. The recovery came even though analysts at Fox-Pitt Kelton joined several others in forecasting a fourth-quarter loss for the bank.American International Group, which jumped 8.1 per cent in the previous session after the Federal Reserve unveiled a revised $150bn rescue plan for the ailing insurer, edged 0.9 per cent lower to $2.26.Alan Ruskin, of RBS Global Banking & Markets, said: “I see no reason why the financial sector should foresee anything better than a protracted rounded bottom or u-shaped recovery when it comes, and that won’t happen before [the second half of] 2009 at the very earliest.”Citigroup slid 3.7 per cent to $10.80 after the bank unveiled plans to rework $20bn of mortgages.Stock in General Motors, which was already at levels not touched since the 1940s, slid 13.1 per cent to $2.92 on heightened fears for the future of the carmaker. Ford lost 6.7 per cent to $1.80.Their declines came even after Nancy Pelosi, house speaker, backed an emergency rescue plan for the ailing industry.A profit warning from Tyco, down 11.7 per cent to $14.13, pushed the industrials sector lower. The lowered guidance came in spite of better than expected fourth-quarter earnings.Defensive areas once again held up relatively well and consumer staples outperformed the market, down 1.5 per cent. Procter & Gamble did better than most, falling 1.7 per cent lower to $63.82 after the group raised its outlook.Technology was 2.1 per cent lower overall. Hardware came under particular pressure after Barclays Capital issued a bearish outlook on the sector, “given continued deterioration in spending from corporations and consumers into year-end, weakness in the PC supply chain and the potential for inventory builds”.Hewlett-Packard and Dell shed 2.7 per cent to $33.25 and 4.5 per cent to $11.33, respectively, after Barclays cut revenue estimates on the companies for the second time in a month.Google hit a fresh low for the year, down 2.3 per cent to $311.46, after Goldman Sachs downgraded its revenue forecast on the search group. “Revenue should react rapidly to macro deterioration,” the bank said.Consumer discretionaries came under pressure as Starbucks fell 2.1 per cent to $9.99 after the coffee chain reported a fall in comparable fourth-quarter US sales.
799;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-11-11T20:51:36Z;Starbucks;;"Starbucks has been troubled for the last two years. Its problems began with the cannibalisation of existing stores and rapid international expansion that failed to translate into a significant contribution to profits. To that were added rising costs for milk, rents and wages, and finally an outright economic recession, prompting the shares to lose almost three-quarters of their value in the past two years. From a growth stock that routinely traded on 50 times prospective earnings, it carries a mere 12 times multiple.Fourth quarter results released on Monday provide plenty of reasons for disdain. As US consumers tighten belts, fewer people are visiting Starbucks coffee shops and they are spending less money on its premium priced food and drink while they are there. Sales in locations open for more than 12 months dropped 8 per cent on the year before. An election day promotion reportedly drove a significant increase in traffic to its stores since the end of the quarter, but then, giving your product away for free is rarely a solid foundation on which to build a turnround.The outlook remains bleak for next year. Management predicts flat sales, with cost cutting and store closures designed to protect margins. But the shares price in very little future growth in either sales or profitability. Capital expenditure has been reassigned to improving existing stores – an approach that McDonald’s eventually hit upon earlier this decade after a relentless focus on expansion had caused it to stumble. There is potential for a similar improvement in Starbucks’ domestic profitability, while any boost to its international operations, where expansion continues apace, would give a double-shot to earnings. The example of McDonald’s suggests that this is a slow and difficult process, complicated further by the downturn. Yet with expectations so low, only the smallest of pick-me-ups is required.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click here

800;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks hit as consumers slow spending;;Starbucks, the world’s largest coffee-shop chain, on Monday reported a sharp fall in fourth quarter comparable sales at its US locations, and a decline in customer visits to its UK outlets, as budget-conscious customers cut back spending.But Howard Schultz, chief executive, said the decline in its US business that had begun over a year ago as the economy slowed, showed some signs of stabilising in October.“Though it is too early to call a trend, October did not show further deterioration,” he said, adding that this was a possible indication that the fourth quarter “may have indicated a bottoming-out milestone for our company”.During the quarter, earnings dropped to $5.4m, from $158.5m for the same period a year ago, as it absorbed $105.1m in restructuring costs due to store closures and other initatives. Revenues increased three per cent to $2.5bn.Mr Schultz, who built Starbucks into a global business in the 1990s, resumed the chief executive’s position in January this year amid growing concerns over its performance and service standards.He subsequently announced the closure of 600 US stores with the loss of 1,000 jobs, as well as a series of measures aime at increasing customer satisfaction, such as new food offerings and a loyalty card programme.Mr Schultz said the company had gone through a transitional year, and had begun its new fiscal year in October “with a healthier store portfolio that will allow for operating margin expansion”.In an indication of the uncertainties facing consumer demand, the company issued a range of forecast earnings for the new fiscal year, based on possible comparable sales declines of between 2 and 7 per cent, that ranged between 78 and 59 cents per diluted share.The company’s total store base in the US will decline by 20 stores next year, compared with over the 1,000 new stores opened in 2007. Internationally it now plans to open 700 new stores, two thirds of them operated under licence, down from a previous target of 900.Internationally, the company reported a 13 per cent increase in revenues to $533.6m, driven primarly by newly licensed stores.The performance of Starbucks stores – which sell comparatively “premium” discretionary coffee drinks – contrasted with the latest October sales figures on Monday from McDonald’s, the fast food restaurant chain. McDonald’s said that comparable sales at its US stores were up 5.3 per cent, with global comparable sales up 8.3 per cent.McDonald’s low-cost meals have been attracting customers who are increasingly focused on saving money, even as more up-market family restaurants have seen sales and traffic decline.Starbucks shares fell over 2 per cent in after-hours trading to $9.95.
801;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-11-10T22:32:55Z;Financials lead Wall St declines;;Wall Street stocks failed to cling onto early gains on Monday as China’s near $600bn economic stimulus package did little to assuage fears for the growth prospects of some of the biggest names in corporate America.The bankruptcy of a well-known retailer, concerns over the fate of shareholders in the nation’s automakers and drastic losses at AIG and Freddie Mac sent many stocks to multi-year lows.Financials led the declines, down 4.4 per cent overall. Goldman Sachs hit a five-year low, down 8.5 per cent to $71.21, after analysts at Barclays became the latest to forecast a fourth-quarter loss, citing in part its exposure to private equity.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed down 1.3 per cent at 919.21 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.8 per cent at 8,870.54 and the Nasdaq Composite Index 1.9 per cent at 1,616.74.The market had risen as much as 2.3 per cent on the hope that the Chinese plan could lessen an expected global slump. Hard-hit construction, material and energy stocks were given a particular boost. New projects such as railways and airports as well as rebuilding earthquake-hit areas seemed likely to form a key plank of the Chinese government’s plan and the move sparked hopes of a floor in commodity prices.Also helping the market earlier, the Federal Reserve unveiled a revised $150bn rescue plan for AIG.The shares jumped 8.1 per cent to $2.28 in spite of third quarter figures from the struggling insurer that showed a net loss of $24.5bn .Stocks retreated as familiar concerns returned to the fore. Among the biggest, General Motors shed 23 per cent to $3.36 after Deutsche Bank set a price target of zero for the shares and recommended clients sell them.The bank said that while necessary for its survival, a government bail-out would do little to help shareholders. “Even if GM succeeds in averting a bankruptcy, we believe that the company’s future path is likely to be bankruptcy-like,” Deutsche analysts wrote, adding that “equity shareholders are unlikely to get anything”.Barclays also downgraded its recommendation on the stock and cut its price target from $4 to $1.Ford lost 4.5 per cent to $1.93 in spite of further signs that the pair, along with privately-held Chrysler, would secure government assistance. Credit Suisse called Ford’s cash burn “eye-popping” and also lowered its price target from $4 to $1.Best Buy rallied as much as 7.3 per cent on hopes the bankruptcy of smaller rival Circuit City would provide an opportunity for the electronics retailer to expand.Best Buy had previously said it could take over stores that struggling rivals closed. Yet the shares closed down 1.5 per cent to $25.21.Other retailers came under pressure after Barclays Capital issued a bearish outlook on a series of department stores after last week’s October sales figures.“We remain especially concerned about declining access to consumer credit and higher finance charges for consumer credit card balances,” the bank said in a report.Macy’s tumbled 9.3 per cent to $9.94 after Barclays cut its price target on the stock from $18 to $15.Starbucks fell 3.3 per cent to $10.20 and a further 2.8 per cent in after-hours trade, when the coffee chain disclosed fourth quarter profit slumped 97 per cent, hurt by the cost of closing underperforming stores.Earlier, UBS trimmed its forecasts and said that “new smoothies did not seem to drive significant sales”.Defensive names were among the biggest winners. Among them, upbeat like-for-like sales figures from McDonald’s lifted the burger chain 1.8 per cent to $56.48, and gave the fast food sector a boost.Delivery stocks United Parcel Service and Fedex rose after rival Deutsche Post unveiled plans to scrap domestic express services in the US.UPS and Fedex climbed 3.2 per cent to $53.60 and 2.7 per cent to $66.29 respectively, as the move is expected to allow the dominant US duo to take yet more market share.Dish Network slid 14.7 per cent to $13.24 after the satellite television group said quarterly profits dropped more than half. DIRECTV Group, its larger rival with which communications group AT&T has struck a deal to replace Dish in providing bundled deals, gained 1.1 per cent to $22.17.
802;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-11-07T17:46:39Z;Hong Kong banks;;Financial centres evolve like organisms. When a flowering plant struggles for light and air, it grows by shooting out seeds a safe distance from the parent. A similar thing happened in New York and London, after space shortages on Wall Street and in the City forced institutions to compete elsewhere. In Hong Kong banks are being driven across Victoria Harbour by a lack of grade-A real estate in Central, the business centre on Hong Kong island. But, unlike the orderly dispersions to Midtown and Canary Wharf, this is happening at a time of extreme stress in the financial services industry. Does the new ecosystem stand a chance of survival?Probably. The seedlings are being housed, initially at least, in the International Commerce Centre, a new 118-storey building in West Kowloon, on the edge of the Chinese mainland. Although only three-quarters completed, it offers all the usual accoutrements – Starbucks, gym and inhouse dry cleaning – that shell-shocked i-bankers need to survive the winter. Developer Sun Hung Kai Properties is used to dealing with Hong Kong’s yo-yoing trade flows: the building is 80 per cent pre-committed, and will not be completed for another two years. By then SHKP should have found occupiers for the remainder from Hong Kong’s more durable breeds of accountants and lawyers.The anchor tenants – Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse among them – are on long-term deals between a third and a fifth of the cost of equivalent space in Central. That price differential is beginning to erode. Softening demand caused Central rents to fall in September, reckons Jones Lang LaSalle, ending an up-cycle that began after Sars was banished five years ago. But, crucially, Central remains tight. The vacancy rate is 1.7 per cent, according to Savills, versus a long-run average of between 5 and 6 per cent. Even if big bank redundancies continue – DBS, south-east Asia’s biggest bank, said on Friday it planned to cut 6 per cent of its workforce – it may make sense to drift across the water.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click
803;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-11-05T20:28:41Z;Let’s meet when it’s over;;"It is here. The recession that many hoped would never come, or prayed they would not have to deal with, has arrived. Others can carry on debating how and why it has happened. Business leaders will want to know what they need to do now.The usual cycle of responses to a huge shock or upset – denial, anger, bargaining, depression and finally acceptance – is of limited use. Cut straight to acceptance, and then action. But what kind?In downturns, it is extraordinary how quickly managers rediscover business virtues that appeared to have been forgotten in the good times. Today the cry is “preserve cash”. Cut unnecessary entertaining. End business class travel and five-star accommodation. Get out of the taxi and back on the bus.But few businesses shrink their way to success. So, even now, smart companies will be trying to plot a path back to profitability.In a new paper for the Boston Consulting Group, David Rhodes, Daniel Stelter and Shubh Saumya argue that well-run companies can be ready to make big, recession-combating structural changes only four to six weeks after beginning their analysis of the situation.Managers need to start by considering the worst-case scenarios. “Even for many still-healthy companies, a drop in sales of around 20 per cent is sufficient to turn profits into huge losses and to send cash flow deep into the red,” they write.Once the top team has grasped the possible severity of the situation, there are four priorities: “To protect the financial fundamentals, to identify ways to protect the existing business, to manage for the long term and optimise the relative valuation of the company.”If you do not already have one, produce a weekly report on your cash position, BCG says. To protect the existing business, consider your pricing points. In the 1930s companies innovated around cheaper product ranges. The McDonald’s $1 menu or Danone’s Eco-Pack yoghurt in France are current examples of this. General Electric first developed its financing business in the Depression, helping customers purchase refrigerators with credit.For the long term, BCG echoes the advice offered by Intel’s Andy Grove. Downturns are the best time to invest in research and development and product innovation, he used to say. Boldness now will help create new products that are ready for the market when it starts to recover.With asset prices so low, acquisitions should also be possible, at least for those companies with relatively healthy balance sheets. “It’s time to go shopping,” Caroline Firstbrook, Accenture’s European head of strategy consulting, told a recent “dealing with the downturn” seminar in London.Getting some of these core challenges right – pricing, products and M&A – is essential. But perhaps companies also need to grasp something more fundamental about the way the rules for business will change during and after this recession. Umair Haque, director of the Havas Media Lab, a consultancy, recently wrote a provocative article for Business Week magazine which declared that “traditional recession strategies are doomed to fail this time”.He argued that conventional business models – big industrial beasts pushing out more and more product – are doomed. He had Starbucks in his sights: “Starbucks tried to grow by selling us more junk we don’t need – music, mugs and mouse pads,” he wrote.“What do we need in the 21st century – not just as brain-dead consumers, but as global citizens?” Mr Haque continued. “We need opportunities to grow and amplify our capabilities. For Starbucks that might mean, instead of hawking mugs and chocolates, training baristas to teach classes in coffee-making, letting communities use Starbucks as a venue for local government, or, at the limit, training local suppliers from developing countries as baristas in developed ones. How cool would that be? Very.” (But how profitable? It is not quite so clear.)That critique may sound a little too flaky to business leaders who want quick wins now, simply to survive. For more practical ideas consider Adrian Slywotzky and Richard Wise’s sensibly titled book How to Grow When Markets Don’tThe authors have some simple suggestions that might just work. They ask a basic but important question: are all your customers really the same? On closer inspection you may have different customer segments lurking there that need to be served (and charged) differently. This offers the possibility of boosting revenues.Do you have any special (and lucrative) customer relationships? Perhaps you are adopting specific approaches with these customers that could be copied and profitably introduced elsewhere. And are you really charging the right price for some of your valuable goods and services? Maybe there is concealed value in a bundle of services that are currently being offered at one price. Budget airlines have found a large number of ways to charge more for goods and services which customers used to enjoy for free. It can be done.Finally, there is you, the boss. What about your own personal recession-beating strategy? Times like these will place enormous pressure on business leaders. Physical and mental health are valuable assets. You will need to be at your fittest if your leadership is not to suffer.Peter Shaw and Steve Wigzell, executive coaches at the Praesta consultancy, have written a guide for senior managers leading teams through tough trading conditions. Leaders should understand how closely their behaviour will be scrutinised. “As a leader, be conscious that everything about you gives a message to your organisation; not only your words, but your posture, facial expression, tone of voice and appearance,” they write.“The perception of your mood will spread like wildfire and will often become distorted through gossip. When one CEO asked his chairman what was the single most important thing he should be doing, the reply was: ‘Smile’.”Smiling will not be enough to steer your business through the next few months. And as the Praesta coaches point out, when you are highly visible to others keeping up a cheerful act is exhausting.The businesses that do make it through to calmer, post-downturn times will have basic balance sheet strength. They will stem all unnecessary outflows of cash. They will price their goods and services keenly, but also imaginatively. And they will continue to plan for the future, remembering that all downturns come to an end.Simple, really. What is everyone getting so worried about?"
804;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-10-15T05:59:26Z;How to improve Eden?;;"Sleaford is how England used to be – or maybe just the way some like to imagine it. The drive into the Lincolnshire town passes mock-Tudor houses and neat bungalows set back from tidy verges. There’s a traffic jam at the rail crossing – there usually is – where drivers sit patiently with scarcely a complaining toot of the horn as a train chugs past.The high street, Southgate, is a rambling collection of independent shops and small cafés – not a Starbucks in sight. The town boasts the 12th-century church of St Denys, a canal that used to connect to the national waterway network and the Navigation Yard, once headquarters for the town canal system, now a museum celebrating local history. An old seed warehouse has been converted into The Hub, the National Centre for Craft and Design.With 61 per cent of the population married – the second highest rate in England and Wales – it seems only right that Sleaford is the corporate base of Interflora, the company that says it with flowers. Crime figures are low, with 28 offences per 1,000 residents compared with 61 nationally, according to Home Office figures for 2006 and 2007. Employment – historically dependent on agriculture and now on education, health, local government and nearby Royal Air Force stations such as Cranwell and Coningsby – stands at 79 per cent, while wages are £414 per week on average compared with £429.70 nationally. And it is just over an hour to London by train from nearby Grantham station.Perhaps not surprisingly, Sleaford is one of the fastest-growing communities in the country, its population doubling to 17,000 in the past 15 years. It is hard to imagine what can be done to improve this semi-detached Eden. But the town is also the site of an extraordinary building, The Maltings, which – like the Baltic art centre in Gateshead and the Mima art gallery in Middlesbrough, both in north-east England – is being transformed into a symbol of change and revitalisation.Completed in 1907 for Bass Breweries to process the locally grown barley, the structure looms out of the flat countryside like a great red cliff of brick. There are nine blocks, each of 5,420 sq metres, spread across eight hectares, with a central core that contained the engine rooms, boiler room kilns, granaries, even an artesian well. It is, say proud locals, 10 times the size of London’s Tate Modern gallery, itself once a power station.The Grade ll*-listed Maltings closed in 1958 and, after a spell when it was used for chicken rearing, it was threatened with demolition. But developer Gladedale Group saw the potential and enlisted the aid of the Prince’s Regeneration Trust to advise on the rebuilding.“The buildings are robust and beautifully crafted,” says Michael Cocks, the development manager. “The malthouse blocks to the east were badly hit by a fire in 1999 and parts of them will be carefully removed to create public courtyards that will bring in light and sun for people sitting in a bar or restaurant.”Gladedale’s proposals, which are estimated to cost £55m, are to convert the blocks to apartments and a “health village”, including a doctor’s surgery and chemist. One block will be used as an office for a single company and as a repository for many of the historic industrial features. Six blocks will be converted into about 200 one- to three-bedroom flats while two blocks will be used for car parking.Work has been delayed by the very 21st century problem of securing the fate of eight protected species of bat and 27 kinds of birds. But final permission to go ahead is expected this autumn, with the five-year project expected to start next year. “The Maltings and new estates to the north and east will help us increase the population by another 6,000,” says Alan Gray, economic development manager of the local North Kesteven District Council. “We don’t have enough people who both live and work here.”The challenge for Sleaford is not just rebuilding The Maltings but also integrating it with the town. First a walkway will connect it to Southgate via a new Tesco supermarket, which is to be built on the site of another disused seed warehouse; then a road will be laid from the centre through a park and over the railway line to former breweries. The latter project is the subject of much protest because it threatens a row of fine old oaks but “it will get the go-ahead,” Gray says. “It has to.”With those ambitious projects underway the rest of the improvements to the town will be on a small scale – which is as it should be. Emphasis will be on culture – 12 years ago the town had no museums; now it has three – and the arts, which has seen 68 pieces of public art commissioned by the council.Southgate has benefited from the removal of unnecessary road signs, de-cluttering that sits well with a centre that boasts a mix of flats, terraces, family homes and retirement complexes that would be the envy of progressive developers. The conversion of another four-storey seed warehouse by the station has provided 32 one- and two-bedroom flats aimed at young people and the disabled.“The town does not have the space for big developments so we have used regional funding to develop the alleyways, outbuildings and small outlets to …encourage the growth of small shops,” Gray says. “We deliberately went against having pedestrianised streets because we want to keep the centre alive and lively.”Shop owner Karen Berry, 44, who owns the Lavender Yard furniture shop on Southgate and lives with her flight instructor husband and three daughters in Quarrington, a village now joined to Sleaford, cannot wait for the changes. “There is room for improvement,” she says. “The town needs the mix to help increase confidence and to attract people here. As long as The Maltings doesn’t take business away it will be fantastic.”Although estate agent Mark Rice reports that business has decreased by “50 to 60 per cent” since last year, with property prices “10 to 12 per cent lower”, he agrees that The Maltings development bodes well for the long term. His agency is selling a flat in a town-centre block for £82,500, and a range of semi-detached and three-bedroom homes for about £150,000, while prices for detached homes are as high as £350,000. His most expensive property is a six-bedroom former farmhouse for £449,950.District councillor Marion Brighton also sees a bright future for Sleaford even as it holds on to its past. “We need shops to attract the young but, above all, we like Sleaford as it is,” she says. “It may be a growing market town but we don’t want to be a new town or change too much because people are looking for the lifestyle we offer.”Mark Rice, tel: +44 (0)1529-414 488, www.markrice.co.uk"
805;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-10-10T08:48:21Z;Asian market rout;;Don’t even think about stopping by Starbucks. European traders this morning hit their desks after a day of carnage in Asia: markets were thrashed, bond sales pulled and a Japanese life insurer went belly-up.Devastation in a part of the world where, broadly speaking, there are still big pots of cash and banking systems are solvent speaks volumes for the power of fear. Exposure to subprime, the genesis of the crisis, is tiny – 5 per cent of global bank write-offs, on HSBC’s reckoning. But just as greed always wins over rational behaviour on the upside, so fear calls the shots on the way down. Hence the Japanese stock market plunged 10 per cent in morning trading and now trades at less than book value. The Indonesian stock market is closed indefinitely and questions swirl over the solvency of the archipelago’s richest family. Safe havens? Forget it. Japanese government bonds plunged almost 2 full points on Friday morning.So if current account surpluses, robust capital adequacy ratios and still decent rates of economic growth (the IMF is pencilling in 8.4 per cent for developing Asia) count for nothing, just how safe is Asia? On the plus side, most governments have the fiscal firepower to spend their way out. Since large parts of the region still need more roads and bridges, this need not end up mimicking Japan’s preponderance of bridges to nowhere. Better, there is already a trend of increasing spending on soft infrastructure like healthcare and education. But any regional solution, or even co-ordination, is simply pie in the sky. Asia is many times more diversified than Europe, with countries at all levels of political and economic development. Upcoming elections and a posse of new and untested governments further muddy the waters. Most economies are too undiversified and reliant on exports. It may have gone into the crisis as best in class, but if the whole ship goes down Asia could find it as hard as any to struggle back on.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click here
806;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-09-16T17:58:23Z;A new way to get people to pay;;Alex Rampell sits with a Starbucks coffee in front of him and ponders the strange contradictions in what people are willing to pay for, and what they are not. “Here I am prepared to spend $3.50 on a cup of coffee. But somehow, I don’t want to pay 99 cents for a music download…People don’t like paying for digital products.”Mr Rampell, a 27-year-old entrepreneur, has built a business on this insight. He co-founded his company, TrialPay, two years ago on the suspicion that customers who do not want to pay for a product such as software might still be prepared to pay for something else – and get the software for free.WinZip, for example, currently asks customers to pay $29.95 at its online store to download one of its file readers. But those who balk at paying can get the software for free by using TrialPay’s system to opt for over 150 alternative transactions from a range of companies. They might, for instance, spend $50 on clothes at Gap.com, or sign up for an American Express credit card.The successful advertiser then pays WinZip a fee for delivering a new customer, while TrialPay receives a small payment for its intermediary role along the way.Since 2006, more than 6,000 merchants have used TrialPay’s online customer acquisition system and more than 10m people have made purchases through the system, up from 5m at the start of this year.In February, the company secured $12.7m in second-round funding from Index Ventures and other investors, after raising $3.1m last year from a group led by Battery Ventures, with angel investors Bob Pittman, a former AOL executive, and Ron Conway, an early investor in Google and PayPal.The idea for TrialPay originated from Mr Rampell’s own experiences as a software retailer, which began at an alarmingly early age. In 1991, when he was just 10 years old, he launched a screensaver product into the world of shareware (software that is freely available on the web, with suggested payments made to the originator under an honour code).“I uploaded it to CompuServe and AOL and I got a cheque in the mail a few days later for $5. I thought this was the best thing ever. And I kept doing that throughout high school and college,” he says.His big early success came when he created his “Always Online” shareware in 1996 – a program that allowed frustrated AOL subscribers to acquire and hold on to overloaded dial-in lines. He created the product for his own use in about four hours, but then decided to sell it initially for $8 a copy.“It sold about 100,000 copies in a very short period of time. I was only 15,” he says. “Then AOL banned the product, and that was great for me. It was, like, big bad AOL is going after this little kid.”Since he was still at boarding school in Andover, Massachusetts, the need to attend a summer school programme forced Mr Rampell to subcontract handling of the payments. He also used the business as the basis for a school essay on price elasticity. At Harvard, aged 19, he was featured in a New York Times article on dorm-room internet business operators.After leaving college in 2003, Mr Rampell continued his software business, now called Rampell Software and employing several college friends. Its main products were a site-security application called SiteAdvisor and SureType, a keyboard shortcuts product.However, as the internet boomed the shareware market began to stagnate, since fewer and fewer users were willing to make the voluntary payments. “A lot of people don’t like paying for digital goods, and I found this out first-hand,” Mr Rampell says. “The question is how do you convert that 99.7 per cent who try but don’t buy, or browse but don’t buy? That’s where the initial concept of TrialPay came from.”Rampell Software formed its first relationship with NetFlix, the online DVD-rental service, offering customers SiteAdvisor for free if they signed up with NetFlix, and making his money from NetFlix rather than his customer. Other deals followed.“We made a lot more money on a unit basis by referring our customers to third-party, blue-chip advertisers like Discover, and Experian, Gap and NetFlix than we did from selling our products directly,” he says.The experience convinced him that the future of his business lay in the system, rather than the site software. Mr Rampell sold Site-Advisor to McAfee in 2006, and SureType to Research in Motion, which now uses it in its BlackBerry mobile devices.TrialPay’s range of products is now extending into other “transactional advertising” such as online coupons, or cross-selling discount offers. These can include offers of special discounts at other retailers if a customer spends above a target amount, or offers of deals at other retailers if he or she spends anything at all.Its latest development is a series of time-limited offers from other online merchants after the conclusion of a purchase. It is partly a recognition of the fact that, while TrialPay’s “pay in lieu” solution works well with lower-cost products, it is harder to find someone prepared to cover the costs of giving away bigger-ticket items, such as television sets.“If you think about transactional advertising, it works for pretty much anything,” he says. “Say you are buying software. You have entered you credit card details so we know where you live. Do you want a $10 coupon off the restaurant downstairs?”Mr Rampell argues that TrialPay is driving inefficiencies out of the web to the benefit of the consumer. He says his service is a way of turning some of the money that a retailer is willing to pay to acquire a customer into savings for that customer – unlike paid search, where the money goes to the search engine company.“The whole idea of customer acquisition right now doesn’t benefit anyone – except maybe Google,” he says.“It should benefit the customer if you can come up for a better way to acquire him or her.”He warmly cites the example of Amazon, which boosts the value of transactions by promoting cross-selling between categories and offering free delivery to those who spend more than $25. Mr Rampell argues that TrialPay can do the same, with products such as post-transaction coupons and a multitude of cross-selling opportunities between smaller online retailers.“There are hundreds of thousands of small sellers out there…What we’re trying to do is turn anybody into Amazon.”
807;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;Poland is cream in the cup for Coffeeheaven;;When Richard Worthington launched his Coffeeheaven chain in Poland nine years ago, the takeaway paper coffee cup, so loved by urbanites in the US and the UK, was nowhere to be seen on the streets of Warsaw. The idea was even frowned on by some Varsovians.“We got people saying ‘I don’t want to drink coffee from an American paper cup’. They were used to drinking from porcelain and the only way we could make our business profitable was if we were to develop takeaway.“But then we had a bit of luck. A popular magazine featured a cup of coffee with our logo on it describing it as cool. So it became acceptable and fashionable to be seen in the street with a paper Coffeeheaven cup.”Mr Worthington spotted his opportunity on a business trip to the Polish capital in the late 1990s when looking for a place to buy a cup of coffee.The dearth of ristrettos in comfy, western-style surroundings gave the former Estée Lauder executive an idea that he has since turned into a business of 89 stores spanning eastern and central Europe and the Baltic states.According to Allegra Strategies, a research consultancy, the regions in which he is operating have become thirsty for western habits and products, especially upmarket coffee.The Aim-listed company does not have operations in the UK nor does it plan to. Instead it has focused on eastern and central Europe and the Baltic, where it believes it has plenty of room to expand.Jeffrey Young, Allegra managing director, says: “Eastern Europe is virgin territory in terms of coffee bars …success is associated with the west and so there is an appetite for western things.”While Coffeeheaven has ridden the growing wave of demand for branded coffee, more recently it has also benefited from the surge of the Polish zloty and the Czech koruna.In Poland, Coffeeheaven’s biggest and most advanced market, it runs 53 stores and controls just over a fifth of a still-fragmented market, according to Allegra. It also runs 36 stores across the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania.The Polish business is described as “very profitable”. For the year to March 31, like-for-like sales grew 16 per cent and operating profits were £2.1m.Coffeeheaven’s growth has not gone unnoticed by some of the world’s larger operators and in recent months there have been rumours of the company being a takeover target.Whitbread’s Costa Coffee has launched in the region, although with mixed success. Its Polish franchise partner is looking for an exit, although Whitbread says it is trading well. Starbucks has a handful of stores in the Czech Republic and Romania.Shares in Coffeeheaven have were buoyed by speculation, hitting a high of 43¾p in June, but they have since dropped back to 36½p. Mr Worthington refuses to comment on whether the company has been approached and says that when he started out there was no big game plan to get the business up and running and then sell.He is scathing of the “push-button” approach of big operators such as Starbucks. “I am not convinced that coffee bars work as truly ‘global businesses’. Coffee bars are very personal and individual – very much ‘your place’ – and by definition it’s difficult to personalise something that is global.Coffeeheaven is set to expand, but it has drawn criticism for not advancing at a ristretto- fuelled rate. “We have always had a target of 350 stores but it could be 200 and it could be 500. We’ve never put a time scale on it.”Mr Worthington cites the example of Gerry Ford, founder of Caffè Nero, who faced the same criticisms in the early stages of building his business.“If we could open 500 stores we would have done it. In some of these markets you’re never going to build 200 stores in two years, maybe in 10 years. The market just isn’t ready. It’s taken us eight years to get to nearly 100 stores in seven countries. Some markets are at different stages. Romania is where Poland was in 1999. It’s a long-term game.”
808;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-09-05T18:08:31Z;Slowdown forces Costa Coffee to redesign;;Costa Coffee is redesigning its stores and opening drive-though cafés to encourage people to keep drinking its cappuccinos and lattes in spite of rising prices and a weakening economy.“Nobody will be immune if the economic environment worsens,” said John Derkach, managing director of the coffee chain, adding businesses come under more pressure to give customers something they really need in a deteriorating economy. “That’s why we’re making our appearance better.”Costa, which has some 780 stores in the UK – making it the country’s biggest coffee chain – is creating what it describes as more “comfortable” stores with leather couches, wooden tables placed several feet apart and low-hanging lamps.People are more likely to think £2.25 is a reasonable price to pay for a cup of coffee if they buy it in “a great environment”, Mr Derkach said. All new Costa stores will be fitted with the furnishings, with about half its stores fitted out by the end of the year.Although Costa’s like-for-like sales were running at 6 per cent in the first quarter, analysts expect them to have slowed in the second quarter.Whitbread, the hotel and restaurant group that has owned Costa since 1995, will update the market on recent sales on Thursday. Costa accounts for about 8 per cent of Whitbread’s operating profits.Costa’s refurnishing emulates similar moves by McDonald’s, which has brought designer armchairs, long narrow tables and striped wallpaper into its restaurants over the past few years. The changes helped boost sales.Costa has been raising the price of its coffee to compensate for the rising cost of milk and coffee beans.“Just about every foodstuff is increasing in cost at the moment,” Mr Derkach said, adding that the group cannot afford to be complacent if it wants to meet its goal of doubling the number of stores its owns globally – about 1,100 – over the next five years.Costa expects to open most of its new stores in international markets, particularly China, Russia and the Middle East, and this year plans to move into the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Turkey.It is also still expanding in the UK and is now following the lead of Starbucks and setting up drive-through coffee shops. It opens its first drive-through – which will also have a café in which people can sit down – in Ashford, Kent in October.“We don’t know if it will be a big idea or not,” Mr Derkach said. Jeffrey Young, managing director of research group Allegra Strategies, said coffee chains were following the path taken by fast food chains, many of which have drive-throughs, as they expand.“They want to access consumers in different ways,” Mr Young said.Starbucks opened its first drive-through in April in Cardiff.Islandrive, an independent coffee store, opened a drive-though in November at the Thurrock shopping park in Essex. As well as coffee it also sells snacks such as smoothies and sandwiches. “Out of town, there’s very little on offer,” said Matt O’Halloran, Islandrive’s founder.

Uncover the Extraordinary Opportunities That Lead to Business Breakthroughs
Craig Stull, Phil Myers and David Meerman Scott
John Wiley & Sons, $27.95

Why do big companies routinely overlook new opportunities that are apparently staring them in the face? Why did Nestlé and Kraft fail to predict the popularity of Starbucks, for example? Why did not American Airlines or Delta Air Lines create Southwest Airlines?Marketing consultants Craig Stull, Phil Myers and David Meerman Scott offer a simple explanation: most of the time, companies look at customers and markets from inside their current operations, rather than adopting an “outside-in” perspective: they simply don’t see things as customers do.Their book offers a six-step recipe for overcoming this tendency. The first, most important step sounds obvious: search for the problems customers want solving. But this, it turns out, is easier said than done.Many executives mistakenly think that because they are experts in their product or service they are experts in their customers’ problems. But the two are not the same. Organisations often pay lip-service to solving customer problems, but the focus of their innovation efforts is to solve their own problems: to feed factories with orders, achieve targets and extend their brands’ reach.Sometimes they focus too hard on what their existing customers want. However, the fact that they are already customers usually means they want just a variation on what they are already getting. This stops companies looking at opportunities to serve people who are not yet customers.Sometimes managers may equate innovation with new technologies, overlooking more basic customer problems. Sometimes they are so focused on “beating the competition” that they forget about customers. Sometimes they are so obsessed with revenue targets that they push products at customers rather than listening to them.To avoid these pitfalls executives should follow some simple rules, such as get out of the office, directly observe what people do and listen carefully to what they have to say. Then, think hard about the problems you see. You’ll know your “tuned-in” thinking is working when the product or service you come up with “resonates” – when you don’t have to educate or persuade customers to buy it, because it simply sells itself.This approach is the linchpin of the book. The other five steps involve detailed implementation. Step two is to identify different “buying personas” – that is, “definable groups of people who share the same problems”. The authors cite the example of car-sharing firm Zipcar, which deliberately appeals to different groups – city dwellers wanting the occasional use of a car, landlords wanting to offer a little extra to their tenants, and the environmentally concerned – with just slight service and communication tweaks.Step three is to get hard data: are people prepared to pay for it? (Market research is not a substitute for insight; it should be a product of this insight.) Step four is to make every step of the buyer process an experience that resonates, from discovering and buying the product through its packaging, use and after-sales. Step five is about articulating the idea (which is about buyer beliefs, not product descriptions) and step six is about communicating it (stop pitching your product and create information that answers buying personas’ questions).So far, so good: it is hard to disagree with anything the authors say. But the case studies they dwell on – such as Disneyland at its inception, event ticket market StubHub and wedding planning service The Knot – are all examples of the creation of new markets and/or business models. The few examples they cite of innovations within mature markets, such as a TV remote that beeps if you lose it, appear lame in comparison.The authors start the book with companies asking themselves “Why didn’t we think of that?” But ultimately they fail to show how companies can avoid such a situation. For example, they seem to believe it is as easy to create breakthrough products and services in mature markets as in new ones. And they fail to recognise the real pressures market leaders in mature markets feel: the need to feed and protect legacy assets, such as factories and brands, when innovations that cannibalise existing sales or take them beyond tried and tested boundaries often loom as threats not opportunities.Without deeper answers to such dilemmas, Tuned In falls back on exhortation. But it may be useful exhortation, nevertheless."
810;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Retailers’ woes hit real estate investors;;When Boscov’s filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this month, it was the latest in a slew of retailers to be pulled under as consumers have reined in their spending.But as the mid-range Pennsylvania retailer held closing sales at 10 of its 49 stores last week, the little-known company’s woes were a sign of how troubles facing US retailers will also hit investors in the buildings that house them.Simon Property Group and General Growth Properties, two major real estate investment trusts that between them own six of the malls in which the Boscov’s department stores sit, will struggle to fill the vacant space in a weak retail environment.There could also be problems for investors who hold Boscov’s debt. Boscov’s mortgages on seven of the stores that are closing were packaged up by Bank of America into a commercial mortgage backed security deal.Boscov’s is late in payments on the $117m in debt, according to Bloomberg data. If it defaults on the loans, owners of the lower classes of bonds will face losses, although Darryl Wheeler, an analyst at Citigroup does not expect them to be major.In total, Boscov’s has more than $1.53bn in outstanding loans spread through $52.75bn worth of CMBS deals, property data company Realpoint calculates, signalling how wide the company’s problems could spread, although it has not announced any other store closures. Boscov’s did not respond to calls for comment.Boscov’s bankruptcy emphasises the growing problems in retail property, which is expected to be the worst hit property sector outside of residential.“Boscov’s expanded too quickly,” said Mr Cardone. “Most of the problems [in retail property] come from over-aggressive expansion. We expect to see more of this.”Beyond Boscov’s a long list of companies such as gadget seller Sharper Image, discount women’s clothes store Steven and Barry’s and Linens N Things, a home furnishings chain, have filed for bankruptcy protection in recent months.Major retailers, such as Home Depot, Zales and Starbucks are also closing stores, and others such as JC Penney are holding back on renewing existing leases or store openings.The result is a market facing a flood of empty space, especially in many parts of the country where the housing boom was most pronounced, with vacancy rates rising to their highest since 1996 in the second quarter according to Reis.“Declines in retail sales in once-hot housing markets in Florida, Arizona, Nevada and Southern and Central California have been significant, and owners of malls in these regions could get more severely battered as a result,” said analysts at Green Street Advisors in a recent note.The rising vacancy and slowing demand for space is beginning to hit the businesses of public retail property investors.General Growth is delaying $500m of development because of the poor retail environment and difficulties securing credit, and recorded weaker than expected profits in the last quarter.“Now is not the best time to be opening new projects,” said John Bucksbaum, the company’s chief executive, after reporting its last results, spurring a sharp drop in the company’s shares.Overall, a rise in speculative building means the proportion of store space filled by tenants when construction is completed has slipped sharply from a historical average of more than 80 per cent to just over 60 per cent in the last two years, Reis reports.Prices for retail buildings have fallen 4 per cent since their peak in the third quarter of last year – less than the 11 per cent decline in office buildings – but Sam Chandan of Reis puts this down to the fact that wary buyers and lenders are only agreeing deals on the safest, best properties.This weak environment has helped drag down construction of shops, which is now falling at its fastest rate in nearly three decades, according to projections from McGraw Hill Construction. “What’s made it dramatic is how quick the decline has been,” said Bob Murray, of McGraw Hill.Mr Murray puts the speed of the slowdown down to the range of problems facing the industry – the credit crisis, the worst housing market since the Great Depression, rising inflation and a struggling economy – as well as greater transparency in property markets allowing a quicker correction.The decline in shop building comes after an extended period where developers raced to erect retail space to keep pace with residential building, and consumer spending grew fast fuelled by mounting personal debts often secured against the value of their homes.More store space was built in 2005 and 2007 than any other years since McGraw Hill’s records began in 1967.“The pace of development picked up as consumers used their home equity like ATMs, spending much of this newfound equity at the mall or neighbourhood shopping center,” says Ben Yang, an analyst at Green Street Advisors.
811;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-08-14T18:36:15Z;Obama goes for crossover appeal;;"Asking Joss Stone, the 21-year-old, blue-eyed soul singer from Devon, to pen his presidential campaign song seems a peculiarly unpatriotic choice for Barack Obama. This is a man, after all, who has been at pains to prove his American credentials.But you can see the appeal. Both have dreams: he wants to “reclaim the American dream”; she sang “I had a dream last night …I dreamed we all were alright/Happy in a land of Oz/Why did everybody laugh when I told them my dream?”There is every chance Mr Obama thinks the soulstress is American. She talks American – as seen at the 2007 Brit Awards when she sent “big love to Robbie Williams fo’ what he goin’ through”, which drew much tittering. Moreover, she sings American – great big pastiches of soul legends such as Aretha Franklin.While acting American may earn ridicule from Brits, it earns dollars in the States. Over here her last album Introducing Joss Stone may have flopped but over there it was a sell-out success. She has become a face of corporate America – adopted as a spokesperson for the US clothing mega-store Gap and a recording artist for Starbucks. She even performed at Wal-Mart’s shareholders’ meeting.She’s not the first Brit to have sold Americana to the Americans. Nor is she the first white Brit to have sold black American music to the mass US market. The Rolling Stones did it years ago, prompting discussions about cultural appropriation. But what is remarkable, according to Professor Paul Gilroy, social theorist at the London School of Economics, “is that the magic of that Anglo ‘whiteness’ is still as powerful as it was all those years ago”. He does not find its longevity heartening: “When Joss Stone gives the fruits of black culture back to middle America, her whiteness and Anglo-ness prevent them from knowing where [the music] came from, just as it did when The Beatles copied Barrett Strong.”With the majority of black Americans on side, Mr Obama can afford to ruffle the feathers of any sensitive to Ms Stone’s “Anglo whiteness”. It is Ms Stone’s talent for straddling the middle of the road that would make her attractive to the Democrat, as it was for Starbucks.But a desire for mass appeal in America and dreams are not the only traits Mr Obama and Ms Stone share. The Democrat has campaigned on a platform for change, an issue close to the heart of the Devon girl too. She introduced her last album with a meditation on this very issue, delivered by hard-man footballer Vinnie Jones: “See although the players change/The song remains the same/And the truth is/You gotta have the balls to change.” A Stone-Obama duet is long overdue.Politico potboilersThere has been considerable glee among Cherie Blair-haters that her autobiography Speaking for Myself was trounced by Ffion Hague’s book The Pain and the Privilege: the Women in Lloyd George’s Life in a survey of MPs’ summer reading. The wife of the Tory shadow foreign minister topped the list while Ms Blair’s memoirs were picked by one MP out of the 150 questioned. Yet a poll of the country reveals a very different picture. Ms Blair has sold 26,715 copies in the UK whereas Ms Hague’s title has sold just 2,542, according to Nielsen BookScan data. Moreover, Ms Hague’s sales pale next to a fellow Tory spouse – Frances Osborne. The wife of George, shadow chancellor of the exchequer, has sold 5,682 of The Bolter, a biography of the society seductress Idina Sackville.Boris is no boffinBoris Johnson may be well-versed in Latin – he dropped a bit of Virgil’s Aeneid into his first mayor’s Question Time. He may be well-versed in Shakespeare – he cited Romeo and Juliet to the Commons home affairs select committee. “We need to deglamorise knife crime,” he said. “This is not the death of Mercutio taking place on the streets of London.”But, from his interview this week with the FT, the mayor’s knowledge of science seems lacking. “London is meant to be the Petri dish into which Tory central office is introducing the bacillus of their policies,” he said. Likening your party’s policies to bacteria is an odd strategy. After all, one type of bacillus causes anthrax. Perhaps he meant “friendly bacteria” like the ones on the telly? It’s a timely reminder in the week that the CBI spoke of the need to strengthen science teaching that even those with a first-class education may need to do more than read the back of a Yakult bottle to learn their Petri dishes from their penicillin.Send your comments to emma.jacobs@ft.com"
812;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-08-04T08:25:23Z;Shades of grey that make an entrepreneur;;"When the dean of Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management approached Lloyd Shefsky to teach entrepreneurship, he was not keen on the idea.The Chicago lawyer – who started a firm that specialised in counselling entrepreneurs – already had a booming business to look after and his work frequently took him out of the city.“I told him, ‘What are the odds of me being in town for 10 consecutive Monday mornings?’” Prof Shefsky recalls. “But the dean was persistent. He said: ‘What if we made the class at night and what if it went for five weeks instead of 10?’ Finally, I said I’d try it. And I was hooked.”Prof Shefsky, a Kellogg faculty member for more than a decade, developed and teaches the Successful Entrepreneurship course. The class, is based on his experience of setting up a law firm and years of advising entrepreneurs and their companies at every stage of their development – from the Fortune 500 corporation looking to expand overseas, to the young person starting out and working from his parents’ garage.“I tell my students the bad news first – the fact they get an MBA means they are less likely to become an entrepreneur. But the good news is that with an MBA they are more likely to succeed.”A professor of entrepreneurship and co-director of Kellogg’s Center for Family Enterprises, Prof Shefsky maintains an open-door policy for his students. They sometimes want to talk about the course, but more often they want feedback on their nascent business ideas.“You can’t be an exuberant, passionate entrepreneur without discipline,” he says. “You have to balance the artistic with the sensibility of business. And that’s not easy. In my course, [students] learn about how to think about that problem. There is no magic bullet, but there are ways of thinking about how to come up with one.”His greatest challenge, he says, is to help students understand that most of what they have been taught on other business school courses does not apply to entrepreneurship.“The lessons they have learned are for running big companies and it is really different when you run a small start-up.“The differences are meaningful.”He ought to know. As a boy growing up in Chicago, he learned about the business world from his father, a podiatrist, who started several businesses. “My father was outgoing in the sense of always telling me what he was doing and some of those lessons have stuck.”One of his father’s forays involved selling goods from the boot of his car. He would offer samples to customers and deliver the goods later. His father kept meticulous notes on customers’ preferences and kept careful track of their family events and any milestones that might require an order.“He told me: ‘When you talk to someone, talk about them, not you,’” he says. “That’s important.”Prof Shefsky is himself an entrepreneur. In 1970, aged 29, he quit his job as a partner at a law practice to start his own legal firm, Shefsky & Froelich. His firm became increasingly successful and clients started turning to him not only for legal advice, but also for business advice.“I relied heavily on my instinct. Without realising it, I was the only guy in the room that had a breadth of experience with starting businesses.”Prof Shefsky, who today remains on counsel at his law firm, wrote a book Entrepreneurs are Made Not Born, published in 1994, which posits that
the characteristics entrepreneurs share are latent in many people and the route to success is by removing the barriers people put in their way.Prof Shefksy cites Howard Schultz, chief executive of Starbucks, and Elmer Winter, the attorney who in 1948 co-founded Manpower, the employment agency, as successful entrepreneurs who maintained faith in themselves and their ideas.“They all had experts telling them that their ideas would not work. And they didn’t say: ‘I’m right and you’re wrong,’ but they did their homework and they understood the grey area,” he says.“It’s not all black and white. And it’s the shades of grey that make entrepreneurs great.”

813;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-07-31T20:30:38Z;Wall Street falls as GDP figures disappoint;;Wall Street stocks fell for the first time in three sessions on Thursday as investors digested disappointing macro-economic data that showed improved but weaker-than-expected growth and rising unemployment.According to the Department of Commerce, the US economy grew at an annual rate of 1.9 per cent in the second quarter – faster than earlier in the year but slower than economists were expecting.Heavy goods manufacturers Deere, Caterpillar and General Electric fell 4.5 per cent to $70.16, 3.5 per cent to $69.52, and 2.4 per cent to $28.29, respectively. The industrials sector as a whole dropped 2.1 per cent.Meanwhile, the Labor Department said that initial claims for unemployment benefit last week jumped by the most in five years. That bodes ill for the key payrolls report due on Friday.A $2 drop in the oil price helped contain losses for much of the session but stocks slid to their lowest levels of the day at the close.Nine of the ten leading industry groups lost ground, dragging the benchmark S&P 500 down 1.3 per cent to 1,267.38. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.8 per cent to 11,378.02, while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.2 per cent to 2,325.39.Over a volatile month, the S&P 500 fell 1 per cent, paring early losses as government measures to backstop the mortgage groups, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, helped to restore confidence to the financial sector.“After coming in like a Lion, July went out like a lamb,” said Alec Young, equity strategist at S&P, pointing to rock-bottom sentiment, a drop in oil prices and second-quarter earnings that were not as bad as expected as additional reasons for the market recovery.The financials were the biggest monthly gainers, adding 6.8 per cent after a roller-coaster ride that saw them down as much as 15 per cent and up as much as 10 per cent.Consumer staples, healthcare and industrials also made solid gains of 3.3 per cent, 4.9 per cent and 1.8 per cent, respectively, as investors moved into defensive sectors and dropped from early-year winners. Energy stocks, for example, dropped 14 per cent.Nonetheless, Mr Young is cautious. “While these positives have helped the market find a short-term floor at 1,200 on the S&P 500, we think its ability to . . . build upward momentum will be driven by the second-half macro-economic outlook and its implications for corporate profit,” he said. “With so many wildcards still in play, we expect equity markets to remain choppy.”The macro-economic data overshadowed another handful of mixed earnings reports.In the technology sector, Symantec and Motorola made ground after posting a better-than-anticipated forecast and a surprise profit, respectively.Symantec added 7 per cent to $21.07 while Motorola jumped 12.5 per cent to $8.64.That news helped offset decent results from Visa and Mastercard, which nevertheless left investors underwhelmed. Visa shares, which have jumped about 65 per cent since the company went public in March, fell 6.9 per cent to $73.06. Mastercard shares slid 9.8 per cent to $244.15.In the consumer discretionary sector, Starbucks posted its first loss in 16 years though the shares advanced 0.1 per cent to $14.69 after it reaffirmed its 2009 full-year forecasts.Energy was the worst performer, dropping 3.4 per cent after some disappointing results from ExxonMobil and Consol Energy. Exxon fell 4.7 per cent to $80.43 while Consol Energy slid 15.9 per cent to $74.39.Financials were another weak spot, falling 1.3 per cent. Wells Fargo lost 3 per cent to $30.27, JPMorgan slipped 2.3 per cent to $40.63 and Bank of America dipped 2.1 per cent to $32.90.Healthcare was the only sector to make consistent progress throughout the day, climbing 0.3 per cent.Aetna, the health insurer, led the way after it said profit had risen 6.5 per cent to $480.5m as the company added members. Aetna stood by its full-year profit forecast and the shares rose 1.7 per cent to $41.01.ImClone Systems surged 37.7 per cent to $63.93 after Bristol-Myers Squibb offered to buy the part of the company that it does not yet own for $4.3bn. Bristol slipped 1.8 per cent to $21.12.
814;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
815;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Store closures wipe out profit at Starbucks;;"Starbucks slid to its first quarterly loss as a public company on Wednesday as charges related to its decision to close more than 650 cafés wiped out profits at the biggest US coffee shop chain.The report came a day after Starbucks reshuffled its top management team and announced that it would increase to 13,000 the number of jobs to be cut by the company as part of a shake-up launched in January by Howard Schultz, chief executive.Shares in the company rose 5.7 per cent in after-hours trading as investors focused on news that the company would close more stores in the US than it planned to open next year – a move that will help cut costs.Starbucks had been opening new stores at a rate of as many as three per day in the US last summer before consumer demand began to wane, a pace of growth that has proved difficult to manage. Earlier this month, it announced a plan to scale back the number of store openings and close 600 existing shops.On Tuesday, Starbucks announced that it would also close dozens of stores in Australia, where the group has failed to gain much traction since it launched there in 2000.The company has been hit by the deteriorating economy, particularly in the US, where high gas prices and other economic pressures have led fewer customers to seek out fancy coffee drinks.“Customers remain loyal to Starbucks and its products,” said Howard Schultz, chief executive. However, “they’re visiting less frequently,” he added.Starbucks has launched a revamp of its stores and its first customer loyalty programme in an effort to reverse the decline in customer traffic.Meanwhile, Mr Schultz said the restructuring launched in recent weeks would allow Starbucks to concentrate on improving its long-term financial performance.Shares of the coffee group, whose stores have become a fixture of urban living from Boston to Beijing, have fallen by more than half during the past two years. They fell 2.1 per cent on Wednesday to $14.67 ahead of the earnings announcement.Starbucks said on Wednesday that sales had risen just
9 per cent to $2.4bn in the third quarter, with growth damped down by continued declines in customer traffic in the US, which accounted for about 76 per cent of total sales.The tepid growth failed to offset a $167.7m charge related to the group’s ongoing restructuring.The result was a net loss for the period of $6.7m, or 1 cent a share, down from a net profit of $158.3m in the same period one year ago.Starbucks said on Wednesday that it continued to see strong opportunities for growth overseas, citing a strong launch for its stores in Argentina last quarter, and continued strength in eastern Europe."
816;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-07-29T18:46:29Z;Starbucks tastes defeat in Australia;;Starbucks on Tuesday admitted defeat in the race to win a large slice of the Australian coffee market when the US chain said it would close 61 “underperforming” stores out of its total Australia portfolio of 84.The decision by Starbucks to downsize its Australian business is a setback for the Seattle-based chain’s international ambitions.Starbucks, which operates more than 15,000 coffee shops globally, this month said it would close about 600 stores in the US and cut as many as 12,000 jobs. The coffee chain said at the time it expected to take pre-tax charges of $328m to $348m related to the US closures, resulting in a net cash outflow after tax benefits of about $100m.The chain has been the victim of an ill-fated push in Australia, a market it only entered in 2000. Starbucks was snubbed by many Australians who have grown up on a diet of quality European-style coffee introduced in the last century to Australia by immigrants, especially from Italy.Howard Schultz, Starbucks chief executive, said on Tuesday that no other international markets need to be addressed in the same manner as Australia. “While this decision represents business challenges unique to the Australian market, it in no way reflects the strong state of Starbucks business in countries outside of the United States.”Although it only arrived in Australia recently, Starbucks expanded quickly there. Australia is of a similar geographic size to the US but the island continent supports less than a tenth of the US’s population.Starbucks said it would close most of its country and regional stores and focus on the three large urban centres of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.The closures will result in 685 job losses.“We are well into the implementation phase of transforming Starbucks and we believe that this difficult, yet necessary, decision to close stores in Australia will help support the continued growth of our international business,” Mr Schultz added.Since he this year resumed the role of CEO at the group he built into a global chain in the 1990s, Mr Schultz has pledged to reinvigorate Starbucks’ US operations, arguing that a dip in service standards had contributed to declining traffic at a time of slowing consumer demand.It has announced several initiatives aimed at improving customer experience, including a new blended coffee and a loyalty programme for its Starbucks stored-value cards.
817;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-07-22T20:49:24Z;Wall Street rallies as oil price drops sharply;;Wall Street stocks rallied strongly on Tuesday as a sharp drop in oil prices boosted consumer-facing stocks while a plan to turn round Wachovia helped investors shrug off some disappointing earnings reports.Most eyes were focused on the financial sector, which staged a remarkable midday volte-face to gain 6.6 per cent as investors skipped over a series of weak earnings results to focus on the positive.Overnight, American Express reported second-quarter earnings that missed estimates and withdrew its full-year earnings forecast. The credit card company’s shares tumbled 7.1 per cent to $37.99 while peer Discover Financial lost 3.8 per cent to $14.62.An $8.9bn loss from Wachovia and some depressing results from regional banks, including Regions Financial and Keycorp, initially added to the sour mood.But by midday investors had shrugged off the bad news, focusing instead on a strategy from Robert Steel, Wachovia’s new chief executive, to cut $2bn of expenses by the end of 2009, sell assets and slash jobs and the dividend at the bank.Wachovia shares swung from an 11.6 per cent loss to a 27.4 per cent gain at $16.79. Regions Financial and Keycorp overturned early losses to gain 9.6 per cent to $11.40 and 4.3 per cent to $11.99, respectively.Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at Thinkorswim, an online brokerage, said: “Wachovia presented a plan this morning, they cut their dividend – they are doing something. This credit crisis is not going away in a month, but if we have a plan to get ourselves out of it in a year that makes the market feel good.”There were some more consistent bright spots. Western Union advanced 8.6 per cent to $27.23 after the money-transfer company said second-quarter profit had risen 13 per cent, thanks to international revenues, and raised its 2008 profit forecast.SunTrust Banks said second-quarter earnings had slumped 21 per cent. But that was a smaller fall than expected and the shares rallied 17.1 per cent to $39.97 after the bank ruled out a capital raising or dividend cut.CME Group, which runs futures exchanges, said second-quarter profit had risen 60 per cent to $201m thanks to its purchase of the Chicago Board of Trade. CME shares rose 12.5 per cent to $366.27.By the close, the benchmark S&P 500 had shaken off early losses and was up 1.4 per cent at 1,277.01 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.2 per cent higher at 11,602.5 points, while the Nasdaq Composite was ahead 1.1 per cent at 2,303.96 points.The day began in downbeat fashion after Apple forecast fourth-quarter profit that undershot analysts’ projections. The news, and speculation about the health of Steve Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, sent shares in the iPod maker down 2.6 per cent to $162.02.Texas Instruments and SanDisk also disappointed investors in the technology sector. The semiconductor makers both predicted earnings that trailed analysts’ expectations. Texas shares fell 14.2 per cent to $24.48, SanDisk dropped 24 per cent to $13.62, while an index of semiconductor stocks slipped 2.8 per cent.A $4 drop in oil prices took the sting out of the worst results. Consumer staples and discretionary stocks were among the best performers, adding 2 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively.Wal-Mart added 3.1 per cent to $59.06 while Starbucks rose 7.4 per cent to $15.13.In industrials, some solid earnings news helped steady investor concerns about the health of the economy. Caterpillar, the heavy goods maker, Lockheed Martin, the defence company, Paccar, the truckmaker, and United Parcel Service, each met or beat analysts’ expectations for their quarterly results.Caterpillar shares rose 2.4 per cent to $74.98, Lockheed Martin added 2.3 per cent to $103.88, Paccar climbed 4.4 per cent to $44.60 and UPS advanced 4.5 per cent to $62.11.Energy was the best performing sector on Monday, but that trend petered out on Tuesday as oil prices slipped back below $130 a barrel and some decent results from the services sub-industry left investors unmoved. BJ Services and Baker Hughes rose 6.6 per cent to $31.99, and 3.2 per cent to $87.06, respectively.

Both are now down more than 20 per cent from their recent peaks.Oil prices smashed through $143 a barrel after a government inventory report showed a sharp drop in crude oil supplies, knocking all ten leading industry groups on the S&P500 into the red.Rising oil prices have been a constant scourge for equity markets in recent months, raising the spectre of spiralling input costs and tumbling corporate profits.The biggest faller on Wednesday was the material sector, which lost 5.3 per cent - its biggest one day fall since March.Energy intensive steel producers fell for a third day. US Steel lost 12.5 per cent to $153.40 and Nucor dropped 14.2 per cent to $61.94.Gold miners also fell back as gold prices dropped. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold dropped 6.9 per cent to $107.57 while Newmont Mining lost 4.5 per cent to $50.99.The energy sector also dragged. Coal stocks were the weak link, tumbling as European prices fell the most since 2005. Massey Energy and Consol Energy fell 18.9 per cent to $74.87 and 14.6 per cent to $95.57 respectively.In industrials, transport-related stocks suffered. CSX fell 6.4 per cent to $57.06 while Paccar lost 7 per cent to $39.86.The day began in a positive fashion after European banks dismissed speculation that they would have to raise more cash, bolstering their US peers.But gains were erased after another rash of analyst downgrades while comments by Hank Paulson also took their toll. The Treasury secretary proposed the president should have to approve any use of taxpayer funds to aid a financial company in trouble.Citigroup fell 1.7 per cent to $16.84 while Merrill lost 3.4 per cent to $31.15. The financial sector as a whole slipped 1.4 per cent.Macroeconomic news did little to improve the mood. New data from the Commerce Department showed US factory orders climbed a faster-than-expected 0.6 per cent in May for a third monthly increase.Any positive momentum was curtailed by the ADP Employer Services report, which showed private companies cut jobs at four times the expected rate in June.Carmakers came under renewed pressure after analysts at Merrill Lynch punctured the euphoria surrounding General Motors sales figures, which were released on Tuesday.The brokerage downgraded GM from “buy” to “underperform” and cut its 2008 and 2009 earnings estimates, citing lower forecasts for US car sales and noting that “bankruptcy is not impossible.”GM fell 15.1 per cent to $9.98 while Ford dipped 7.4 per cent to $4.36.The consumer discretionary sector also slipped back 1.7 per cent as oil prices rose. Liz Claibornlost 6.6 per cent to $13.08 while Staplesfell 4.9 per cent to $23.12.Starbucks clung to a 0.4 per cent gain at $15.68, buoyed by plans to cut 7 per cent of its workforce and close 600 stores as part of efforts to revitalise the coffee chain.Blockbuster rose 5.8 per cent to $2.65 after it dropped a $1.35bn bid for Circuit City Stores the lossmaking electronics retailer. Circuit City shares slumped 9 per cent to $2.32.The technology sector was volatile. Semiconductors were the worst performing subsector, while software and services companies followed close behind.But there were exceptions. Yahoo climbed 3.4 per cent to $20.88 after the Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft had approached media companies about teaming up for a break-up deal. Microsoft fell 3.7 per cent to $25.88.Meanwhile, Dell shares rallied 2. per cent to $23.70 after chief executive Michael Dell revealed he had bought 4.5m shares in the company at between $21.89 and $22.39 since June 27.
819;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-07-02T19:05:11Z;Starbucks goes skinny as froth withers;;As US consumer demand started to falter last summer, Starbucks was opening new company-owned stores in the US at the rate of three a day.But on Tuesday the world’s largest coffee retailer decisively put its foot on the brake, with Peter Bocian, chief financial officer, bidding farewell to the era of growth that has made Starbucks’ green and white sign a symbol of urban America.“We believe with the stores we have today, and incrementally [adding] a couple of hundred more per year, we will have the right answer for Starbucks in the United States,” he said.In its coming 2009 fiscal year, which starts in October, it plans to open fewer than 200 new US company-operated locations, down from this year’s reduced target of 650, and the more than 1,000 US company-operated stores that opened in both 2006 and 2007.Starbucks also plans to close 600 stores, many of them less than two years old, leaving a network of more than 6,600 company-run stores in the US, as well as more than 4,000 licensed outlets in locations such as airports, bookstores and supermarkets.Mr Bocian argued the decision to close stores and slow growth reflected more than the current economic climate, following a detailed review of local market factors by the company’s real estate team.“We believe absolutely that we’re seeing a major impact from the economy,” he told investors and analysts. But, he added, the decision to close the 600 stores had been taken because of other factors too. “We didn’t believe it was all economy”.Those factors include proximity to other stores – reflecting Starbucks original readiness to allow new openings to cannibalise about 30 per cent of the traffic at existing stores as a way of reducing lines and improving customer service.This aspect of the cutbacks in planned growth mirrors similar decisions by two very different but equally ubiquitous US retailers – Wal-Mart, and Home Depot, the home improvement chain.Over the past year the two largest US retailers have slowed new store expansion plans and capital investment, with Home Depot saying in May it would close 15 of its underperforming superstores. Like Starbucks, both Wal-Mart and Home Depot are approaching saturation coverage of the available markets, with new stores taking some customer traffic away from existing outlets.But at the same time, the slowdown in demand is manifesting itself in a string of store closures and trimmed expansion plans from retailers that are more clearly linked to economic conditions.JC Penney, the mainstream department store, said last week, for instance, that it was planning to open 20, rather than 50 stores in 2009, and was halving capital spending plans.Other retailers have also announced the closure of underperforming stores, including Ann Taylor, Liz Claiborne and Talbots, the women’s fashion retailers and Zales, the jewellers.Richard Hastings, consumer strategist at Global Hunter Securities, noted that the current inflationary environment, combined with slowing demand, was making capital expenditure reductions increasingly attractive to retailers. Cutting store costs and expenditure on new stores were “the most logical next steps in this story once you saw demand begin to decline in the summer of 2007”.Starbucks says it is not actively expecting any further closures, but will be closely monitoring the performance of its remaining US store portfolio. Its international expansion plans also remain unchanged, with a further 950 new licensed and company-owned stores opening this year, including its first store in Argentina.It also argues that its store development team will be more effective, under a new president of global development, Arthur Rubenfeld, a veteran of its 1990s expansion, who recently rejoined the company.Mr Bocian also said Starbucks would be looking at further cost-cutting measures under Howard Schultz, its chief executive, that are aimed at restoring the reputation of the brand battered by its expansion.“We understand we are in a tough economic environment and have to innovate and invest but also work on things we can control.”
820;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-07-01T23:21:39Z;Starbucks to close 600 US stores;;Starbucks is to close 8 per cent of its 7,000 US coffee shops and drastically cut plans for new locations, blaming over-aggressive expansion rather than slowing consumer demand.Peter Bocian, chief financial officer, said on Tuesday that while the economy had had a “major impact”, the business at the outlets being closed did not work out like the business case expected. ”We didn’t believe it was all economy,” he said.The coffee retailer said it would close about 600 shops over the next year, which will result in pre-tax charges estimated at more than $300m, and about 12,000 lost jobs, or 7 per cent of its global workforce.In addition to the company-run outlets there are just over 4,000 licensed operations.The new figure includes 100 stores already identified for closure in January after Howard Schultz resumed the role of chief executive at the company.The company said it would now open fewer than 200 new company-operated shops in its coming 2009 fiscal year, beginning in October, down from an initial forecast of about 500.It said the closures were aimed at “restoring long-term profitable growth” and followed an extensive review of its store base that took into account local market conditions, as well as “the impact of current and anticipated economic trends”.Mr Bocian said many shops were near other Starbucks locations. “We won’t lose all the revenue, and that should help the economics of the other stores,” .About 70 per cent of the stores had opened in the last two and a half years.Starbucks said it expected to take pre-tax charges of $328m to $348m related to the closures, resulting in a net cash outflow after tax benefits of about $100m.Since resuming the chief executive role, Mr Schultz has pledged to reinvigorate Starbucks’ US operations, arguing that a decline in service standards had contributed to declining traffic at a time of slowing demand. The company has subsequently announced several initiatives aimed at improving customer experience, including a loyalty programme for its Starbucks stored-value cards.Starbucks, which reports third-quarter results at the end of this month, in April blamed the slowing economy for a lower than expected 8 per cent increase in total US net revenues to $1.9bn, as traffic continued a decline that began last year.While its management played down the impact of broader economc factors, the company is the latest in a series of retailers to cut back expansion plans.Last week JC Penney, the mainstream department store chain, more than halved its new store opening plans for 2009.
821;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-06-25T03:21:34Z;Rival suitors facing one-bid Enodis auction;;"Rival US suitors for Enodis, the industrial catering equipment maker, face a “one shot, sudden-death, shoot-out” after the close of trading next Monday if the company remains in play by 4.30pm on Friday.A one-bid auction between Manitowoc and Illinois Tool Works, one of only a handful of auctions arranged under the Takeover Panel’s direct auspices in recent years, should bring to an end a protracted tug-of-war for Enodis, which has switched its recommendation to shareholders back and forth since Manitowoc’s conditional approach in April.Enodis, which supplies catering equipment to clients such as McDonald’s and Starbucks, accepted an offer of 280p a share from ITW in early May before backing a 294p-a-share counter offer from Manitowoc on May 19, which valued Enodis at £1.08bn ($2.13bn).That offer, however, did not close the door on ITW making a counter bid. Manitowoc, which supplies cranes and ice-making machines, has delayed posting out documentation to shareholders for the scheme of arrangement. The delay came as talks between suitors, Enodis and the Takeover Panel, aimed at bringing the battle to a decisive end, continued.A decision to allow just one round of offers contrasts with the procedure agreed with the Takeover Panel during the bidding for Corus by Tata and CSN of Brazil. After eight hours of bidding in 2007, Tata emerged the victor by offering 608p a share, or £6.2bn, for the Anglo-Dutch steelmaker.The Takeover Panel stated on Tuesday that there should be “only one round in the auction procedure”, with each side required to offer 5p in excess of any previous highest bid.To prevent a tie, ITW has agreed to bid an odd-numbered price; while Manitowoc must pitch an even-numbered price.Agreement between all parties contrasts with the protracted battle for Expro, the oil services company, which had its court hearing to confirm a scheme of arrangement purchase by the Candover-led Umbrellastream consortium adjourned on Monday.That hearing reconvenes on Wednesday after submissions by Umbrellastream’s rival bidder Halliburton, which has complained over Expro’s decision not to entertain a possible improved offer last Friday that would have required further delay in a sale of Expro. Hedge fund Mason Capital is also seeking a ruling from the court that the sale of Expro be delayed in the hope of prompting an auction.Mark Curtis, M&A partner at law firm Simmons & Simmons, and previously a secondee to the Takeover Panel, said the Enodis arrangement appeared a sensible way forward for all involved parties.Shares in Enodis closed down 1p at 316p on Tuesday, a 22p premium to the current recommended price."
822;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-06-24T21:29:15Z;US stocks hit lowest level in three months;;US stocks hit their lowest level in three months on Tuesday as investors weighed a handful of mixed earnings reports, a rally in financials and new data showing the continuation of a slump in house prices and consumer confidence.The day began in downbeat fashion after UPS, the world’s largest shipping carrier, cut its earnings expectations for the second quarter, blaming slowing US growth and higher fuel costs. UPS is often seen as an industrial bellwether because its business depends on the levels of activity in the broader economy.Last week, rival FedExsimilarly disappointed markets when it posted an unexpectedly large fourth-quarter loss. Together, these results will heighten fears about the impact of elevated oil prices on the wider economy.UPS lost 6 per cent to $62.26 while FedEx slipped 0.2 per cent to $79.98, helping to drag the industrials sector down 1.3 per cent.Markets took another downward leg after the release of data showing a further record decline in house prices and tumbling consumer confidence.Estimate-beating first-quarter results and full-year forecasts from food retailer Kroger helped offset some of that bad news, boosting the consumer staples sector and broader equity indices – but only for a time.Kroger added 7 per cent to $27.82 and was followed higher by Safeway and Supervalu which climbed 2.6 per cent to $29.65 and 3 per cent to $31.35 respectively. The consumer staples sector rose 0.2 per cent as a whole.The benchmark S&P 500 wavered between gains and losses but eventually closed down 0.3 per cent at 1,314.29 points – its lowest level since mid-March. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3 per cent to 11,807.43 while the Nasdaq Composite edged down 0.7 per cent to 2,368.28.Analysts had expected trading to be subdued ahead of Wednesday’s decision on interest rates from the Federal Reserve but the main indices have instead been notably choppy so far this week.In spite of the volatility, some observers found reason for optimism. Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said recent market weakness could be a prelude to a recovery in the second half as the lagged impact of Fed easing, the fiscal stimulus and attractive valuations took effect.“We are in the middle of a healthy seasonal correction but if we retest the mid-March lows and bounce back we will have set up a nice triple bottom . . . and I think we could see record highs for equity markets in the next six to 12 months.”In the background, financials provided a rare fillip to market sentiment, shrugging off another round of analyst downgrades to climb 2.5 per cent after retesting five-year lows.The most heavily sold banks and brokerages were among the biggest gainers. SunTrust Bank advanced 4.1 per cent to $37.40, Lehman Brothers rose 6.8 per cent to $24.35 and Wells Fargo climbed 3.9 per cent to $25.20. Wachovia also made ground, rising 5.6 per cent to $17.86 after it said it had hired Goldman Sachs to assess its loan portfolio.Even the consumer discretionary sector, initially hit hard by the latest data, just about held its own. Eastman Kodak led the way, soaring 13.7 per cent to $14.03 after the photography company said its board had authorised a $1bn share repurchase. Over the past year, however, Eastman shares have lost about half of their value.Starbucks and Darden Restaurants were also among the gainers, adding 1.7 per cent to $16.57 and 3.1 per cent to $31.60 respectively.Homebuilders proved im­pervious to the housing statistics, rallying after Credit Suisse initiated coverage on the sector with an outperform rating on Centex, DR Horton and others. Centex and DR Horton advanced 7.5 per cent to $15.15 and 7.3 per cent to $12.62 respectively.But inflation worries have become increasingly acute in recent weeks, a trend that looks set to continue as producers pass on higher input costs.Dow Chemical said it would raise prices by up to 25 per cent and institute freight surcharges to combat high energy prices. The price rises are the second in a month. Dow fell 2.8 per cent to $36.58 while the material sector was the worst performer in the S&P 500, losing 2.5 per cent – its biggest one day loss since the start of the month.
823;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-06-20T20:45:47Z;US stocks slide as oil prices rebound;;Wall Street stock markets slumped to three-month lows on Friday as oil prices rebounded, knocking consumer-facing stocks, while analyst and ratings downgrades for financials stoked fears that the credit crisis has further to play out.Oil moved as much as $4 higher on Friday, cutting short a rally in consumer-facing stocks. Dillards and Starbucks gave up 4.7 per cent to $13.10 and 4.2 per cent to $17.23.But carmakers were the biggest fallers after S&P, the credit rating agency, said it may cut auto makers ratings. Ford lost 8.1 per cent to $5.81, GM slid 6.8 per cent to $13.79 and the discretionary sector plunged 4 per cent.Technology shares also came under heavy selling pressure, with large caps leading the sector to a 2.5 per cent loss. Microsoft dropped 2.4 per cent to $28.25.In the background, the financials cut away at investor confidence. Moody’s became the last of the three major rating agencies to downgrade Ambac and MBIA, the embattled bond insurers, citing their limited ability to raise new capital and write new business.Ambac swung to a gain of 1 per cent at $2.05 in late trading but MBIA lost 13.3 per cent to $5.59.Banks were also in focus after analysts downgraded or cut their price targets for Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Wachovia among others, arguing that writedowns, volatile capital markets and mediocre fixed-income performance would damage earnings. Citigroup shares fell 4.8 per cent to $19.21, while Goldman Sachs and Wachovia dropped 1.7 per cent to $183.77 and 1.9 per cent to $17.43. The S&P 500 financials index dropped 2.6 per cent to its lowest level in five years.The S&P 500 closed 1.9 per cent lower at 1,317.85 on Friday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.8 per cent at 11,841.95. The Nasdaq Composite lost 2.3 per cent to 2,406.09.On Thursday, equity markets ended higher after a jittery session of trading, as oil prices dropped sharply, helping exporters, such as technology stocks, and consumer-facing stocks to advance.That strong run was the exception in a week marked by bad news from the financials, another batch of data showing considerable weakness in the US economy and elevated fears of inflation.The S&P 500 fell for a third straight week, losing 3.1 per cent as all 10 leading industrial sectors retreated. The S&P 500 is now down 5.9 per cent so far in June after making gains in April and May.As if to underline the bearish sentiment on Wall Street, short interest on the New York Stock Exchange jumped to an all-time high during the week. Financial stocks came under pressure from short-sellers.William Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Wealth Management, said: “We got decent earnings out of Goldman Sachs this week and that seemed to raise people’s spirits a bit. But we can’t seem to get out of the way of bad news . . . every day another bank needs to raise more capital.”On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs undermined market sentiment, in spite of posting better-than-expected results, after its analysts warned that US banks might have to raise as much as $65bn in additional capital to shore up balance sheets weakened by the mortgage crisis.As if to confirm those predictions, Fifth Third Bancorp said on Wednesday it would raise $2bn by selling shares and assets. Fifth was among the week’s biggest losers, dropping 23.2 per cent to $10.11. It was followed down by other regional banks as analysts questioned whether smaller, less capitalised institutions could withstand the credit crisis.Healthcare stocks were another weak point after Coventry Health Care cut its second-quarter and full-year forecasts. Coventry was the biggest faller on the S&P 500 dropping 26.4 per cent to $31.05 over the week, while peers UnitedHealth Group and Humana slumped 11.8 per cent to $27.12 and 10.7 per cent to $41.97.

825;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-06-14T00:45:54Z;Wake up and smell the fun;;"No matter how hard one tries, it is impossible to get a venti low-fat mocha frappucino in Tehran. French coffee? Yes. Turkish? No problem. Freshly squeezed pomegranate juice? It’s everywhere.But being on a US blacklist has some upsides. The Iranian capital is a glorious exception to the globalisation of coffee – and of cafés.Instead, Tehran has a blooming café scene: quirky, individual places with their own character, serving coffee the way it should be. This is somewhat surprising, given Iran’s firmly established tradition of tea drinking.It is also rather surprising given the fact that there are two Tehrans – public Tehran, where people err on the side of discretion, and private Tehran, where they socialise with abandon.But in this crowded, hectic city, cafés are places to meet friends, surf the internet, check out the latest fashions and right the wrongs of the world.Whiling away the time in these cafés has become one of my favourite pastimes in the few months I have been in Tehran, and not just because of my constant need for coffee.They are a great spot for people-watching, for taking the pulse of this most paradoxical of countries.The Islamic Republic is a place where traditional women peep out from their chadors and clerics walk down the street in turbans and long flowing cloaks. But it is also home to a vibrant, outward-looking young population: more than two-thirds of Iranians have yet to celebrate their 30th birthdays. You see young guys with elaborate gelled hairstyles, listening to Farsi hip-hop, and young women who have carefully calculated how much of themselves they can show without violating the rules of the hijab.And in the cafés in central Tehran, where old meets new and traditional meets hip, it’s often possible to see many facets of this complicated place coming together.My favourite café is without doubt Entr’acte, upstairs from the Jomhuri Cinema on the central city thoroughfare of Jomhuri Street, which, with its endless electronics shops, is Tehran’s equivalent to London’s Tottenham Court Road.A delightful jumble of mismatched chairs and tables, bookshelves lined with magazines, old photos of Tehran and paintings by new artists, Entr’acte is a cross between an eccentric aunt’s living room and a bohemian hang-out. It is run by renowned actors Leila Hatami and Ali Mosaffa, who can often be seen in the café.I love to come here on a Friday, when there is a breakfast buffet – eggs, Iranian feta, flat bread, breakfast lentils, fruit, and sometimes carrot juice.As much as I love Entr’acte’s individuality and hate the contrived environments of international chains, I also like spending time at Raees Coffee, Tehran’s answer to Starbucks. It is obvious where Raees (“Boss”) gets its inspiration. The waiters wear green shirts with a circular logo, and the coffee cups, the bottled water and even the sugar sachets, are straight Starbucks rip-offs. But here it feels almost ironic.Because Raees has wireless internet access, it is not uncommon to see young people in there checking their Facebook pages (even though the website is officially blocked) while talking on their mobiles and drinking Americanos. The first time I walked into this place I did a double-take: was this really Tehran?Iran actually takes credit for pioneering the concept of the coffee shop. Persians were drinking coffee as long as 3,000 years ago, and it was not until the 19th century that Iran began importing tea.But the 1979 revolution led to a crackdown on coffee shops, with the new religious establishment viewing these gloomy venues as places where boys and girls could do things they shouldn’t – such as mingling.Some cafés, however, survived the revolution and retain the intellectual atmosphere – and sometimes the furniture and menu – of earlier days. And despite the Islamic regime’s reservations, they continue to serve an important social function.“One of the real problems with Tehran is that the only place where you can hang out with your friends, apart from your home, is in cafés,” says my friend Tara, a drama student at Tehran University, as we sit in Gol-e Rezaiyeh, a cross between a London greasy spoon and Paris’ Les Deux Magots. “I like old cafés like this, rather than the new cafés, which are just for showing off.”Gol-e Rezaiyeh, established in 1931, certainly belongs to a different era. With its net curtains, rows of old photos on the walls – Beethoven, Ibsen, Buddha – and menu of comfort food such as lamb shanks and fried chicken, it has an old-fashioned, homely feel. Its location close to Tehran University in the heart of the capital means it continues to attract an eclectic clientele.So too does Linette, just down the street from Raees. With its wooden interior, this café has the feel of Italy circa 1970.“I often come to cafés alone. I like to sit there and watch the people talking and sometimes to join in,” says Makan, a young musician who also loves café-hopping. “When I’m away I miss Linette more than my own bedroom.”But among the old-school establishments, there is no beating the nonagenarian Café Naderi, also located on Jomhuri Street. Naderi looks as though it the last time it was decorated – and the last time it recruited any staff – was in the 1960s. Its Formica tables and chairs, its ancient La Cimbali espresso machine and its grizzled waiters have all been here for decades.…………………………………………..DetailsEntr’acte: Jomhuri Cinema, Jomhuri Street, between Abureyham and Felestine

826;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-06-11T23:26:27Z;Enodis bidders await Takeover Panel verdict;;Manitowoc and Illinois Tool Works have put their battle for Enodis on hold as they wait to hear whether the UK Takeover Panel will advise the restaurant equipment maker to establish a more formal auction process.Enodis’s board, after receiving an initial takeover bid from US-based Manitowoc in April, has been forced to flip-flop its recommendation to shareholders several times, endorsing whichever bid has been highest.After ITW won the board’s support in early May with a bid of 280p per share, Manitowoc regained its favoured position on May 20 with a 294p offer, through which it would pay $2.1bn (£1.07bn) in cash and assume Enodis’s net debt of $245m.Over the past week, shares of Enodis, which sells fryers and other equipment to McDonald’s, Starbucks and other restaurants, have traded just shy of 310p on expectations that ITW might make a higher offer.ITW is evaluating a renewed proposal, according to one person close to the situation. But while ITW is still interested, the lack of clarity over how the bidding process will unfold may keep ITW in a holding pattern.With proposed schemes of arrangement for a takeover of Enodis filed by both Manitowoc and ITW, the Takeover Panel could decide within weeks whether to recommend the company set up an auction, according to the person close to the situation.An auction would let Enodis entertain bids from interested parties without having to issue confusing board recommendations that alternately favour one offer over another.Manitowoc also decided this week – with the Takeover Panel’s consent – to delay posting documents on its frontrunning offer, which could otherwise have moved the process forward. It referred instead to another pending announcement.Ahead of the panel’s decision, it may not make sense for Manitowoc to file documents on its latest bid. Any higher bids by either party could only serve to raise Enodis’s price expectations if an auction does occur.Enodis had no comment. ITW and Manitowoc did not respond to requests for comment.
827;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-06-11T16:38:51Z;Kuwait business takes Starbucks to Russia;;Not many Middle Eastern companies can lay claim to a first in their home region followed by a first in faraway Russia a quarter of a century later.But thousands in the Arab world who while away their evenings sitting and drinking in Starbucks and businessmen who wander into the coffee house’s new outlets in Moscow can all trace their brand name espresso or latte back to a Kuwaiti family business.From Prague to Riyadh and Warsaw to Nicosia, M.H. Alshaya Co – which has the franchise rights for Starbucks in the Middle East and now Russia – is expanding on the back of decades in the retail business, with an eye firmly on eastern Europe’s emerging economies.It has had the Starbucks franchise for its home region for 10 years and opened the chain’s first store in Russia in September. Moscow now boasts six Starbucks outlets. And while that franchise may be one of its most high profile, it is just one small element of the group’s overall business.Alshaya’s connection with international brands began in 1983 with Mothercare. Since then it has gone on to secure the Middle Eastern franchise rights for such household names as The Body Shop, an ethical cosmetics chain, Next, Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge, the UK-based fashion retailers, and Debenhams, the UK department store.Its move into eastern Europe started gradually with the acquisition of a Turkish company in 2002 that had a relationship with Top Shop, a UK brand with which Alshaya already had a franchise deal. It then moved in to the Russian market with the acquisition three years ago of a company that had ties with Mothercare, and last year it started in Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Hungary is the latest country where it is seeking to begin operations.Once it has its foot in a market, the group looks to build up its portfolio by introducing other brands. In Turkey, for example, it now has about 15 brands compared with more than 30 in Kuwait. In Russia it has four – Next, Mothercare, The Body Shop and Starbucks – and the goal is to further expand its alliances with high street names throughout eastern Europe.“These markets are the natural expansion of western Europe and I think we and Starbucks felt it was the right time to go into Russia,” says Mohammed Alshaya, executive chairman of M.H. Alshaya, a part of the Alshaya Group. “Just the city of Moscow of 15m [people] is more than the size of the Gulf countries [excluding] Saudi Arabia.”The family business traces it roots back to the early 1890s, when Mr Alshaya’s great uncle began trading with India in textiles, food and other goods.In the 1950s and 1960s, after oil was discovered in the Middle East, the group moved into real estate and hotels, opening a Sheraton in Kuwait City in 1965 – the region’s first five-star hotel south of Beirut and the first Sheraton outside the US.It had the option to expand its hotel network in the 1970s as the Gulf enjoyed the first oil boom. But it decided against the move because it did not believe a hotel sector without alcohol was a viable business. As a religious family, the company did not want to get into “these questionable endeavours”, Mr Alshaya says.Family members then came up with the idea of going into business with UK-based Mothercare, and in doing so helped introduce to the Gulf the concept of fixed pricing in shops.Mr Alshaya, who holds an MBA from the US and had to be lured back from Wall Street by his father before entering the family’s retail business, says it was not always easy to convince international outlets to invest in a region often linked to conflict and extremism.But the Kuwaiti business succeeded in assuring them it was a “no-brainer”, by offering to shoulder the risk, he says. “It’s hard work because this is a small market, and in the Middle East it’s always the [negative] stereotype,” Mr Alshaya says, a plastic cup of Starbucks’ coffee on the table in front of him. But “we told them we take the risk …the risk of investment, of recruiting people, putting together the components of the business”.There are also cultural issues that impact on the business. It is common for Arab men to sit around for hours slowly sipping coffee or tea as they chat. That means the Starbucks margins are hit because 80 per cent of customers are those who like to sit, while only 20 per cent “grab and go” – the opposite of the fast-paced US market, Mr Alshaya says.Like many family businesses in the region, Mr Alshaya is reluctant to talk about financial numbers, and will only reveal that the investments in Russia amount to “a good size”.But the group is thinking about its evolution in the increasingly globalised environment, which means considering options such as a public listing.“It’s one of the options that we may [consider] in future, but don’t ask me when. I don’t know when, but I think eventually we will move into a new phase of the company’s life to bring in investors,” Mr Alshaya says. “Financially, we are not looking for financial investors, but we are looking for investors that bring an added value to our company.”
828;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-06-04T20:48:06Z;Wall St falls after Bernanke’s inflation remarks;;US stock markets fell slightly for a third straight session on Wednesday after the chairman of the Federal Reserve said that inflation was higher than the central bank would like, while a ratings review for one of the troubled bond insurers snuffed out an early rally in financials.Stocks began the day in positive mood after reports showed that private sector employers added staff unexpectedly last month while the services sector also continued to expand.The ADP National Employment Report showed a surprise gain of 40,000 jobs in May, suggesting that the employment outlook while poor, is not deteriorating. Analysts had expected a decline of 60,000.The latest Institute for Supply Management report on the US service industry kept broader equity indices moving forward. The ISM non-manufacturing index showed faster expansion than had been forecast, boosting service sector stocks.But by mid-afternoon a rally in the financial sector had petered out however, after Moody’s placed Ambac, the embattled bond insurer, on review for possible downgrade.The S&P 500 banking index, gave up gains of as much as 1.1 per cent to close down 0.8 per cent.A speech by Ben Bernanke in Harvard, swung the broader markets into losses near the close, raising the spectre of higher inflation and potentially higher interest rates going forward.The benchmark S&P 500 gave up gains of as much as 0.8 per cent to close roughly flat at 1,377.18. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also swung from gains to losses, ending the day down 0.1 per cent at 12,389.99. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.9 per cent to 2,503.14.On Tuesday, the travails of Lehman Brothers dragged down the banking sector and broader equity indices. A drop in oil prices also weighed on energy stocks.Financials have been the laggards by a wide margin for much of the year and the trend continued in the early part of the week, after Standard & Poor’s downgraded the credit ratings of a number of major institutions.Still, American Express helped lift the mood, if only briefly, saying it expects full-year profit to increase in spite of mounting credit losses. The credit card company rose 3 per cent to $45.64.Lehman climbed, for the first time in four days, adding 2.6 per cent to $31.40. An upgrade for Morgan Stanley from Wachovia helped the brokerage gain 1.7 per cent to $43.36.Moody’s and McGraw-Hill, which owns S&P, also made ground after reports that the credit rating agencies were near to a deal to end an investigation by the New York Attorney General into their role in the subprime crisis.Moody’s and McGraw-Hill rose 3.1 per cent to $39.63 and 6.5 per cent to $43.88 respectively.Ambac however, slumped 17 per cent to $2.49, while MBIA fell 15.8 per cent to $5.63, knocking sentiment and stock prices in the financial sector.Nonetheless, a further decline in oil prices offered some respite for consumer-related stocks hit hard by fears that record energy prices will curb household spending. Consumer staple and discretionary stocks rose 0.5 per cent each.Whole Foods Market was among the leading gainers in the consumer staples sector, rising 4.4 per cent to $29.34 after an analyst at FTN Midwest Securities recommended buying the stock.In the discretionary sector, Guess rallied 13.8 per cent to $43.11. The jeans retailer reported estimate-beating first-quarter profits and raised its full year earnings forecasts.Starbucks and Hasbro also made gains, advancing 2.1 per cent to $18.12 and 4.7 per cent to $38.80 respectively. Walt Disney rose 3.5 per cent to $34.35 on speculation that its ABC network will receive higher advertising rates than expected.Conversely, falling commodity prices weighed on energy and material stocks for a second day. The sectors lost 1.2 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively.Sunoco slumped 9.1 per cent to $44.22 while Titanium Metals fell 4 per cent to $16.12.Technology was the only sector to find any significant positive momentum, driven by the ISM data.AMD rose 5.6 per cent to $7.19, Ebay gained 2.1 per cent to $29.89 and the sector as whole rose 1 per cent.
829;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-05-27T00:04:06Z;Wall Street dispatch: Crisis queries power to appoint;;Most of us would not dream of buying a car without first kicking its tyres, or purchasing a house we have never visited.But when it comes to management teams, investors are being asked to take an awful lot on trust.Just ask shareholders in Citigroup. They must sit in front of their trading screens hoping that their board turns out to be lucky in its choice of chief executive.“Hoping” is the operative word, because many of the directors who selected the not-so-successful Chuck Prince in 2003 were behind the recent appointment of Vikram Pandit as the new number one.Investors in stumbling companies such as Yahoo, Starbucks and Dell, which recalled past leaders to the executive suite – a manoeuvre I hereby christen “the Steve Jobs” after Apple’s comeback bid – must also pray the board’s intuition proves correct.In all of these, and many other, cases shareholders were not consulted, let alone asked to vote, on the changes at the top.According to the US corporate handbook, that’s just fine.One of the commandments of Anglo-Saxon capitalism is that the board, and the board alone, is in charge of executive appointments. Dissatisfied shareholders can oppose directors at annual meetings or, more drastically, “vote with their feet” and sell their shares.I have some sympathy with the governance orthodoxy.Companies are not democracies and a well-run, properly-briefed, board has to be better placed to pick the right leader than an amorphous mass of investors with conflicting interests and a myriad of other trading positions.Even if annual meetings tend to be one-sided, tame affairs dominated by management, the current regime is, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, “the worst system of corporate governance except for all those other systems which have been tried”.But the credit squeeze has posed new questions about the way companies organise their upper echelons.By definition, all financial crises increase demands on top management and raise the pressure on boards for more effective oversight of the executive team. But the current turmoil has put a particular focus on the relationship between board, chief executive and chief financial officer.With asset prices volatile, large chunks of the credit markets in a coma, and huge pressure from investors and regulators for increased transparency, the role of the CFO has become more crucial.As the executive suite’s link between the internal audit functions, the external accountants, and the directors, the CFO is a pivotal figure in decisions such as write-downs, fund raisings and capital expenditure.Just like the influence of a finance minister rises when a country faces economic hardship, so does the power of a CFO in a corporation beset by a financial crisis. The problem is that CFO’s rising status in times of trouble is not matched by a commensurate strengthening of the oversight of his actions. The same conventions dictating that boards are charged with selecting a chief executive maintain that the CEO is the supreme judge of a CFO’s performance and ultimate arbiter of his or her fate.The CEO serves at the pleasure of the board but the CFO is, for all intents and purposes, a direct subordinate to the chief executive.Dell, one the companies that changed CFO recently, spelt this out when it said that Brian Gladden, the new recruit, would be “reporting to Michael Dell, CEO and chairman”.American International Group, the giant insurer, said as much this month when it accompanied news that CFO Steven Bensinger was moving to another post with a warm statement of thanks from CEO Martin Sullivan.Strict collaboration between chief executive and chief financial officer is, of course, beneficial to the company. Corporate America has a long tradition of hands-on CFOs, whose job goes beyond number crunching and takes in strategic planning. Many others have shown their managerial mettle by making the upward trip from finance chief to top dog.My contention is simply that, in unusually difficult times such as the present, boards should broaden their areas of scrutiny and take more of an interest in the CFO’s day-to-day work.Before aggrieved directors start e-mailing howls of protest, let me say that I am aware that boards have a “dialogue” with all top executives, including the finance chief. I also know that the board’s role involves planning succession for the whole executive team.But it is difficult to get away from the notion that, at many companies, CEOs and CFOs work hand-in-glove and that the latter’s foremost incentive is to keep their bosses satisfied.That, in turn, may forge a conspiratorial atmosphere that could encourage the two top executives to present a common front. Challenging periods tend to foster a siege mentality in many organisations and companies are no exception.Directors and boards should make a point of ensuring that the “ménage à deux” of their two top executives does not become too cozy, or worse.francesco.guerrera@ft.com
830;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-05-24T02:27:27Z;Arne Alsin: Investors who understand value have a real edge;;"You’re standing in line, waiting to buy a frappucino, and it hits you like a thunderbolt. It is a brilliant idea. Why didn’t you think of it earlier? You love the coffee sold here. You’re convinced this particular coffee company will continue to grow and prosper. So why not buy the stock? You call your broker and act on the idea. You pay $40 a share for Starbucks (I do not have a position in this company). You check the quote a few months later and it is $20.What does the drop in stock price tell you?If you’re like many investors, the fall is critically important. You look at the price and it makes you nervous. You’re upset. In your mind, it means you made a mistake. You worry that the stock price may fall further. And so, if you’re like a lot of investors, you sell.It is a mistake. It is always a mistake to sell because of a decline in price. Why? It’s because price, by itself, is meaningless.In order to attribute meaning to the price quote of Starbucks, a frame of reference is required: an appraisal of value. Is the stock worth $5 a share? Is it worth $100 a share? Only when you have a frame of reference can you make a judgment with respect to price.If your neighbour knocks on your door and offers you $20,000 for your new car, a car you know is worth at least $30,000, you’re not going to take his offer. If your neighbour knocks on your door a few days later and offers $10,000, you’re going to consider his offer frivolous, if not insulting. Why? It is because your decision-making process is based on a frame of reference. It’s easy to make a decision when you compare the price offer ($10,000) to the asset value ($30,000).For many investors in the stock market, it’s about price and price alone. Price drives perception. If the price goes down, something must be wrong. Sell the stock. If the price goes up, enthusiasm follows. Buy the stock. Since many investors lack an understanding of value, they do the stock market equivalent of selling a $30,000 car (value) for only $20,000, or even $10,000.Since the stock market is dominated by price-centric investors, those who understand value enjoy a significant edge. I gave readers of this column only one stock idea in 2007: Tecumseh Products, a worldwide leader in hermetic compressors, which continues to be one of my largest positions. It is up by 100 per cent since I highlighted it last year.…Here is my first buy recommendation in 2008. It is a stock that I have been buying aggressively, and that I think will more than double over the next couple of years: Office Depot. This story is a microcosm of what ails most investors. That is, investors employ a linear bias when viewing the operating performance of companies. When a company is thriving, producing operating metrics that are at or near peak levels, investors linearly project more of the same into the distant future. And when a company is struggling, when operating conditions are at or near a nadir, investors price the company as if the struggles are permanent.In spite of investors’ insistence on linearity, the fundamental essence of business is cyclical. All companies wrestle with cycles – sometimes the cyclical influence is external (such as a lousy economy) and sometimes the cyclical influence is internal.Office Depot is struggling with both external and internal issues. On the external front, many of its stores are located in California and Florida, states that have been hard hit by a decline in real estate activity. The good news for investors is that a number of internal initiatives, such as sourcing of private label product to China, are well under way and will lead to a significant rebound in operating margins.My calculations indicate that Office Depot, recently trading at about $13 a share, is worth at least $30 a share. There is upside from my $30 valuation since my model is based on margins that are below company targets.The value – not the stock price – of the average publicly traded business changes by less than 10 per cent a year. That’s less than 1 per cent a month. Why, then, do the stock prices oscillate so much?What does it say about the character of the stock market when Office Depot trades at more than $36 a share and, a few months later, trades at $13 a share?

831;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-05-16T19:47:11Z;Safeway responds to Tesco challenge;;Tesco, the UK supermarket group, is eyeing a first direct response from a US competitor to the arrival in the US of its Fresh & Easy markets, with the opening this week by Safeway of a new similarly-sized small grocery store.Von’s, Safeway’s subsidiary in southern California, this week opened a 15,000 sq ft store called The Market in Long Beach, on a site six miles from one of Tesco’s planned new 10,000 sq ft stores.However, unlike Tesco’s minimalist hard discount stores, an online review of the new store described The Market as “high-end”.Liz Ortega, a music industry producer and writer, said the store offers Long Beach residents “a wide variety of choices …fresh bakery, deli, meat department with an on-site butcher, fresh produce, a wine cellar.”The store also includes a counter serving Starbucks coffee. It is located on the edge of a prosperous beach- front neighbourhood, on a site previously occupied by a full-size Von’s supermarket.Von’s is describing the store as “a refreshingly simple” way to shop, echoing the focus on convenience and fresh food that is central to Fresh & Easy’s brand position. Its brand logo includes green leaves and brown lower-case lettering alongside Vons red trademark (see pictures below).While Fresh & Easy stores are dominated by Tesco’s own-label products, Von’s has opted for an edited selection of the most popular items sold in its regular, more up-market supermarkets.Safeway executives have said the new store is a pilot, as the California-based retailer, which operates more than 1,700 supermarkets in North America, experiments with the small format.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, is also preparing to open its first small-format grocers in Arizona later this year, which will be focused around low-price fresh produce and prepared ready-to-eat meals. The planned Marketside stores will initially open in communities around the city of Phoenix, one of Tesco’s main target markets.Tesco has opened more than 60 Fresh & Easy stores around Los Angeles, Phoenix and Las Vegas since November, with scores more planned.It has put a three-month hold on further openings while it reviews the performance so far and is expected to make adjustments to the store presentation and assortments.Pictures: Jeff Love/Liz Ortega
832;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Fast food boom lifts Enodis;;Enodis, the catering equipment maker that last week turned its back on an agreed offer from US rival Manitowoc in favour of an improved £1bn offer from Illinois Tool Works, saw interim profits slip as it absorbed restructuring costs in its US and European operations.But underlying profits before exceptionals resulting from its cost-cutting programme rose 9 per cent to £32.9m (£30.3m) on revenues that rose 8 per cent to £395m (£365m) amid resilient, if slowing, growth in its core US market.The company, whose deep-fat fryers, pizza ovens and latest generation smoothie makers are supplied to customers ranging from McDonald’s and Starbucks to the Royal Navy, said it continued to benefit from the global trend of people eating and drinking “on the hoof”.Dave McCulloch, chief executive, said: “The beauty of this industry is people still have to eat and drink and the market for food and beverages [catering equipment] has been growing considerably. In the US, gross domestic product growth is at 1 per cent, but our industry is growing at 4 per cent, and we have been outperforming the industry.”Mr McCulloch declined to comment on whether or not Manitowoc might come back to the table to trump ITW’s 282p a share agreed bid, pitched ahead of Manitowoc’s previously agreed bid of 260p.Shares in Enodis, which has seen its share price double since April 8, the day before it first came under offer from Manitowoc, closed down ¾p at 285¼p, reflecting slender hopes that an improved counterbid may yet emerge. Manitowoc has declined so far to make its intentions clear.Pre-tax profits for the half year to March 29 fell 16 per cent to £22.2m (£26.3m) following exceptional charges totalling £9.6m, including £5m of restructuring costs.The company said it expected to save £8m this year, and £4m next year, as a result of job losses and restructuring across the US and Europe.Earnings per share fell more sharply to 2.6p (4.3p) as the company absorbed a write-off on deferred tax assessments resulting from the offers for the company.Enodis has already declared a special 2p dividend, in lieu of an interim dividend, following the Manitowoc offer.FT CommentThe board and shareholders of Enodis deserve credit for holding their nerve over the two years of bid speculation. Approaches in 2006 from US competitors Middleby – at 195p – and then Manitowoc – at 220p – were followed by one from UK rival Aga Foodservice at below 200p. All were spurned as undervaluing the company. Last year saw Enodis’s shares fall from 220p to below 140p as bid speculation receded. With 282p a share in the bag, and a slender upside of an improved offering, those with a stake in the maker of deep-fat fryers can finally look forward to cashing in their chips.
833;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;What happened to tea time?;;On most afternoons at 3:45pm, staff in Cambridge architects RMJM down tools for a cuppa. “We stop and come together and someone makes tea,” says director Peter Williams. “It usually lasts 15-20 minutes.”Although the tea break has been taking place informally for some time, it was formalised three months ago, partly as a response to an increase in staff. “It’s a way for people to find out what colleagues are thinking, relax and stop e-mailing people across the room.”The tea break is a great British institution. But it has fallen from favour in the workplace and, unlike RMJM, most “tea breaks” involve tea in name only. Where once tea ladies walked the aisles of the UK’s offices, ministering brown beverages to the ranks, they have been largely supplanted by a combination of Starbucks and kitchenettes.Scottish Enterprise, the development agency, kept its tea lady long after most organisations had relinquished theirs. Yet when she retired, she was not replaced. The House of Commons has a members’ tea room, but it operates a canteen service.Nicky Wells, a senior brand manager at consumer goods company Unilever, looks after the PG Tips label. She says that, however it is made and served, taking tea brings people together: “Tea has always been a sociable, relaxing thing – think about the classic British response to a crisis. Coffee is a bit more ‘on the go’ and more of an individual thing.” The PG Tips team even throws tea parties in the office from time to time, she says: “They’re very well attended.”In keeping with the egalitarian spirit of our times, tea is nowadays made largely by those who drink it. But it can be a source of divisiveness when someone is not making their share. And the problem with ad hoc tea-making is that it tends to happen when the most caffeine-dependent member of the team needs their fix.Rachel Holland, an etiquette teacher, says the best way of dealing with this is to set a tea break at a certain time and use a rota. She also suggests posting a list of everyone’s preferences by the kettle.Large open-plan offices can be problematic, she says. In an workplace of several hundred there will always be an arbitrary cut-off point to your tea-making circle: “You can offer to make the tea and coffee for people around you, your team or those you’ll be talking to during the day.” She adds that the boss really should be part of this – making tea sends the right message.Bill Gorman, executive chairman of the UK Tea Council, says that when companies supply the tea, they need to ensure quality control. “The water often isn’t hot enough and has often been repeatedly boiled, which de-oxygenates it. Good tea needs fresh water which has just been boiled.”He adds that many organisations will “nickel and dime” staff when it comes to tea. “The company or their caterers go for the cheapest possible tea, which is a ridiculous economy. Fantastic tea costs 3p a cup while awful tea costs 1.5p. Caterers worry about sandwiches and coffee, but when it comes to tea they think we’ll drink any old rubbish. The average Brit drinks three cups a day – there should be a revolution.”In fact, one of the great things about tea is how easy it is to make a perfect drink. A premium cup of coffee requires specialist equipment – at the very least a cafetière – but a great cup of tea is within anyone’s reach. “With tea bags, it takes no time at all, and even a pot made with loose leaf is still fairly quick and convenient,” says Jeremy Sturges, senior buyer at Twinings.Perhaps the ultimate in tea convenience, however, is to be found in Japan. Although Honda says that traditional Japanese tea ceremonies are very rare these days, the company has come up with a novel answer to that vexed question: who serves the tea?Guests at the company’s headquarters earlier this year were brought tea, not by a personal assistant or office junior, but by a pair of Honda’s Asimo robots (pictured above).
834;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-05-05T19:16:38Z;Out of the door: Tax treatment tempts businesses to move country;;When Halliburton moved its headquarters from Houston to Dubai last year, the oil services group provoked a political storm. Despite assurances that the company was not seeking to avoid tax or scrutiny, the move was lambasted by Democrats as an example of corporate greed. Senator Hillary Clinton led the attack, denouncing the move as “disgraceful”.On the other side of the Atlantic, the spotlight is also on corporate defections after two big UK companies said last month they were shifting to Ireland for tax reasons. Others have also hinted at leaving. When United Business Media, a trade publisher, announced the move of its headquarters to Ireland, Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrats’ Treasury affairs spokesman, criticised this as “blatant tax avoidance”.Politicians fear loss of jobs and tax revenues when companies move their headquarters. But their moral indignation cuts little ice with multinationals whose ties with their home countries have diminished because of international expansion and cross-border mergers.Over the last decade, 6 per cent of multinationals have relocated, partly for tax reasons, according to research from Oxford University’s Centre for Business Taxation. Companies competing with rivals based in lower-tax regimes are under pressure to cut their tax bills. Moreover, they are being wooed as never before by small countries keen to attract skilled jobs or create a larger tax base.UBS, the investment bank, predicts a “gradual erosion of governments’ ability to tax”. When Shire, the UK pharmaceutical company, announced its move to low-tax Ireland last month, Amit Kara, director of UBS, said: “This is the kind of tax competition we should expect. The pressure will remain on countries such as the UK to continue lowering corporation tax especially for the fleet-footed. The tax burden may shift to smaller companies.”At first sight, there is little reason for governments to panic about the threat of shifting headquarters. Companies will still pay tax on the factories, sales and other profitable activities in the countries where they operate. But finance ministries fear that migrating companies will find new ways to strip the tax base of the countries where they operate. Academic research published last year showed that foreign-owned manufacturers in Europe paid less than half as much tax as domestically owned businesses.Julian Alworth, an associate fellow at Oxford’s Saïd Business School, sees fiscal reasons as dominant in determining relocations. He told a recent conference: “When you look at why companies are moving headquarters, it is often to reduce the liability in the country where their headquarters are located and where they have their operations.” He cited a controversial attempt by Stanley Works, the US tool manufacturer, to move its headquarters to Bermuda in 2002, which was ditched after a political outcry.The suspicions of finance ministries are also aroused by the mobility of the income that companies derive from intellectual property or financing operations. Many big countries attempt to trap this income in their tax net using anti-avoidance rules. By moving to a more lenient regime, companies hope to escape these restrictions.Boasting an attractive tax regime for intellectual property has become part of the marketing pitch for countries wanting to attract foreign corporations, particularly the regional European headquarters of US multinationals. Kraft, Google, Electronic Arts and Yahoo have all recently switched their European headquarters from the UK to Switzerland. Ebay, Amazon and Microsoft have moved to Luxembourg. The Netherlands boasts names such as Cisco Systems, Nike and Starbucks.As multinationals become more skillful at managing their intellectual property, there are tax as well as commercial advantages. By holding brands and patents in low-tax countries and charging other subsidiaries for their use, profits are lowered in high-tax countries.Unsurprisingly, these shifts of intellectual capital are unpopular with many tax authorities. Two years ago, Mark Everson, former commissioner of the US Internal Revenue Service, warned that the increasing transfer of intangibles was a “high-risk compliance concern”, adding: “Taxpayers, especially in the high technology and pharmaceutical industries, are shifting profits offshore.”The small, low-tax countries that encourage profit-shifting of this sort are also criticised. Ireland’s success at attracting knowledge-based companies is seen as overly aggressive by some rival governments. Arnauld Montebourg, a French politician, last year accused low-tax Switzerland of “predatory practices”. The Netherlands – which attracted Ikea from Sweden and Gucci from Italy – was lambasted for its approach to taxing mobile income by the Amsterdam-based Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations, a non-profit research group. “All the empirical evidence indicates that the Netherlands is a tax haven,” it said.These criticisms are shrugged off by tax competition advocates, who believe tax competitiveness encourages investment. But resentment from larger rivals poses risks for small countries eager for foreign business. One of the worst fears of Ireland’s politicians is that the republic will be arm-twisted into adopting the European Commission’s proposals for a common method of computing corporate taxes. When Christine Lagarde, French finance minister, said last month that France would push this concept forward in its European Union presidency, Bertie Ahern, the outgoing Irish prime minister, dismissed it as a “daft” idea.Big countries are meanwhile strengthening their defences. In the US, the IRS is fighting the migration of intellectual property, inflicting tax demands running into billions of dollars on pharmaceutical companies. Germany has just reinforced its rules on the transfer of assets to foreign companies. The UK has proposed tightening its anti-avoidance rules by taxing the worldwide “passive” income of companies with UK headquarters.But the problem is that these tougher regimes impose a hefty compliance burden on companies and expose them to the risk of double taxation. In the UK, the complexities of the proposed anti-avoidance system have exasperated big businesses already disenchanted with Britain’s tax regime. Richard Lambert, director-general of the CBI, the British employers’ federation, says companies “are seriously concerned about the high level and rising complexity of taxation in the UK and are increasingly prepared to vote with their feet”.Shire said it was leaving to “help protect the group’s tax position”. UBM said its long-term interests would be helped by Ireland’s “less complex system of taxation”. But nobody can confidently predict whether this trickle will become a flood. There are some powerful factors that deter companies from migrating, including the prospect of capital gains tax bills and the threat of reputational damage.Also, for all the criticism of Britain’s tax regime, it has an enduring appeal for some multinationals because of its generous treatment of interest costs and payments to shareholders. Barclays, Britain’s third-largest bank, thought hard about moving its tax domicile when it tried to acquire ABN Amro last year but calculated that its shareholders would be better off if it stayed in Britain.Nonetheless, more big companies are considering leaving the UK. International Power, WPP, AstraZeneca and GSK have all hinted that the matter is under review. A few years ago, this could have been viewed as sabre-rattling. But a big barrier to migration has recently been lifted: companies are no longer required to have a UK base to be included in the FTSE index.Nor can the government rely on exit taxes to stem the tide. Unlike the US, which has tried to devise laws to keep companies on American soil, European governments are under pressure to remove barriers to movement within the single market.In Britain, the threat of an exodus has sparked a debate about how policymakers should respond. Insurers are lobbying the Treasury for concessions to stem migrations to Bermuda. Deloitte, the professional services company, has argued for a special tax rate on mobile income such as trademarks. Another radical option being discussed is imposing a minimum tax for multinationals on their UK profits, as an alternative to stringent anti-avoidance measures.The Treasury has an awkward dilemma. It depends on corporate taxpayers for a tenth of its revenue. It does not want to make overly generous concessions. Nor does it wish to single out specific sectors or types of income for concessions, which might create new loopholes for avoidance.So far, the Treasury’s focus has been on making the tax regime more attractive for multinationals by exempting foreign profits from tax. This move could help stop corporate migrations, were it not accompanied by tougher anti-avoidance rules. One of the main reasons why DaimlerChrysler based itself in Germany rather than the US after its 1998 merger (subsequently unwound) was that Germany exempted foreign profits from tax.The UK has also promised to cut the corporation tax further, following a 2 percentage point fall to 28 per cent this year. Gordon Brown last week told business leaders that one of his aims as prime minister was “to reduce corporation tax even further when we can afford to do so”. Some businesses are clamouring for radical cuts. A recent CBI taskforce called for the corporation tax rate to fall, over time, to 18 per cent.A view sometimes aired in government is that large countries such as the UK should be more sanguine about losing the headquarters of big domestic businesses and focus on attracting “real business” into the country, regardless of who owns or controls it. Genuine investment goes to countries where it can be deployed. Tax is far less important in these considerations than proximity to markets, infrastructure and the availability of skilled staff.Yet if countries such as Britain become reconciled to losing headquarters to lower-tax rivals, they will pay a price. As well as shedding well-paid jobs and advisory work, they risk a decline in influence and investment as decision-makers go elsewhere. When world-leading businesses uproot themselves, more is at stake than national pride.
835;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-05-01T19:22:21Z;Corporate US faces changing shopping habits;;Corporate America has been dealing with the damage done by the mortgage crisis and resulting credit crunch since last year, with the effects spreading gradually across consumer companies ranging from Tiffany, the jewellers, to Starbucks and General Motors.Yet the economic slowdown has not been bad news for everyone, reflecting both behavioural shifts among US consumers and the advantages enjoyed by those companies that are less reliant on the US domestic market than most of their rivals.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, has a mass discount business that is focused on low-income consumers, who have been the hardest hit by rising fuel prices and tightening credit.But its sales have outperformed other mainstream retailers, including the department stores JC Penney, Kohl’s and Macy’s, and Target, its more upmarket discount rival. Its shares have risen more than 30 per cent since October, to hit their highest levels for four years.Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart’s US stores, this week offered investors data supporting the view that the retailer was benefiting as more affluent customers were “shopping down”. He said traffic at the hundreds of Wal-Mart stores classed as “affluent” – serving households with incomes in the $55,000-$75,000 range – had increased in March 2.3 percentage points above the average for the entire 3,500 store network.“We are capturing our customers from the more affluent segments,” he said.He noted that Wal-Mart’s customers overall were increasingly using cash, rather than credit. The trend continued even in the run-up to Christmas last year, when the share of credit would traditionally increase.Wal-Mart’s credit receipts in February and March, fell almost 6 per cent, compared with the same period in 2007.“People don’t have as much access to credit as they used to and clearly that is having an impact on how consumers behave,” he said.“This isn’t that people have decided that they can’t spend more, but they have gone beyond their ability to get any more credit . . . they’ve topped out,” he said.Frank Badillo, chief economist at consultants TNS Retail Forward, says there is increasing evidence in the US of shoppers responding differently to economic pressures in their shopping habits. The upper income shoppers are increasingly likely to go to a discounter such as Wal-Mart to buy their preferred brands, while low- and middle-income shoppers opt for store brands that cost less.“The upper income shopper is more likely to stick with brand buys but is more likely to shift shopping channel,” he says.Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer products company, suggests that is a factor in the continued strength of its leading brands such as Pampers and Tide.The only other bright spots on the corporate American landscape are those companies with large export markets, which are helped by the weak dollar, and those exposed to booming sectors, such as energy and mining, and emerging markets.In contrast to this week’s warning from Michelin, its European rival, Goodyear, the US tyremaker, reported strong first-quarter profits as the weak dollar boosted exports.Other strong quarterly performance came from Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of bulldozers, and Honeywell, the industrial conglomerate, which were also buoyed by strong demand from overseas.Meanwhile, Kraft, the largest US food brand company, is trying to hold on to customers by producing smaller versions of its pizzas and deli meat packages at lower price points – traditionally a tactic used by consumer brands building market share in the developing world.
836;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Home Depot cuts back plans for growth;;Home Depot, the second-largest US retailer, is again to scale down its US growth plans, continuing a trend that has also seen Wal-Mart and Starbucks cut back on store opening plans in response to increasing market saturation.The home improvement retailer, which operates almost 2,000 stores across the US, says it will slow its annual sq ft growth to 1.5 per cent, adding 20 to 30 new US stores annually – that is, less than a third of its growth rate in 2007. Frank Blake, chief executive, characterised the decision as a response to investor concerns about return on capital rather than as a short-term response to the slump in the home improvement market.“This is a continuation of our disciplined approach to capital allocation that we outlined last year,” he said in a statement.Two years ago, Mr Blake’s predecessor, Bob Nardelli, outlined plans for Home Depot to add 80 to 90 stores a year until 2011, which already represented a reduction from the 180 stores a year that it was opening in the first years of the decade.As part of a review of its real estate, the company is to close 15 underperforming stores. It will also abandon 50 planned US store locations, some of which have been in its pipeline for more than 10 years, recording a $400m charge for development costs.Home Depot said spending on new stores will be reduced by about $1bn during the next three years.Mr Blake had already reduced capital spending on new stores to $2.3bn this year, from $3.6bn last year, with 36 new stores planned for the US and 19 in Canada and Mexico.The strategy reflects decisions by other retail icons that expanded rapidly in the 1990s against a background of strong US economic growth. Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, said last year that it would slow its US store expansion amid similar investor concerns about returns on investment.Starbucks, the global coffee chain, is also to cut planned US store openings as part of a broad effort by Howard Schultz, chief executive, to improve performance. The company said on Wednesday it would slow its US opening plans to 400 a year for the next three years, down from 1,020 this year.
837;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-04-25T18:27:19Z;Starbucks curtails its musical ambitions;;Starbucks, the global coffee shop chain, this week abandoned its ambitions of playing a direct role in the music production business, ending an experiment that became emblematic of the dramatic changes in the music industry over the past decade.The move comes less than a year after Sir Paul McCartney became the first artist to launch an album of new songs on Starbucks’ Hear Music label.The retailer is handing over management of Hear Music, which it acquired in 1999, to Concord Music Group, its partner on projects including Sir Paul’s Memory Almost Full album.The move is part of a drive to cut costs and to focus on its core coffee business led by Howard Schultz, who resumed the position of chief executive officer of the company in January.Hear Music reflected a search by both music companies and retailers to find new ways of reaching potential customers.The label’s first original recording, a 2004 tribute to Ray Charles called Genius Loves Company, won eight Grammy music industry awards when it was released two months after his death.Starbucks will continue its efforts to exploit its stores’ potential as a retail outlet for music, with Concord selecting and producing recordings that will be exclusive to the chain.However, the relationship will now be closer to that emerging between the music industry and Wal-Mart and Target, the two largest mass discount chains, which are the largest channels for sales of traditional CDs.Last Christmas, Wal-Mart launched Long Road out of Eden, the first album in 28 years by the Eagles, which was produced by the band’s own recording company. The retailer also produces exclusive online recording sessions with artists ranging from Sheryl Crow to Lenny Kravitz on its website.In January this year Target released an exclusive live album by John Legend, produced by his recording company, Sony BMG.But while Wal-Mart’s and Target’s music strategy is aimed at attracting customers who will spend on other purchases, Starbucks says it will focus on selecting music and other offerings that reinforce the experience of visiting its coffee houses.It is also continuing a relationship with Apple’s iTunes that includes giving a free music track away weekly, and selling downloads of music through in-store wireless networks. It had earlier experimented with Hear Music stores equipped with kiosks where customers could download music.The chain will also continue to work with the William Morris agency to promote books.Starbucks also indicated that it will drop attempts to co-promote films, after aggressively backing the 2006 film Akeelah and the Bee with Lions Gate Films and Arctic Tale in 2007 with Paramount. Both films were released on DVD through the coffee chain, but were box office failures.As a result of the changes, Ken Lombard, the former head of the entertainment division, is leaving the company, and responsibility for future projects will go to Chris Bruzzo, chief technology officer – reflecting the focus on wireless services.
838;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-04-24T20:48:38Z;Wall Street rally led by financials;;Wall Street stocks rallied for a second day on Thursday as financials led markets higher and investors picked out the positive in a mixed batch of earnings reports.The day began in gloomy fashion as cautious outlook statements from several corporations, including Apple and Amazon, stirred fears of a consumer-spending slowdown.Materials and energy stocks, which have supported equity markets for much of the past few weeks, had their worst day in over a month, following commodity prices lower in spite of strong results from industry leaders.But an unexpected rally in financials helped wipe out those declines thanks to upgrades and strong results at a handful of insurance companies.Homebuilders contributed to the turn in sentiment after the National Association of Home Builders said the US housing market would begin to recover in the third quarter, brushing aside new data showing sales of new homes slumped in March.The benchmark S&P 500 erased losses of as much as 0.6 per cent to close up 0.6 per cent at 1,388.82 while the Nasdaq Composite ended 1 per cent higher at 2,428.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.7 per cent to 12,848.95.Financials advanced 3.8 per cent on Thursday, their biggest gain since the start of the month, as investors looking for a bottom to the market rotated out of energy stocks and into the downtrodden sector. T Rowe Price, the fund manager, led the gainers adding 11.8 per cent to $60.24 after posting its 20th straight quarterly increase in earnings.Insurers Travelers and Aflac added to that revival, climbing 4 per cent to $50.23 and 4.1 per cent to $67.76, respectively, after both beat first-quarter estimates and raised their full-year forecasts.Investment banks also made ground after the chief executive of Merrill Lynch said the firm would maintain its dividend. Merrill Lynch added 7.1 per cent to $48.09 while Lehman Brothers rose 6.2 per cent to $46.38.James McGlynn, portfolio manager of the Summit Everest Fund, said: “There was so much uncertainty going into the earnings season, people thought financials were going to drop another shoe, so the stocks have perhaps been overly discounted.”Mike Mayo, an analyst with Deutsche Bank, said: “The crises now seems closer to the end, albeit with lingering uncertainty related to monoline insurers, CDO dispositions and short-term money markets.”As oil slipped off its highs and the dollar rallied, giving consumers more wiggle room, JC Penney climbed 3.5 per cent to $41.97 while Macy’s added 5 per cent to $24.36.Ford led the consumer sector higher after the car group unexpectedly swung into profit in the first quarter as reduced costs offset weak US sales. Ford jumped 11.7 per cent to $8.40 while rival General Motors added 5.6 per cent to $22.11.Companies reliant on discretionary spending had initially found it hard going after several bellwethers cut forecasts and were sold by anxious investors.Starbucks tumbled 10.4 per cent to $15.99, Whirlpool, the appliance maker, slid 10.1 per cent to $73.89 and 3M lost 1.7 per cent to $79.25.Homebuilders helped the advance. Lennar added 7.9 per cent to $18.38 while Pulte Homes rose 5.4 per cent to $13.81.In technology, too, early despair gave way to enthusiasm. Better-than-expected results and forecasts from LSI pushed the sector into the black. The maker of storage chips advanced 20.8 per cent to $5.99.By the close, Apple, which added 15 per cent in the month running up to the results, was 3.7 per cent higher at $168.94. Amazon fell 4.1 per cent at $77.69.Energy and materials stocks were a drag on indices. Gold producer Newmont Mining said first-quarter profit rose fivefold thanks to record prices for bullion but its shares fell 2.1 per cent to $42.94, mimicking the pattern of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold on Wednesday. Freeport shares fell 3 per cent to $112.61 while energy groups Chevron and ConocoPhillips dropped 2.2 per cent to $92.40 and 1.8 per cent to $82.96.Industrials rose after Northrop Grumman, the shipbuilder, and Goodrich, the aerospace components maker, posted better-than-expected results. Goodrich shares jumped 9.7 per cent to $67.66 while Northrop climbed 4.4 per cent $72.55.
839;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-04-23T23:47:23Z;Slowdown filters through to Starbucks;;Starbucks, the coffee house chain, on Wednesday blamed a “sharp weakening” in the consumer economy for an unexpected decline in its US sales, sending its shares plunging more than 10 per cent in after-hours trading.Howard Schultz, who returned to the role of chief executive in January, said “the current economic environment is the weakest in our company’s history”, citing the housing slump and rising energy and food costs.The company said conditions were particularly bad in California and Florida, which account for 32 per cent of its retail revenues and have been hard hit by the slump in the US housing market.Starbucks said comparable sales at its US stores experienced a mid-single-digit percentage fall during the quarter that ended on March 30. It said it expected to earn 15 cents a share in the quarter, down from 19 cents a year ago and less than the 21 cents expected by Wall Street analysts.Starbucks reported its first ever fall in US comparable sales in the quarter ending on December 31, with sales down 1 per cent.The company said it expected its full-year earnings per share to be “somewhat lower” than it reported in its 2007 fiscal year.It said it was not providing a more detailed forecast “due to lack of visibility into near-term economic conditions”.Mr Schultz said the company was committed to a series of initiatives announced last month aimed at revitalising its US stores, including a new coffee blend.It also has embraced old-school direct marketing methods, such as coupons, after launching its first US television advertising campaign over the Christmas holiday.Starbucks’ shares fell to $15.88 in after-hours trade.
840;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-04-20T20:51:51Z;Market trends: Strong names beat the market;;Branding is becoming ever more important as companies face an increasingly global and competitive marketplace.Millward Brown Optimor’s third annual ranking of the world’s top 100 most powerful brands is based partly on WPP’s Brandz database, which covers more than 50,000 of them. It found that the world’s top 100 brands have a total value of about $1,900bn, equivalent to the GDP of Italy.“Brand is becoming more and more important,” says Joanna Seddon, chief executive of Millward Brown Optimor. “Technology brands have done very well this year, Google and Apple are in the top 10. For the second year running Google is the world’s most valuable brand.“Some of the world’s most successful companies are successful because they built their brand along with the business,” she adds. “Orange is a good example of that. They invested in the brand before they even had a business.”But Millward Brown Optimor has also been measuring the effects of brand on stock market performance – an area where little research has been done. It has created a “Brandz” portfolio incorporating all the brands in its top 100 survey that it was possible to invest in.The brands had to be public limited companies with liquid stock. The portfolio returns were measured in US dollars so the results are subject to currency effects.The Brandz portfolio is benchmarked against the S&P 500 as this exchange mirrors its composition most closely – large and small caps, industry and inter­national exposure.“We didn’t use the FTSE, as eight of the world’s top brands are in the US so it would be skewed by currency effects,” says Malte Nuhn, senior consultant at Millward Brown Optimor.Not all companies received equal investment at the onset of the portfolio. There was a higher investment in companies with stronger brands and those whose branded businesses were a larger part of the group.Millward Brown also isolated the stronger brands into a separate portfolio – those that have a brand contribution above 30 per cent (in the rankings the brand contributions are indexed but in fact they are percentages). This “Strong Brands” portfolio incorporates around two-thirds of the world’s top 100 brands.On April 3, the S&P had risen 3 per cent over 12 months, the Brandz Top 100 portfolio was up 15 per cent and the strong brands portfolio was up 22 per cent.On December 31 last year the S&P was up 11 per cent, the Brandz Top 100 portfolio was up 25 per cent and the strong brands portfolio was up 34 per cent.The Millward Brown study showed that products and companies with strong brand value enjoyed markedly stronger returns in good times and also during the recent market downturn.Hayes Roth, chief marketing officer of Landor Associates, the consultancy, says: “There is remarkable consistency between strong brand value and stock performance.”“Brand power can be significantly linked to stock market strength, adding on average – and depending on category – more than 25 per cent market value to an organisation.”Ms Seddon believes that the drivers behind this outperformance include the fact that strong brands can more readily increase their revenues and market share. This is because people are more attracted to the products and are more likely to be loyal to them.“You also may have the possibility of achieving a price premium,” adds Mr Nuhn. “Apple’s products sell for roughly 20 per cent more than equivalents from rivals, which will affect margins.”But there are plenty of examples of strong brands hitting nasty bumps in the road.“Look at Starbucks. You can do a world class job of building brands and do every­thing right but when you rapidly expand your global footprint it is hard to maintain what made the brand great in the first place. They over-extended themselves,” says Mr Roth.“McDonald’s suffered with the Americanisation of the world but they went back and reinvented themselves and they have moved up the list,” he adds.Studies have shown that a strong brand affects not only demand but also the supply chain. For example, if you have a strong brand such as Goldman Sachs or Microsoft it is easier to attract top graduates from business schools.“You can pay them less and they will stay longer, you can get better terms with suppliers. If you have a strong brand and invest in new products or markets you can get somebody else to take your investment risk,” says Ms Seddon.There are no global brand funds to date, although Millward Brown Optimor says its study has generated a lot of interest from the fund management community who have mooted the idea of creating a global brand fund where they would use the data as a basis for stock picking.Mr Roth says: “Look at the Optimor study. If you had picked the top five you would have done OK. Of the top 100 brands there is a lot of jockeying up and down because there are other things that affect performance.”“But strong brands will see you through and leave you in a far better place. A global brand fund would be a long-haul investment, it ought to look like a blue chip fund. It would be terrific to see. There is certainly a lot of interest.”
841;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-04-20T20:51:50Z;Sector analysis: Asia and technology leading the way;;"The key trends in this year’s Brandz Top 100 rankings – the strength of leading technology and mobile communications brands, the power of innovation, the rise of Asian and especially Chinese brands – all emerge in this detailed look at 16 business categories.This year, insurance companies have been given their own category rather than being lumped in with other financial institutions. Some additional research in laundry care (fabric detergent and fabric softener/conditioner) and deodorants has covered some of the brands in the category. Spirits is an entirely new category and gives fresh insight into the performance of companies such as Diageo, which owns five of the Top 10 brands.The following is an edited version of the Brandz sectoral findings, with additional comments for the fastest-growing categories, and the two new ones, from Joanna Seddon, chief executive of Millward Brown Optimor, Peter Walshe, director of the Brandz programme at MBO, and Anna Chen, associate director.Apparel• There is an increased link between sport and lifestyle, leading to a smaller distinction between sports and regular apparel brands – many consumers are wearing more sportswear, but not participating in more sports activities.• The sporting goods industry has benefited from global sporting events such as the World Cup and the forthcoming Beijing Olympics, which have placed the industry in the limelight. In China, rising disposable incomes and interest in western sporting events have created an opportunity for western sports brands.• Retailers are placing more focus on online channels as more and more consumers turn to e-retailing.Brand highlights: Ralph Lauren is seeking better control over its products to maintain its prestigious brand image, and has seen strong demand for its “collection” products.Esprit is the one brand from this category to feature in the overall list of top 20 risers. It has not deviated from its original aim, says Ms Chen – focusing on affordable, casual clothing that is not overly trendy and thus likely to fall out of fashion quickly. Esprit is also a relatively rare example of a global mass market brand, says Ms Seddon – while others such as Zara and H&M are still becoming global.Beer• In the west, smoking bans, shrinking core markets and a widening choice of alternative alcoholic beverages have conspired to stunt the growth of the beer market, although the 2006 World Cup and a spate of unusually hot weather have softened the blow.• Companies are increasing their focus on emerging markets.• Domestic beers in developed markets face stagnant volumes while imported premium brands see strong growth.• In the US, a preference for imported premium beers and for healthier options has boosted the “luxury imported light” category,with sales almost twice those of imported regular beers.• There has been consolidation in the brewing industry as companies seek to secure brands and national positions as well as broaden global footprints.Brand highlights: Skol’s results come from long-term brand renovation work and significant outreach to young men. The Stella Artois brand grew beyond the UK, with good results in North America and eastern Europe. For Beck’s, innovative products such as Beck’s Green Lemon have helped refresh the brand image and attract interest.Cars• The strong brands benefit from cool new designs, fuel efficient and green models in an environment where gas prices are rising.• Recent business conditions have been characterised by increases in crude oil and raw materials prices, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and structural changes in demand.• Development was influenced by dynamic growth in the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America, whereas the traditional car markets (US, Japan and western Europe) recorded zero or negative growth.Brand highlights: Porsche capitalised on the success of the previous fiscal year in the Middle East, Latin America and southern and eastern Europe. Fiat’s revenues reached a record high, due to the success of the Punto, Panda, Bravo and light commercial vehicles.Coffee• The global coffee market has experienced slow but positive sales growth, leading to good results for most brands.• A big characteristic is innovation and movement towards quality/premium products.• Fair trade sales have significantly increased.• Nestlé and Kraft dominate instant coffees and the whole category as a result.• Consumers are turning to ground coffee and/or stopping consumption of instant coffee.Brand highlights: Nespresso has capitalised on the success of the previous fiscal year in the Middle East, Latin America and southern and eastern Europe. The brand is leading the “premium” trend because it is positioned as almost a luxury coffee – sold only at top department stores and its own “boutiques”. So the product can be sold at a relatively high price.Fast Food• Consumers are returning to fast-food restaurants as efforts to revamp the industry’s image through healthier and better quality offerings pay off.• Growth in the number of outlets is forecast to slow down as operators focus on maximising sales from existing stores with later hours and increased menu variety.• Asia offers great opportunity for fast food operators to expand. Western fast-food brands hold an aspirational status and are regarded as a treat.• Coffee houses have reached a level of maturity in leading markets, which means that profits are substantial but not as large as early 2000.• Competition is also increasing as major retailers have or are developing their own-brand coffee shops.Brand highlights: The category was the fastest overall riser in the previous year’s rankings and is still doing well. McDonald’s and Burger King remain the sector’s “Yin and Yang” in terms of strategy, as Ms Seddon puts it, yet have both recorded big rises in brand value. Meanwhile KFC’s “new fast food” positioning in China has strengthened the brand’s No 1 position, far outstripping McDonald’s.Apart from Wendy’s, the one brand whose value declined, by 25.2 per cent, was Starbucks. This partly reflects the decline in the “business value” element of the calculation and the fact that the brand has fallen from its peak position.But MBO’s experts point out that Starbucks’ “brand contribution” is still rising and the brand remains fundamentally strong.Howard Schultz, the chairman and founder who this year returned to the post of chief executive, is given credit by Ms Seddon for realising early that the company, in its dash for growth, may be losing something essential to the brand – the “smell of fresh coffee in the stores”.Financial Institutions• Many US and British banks have been affected by the subprime crisis.• Chinese banks have had two big years but it is hard to tell how much of their performance is due to better management and how much to the exceptionally favourable economic conditions.• To maintain a competitive edge, banks need to both provide a service that clients perceive as being personalized and focus on a specific area rather than a wide range of functions.• Leading banks and financial services companies are making proactive attempts to be more “green”.Brand highlights: The impact of last summer’s credit squeeze can be seen in the declines or small rises in brand value for Citi, UBS, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley, whereas Goldman Sachs, up 45 per cent, is benefiting from taking a contrarian line to its rivals. “They saw the credit crunch coming and actually bet against the subprime mortgage market,” says Ms Seddon.Citi’s 10 per cent decline in brand value has allowed Bank of America to claim top spot. Mr Walshe notes that 10 years ago, Bank of America hardly registered as a brand, but that acquisitions, rebranding and “shouting about what it is and where it stands in the marketplace”, have made a big impact.The inexorable rise of the Chinese banks is also charted by the Brandz rankings, with ICBC, China Construction Bank and Bank of China all achieving big rises in brand value. Standard Chartered Bank benefits from its presence in Asia. The increases would have been greater if MBO had not adjusted for the so-called “Shanghai bubble” on stock markets last year, which would have given an inflated overall view of the banks’ brand value.Insurance• Leading insurance companies are positioning themselves for a future that requires significant changes in the way they do business (unprecedented volatility, a changing customer base and exacting regulators).• New markets will help drive profits, as developed economies see slower growth in demand for insurance.• Insurers collectively spent $2bn last year on advertising, surpassing the beer, entertainment and soft drink industries.Brand highlights: The Aviva brand (a new entry) is not used in the UK, where it trades as Norwich Union. Net income increased 26 per cent with special help from the UK and the Netherlands, acquisitions and rapidly growing organic start-ups.Axa’s net income rose significantly, including the acquisition of Winterthur, the former insurance arm of Credit Suisse. Axa wants to address eroded confidence in the sector.Luxury• The global value of the market is around $400bn and it is tipped to grow to $2,000bn by 2010.• There are emerging consumers for “New Luxury” items, products and services that deliver higher levels of quality, taste, and aspiration than conventional ones.• Luxury brands prefer to use standard advertising and marketing formats as they have concerns that interruptive formats have a negative impact on their brand.• There is pressure even for luxury brands to be environmentally responsible. A report by WWF, the conservation organisation, criticised the luxury products industry as being “slow to recognise their responsibilities and opportunities”.• Recently luxury brands have been entering the leisure/construction industries, exporting lifestyle brands to hotels and apartments.Brand highlights: The solid rises in brand value, from an already high base, attest to the importance of innovation – and making a splash about it. “It’s about constantly coming up with something new and creating a buzz around the brands, and all these brands are very good at that,” says Ms Seddon. Consistent application of brand management principles has resulted in very similar brand value increases across the LVMH brands – Louis Vuitton, Moët & Chandon and Hennessy. Yet LVMH is a true “house of brands”, says Ms Seddon – each is managed separately and synergies are not exploited because this could have a long-term impact on the share price and the success of the brand. “It’s the opposite of some of the car companies, who make the same chassis for all their cars and just stick different top pieces on it,” she says. “There is no same car under different labels here. The employees stay within one brand, they don’t jump from one to another, so they live the principles of the brand.”Elsewhere, Gucci has branched away from the conservative approach typical of brands in this category through the creation of a strong online corporate identity, allowing it to stand out among competitors.Mobile Operators• Mobile phones are ubiquitous, so network operators are focused on getting customers to spend more.• The biggest influence on the growth of the market has been the advent of 3G technology, which enables facilities such as video calling and game downloads.• The liberalisation of the telecommunications sector has led to price pressure.• As markets approach saturation point, providers are focusing on strengthening existing customer relationships. At the European level, competition is increasing because of the introduction of Europe-wide services.Brand highlights: Vodafone, Movistar and Orange are expanding globally from bases in smaller markets, while China Mobile has built a very strong brand in one huge market. “It’s a premium-priced brand, unlike its competitors, and it is not just big,” says Ms Seddon. “It is also very much being developed, positioned and marketed as a brand, as opposed to just a product or service.”O2, now part of Telefónica, is maintaining its brand personality, standing for solidity, globalisation and innovation while reinventing itself through marketing efforts such as sponsoring the England rugby team.MTS is the first Russian company to reach the BrandZ Top 100, coming in at 89th.Motor Fuel• Brands are globalising, as is shown by the expansion not only of the BP brand, but also the recent appearance of the Lukoil brand in retail petrol in the US and other markets.• Companies are trying to manage the difficult balancing act of promoting a “green” agenda and sustainability in a credible manner.• The strategic focus for the companies remains on upstream and refining activities – brand-building is at the bottom of the agenda.Brand highlights: PetroChina’s consolidated turnover increased 24.8 per cent and consolidated net profit rose 6.6 per cent.Personal Care• In all areas of the personal care market, products offering additional properties to simply cleaning have been booming (for example, skin-firming for face, whitening for teeth or curl-enhancing for hair).• As manufacturers have extended their offerings, brands have shifted consumer perceptions so that these products are now viewed as beauty products and not simply as toiletries.• A big trend in the sector is the rise of spa-influenced products, which command price premiums.Brand highlights: The sector has some very strong brands that continue to grow, says Mr Walshe. The biggest riser is Nivea. Innovation underlies the strength of the top brands, he says – but this may not necessarily be in the products themselves. “There’s a feeling of communications innovation, which gives you a sense of dynamism about the brand and why, therefore, it’s worth buying it and being seen to use it.”A further point is that brands with a “premium feel” to them, if not actually luxury brands, are doing well. Lancôme and Shiseido, which has expanded beyond Japan, are examples.Unlike in other categories, no strong indigenous brands have yet developed in emerging Asian markets, attesting to the international brands’ marketing and distribution clout and their recognisability.In deodorants, Axe is now the number one deodorant in the US, with strong double-digit growth. The “Axe effect” – giving men the edge in the dating game – underpins all the brand’s campaigns. Branding and marketing is very similar for Lynx, as the Unilever product is called in the UK, Ireland and Australia.Dove associated its deodorant with positive skincare credentials, and positioned it more as a beauty product than a functional one, which helped to increase penetration and achieve a double-digit increase in turnover.Retailing• The race to capture the green moral high ground has gone into overdrive.• Grocery retailers are moving into non-traditional business areas such as digital media services, marking a new position as providers of lifestyle products.• There has been significant growth in online retailing as consumers seek more convenient ways to shop. Many retailers have enhanced multi-channel offers to give a more flexible service.• In line with the trend towards healthy eating, retailers are increasingly displaying nutrition labels on products.Brand highlights: At Amazon, increased product offerings and new initiatives not only improved financial performance but also helped to refresh the brand with consumers.“There is one internet retail success story and this is it,” says Ms Seddon. “It’s about focusing on ease of use and involving the consumer.”They reach out to you by saying: “What books do you want to buy this week? We think you might be interested in this.” At Tesco, meanwhile, the introduction of more healthy foods boosted sales. Wider product choice and a flexible delivery system led to a 30 per cent increase in Tesco.com revenues as consumers seek more convenient ways to shop.At Home Depot in the US, the slowdown in the home improvement market resulted in a decrease of comparable store sales of 4.6 per cent; increasing labour and store costs also reduced profitability.Soft Drinks• The sector is struggling to sustain growth as an unhealthy image drives down consumption of soft drinks, while juices and water are claiming market share. Unsurprisingly, the low-calorie category is faring best.• The sector is dominated by a handful of superbrands and strong promotional support will ensure that the sector continues to grow, even if it is at a slower rate.• Events such as the football World Cup provided good opportunities for marketing, while the sector continues to embrace the web to reach a youthful audience, particularly in the form of websites for music downloading or video uploading.• The inclusion of bottling has boosted business value for all brands.Spirits• The European beverage sector is trading at a higher relative valuation than for more than a decade.• The US market continues to deliver growth in the premium segments.• Emerging markets are increasingly important to profitability and have shown accelerating sales.• Growth in the spirits market is coming from “premiumisation”. Many brands are trying to innovate and extend brands upwards.• Brands have faced greater advertising restrictions, especially around the issue of linking sex to alcohol and responsibility among younger drinkers.Brand highlights: The most valuable spirits brand, Hennessy, is not on the list as it is in the luxury category. Innovations include new flavours to add pizzazz to he big base brands, according to Ms Seddon. Bacardi is a good example with additional flavours to complement the core white rum.Elsewhere, Smirnoff relaunched its Smirnoff Black Label at the premium end of the market and emphasised its copper-pot distillation method.Johnnie Walker has harnessed tremendous growth as a result of price increases, additional investment, a focus on premiumisation and success in Latin America and Asia.Jack Daniels has been boosting market share through a super-premium offer recently redirected at younger drinkers, with a strong bias towards males.Technology• This is a rapidly evolving market driven by technological advancements available at a cheaper price. At the same time, the industry is experiencing a new wave, led by Apple, of sophisticated premium-priced products that command higher margins for design, functionality and trendiness.• The majority of brands have minimal product differentiation and are jostling for a position in the market.• Microsoft is still king in the software category.• The mobile handset category is still growing fast, especially in the Latin American and Asian markets as mobile phones become more affordable.• Apple’s iPhone is having a powerful impact.• After several years of moving at a healthy pace, the search engine industry seems to be sailing off in new directions.• There has been a recent surge of selling and buying of web businesses in which lofty sums are being paid.• The internet has become a principal medium for community, communication, and entertainment – three areas that have collided and are impacting each other’s growth.Brand highlights: Google, leading the Top 100 ranking again, continues to expand its business into different areas: it acquired Double- Click, a vibrant advertising business for banners, videos, and other so-called display ads, and launched an open operating system for mobile phones (free to use), called Android, promising “better, cheaper” mobile phones.BlackBerry and Apple had the biggest rises in brand value for the Top 100.Two other strong performers in the category were: IBM (up 64.8 per cent) which benefited from continued growth in emerging markets, improved cost competitiveness and utilisation levels, and ongoing productivity initiatives. And Siemens, up 61 per cent, had strong financial results throughout the year, powered by multiple acquisitions and strategic alliances. This year, however, has brought a shock €900m ($1,400bn) profit warning that it blamed on a contract cancellation, project delays and capacity issues.Nokia benefited from big year-on-year increases in sales in Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific. Two company acquisitions during 2007 and four in 2006 have improved process integration and quality, resulting in greater customer loyalty and profitability.According to Mr Walshe, Nokia’s relationship with its customers, already strong 10 years ago, has become even closer. The company’s 38.9 per cent rise in brand value reflects a resurgence after rivals stole a march on it in the clamshell phone market.But Mr Walshe says that “the relationship people have got with the Nokia brand is putting the company in a strong position, so if it ever got out of synch with the product cycle, as can sometimes happen with technology companies, it would be better placed to recover than others”.Bottled Water• While bottled water is thriving as a healthy alternative to carbonated soft drinks, a rise in the environmental consciousness of consumers has put the industry in the spotlight.• Commoditisation and a lack of brand and product differentiation have caused the ”brand contribution” to drop across the category.• Still water has continued to outsell sparkling, with flavoured variants from the big brands thriving.Brand highlights: Perrier has revived its exclusive image, and with its distinctive green bottle, is one of the most recognisable bottled water brands.Volvic, the top brand in the UK, is continuing its positioning as a water for the younger consumer with its “Volcanicity” campaign."
842;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:15:58+0000;Holding firm as downturn looms;;The past year was, like the years immediately preceding it, a good time to build a brand. Strong economic growth around the world and rising income in countries such as India and China provided fertile conditions for many companies to boost the value of their products.The world’s top 100 brands increased in value by 21 per cent to a total of $1,940bn. They were buoyed not only by strong growth in many countries and industries but by a willingness to invest heavily in the brands that distinguish their products.The boom in luxury goods and services over the past 10 years has given this trend an impetus. Brands such as Gucci and Louis Vuitton have expanded globally, taking advantage of demand not only in Japan but now in China, India and Russia.By the year-end, however, problems had appeared. Neither Bear Stearns or Northern Rock had been in the top 100 but both lost huge amounts of value amid the credit crunch. Weakening economic growth – and a possible recession – in the US also took a less dramatic toll on brands such as Starbucks and Wal-Mart.So, in 2008, many brands will face a tougher climate. Those in the Brandz Top 100 Most Powerful Brands ranking must hope that Nigel Hollis, chief global analyst for Millward Brown, the consultancy that compiles the rankings, is right that they are in a comparatively strong position.“Strong brands are far better positioned than others to ride out recessions. The ones that perform best are those that invest during downturns because, as the recessions ends, they come out stronger,” he says.The downturn will test that proposition, which is a tenet of advertising and marketing companies such as WPP Group, the parent of Millward Brown.Brands have long been a mainstay of consumer companies. “A vodka salesman may have a good reputation but his successor generally does just as well if the label on the bottle is Smirnoff,” says Thayne Forbes, joint managing director of Intangible Business, a UK consultancy.But the early 21st century has been notable for the new brands industries that have sprung up. The clearest examples are in communications, with brands such as Research in Motion’s BlackBerry – the fastest growing brand this year – coming to the fore.Six of the top 10 most valuable global brands (seven if you include General Electric) are in the technology or telecoms industries. Both Nokia and Apple, which now produces the iPhone, rose enough places in the rankings this year to enter the top 10.The number one place in the rankings was taken once again by Google, which retained its two-spot edge over its rival Microsoft. “Google has delivered something that speaks to people in the modern age, the ability to get information quickly and easily,” says Mr Hollis.Apple, the second fastest growing brand of the year, still thrives under the leadership of Steve Jobs, its co-founder. Mr Jobs has shown how a brand can be built with superior technology, smart design, strong advertising and strong customer service at its own-name stores.Yet the growth of mobile telephony, which has been such a strong influence on brand value, already shows signs of waning. Some markets have reached full penetration and the economic uncertainty is having a direct impact on phone sales.Brands in technology and telecoms could now face a period of competition with each other. That has already been the experience of consumer goods comp­anies – and restaurants such as Starbucks, which dropped 21 places this year as American consumers became jaded.Howard Schultz, Starbucks’ founder, has now taken over as chief executive to revive its fortunes. He could take note of the rise of McDonald’s, which went through a similar downturn but has been reviving and entered the top 10 at number eight.Retailers and makers of packaged goods continue to tussle for the consumer’s loyalty. Retailers such as Tesco in the UK and Whole Foods Market in the US not only control their shelf space zealously but also sell white label versions of branded goods.US retailers had a tough year, with Wal-Mart and Home Depot both falling in the rankings, but Tesco continued to rise. Coca-Cola retained its fourth position in the rankings, while the brands Tide and Ariel were counted in the rankings for the first time.Financial services companies – and particularly banks and investment banks – were already facing tough conditions in 2007. Merrill Lynch, which was badly affected by the sub-prime credit crisis, dropped 24 places, losing 16 per cent of its brand value.“It has been a very scary year from a brand perspective because we have seen a couple of names – Northern Rock and Bear Stearns – disappear. That is pretty rare and it shows how vulnerable banks are to their reputations being impaired,” says Mr Forbes.The outlook is less troubled for brands in Asia – and in particular what Millward Brown calls “modern” rather than “traditional” Asia – mainland China rather than Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong – from where brands have emerged in the past.This year, there are four mainland Chinese companies in the top 100 – China Mobile and three Chinese banks. They have joined seven traditional Asian brands, including Standard Chartered Bank and Toyota, but have already overtaken them in value.Wally Olins, chairman of Saffron brand consultants, argues that India and China are only tapping the surface of their ability to create global brands. He cites the development by the Indian company Tata of the Nano – the “one lakh” small car – as a sign of things to come.“India and China are going to emerge very powerfully and are moving to become global. We will see examples of big brands that come from places we did not consider at all seriously before.”Mr Hollis, however, has doubts about how fast this will occur, and how many Asian brands will succeed on the global stage. “It is incredibly hard for a brand that has been a success in one country to make an impact outside. It happens only rarely,” he says.Recognising this, Asian companies are showing interest in acquiring western brands to which they can apply their manufacturing expertise, such as Lenovo’s purchase of IBM’s personal computer business.The uncertain economic climate could make this easier for Asian companies, particularly if a sharp US downturn does not derail growth in China and India. But it could also inhibit them from expanding out of domestic markets and entering softer US and European economies.Indeed, 2008 is likely to be a challenging year for many brands that have become used to expanding rapidly. It could be a particular test for the newer brands that have established themselves in consumers’ minds in a relatively short period.These rising stars have not yet been through a downturn and had to cope with hard choices about how much to continue to invest in marketing and branding. The advice of branding experts is to stick the course but we shall see whether they have the nerve.
843;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-04-17T01:25:09Z;British consumers worry more about economy;;Concern over the environment has tailed off in the past year, while fears over the economy have rocketed up the consumer agenda.Polling data from Ipsos Mori show that environmental concerns reached a pinnacle in January 2007, when 19 per cent of people named the environment as one of the biggest issues facing Britain today, compared with just a few per cent several years earlier. But by January 2008, that figure had fallen to 8 per cent.Meanwhile, 23 per cent of people rated the economy a top concern in March, up from 20 per cent in January – double the number who did so for most of 2007.Jenny Dawkins, head of corporate responsibility research at Ipsos Mori, said environmental concerns peaked 15 months ago amid a welter of publicity around climate change. “It was not long after the Stern report and Al Gore’s film, and there was unprecedented media interest in the topic,” she said. Fears of an economic slowdown were instrumental in pushing the environment down the agenda.But Ms Dawkins warned the poll should not be interpreted as suggesting that people had lost interest in the climate. “For people to mention it as an issue unprompted is pretty strong – it’s a tough benchmark to make.” This means that even if people are no longer rating the environment as one of the most important issues facing the country, they may still harbour strong feelings about it.“Just because it’s getting a lower priority now does not mean people are not looking for companies to take responsibility for environmental issues. Our research shows they still have high expectations that companies should do more,” she said.Ms Dawkins added: “It would be dangerous for companies to think they can back down on their green initiatives now, because there is already a lot of scepticism among consumers about their green claims – so if they do [abandon their green initiatives], that will damage people’s confidence in them even further.”Andrew Perkins, a director at Ernst & Young, agreed, saying businesses such as retailer Marks and Spencer that trumpeted their green credentials would look foolish if they dropped them at the first sign of trouble.M&S said it was “absolutely committed” to its five-year plan to become carbon-neutral and cut waste. “[Being green] has been integral to the way we operate for a long time, before it became a hot issue,” it said.B&Q, the DIY chain, said it was also committed to its green targets: “It is a tough climate for businesses and consumers, but being sustainable needn’t cost the earth.” McDonald’s cited the positive response to its use of organic milk and Costa Coffee said it would carry on investing in environmentally sound practices because “it gives us credibility and strengthens the brand”.Unilever last year asked the Rainforest Alliance, which certifies companies’ water conservation, soil management practices and labour conditions, to audit its tea suppliers. The Rainforest Alliance also certifies coffee sold by McDonald’s, Starbucks and Kraft.But Ms Dawkins warned such companies could be vulnerable to a slowdown: “There has been an upturn in ethical purchasing, but it has been driven by the middle [classes] – and they are the people who will feel the economic pinch before the very high incomes, so ethical purchasing may tail off.”
844;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Coke gets lift from international business;;Coca-Cola, the world’s largest soft drinks company, shook off the effects of the US consumer slowdown during its first quarter, delivering results that beat Wall Street’s expectations on strong international demand and currency benefits.Coke’s earnings rose 19 per cent to $1.5bn, or 64 cents per share, while revenues increased 21 per cent to $7.4bn.Without currency gains, revenues would have increased by 12 per cent.Neville Isdell, who steps down as chief executive this summer, said the company was “off to a good start” for the year and expected to achieve its growth targets for 2008.However, Coke’s performance in North America, where it is striving to revitalise its sparkling-drinks business, were hit by the decline in visits to restaurants and fast-food outlets that has resulted from the economic downturn.Muhtar Kent, chief operating officer and Mr Isdell’s designated successor, said Coke was facing a “challenging” macro-economic environment in North America, with away-from-home consumption hit hardest during the quarter.“There’s a move from on-premises to more home consumption and we’re realigning our marketing programmes all the time on a flexible basis to ensure we can capture whatever opportunities are out there.”Sales on a unit case basis of both sparkling and non-sparkling drinks were flat for the quarter in North America, with foodservice and hospitality sales down 4 per cent, and retail sales up 2 per cent.However, its non-sparkling drink sales, which include last May’s $4.2bn acquisition of Glaceau and sales of Fuze juices, increased 10 per cent.Coke said it had launched Glaceau in Australia during the first quarter and was looking at further international expansion later in the year.In Europe, the company also launched a range of canned expresso coffees in the first stage of a global partnership with Illycaffè, the Italian coffee brand, which will expand eventually to North America, where its rival PepsiCo has seen strong growth in its Starbucks brand canned coffees.Mr Kent said the company had yet to see any evidence of the US slowdown having any impact on demand in Latin America.“We have not yet seen any impact not just in Mexico, but across Latin America, although certainly that could be a risk going forward.”Coke reported a 20 per cent increase in volume sales in China, and double- digit increases in India, Turkey, Russia and eastern Europe.Sales outside North America account for 75 per cent of Coke’s total revenues.
845;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-04-14T16:25:04Z;Enodis accepts £950m Manitowoc offer;;Enodis, the UK food equipment maker that supplies customers such as McDonald’s, Starbucks and Subway, has agreed to be bought by Manitowoc, the US engineering group, in a cash offer that values the shares at £948m ($1.9bn).The fully funded bid worth 260p a share is an 82.3 per cent premium to the 141½p price at the close of trading on April 8, the day before Enodis announced it had received an indicative offer from Manitowoc.It is also 43.6 per cent above the UK group’s average price of 179.6p for the 12 months to April 8. The highest price at which Enodis shares have traded over the past three years is 225p.Following the announcement of an indicative cash offer of 260p a share on Wednesday, shares rose, ending the week at 231p. Enodis shares rose 12½p, or 5.4 per cent, to 243½p after the announcement.The offer is subject to anti-trust clearance by US and European Union authorities. If these have not been satisfied by October 11, Manitowoc will pay Enodis a $50m termination fee.Peter Brooks, Enodis chairman, said the board was confident in the company’s future. “Nevertheless, it recognises that the cash offer from Manitowoc represents an opportunity for shareholders to receive cash value for their shares, especially in the context of prevailing uncertain global financial markets.”Manitowoc said the offer was worth $2.1bn, including the assumption of Enodis’ net debt of about $207m at the end of September.It has raised $2.4bn from JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and BNP Paribas to finance the offer, pay expenses, restructure other debts and to provide extra working capital for the enlarged group.The US group said it expected annual synergies, from cross-selling, lower supply costs and reduced administrative overheads, to be not less than $60m by 2010, excluding one-off costs. It expected the acquisition to be earnings-enhancing in 2009.The acquisition would let Manitowoc enter the hot food service and food retail equipment sectors, and to expand its ice, refrigeration and beverage businesses.Glen Tellock, Manitowoc president and chief executive, said: “We have long recognised the value that a combination of the food service businesses of Enodis and Manitowoc would create.”JPMorgan Cazenove is advising Manitowoc. Rothschild is advising Enodis, as is Credit Suisse, which is the UK group’s joint corporate broker with Investec.
846;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-04-10T03:50:37Z;Manitowoc opens bidding for Enodis;;Enodis has received an indicative cash offer of 260p a share from Manitowoc, its US rival, raising hopes of a bidding war for the catering equipment maker, which could be valued at up to £950m ($1.8bn).The move by Manitowoc comes less than two years after the US company had an offer of between 205p and 210p a share rejected by Enodis on the grounds that it undervalued the company.Enodis, which sells specialised equipment to the likes of Starbucks and McDonald’s, granted Manitowoc access to the data room on Wednesday.Enodis was forced to make an announcement by the Takeover Panel after its share price gained 5 per cent in the last hour of trading on Wednesday, to 151½p.The company said the announcement was made with the consent of Manitowoc, but added that “there is no certainty that a formal offer will be made for the company”.David McCulloch, Enodis chief executive, said in May that he was “open to approaches” if it enhanced shareholder value.The move could reignite interest from other potential bidders, including Middleby and Aga Food Service, which also approached Enodis in late 2006 with a cash-and-shares offer pitched at about 194p.In a recent trading update, Enodis said it was cutting head count and reducing overheads to shield itself from slowing demand. It will also restructure some of its business units in Europe and Asia. Interim profits are expected in May.Shares in Manitowoc fell $1.80 soon after the announcement, to $42.47, giving the cranes-to-cookers group a market value of $5.5bn (£2.8bn).NM Rothschild is acting as financial adviser to Enodis.
847;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;The secret of longevity;;"“England and America are two countries separated by a common language.” If George Bernard Shaw were alive today, he might add that they are also separated by, among other things, 3,000 miles or so of sea and a totally different approach to advertisements for erectile dysfunction.We might be separated by a common language but we are united in our fascination with the Eliot Spitzer saga; it got acres of news coverage in the British press, including the FT, as well as in the US. Who could resist the chance to read about the extra-curricular habits of a man who had set himself up as the scourge of Wall Street, and in so doing probably increased the sales of Starbucks in London several hundredfold by forcing analysts and investment bankers to go out for coffee if they wanted to speak to each other? In his blog, my FT colleague John Gapper produced a very early account of what was happening that proved to be gripping reading for two reasons. First, he swiftly received a post on the blog from a woman working as a highly paid escort in NYC (always interesting to see who reads the FT online), and second, that he included a link to scans of the court papers, which I read with great interest.I was intrigued by one thing in particular, which was mentioned in both the court papers and the blog posting from the call girl – the length of time that escorts are booked for. No wonder Gapper’s correspondent says that she spends most of her time with her clothes on – when was the last time anyone you know had sex for four hours, the length of a typical Emperors Club booking? Indeed, would you want to have sex for four hours? The very thought of it makes me feel exhausted. Does one get a break for a drink and a visit to the loo, I wonder?I considered the four-hour question on my way over the pond last week for a few days stateside, particularly as I read several magazines during the flight. Many British commentators followed Gapper’s lead and addressed the issue of sex for money, including Taki Theodoracopulos in The Spectator. Taki was delighted at Spitzer’s demise, not least because Spitzer was responsible for instigating the prosecution of Taki’s friend, Hank Greenberg, former chairman of AIG, a big US insurer. Greenberg, for the record, has denied all the charges brought against him and has not been convicted of wrongdoing. Even those of us who are not Greek millionaires and don’t hang out with insurance billionaires can admire Greenberg’s achievements (and they are many – he served in the second world war and the Korean War with distinction, and then took charge of an ailing AIG in the 1960s and led it back to health with resounding success).Taki’s views on Spitzer closely resemble his views on Hillary Clinton, but on reading yet another of his rather subjective swipes at her I realised I was just as guilty of trite comments with little foundation. Taki suggested last month that Clinton should not win the Democratic nomination because he did not find her attractive enough. Does that amount to trivialising the debate? No more so, perhaps, than my assertion earlier this year that I would vote for Clinton (if I could) because she is a woman. I realise, having had it pointed out to me that I am always the first to resist any form of positive discrimination, that even if I were privileged enough to have a say in the process, I ought to base my voting decision on the candidate’s record rather than her sex.Once in the US and ensconced in a hotel room, I immersed myself in wall-to-wall CNN to hear how the race for the Democratic nomination was going. It was then that I suddenly realised why people in the US book escorts for such long periods of time. Listening to yet another television advertisement for erectile dysfunction while brushing my teeth, I caught the disclaimer for the first time.We in Britain have lengthy disclaimers at the end of TV advertisements too, you know, although they are more along the lines of “you could lose your home if you do not keep up repayments” (judging by what is happening in the US, this is a line the Americans don’t include in theirs very often). But the disclaimer that I was suddenly drawn to was rather different. It suggested that if the drug being advertised was still working after four hours you should call the doctor. Four hours? Now I understand.mrsmoneypenny@ft.com"
848;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Enodis seeks to mitigate market weakness;;Enodis is taking steps to mitigate any weakness in the North American market, although it said on Thursday that most of its businesses continued to perform strongly in the half year to end March and it was not changing expectations for the full year.North America accounts for around three-quarters of sales made by the supplier of kitchen equipment, such as ovens, fryers and fridges, to restaurant chains and institutions. It counts McDonald’s, Starbucks, Subway and Tesco among its customers.In a trading update, Enodis said it was cutting head count and reducing overheads in across the group as a pre-emptive move. It will also restructure some of its business units in Europe and Asia. The moves are likely to cause an exceptional charge, with more detail expected when the group reports interim profits in May.Enodis shares, which have been buoyed lately by takeover speculation, slipped 3.3 per cent or 5p to 146½p in early trading.The group said first half sales were up 7 per cent on a like-for-like basis. This was after a 14 per cent increase in the first quarter, but Enodis had warned that the second quarter compared to a strong period the previous year when it had a large order for the roll-out to a national chain in North America.It said its quick serve restaurant, project and institutional business in north America was performing strongly, but it had seen “a degree of softness in some other segments” such as operators of small restaurant chains or owner operated single outlets.It said the food service business in Europe and Asia also continued to perform strongly. The retail businesses were also doing well.Dave McCulloch, the US based chief executive, said he was “excited by the upside opportunties” from new products which should benefit the second half.In 2006 the group received a tentative bid approach from Manitowoc, a US rival, at 220p a share which was dropped. Since then Manitowoc has been rumoured to be interested in bidding, and the speculation has increased in recent days, but Enodis said it would not comment.
849;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-03-24T19:08:41Z;Early brigade brings home the bacon;;"Almost no one has time for leisurely business lunches nowadays, says Yvonne Ike, an executive director at JPMorgan – which is why she is a “big fan” of the business breakfast. A quick lunch is often rushed and forced but a short breakfast feels relaxed and natural. “Breakfast hardly ever goes on for more than an hour and people usually get straight to the point,” she says.The business lunch – in its traditional, boozy, all-afternoon sense – has long been in decline. First went the alcoholic excess; then, with the advent of quick lunches, the third and even the second courses; now a sandwich in Starbucks can qualify as a business lunch. And, even in its stripped down form, many executives don’t like to take a big chunk out of their schedule. Small wonder that many are choosing to meet and eat before they get to the office.Sarah Gold, managing partner of CHI, an advertising agency, also prefers to do deals over coffee and croissants. “Lunches take up too much time – two hours minimum with travel – and while I like business dinners, they really do encroach on your personal life,” she says.Ms Gold, who has up to three breakfast meetings a week, says the advantages are not only to do with saving time: “It is also considerably cheaper. If you go for lunch, you’ll barely get change from £100, whereas with breakfast it will be more like £30. They also just feel more part of the modern working world.”The power breakfast, in combining elements of puritanism and the competitive work ethic, has always held a powerful appeal in the US. Well-known practitioners include New York’s Regency Hotel and the Bel-Air in Los Angeles.But fashionable restaurants elsewhere are not far behind. In London, the Wolseley, the Cinnamon Club, Raoul’s and Automat all cater to the early-morning business brigade. In Tokyo, the Imperial and the French Kitchen at the Grand Hyatt play host to the city’s dealmakers.Jeremy King, co-founder of the Wolseley restaurant in London’s Piccadilly, says: “Lunch often has a lot of obligatory socialising attached. You see groups of men talking about anything but work for two hours and then cramming all the business into the last 10 minutes. But breakfast focuses the mind. We’re even seeing people doing two or three breakfast meetings in a row.”Hotels are also reporting a breakfast boom. Claridge’s says queues for breakfast often stretch out of the restaurant door: “In the past few years, it seems to have really grown. A lot of it is [down to] non-residents and it’s very much a suited and booted clientèle.”Much of the growth in popularity of breakfast is down to longer working hours and shorter breaks. But Carole Stone, author of Networking: The Art of Making Friends, says there are other reasons. “It is usually much easier to get a table for breakfast and people who might say no to lunch for time reasons are happy to make breakfast. It is also much easier to have on your premises than lunch.”Ms Stone adds that although some may see business breakfasts as yet another workplace intrusion into home time, the reverse may be the case. If you get your meeting out of the way before the start of the day, by getting up 45 minutes earlier you can often leave work earlier. Doing business over breakfast makes a good impression and puts you at your desk at 9.30 with a sense of achievement under your belt.The working breakfast’s other great benefit is its relative informality. Even today’s pared-down lunches can be involve a series of etiquette hurdles. Does a glass of wine say you are not serious about business? Should you have a starter? A pudding? Bottled or tap water? And at what point can you politely leave? With breakfast these worries fall by the wayside. At the first meal of the day, it is perfectly acceptable for one person to have a “full English” with three coffees while another has a meagre bowl of fruit without the two diners feeling awkward.Ms Gold says a final reason breakfasts are better is to do with cultural change. In a fitness-conscious and more feminine workplace, “a lot of women prefer breakfasts. You feel as if you can be a lot more indulgent over them.”She adds, however, that her idea of indulgence may differ from those of many businesswomen: “I’m a northern lass, so one of the reasons I like them is because I love kippers.”"
850;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-03-19T21:23:04Z;Starbucks in drive to improve ‘experience’;;Howard Schultz, chief executive officer of Starbucks, on Wednesday announced a series of moves aimed at improving what he calls “the coffee experience” in its US stores, as part of his drive to revitalise the world’s largest coffee chain.The initiatives - ranging from new lower-height expresso machines to plans for the company’s first loyalty programme - are part of a strategic shakeup at Starbucks by Mr Schultz, who resumed the post of CEO in January amid investor concerns over slowing US growth.New initiatives in the US stores will include the introduction of a new blend of coffee named after the company’s first store at Pike Place, Seattle, and the rapid roll out of the new low-level Mastrena machines - which allowing greater eye-contact with customers.The new machines will be introduced into 30 percent of its more than 7,000 US stores by the end of the year, and into three-quarters of its stores by the end of 2010.The company also said it had acquired the Coffee Equipment Company, a small Seattle based company that makes innovative single-cup grinding and brewing machines for filter coffee, which will be introduced in selected stores.Starbucks also announced its first rewards programme for regular US customers who use its stored-value cards. From April, registered card holders will receive free customised extra ingredients such as flavourings and cream.It also launched its first online social-networking community called “MyStarbucksidea.com”. The site is aimed at offering customers a forum for proposing and voting on new ideas for the chain that will be incorporated into its stores.In an effort to strengthen its ethical credentials, Starbucks is also to expand an existing partnership with Conservation International, a non-profit group, to protect tropical forests by providing incentives to farmers not to clear forest for land.The moves are a response to growing competition from similar chains such as Caribou Coffee and Peet’s, while fast food outlets such as McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts have also started expanding their lower-cost expresso coffee offerings.In other areas, Mr Schultz said it will also will expand into drinks and foods that are focused on health and wellness and explore new energy drinks as it pushes to improve its financial performance.He also described opportunities for expanding the company’s sales of packaged coffee and drinks through supermarkets and other outlets as a potential billion dollar business for the company.The company has made a series of changes in top management, and cut back US store opening plans. It also closed all its US stores last month for three hours for a staff training session, as part of efforts to improve store service.
851;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Cash in on people’s need to look good;;"I was ugly from about sixth grade all the way through high school. The worst was in high school. I had braces, acne, glasses and dark curly hair. I didn’t play any sports – my only real hobby was playing chess and I read a lot of comic books.Basically, no girl was chasing me. I used to pretend my television was a computer that could tell me which girl in my classes was in love with me. The TV knew but it didn’t know how to output the answer to me, so I just waited.I asked out one girl in ninth grade and she walked away as quickly as she could without even responding. I remember another guy came up to her right then and asked her: “Do you need help?” That was the end of my attempts at dating in high school. I didn’t attend any prom and held my breath until college where things got much better, only to get better still in graduate school and then “the real world”.Everybody wants to look good. It doesn’t matter how smart you are. It doesn’t matter how funny – or how rich. Although all of these things compensate to an extent. Not to belittle this compensation. Sometimes you don’t want to go out with or marry the most beautiful person because they never compensated in these other ways. They might not be funny, for instance, or they might not be kind or sympathetic to others. Sometimes the teasing in the school playground is the best training ground for life. But maybe I’m just telling myself that.In any case, the plight of those who don’t look good has been hurt by the shrinking work week. In 1900, the average work week was 60 hours as many people worked 12 hours a day, five days a week in factories. Now the average work week is 35 hours.And believe me, people don’t work 35 hours a week. They instant message each other at least 10 hours, take lunch breaks for another 10 hours, and hang out in meetings for another 10 hours a week. The average person who works in an office probably works about five hours a week. That means they have more free time, more social time, more hours per week where they need to look good.There are lots of way to attack this trend from a stock market perspective; we can look at fitness clubs, obesity stocks, botox stocks, breast implant stocks. Or women’s legs. It’s important to note also that the size of the demographic of “women aged 45-55” increases every year by about 1m people. In other words, regardless of the economy, there’s another potential 1m customers for companies that cater to helping women in this demographic look good. So let’s look at some of these companies.Venus Medical Technologies. The company specialises in non-invasive, outpatient treatment of varicose veins, which plague women in their 40s and 50s. About 25m people in the US suffer from varicose veins and another 40m in western Europe. In 2006, 1.2m sought treatment for the condition. The reason so few seek treatment is that it often involves painful invasive surgery (removing the vein in question) with many potential side-effects.The Venus procedure is to give the patient an “RF Generator”, which provides the power and monitoring for a disposable catheter that heats the vein. The disposable catheters generate recurring revenues for the company. Out of the estimated 65m people with varicose vein conditions, only about 90,000 have used the company’s procedure for treatment. This company is potentially the Starbucks of women’s legs once it starts to expand its demographic reach. Revenues have gone up every year since it first started selling the product in 1999.Syneron Medical is another company in the sector.Syneron also uses radio frequency (RF) energy to deliver heat layers of the skin below the epidermis, avoiding burning associated with other skin treatments. With this device the company can constantly monitor the level of heat and energy that is being applied to an area and adjust accordingly. Its treatments have been used for wrinkles, leg veins, acne, cellulite and a host of other cosmetic solutions.Revenue has gone up every year since 2001. I also like that the company is sitting on $167m in cash, no debt, and only a market capitalisation of $444m – so almost half of its market cap is in cash."
852;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-03-16T18:28:32Z;Whitbread in talks with DIC on Travelodge;;"Whitbread is in preliminary discussions to merge its Premier Inn chain with Travelodge, Dubai International Capital’s rival budget hotels operator.DIC would take a stake in Whitbread as part of the deal if a mooted cash-and-shares acquisition of Travelodge could be completed successfully.The Dubai fund, which has attracted publicity for its attempts to acquire Liverpool Football Club, conducted a sale last year of its Tussauds Group to Blackstone in which it took a 20 per cent stake in an enlarged entertainment group form- ed by the private equity firm.DIC trumped Whitbread when it paid £675m to ac-quire Travelodge from Permira in August 2006.The hotel chain, which is the second biggest in the UK behind Premier Inn, is expected to publish its latest accounts today, giving a clearer indication of the likely valuation. If the parties can agree a price, the combined company would have a dominant position
in the budget hotels market, possibly sparking an inquiry from competition watchdogs.However, on a broader view of the hotels market the pair have only a small share.The talks are at an early stage and the details of who would manage the combined group have not been ex-plored but Grant Hearn, the chief executive of Trav-elodge, has experience in running Premier Inns under its previous guise.Alan Parker, chief executive of Whitbread, has outlined an ambitious expansion plan for the group, which also includes Costa Coffee.Last month he said that Premier Inn would open 4,000 rooms this year compared with 3,400 in 2007-08 and 2,500 a year earlier.Costa, meanwhile, is opening an average of one coffee shop every day as it takes on Starbucks.Travelodge, meanwhile, has promised to open up to 100 hotels in Spain by 2020 in a bid to capitalise on the strong demand expected there. Whitbread’s overseas expansion plans include India and Dubai.Whitbread has sought to raise funds in recent months, intending to issue a £600m bond backed by its substantial property assets. However, that plan has been put on hold because of the turmoil in credit markets.After selling David Lloyd for £925m last year, the group has conducted a large buy-back programme.However, its shares have fallen 29.9 per cent in the past year, significantly underperforming its peers in the FTSE 100.Ironically, Whitbread last year spent £22m on changing the name of its hotels brand from Premier Travel Inn to Premier Inn, in part to end confusion between its chain and Travelodge."
853;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-02-29T17:52:36Z;M&S hastens overseas expansion;;Marks and Spencer has set up a Greek joint venture and is in talks about a series of similar deals as the retailer looks to speed up its international expansion.The 50-50 venture with Marinopoulus, the Greek franchisee that also works with Starbucks and Carrefour, involves M&S paying its partner €50m (£38.2m) for half the new company’s share capital.M&S is already the second- biggest clothing retailer in Greece behind Spain’s Inditex and has 38 stores in Greece, the Balkans and Switzerland.Carl Leaver, head of M&S’s international division, said: “I think there is an opportunity for us to go faster and to execute better by working closer [with Marinopoulus].“They bring an awful lot to this relationship.”Marinopoulus’s regional influence is particularly important when deciding terms with landlords.The new venture aims to open up to 50 stores in the region in the next few years.M&S’s Greek business does not have a food operation, although Mr Leaver said that was an option for the future.M&S is also expected to overhaul its presence in India where its stores have not taken off as hoped and is also planning a foray into China for the first time.The company plans to increase its international business to 15-20 per cent of group revenues within the next five years.The different international initiatives mark a return to a more expansionist strategy that was ended under previous management as it concentrated on restoring the floundering UK business.Sir Stuart Rose, chief executive, has said that the decision to withdraw from continental Europe, in particular, was a mistake.Tony Shiret, analyst at Credit Suisse, said in a report on Friday that M&S might look to strengthen its UK presence by trying to acquire Next, its clothing rival.
854;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-02-18T18:09:28Z;US retailers hope for tax boost;;For beleaguered US retailers struggling with slowing consumer demand, relief could be on the way in the form of an estimated $42.9bn spending boost from federal tax rebates, aimed at steering the US away from recession.According to a survey of more than 7,000 people for the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend about 40 per cent of the extra $105.7bn due in rebates that will start arriving in May. A further $30bn will be used to pay down debt, $19.8bn will be saved and the remainder either invested or used to pay for medical bills.However, for retailers and consumer goods companies, much will depend on whether consumers choose to spend the extra money on food and low-margin basics, or on discretionary purchases, such as home goods, electronics and toys.Deborah Weinswig, retail analyst at Citigroup, has said she expects the rebates to deliver a “one-time jolt” to consumer spending. But she told clients that “we expect most consumers who decide to spend their cheques to purchase lower- margin food and consumables” rather than discretionary items.In an indication of the state of lower-income consumers, Wal-Mart said that, in January, its customers were using Christmas gift cards to pay for food and other basics, rather than buy discretionary goods.Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, and other discounters are expected to offer free cheque cashing facilities for rebate cheques, and they are likely to be prime beneficiaries of the extra spending. Citigroup says that, in 2001, about 25 per cent of a similar round of rebate cheques were spent at Wal-Mart.But if the large discounters – Wal-Mart, Kmart and Target – seem well-positioned to win business from hard-pressed consumers, others who depend on discretionary spending, or spending linked to the housing market – such as Home Depot or Macy’s department stores – seem less likely to benefit.The split in fortunes between basic and discretionary spending extends across the consumer sector.In the food industry, restaurants are showing signs of strain: same-store sales growth at McDonald’s has been slowing, while Howard Schultz, chief executive of Starbucks, has declared that the US consumer is already in a recession, as his company reported a second quarter of falling traffic.However, food companies such as Kellogg, Kraft and Pepsico are more troubled by higher commodity prices than slowing demand, and see themselves as able to profit if consumers opt to eat at home, rather than restaurants.Also, suppliers of household staples, such as Procter & Gamble, Kimberly-Clark and Clorox, argue that they have seen no significant slowing in demand, or evidence of consumers shifting to cheaper alternatives.Ian Cook, chief executive of Colgate Palmolive, told investors that “so far we are seeing no indication of the slowdown,” in the US.But beyond personal care, companies that sell even some of the most basic household products have been feeling the pressure. Newell Rubbermaid, whose products range from storage bins to baby chairs, cut its 2008 sales growth forecast on January 31 to 2-3 per cent, down from its previous forecast of 3-5 per cent.Martin Franklin, chief executive of Jarden, argues that his company’s lower-cost consumer products such as coffee pots and fire extinguishers will benefit from the rebates. “I don’t think the stimulus package is going to make you go out and buy that $2,000 flat-screen TV.“But when it comes to going out and buying some of the smaller ticket items that you have in your life that you don’t want to cut back on, then I think the stimulus package will have a positive effect.”Predictably, US retailers welcomed the federal tax rebates, which they had lobbied strongly for. Tracy Mullin, chief executive of the NRF, described the package as “a crucial component to economic recovery”.But as retailers set out their first-quarter earnings view over the coming two weeks, investors still expect the overall mood to remain sober, with retailers taking a conservative approach to inventory planning, with resulting knock-on effects for their suppliers.
855;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-02-16T01:03:03Z;Small shops suffer as ‘the big people’ move in;;Nestled between Wandsworth and Clapham Commons, discerning consumers have for decades flocked to south-west London’s Northcote Road in search of high-quality local fare.The occasional Starbucks or Oddbins punctuates an otherwise continuous stretch of traditional butchers, bakers and roadside stalls offering artisan breads and fresh fruit and veg.Yet locals fear for the future of the historic thoroughfare, already surrounded by supermarket giants that have sprung up with growing rapidity over the years.For many, practicality outweighs sentimentality. Teacher Jenny Railton remembers with a certain fondness the local vegetable market she once frequented, before it vanished a decade ago. But she adds: “Now we get our vegetables mostly from supermarkets. I’d rather not go to Tesco but we do end up there.”“It’s more convenient. You can park just outside,” says her retired solicitor husband, Tim. The couple’s visit to Hennesy’s on Friday, which promises the finest Chichester-reared pork, is not as regular as they would like.Gary, the 51-year-old owner of the butcher’s that bears his name and spans four generations, says: “We had one of the original Tesco’s down here in the early sixties. The big problem is that they’re a one-stop shop. I like competition but it has to be a fair playing field.”A steady stream of customers emerges from the Somerfield further up the street, its sole supermarket whose garish billboards lure with half-price promotions.“It’s just cleaning up stuff,” Jackie Shearing, who owns the independent All Good Gifts store, hastens to point out when asked about the contents of her bags. “I don’t buy my main shopping here.”“The rents have gone up,” she adds. “It’s horrendous. It seems like every week one of the smaller shops is closing. The big people are moving in.”Beverley Hayward, a 50-year-old teacher, says: “I just like the fact that you’re getting a more personal service.” She, notes, however, the cost of the tempting array of fine desserts on the stall in front of her.Nearby, Harriet Mellor, a 45-year-old housewife, says: “They’re more expensive but it’s quite important to support them.”Rebekah Robinson, 42, says she does not mind the existence of so many supermarkets so long as they are not all located in the high street. “It depends where they site them.”
856;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-02-16T00:18:53Z;Virtual virtues;;Nurses leave Nigeria and come to the UK, hoping for a better career. Farmers leave Mexico to work in construction or catering in the US. Such migrants can have a profound impact on the economy, as well as the society and politics both of the country they leave and the country to which they move. Social scientists, naturally, take an interest.But one economist, Edward Castronova of Indiana University, studies an unusual kind of migration. Unhappy with your job as a Starbucks barista? Why not become a starship captain instead? Impossible if you stay in the country of your birth, but simplicity itself if, instead, you emigrate to an online fantasy world.In such worlds, players usually pay a monthly fee for the right to explore richly detailed three-dimensional landscapes inhabited by dragons or aliens or, in some cases, punks and strippers. They are also populated by other players – guess who plays the strippers. If a player spends enough time there, perhaps he has migrated.You might protest that is not migration at all, and you’d be right in all sorts of ways. But Castronova thinks it is relevant nonetheless, and he may be right too.Half-joking but curious, his studies began with a survey he conducted in 2001 among regular players of an online game, Everquest. He asked about how much they played, as well as their real and fantasy careers. A third spent more time in the Everquest world than they did working for pay (and the average respondent worked a 40-hour week). One fifth regarded themselves as residents of the Everquest world, and a similar proportion said they would spend all their time in Everquest, if only that were possible.By itself, that means little. But it should set us thinking. There is no doubt that these games have a modest but real and growing economic significance. People spend time and effort inside the game, creating or obtaining items that other players value. Virtual currency can be traded for dollars, and performing mundane tasks inside a computer game can even provide an income that is attractive to Chinese and eastern European students. Paying real dollars for an in-game item sounds silly, but no more than paying for a new mobile phone ringtone, which is also a digital product of purely aesthetic value. Time is spent, fun is had, money is spent, economic value is added.As many more people log on and spend time having fun in a synthetic economy, will that really change the mundane world, as Castronova argues in a new book, Exodus to the Virtual World? Is the phenomenon any different from, say, poker – which is also a game in which time is spent, fun is had, and money changes hands?If there turns out to be a difference it will be because synthetic worlds offer us an alternative vision of how society might work. These are places in which alter-egos live and die, fall in love, and develop careers and alliances. Their politics are very different from those to which we are accustomed.Most synthetic worlds, for instance, celebrate their huge inequalities. Some characters are helpless and penniless, others are near gods, and every facet of the game’s interface will scream the distinction at you. But nobody minds, because the game is seen as fair. Everyone starts from the bottom and works their way up without state intervention, a libertarian’s dream. Yet other facets of the game are centrally controlled with great care: tremendous effort goes into offering equal opportunity to all players.Castronova believes that compelling, increasingly popular and radically new experiences in synthetic worlds will start to change the nature of politics “back home”. That remains to be seen. But I find the idea faintly encouraging: a little healthy competition never did anyone any harm.Tim Harford is author of ‘The Logic of Life’ (Little, Brown).

857;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-02-16T00:17:47Z;‘A great space lifts your spirits’;;"Amanda Levete, 52, trained at the Architectural Association, London. After working for Richard Rogers she joined Jan Kaplicky as a partner at Future Systems in 1989. Their seminal and award-winning buildings include the Media Centre at Lord’s Cricket Ground, London – winner of the Stirling Prize in 1999 – and the Selfridges department store in Birmingham, UK. Her solo show of furniture, designed for Established & Sons, runs at its London gallery until March 27. She lives with her husband and children in London.What attracted you to your current home and how long have you lived there?I moved into my husband’s house 18 months ago. We have four children between us so we needed lots of bedrooms. It’s a regular, terraced house in Holloway, north London. I’ve done very little to it other than install a red carpet and some of my furniture because my focus is on our next project: creating our dream family home. I’m not a north London girl so I feel a bit stateless; but I’ve learned to enjoy living in an area that is deeply unfashionable. Holloway is gritty and anonymous, with not a Starbucks in sight. I like that. And I enjoy the width of the Holloway Road, whose scale is like an American boulevard. I would probably find it hard to move back to west London now. I’ve also learned, in quite a profound way, that home is where the heart is.Have you always lived in London?For most of my life. My previous home was in Notting Hill Gate. Originally it was a small factory, then a rather sleazy office. It was an extraordinarily deep space with top light and almost no aspect so no one imagined you could live there. I bought it very cheaply, gutted it, put in a shocking pink carpet and created two huge light-filled floors with only three doors – the front door, lavatory door and the door to my son’s room. It was an essay in open-plan living that worked particularly well when I was there alone. It is now used as an art space. Before that, I lived in a former mews house in Bayswater, west London.I dug out 2.5 metres of basement with my own hands to create a mezzanine level and remember having dinner parties surrounded by piles of earth. It was quite a surreal experience both the digging and entertaining. The whole process gave me a huge respect for the people who actually build and make.Future Systems has designed some award-winning buildings. Is living in an inspirational building important to you?To live in a great space inspires you and lifts your spirits. The environment in which you live and work has a tremendous capacity to change your mood and affect the way you live your life. Our next home will be arranged in three zones: a family zone located between a teenage zone and a private zone for me, my husband and whoever else we invite. Space, volume and natural light are vital for good living. As an architect and designer, it is also important that my home speaks of my work and preoccupations.Some of your projects look ahead of their time. Is it your intention to create a new architectural language for our times?Our work at Future Systems has often been called futuristic largely because there is an absence of straight lines in much of it. The Media Centre at Lord’s Cricket Ground and Selfridges exemplify this. Over the years we have developed a language but it is one that is continually evolving. Much of our aesthetic is derived from an organic and fluid language that you find in nature. It involves complex, three-dimensional geometries but there is always a rigorous logic behind them.It is very important that what we do pushes boundaries and people’s perception of space. In that sense, yes, I suppose we are conscious of creating an architectural language that is of our time.You’ve also designed some seminal residential properties. Do you apply the same rules when designing a client’s house as you would do to your ownOf course the same rules apply. I want to make sure their space is beautiful, functional and exhilarating to live in. But every client is different. Their needs, personality, the site – it all affects the approach. But they are paying me to think as well as design so there is a sensibility that links them all.What about furnishings? Do you live with your own designs?It gives me great pleasure to be surrounded by pieces I’ve designed. One of the reasons we have to move is to house my growing furniture collection, which is mostly in storage. Also there is no better critique than seeing how people use your furniture. For me, designing furniture is a chance to experiment, to develop a language and to push a geometry to its aesthetic and technical limits. The more I do, the more it influences our architecture.How do your new pieces relate to your architectural projects?The corners of a room are often lost spaces, rarely exploited for the display of either art or furniture. I wanted to address this with pieces specifically designed to take up these vacant areas where the space in between is as important as the object itself. It was important to me that the pieces had a spatial quality. I also wanted to show how the perception of form changes according to the material employed – in this case marble, wood, glass fibre or Corian. The idea of a show about corners is a little ironic because in much of my architectural work there are no corners.Where do you find the inspiration for your designs?It could be something from nature, a colour, a material or something more technical. The twisted geometry of the pieces in the show was initially derived from a three-dimensional mathematical formula that was then manipulated digitally and by hand to create functional and elegant furniture.What do you love about London?I run quite a lot so green space is very important to me. Kensington Gardens is my favourite park. I made a film about it when I was a student and know every part of it. I love the river and the views at night but hate almost all the modern buildings along it. I love London’s multi-cultural aspects and the abundance of good food from around the world. It has always been a very creative city and I can’t think of a better place to live. And I like the weather, the seasons, even the rain.In which other countries have you lived or would like to live?I lived in New York for six months when I was a student. I was a waitress in a hamburger joint where a then unknown Julian Schnabel was the chef. I could live there again. Years ago I went on a lecture tour to Sydney and Melbourne. I loved Australia’s huge landscape and sense of space. I think I could live there for a time if there was a reason to go.Do you leave town at weekends?Weekends are usually at home or, occasionally, at friends’ houses in the country or sometimes on an away-break with my husband. I travel quite a lot for work so being at home is always a treat.Is the idea of cocooning at home important to you?Very important. It’s about creating a place to be with my family, a place to entertain friends and a refuge to come back to when everything around me is going wrong.Are there any facilities you can’t live without?I lived without a washing machine, dishwasher or mobile phone until I was 40. I can’t imagine why or how but there’s no way back now."
858;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Full steam ahead? Although fear of recession stalks America, business is undeterred;;"From where Paul Double stands, on the placid banks of the Mississippi, the gloomy predictions of an impending US recession emanating from New York and Washington are no more than a faint hum from places far away.Mr Double, whose Canamar International makes huge plastic sheets to cover coal and grain from a plant nestled on the Minnesotan stretch of the big river, sees no signs of a slowdown.“Our business is in excellent health,” he says, adding that booming demand for commodities is prompting clients including Conagra and Cargill, the agricultural products groups, to place record orders. “By November we were already ahead of the past 12 months; by the end of our fiscal year in March we will have had our best year since 2005.”Mr Double’s jubilation points to a stark difference in opinion between two important constituencies in the US financial and economic landscape: when it comes to the health of the world’s largest economy, it appears that economists are from Mars and businesspeople are from Venus.In recent months, as a litany of poor data, tales of woe from the financial sector and reports of belt-tightening consumers prompted expert after expert to predict the first US recession in almost a decade, businesses have begged to differ. From entrepreneurs such as Mr Double to huge multinationals including General Electric and Kraft, corporate America has been decidedly more upbeat than the Federal Reserve and private sector economists. As one senior executive puts it, the US economy at the moment is like a stormy sea: tempestuous for those looking at it from the top but a lot calmer for those inhabiting its deeper reaches.To be sure, most corporate executives express concern at the prospect of a darkening economic picture – and companies directly affected by the subprime meltdown and the decline in consumer confidence, notably banks and housebuilders, are already ensnared in their own mini-recessions. But the attitude of most of the rest of US business is well summarised by David Cote, chief executive of the conglomerate Honeywell. Asked by an analyst last month about the recession, he replied: “We don’t really see it yet.”That sentiment is mirrored by business leaders across the Atlantic, alert to whether the US malaise is spreading to their home shores. Ian McCafferty of the CBI, the UK’s largest business organisation, says that as he travels around the country, its members’ views become more optimistic the further they are from the City of London. “I have been asking members whether they are facing significant constraints from tougher credit conditions. The answer across the board is: ‘not much’,” he says.From Germany’s industrial heartland, meanwhile, Jürgen Hambrecht, chief executive of BASF, this week accused the financial industry of “panicking” – and predicted that the US would not suffer a recession this year.Such protestations of optimism by American and European captains of industry raise the issue of whether companies’ desire to capitalise on the last leg of the business cycle will leave them blindsided if a slowdown does arrive. As US economic health deteriorates, the question for chief executives and investors is: can corporate leaders ensure their companies do not lose revenues and customers by retrenching too soon, while at the same time preparing contingency plans for the possibly leaner years ahead?To many experts, the confident statements coming from American boardrooms ring increasingly hollow. The prospects of a US recession have grown significantly over the past fortnight, as key indicators on employment and business sentiment disappointed economists and Wall Street investors. On February 1, the Labor Department released figures showing that the US had lost 17,000 jobs in January– the first decline since March 2003.The second bombshell came on February 5, as many Americans headed to the polls for the presidential primary elections, in the form of the Institute for Supply Management’s monthly report on the health of the services industry. That gauge of the largest sector in the US emerged below 50, which separates an expansion from a contraction, also for the first time since March 2003.The news confounded hopes that, despite a marked deceleration in growth in gross domestic product to an annual rate of just 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter, sectors not directly tied to the mortgage crisis would be able to escape the worst. Since the double whammy of bad data, forecasters have been lining up to declare the onset of a US recession.In a note headlined “Free Fallin’”, Goldman Sachs economists last week gave voice to the concerns of the bears, which include their colleagues at Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and a dozen other financial groups. Even less pessimistic pundits such as Bruce Kasman, chief economist at JPMorgan Chase, admit that the economy is close to breaking point. “Recessions are all about shifts in business behaviour. This is the key call,” he says.But many of the executives in charge of making that call do not appear ready to switch into recession mode just yet. In their view, battening down the hatches at a time when their markets are still growing would be, quite simply, bad business.They point for example to Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest household goods group and one of the savviest predictors of consumer behaviour, which detects little or no impact on its domestic operations. Clayt Daley, P&G’s chief financial officer, told Wall Street analysts this month it had gained market share in three-quarters of its US business because consumers had not switched to private label versions of its products such as Tide detergent and Pampers nappies.Other corporate leaders argue that their businesses are, to varying degrees, recession-proof. Food companies such as Kraft and PepsiCo maintain they would benefit from a downturn as people eat at home more frequently or plump for affordable “treats” including sodas and snacks to beat the recession blues. Logistics groups such as UPS, whose brown vans help keep the economy ticking over, still predict that their domestic business will grow this year as people and businesses keep sending letters and packages. As a senior executive at one of UPS’s rivals says: “We are a need, not a want.”Small businesses, which have fewer financial and operational resources to withstand economic convulsions, are also unwilling to throw in the towel. When SurePayroll, a group that prepares payrolls for some 18,000 small US companies, analysed January staff data, it was surprised to find that small businesses were still hiring and increasing employees’ salaries.“Recession, schmecession. That’s what most small business owners appear to be saying about the economic storm clouds,” says Michael Alter, SurePayroll’s president. “Our data indicate that the news of the demise of the economy has been greatly exaggerated.”Students of past downturns argue that the gap between economists’ pessimism and business confidence is due to a combination of timing and psychology. First, different companies perceive recessions differently, because economic downturns and individual industries’ business cycles are not synchronised. In addition, experience suggests that as the threat of a downturn increases, corporate leaders tend to understate it, in an attempt to maintain morale among staff, customers and investors. When Bain, the management consultancy, looked at the behaviour of 377 of the largest US companies in 1981-2001, it found the same overconfident demeanour displayed by many chief executives today.“As evidence gathers that a downturn is likely, executives often continue to radiate confidence – and even clairvoyance – about the future. They don’t want to frighten the troops, which will only make matters worse,” say the Bain authors in the Harvard Business Review. “Our research shows that most executives are likely to be overly optimistic in the face of an approaching downturn. Some will contend that their industries are safe, period. Others believe that their own company’s ability to weather a downturn is superior to that of competitors.”Yet executives’ fighting talk cannot be dismissed as a clever psychological ruse, hubris or even plain old wishful thinking. In today’s globalised economy, a number say their company really can cushion the impact of a domestic downturn, by relying on overseas operations. Jeffrey Immelt, chairman of General Electric, has made it clear that his promise of 10 per cent-plus growth in the conglomerate’s earnings in 2008 is driven by the fact that over half of its revenues come from outside the US.With a lower dollar boosting exports and demand for infrastructure such as energy and aerospace equipment soaring in emerging markets, Mr Immelt remains confident that a US slowdown will not derail GE. “A lot of the senior leadership team, including myself, travelled around the world and the emerging markets,” he told investors recently. “Every place we went there’s a need for power, there is a need for planes, there is lots of capital being invested in infrastructure and there are just no signs that this global infrastructure boom is slowing at all.”It is no coincidence that some of the more optimistic statements have come from industrial companies that have placed bets on fast-growing overseas markets. Yet even airlines – a frequent victim of slowdowns, especially when, like now, they are accompanied by high oil prices – are relatively upbeat because of solid demand for international travel. “Looking ahead to the first quarter, demand in all our regions remains strong,” Jeff Smisek, Continental’s president, said last month.Critics charge that the positive talk coming out of America’s boardrooms is in danger of obscuring the worsening reality, thus preventing companies from planning for a downturn. Indeed, evidence from the last recession six years ago suggests that far too many executives insist on seeing the world through rose-tinted glasses.“Decision-making is very tough in downturns. Psychologists say there are at least three ways executives botch decision in times of economic stress,” says Bain’s Darrell Rigby, who has studied downturns since 1987. “Their perceptions become distorted, they obsess on insignificant details and they try and prove that their mistaken hypotheses were right all along.”Mr Rigby estimates that fewer than one in five US companies enters a downturn with adequate survival plans, even though implementing timely contingency arrangements has been proved to be a key competitive advantage during economic contractions. In 2000-01, for example, the electronics group Emerson fared better than most because its sophisticated planning system, which required every unit to file a quarterly forecast each month, enabled management to predict the downturn.But most companies prefer merely to slash capital expenditure, fire employees and squeeze suppliers. Some of those classic recession tactics have already been on display this time around. Investment banks have shed thousands of people, while Detroit’s struggling carmakers are reportedly putting pressure on suppliers in an attempt to rein in costs.Management experts say such moves are rarely useful and often counter-productive, as they deprive companies of the resources needed to take advantage of the next upturn. “The specific question executives need to answer is, what is the benefit of hunkering down versus the opportunity costs of not continuing to invest?” says Patrick Viguerie, head of McKinsey’s corporate practice in the Americas.Indeed, recessions, which in the US last less than a year on average, have proved to be good times for nimble companies to steal a march on their competitors. Starbucks, for one, harnessed the 2000-01 slowdown to consolidate its position as the world’s largest coffee shop group. Building on prudent financial management in the years preceding the downturn, the Seattle chain expanded internationally and increased the proportion of licensed, rather than owned, outlets – a strategy that boosted its profit growth.Others were less proactive – and were punished for their inaction. McKinsey estimates that 40 per cent of US industrial companies and one in three US banks lost their position as their sector’s best performer during the last recession. “When economic uncertainty increases, you have this temporary freeze,” says Nick Bloom, economics professor at Stanford University. “Companies don’t hire, don’t spend, they just wait. The irony is: if every company in the economy waits, that in itself exacerbates the recession.”In the current uncertain times, this fear is starting to dent the aura of confidence displayed by corporate leaders. As John Chambers, Cisco chief executive and one of the information technology industry’s longest-serving and most thoughtful leaders, said recently: “When I talk to many CEOs, most of them would say, ‘I feel pretty good about my business but I don’t like what I’m hearing and seeing’.”Additional reporting by Justin Baer, Jonathan Birchall, Hal Weitzman and Chris Giles………………………………….Changing habits put defensive plays in doubtIn 1991 and 2001, the last two US recessions, those without jobs spent their days waiting for the phone to ring, the old-fashioned kind that was plugged into a wall, writes Aline van Duyn.During the wait, and in evenings spent at home – going out had become too expensive – people watched television, their most important source of entertainment.Chances are that people who lose their jobs in the current economic downturn will behave slightly differently. For a start, most people with traditional telephone connections now have mobile phones. There are also more alternatives to television, such as playing video games or watching films via high-speed internet connections.This may have implications for investors. “The lowest earnings risk rankings are mostly in traditional defensive areas, specifically consumer staples, pharmaceuticals and telecoms,” analysts at Morgan Stanley said recently. But what if changing habits also alter the performance of traditional “recession-proof” sectors such as telecommunications?“Historically, the telcos and cable operators were both ideal defensives,” says Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein. “After all, nobody in their right mind would disconnect their phone line, or their cable service, in a recession. What if someone miraculously called with a job offer? And what else is there to do but watch TV while you waited for the call?”Mr Moffett, however, believes that changes in the types of business done by telecoms companies could turn this on its head. “What if everything we think we know about this sector behaves in a recession is wrong?” he asks.For example, people may be more inclined to disconnect landlines and hang on to their mobile phones. Growth in mobiles could well slow – in the US, 80 per cent of the population has one already. The race between cable companies and telecoms groups to offer customers bundled phone, internet and television services could make it more likely that people will switch regularly to lock in the latest cheap offers.Exposure to emerging markets could have a bearing on what stocks prove to be defensive. Many equity investors have based their strategies around an expectation that growth in countries such as China, India and Brazil would remain solid even if the US slows down.Others are unconvinced. “This decoupling theory is starting to be very severely tested,” says Tobias Levkovich, an analyst at Citigroup. “This makes it hard to hide out, because some sectors [such as energy and materials] which can perform well in a downturn may not do so if commodity prices fall on the back of lower global demand. It is very uncomfortable.”In the 2001 downturn, the bursting of the technology bubble was particularly painful for internet start-ups that had developed plans around expectations of a huge boom in online business. This time around, online companies are widely expected to benefit, with traditional media bearing the brunt of any downturns in advertising. The large audiences for web-based content, and the increased ability to target customers through detailed information about their web-surfing habits, are widely expected to accelerate the shift from traditional to online media.One sector that should live up to its traditional defensive role, however, is healthcare. Extending healthcare services to the millions of Americans who currently have no insurance or coverage is expected to be an important issue in this year’s US election. Regardless of the direction of US economic growth, there is little chance that spending on healthcare will diminish, certainly not in this economic cycle."

Mr Schultz attributed the drop to slowing consumer spending.Mr Schultz, who this month resumed the role of chief executive of the coffee retailer he founded and ran until 2000, said Starbucks had already decided to stop selling heated breakfast sandwiches, chiefly because they interfered with the aroma of coffee.“We recognise that there could be a short-term revenue impact in this decision, but it is the right decision for the business,” he said.He said the move was “just one example” of changes under way “that will substantially change the retail experience in the US”.Since returning to the position of CEO, Mr Schultz has made a number of management changes, including bringing back former Starbucks executive Harry Roberts in the new role of chief creative officer.Mr Schultz said the company would outline five major new initiatives for its US stores at its shareholder meeting on March 19, and set out new three-year financial targets on April 30.During the first quarter, Starbucks reported a 1.5 per cent increase in earnings to $208.1m on a 17 per cent increase in revenues to $2.8bn.

861;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-01-26T00:31:23Z;Meat isn’t just for New Year;;When Leng Jingyi was a small girl, she had to wait for the annual Chinese Spring Festival to indulge in her favourite dishes.It was the one time of the year when the Shanghai-native got to eat dumplings filled with pork and crab, “eight-treasure” duck or river shrimps in vinegar.But the huge shift in the country’s eating habits over the past two decades has turned the special into the routine. “We can now eat meat, fish or shrimp every day, if we want to,” explains the 25-year-old translator. “We do not need to wait for New Year any more.”Even in the late 1980s, many Chinese still relied on rationing cards for some essential foods and would store up special items for Chinese New Year. Now many are able to fill their newly bought fridges with ever-larger portions of protein that were either too expensive or too scarce in the past.As incomes have risen, imported foods and habits have also started to influence Chinese life. Residents of big cities can buy foreign goods at Carrefour and Wal-Mart, and Shanghai is about to get its first Marks & Spencer.Leng likes to meet up with her friends for coffee at Starbucks, drinks Coca-Cola with her meals and treats herself to cakes and pastries every now and again – something that before was reserved only for birthdays. Many Chinese of her generation are now taking baking lessons, she says, so that they can make their children cookies, brownies and muffins. She does not have an oven at home, but says proudly: “My fiancee and I plan to buy an apartment equipped with an oven.” Dairy goods – especially milk and yogurt – are also quickly becoming popular, although from a low base.With basic needs satisfied, Leng and her family now look overseas to spice up the Spring Festival feast. This year she helped out by making an Italian pasta dish. “It is actually very simple to prepare,” she says, “and it allowed my parents to experience something exotic and unusual.”

On the rather turbulent ride at 10,000ft I begin to realise the scale of California. There is a great deal more to it than just San Francisco and Los Angeles – we fly over Silicon Valley, housing the likes of Google and Apple, and a vast agricultural inland that seems to go on for ever in addition to numerous oil fields and sport utility vehicles galore. The pilot informs me that California, alone, would be the sixth largest economy in the world.Rather than contacting estate agents in advance I decide to survey the scene in Santa Barbara myself. The town had previously conjured, in my mind, vague recollections of the mid-1980s television soap opera. I find, in reality, it is home to 100,000 inhabitants and located 90 miles north of LA. It is famous for its beaches, volleyball, canyons and wealth. “Who lives in Santa Barbara?” I ask at The Coffee Bean café. “The newly wed and nearly dead,” is the answer.Montecito has what are known in the US as “estate homes”. These houses were largely built in the first half of the 20th century and each of them sits in at least an acre of land, behind wrought iron electronic gates. On the main drag, every other shop seems to be an estate agency; as the average price for each property in Montecito was $2,900,000 in 2007, I can understand why.Over the following two days I do a comprehensive search of all the properties available in the range $5m-$50m. My favoured estate agent is Patreece, a former child star who has lived in the area for 25 years; rather than platitudes she is direct with her responses. I ask if there are many celebrities living in Montecito. “Most of them can’t afford it,” she replies matter-of-factly, “though Oprah bought a few years ago. She can afford it. We are looking at our sixth faux Tuscan villa on another perfect southern Californian day.My phone goes and interrupts my reverie as I picture myself, rather than the Sheik, living this perfectly manicured life. The unflappable Shane is shaken. Mr Hedgefund is not playing ball and refuses to up his offer on the detached Holland Park house found for him. My Aussie wonder boy can’t understand how his persuasive charm is not working and fears the deal will be lost. There is a £1m margin that separates the figure Mr Hedgefund is prepared to pay and what the vendor will take. Shane protests that it’s a small percentage of the total purchase price but I point out this is still a significant amount of money.As Patreece and I head off for a vanilla latte ice blended frapruccino in the centre of town I realise with a sinking inevitability that the immaculate lawns, the faux Italian villas and French chateaux, the “English-style” teashops and the general “tastefulness” of the whole place are not for the Sheik. I reluctantly alert his adviser accordingly. It’s too perfect and too pristine; walking down Main Street, I feel like I’ve walked on to the set of a Gap commercial.The adviser takes my advice on board and suggests I fly home, as the Sheik is thinking of acquiring more London properties (when isn’t he, I wonder). It is time, with some regret, to bring my sojourn in southern California to an end and for my negotiations with Mr and Mrs Hedgefund to begin again."
863;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-01-21T19:16:06Z;US Retail Reits;;Shopping malls have long attracted truant schoolchildren. But the malls’ corporate landlords are more concerned these days that their own tenants may disappear.As wary consumers slow spending, investors in retail real estate investment trusts are growing nervous. Mall and shopping centre Reit shares have fallen more than 25 per cent since the beginning of 2007. Retail Reits now trade at a one-third discount to net asset value versus the broader Reit sector, which is trading at 71 per cent of NAV.Retail landlords are better insulated than their tenants against slower consumer spending. Stores’ revenues change daily, but Reits often secure decade-long leases with tenants who stay current on rent payments unless they go bankrupt. No wave of retailer bankruptcies looms on the horizon, at least not yet. And when weak tenants cancel leases during a brief slowdown, it can actually help landlords by freeing up space for stronger tenants.But will this slowdown be brief? Retail Reits have so far been able to pay their sizeable dividends and refinance debt. However some commercial developers have been unable to refinance short-term loans, and some properties had been showing signs of stress even before Sprint and Starbucks announced store closings. Neighbourhood shopping centre vacancies, which have been steadily rising, reached 7.5 per cent in the fourth quarter. Only two-thirds of the 12m sq ft of new inventory was absorbed, said research firm Reis. Vacancy rates at more stable regional malls also rose, to 5.8 per cent.Strong demand in recent years has helped Reits widen the spread between rents on expiring and new leases to as much as 17 per cent. Those spreads could shrink. But tenant bankruptcies would be far more damaging. Some retailers, including now-liquidating CompUSA, have already been caught out by the market. The fortunes of retail Reits now lie in the hands of others.Post and read comments on this Lex
864;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-01-15T22:00:16Z;Comeback kids and the risks of a repeat performance;;"THE PROBLEM

Howard Schultz, chairman of Starbucks, last week took over as chief executive of the coffee retail chain he founded and ran until 2000, after a decline in its share price in 2007 and worries about excessive expansion. His return to the helm follows the reinstatement of several other founders as chief executive, including Jerry Yang of Yahoo, Michael Dell of Dell Computer and Steve Jobs at Apple. Should investors be pleased when founders make a comeback? Will the mistakes that prompted their departure be repeated? And why should a leader found wanting in the past have the right ideas to set the company back on track?

THE ADVICETHE EXECUTIVE
Archie Norman
After I left Asda in 2000, I did not set foot in a store for five years. My view is when you’re gone, you’re gone; the last thing any organisation needs is the former chief executive leaning over its shoulder. And as a general career rule, going back is not the best idea. I remember when Cecil Parkinson, a great political talent, became Conservative party chairman in 1997. He kept referring to “when I was last here”, and was frustrated at how much politics had changed since 1993. Business leaders returning to old pastures are a bit like ageing boxers returning to the ring for one last crack at the title. It is so easy to underestimate how the market has moved on, technology has changed, new competitors have arrived. The surroundings seem familiar and it is hard not to be seduced into the belief the old techniques will work their magic again: whereas what is really needed is new thinking and fresh dynamism. Of course there are no absolute rules. What the “blasts from the pasts” can bring is passion, a commitment to the founding values and a belief the business must rediscover its roots. If the comeback kids have the wisdom to recognise the need to blend old tricks with fresh ideas it might – just might – work.

It depends on the problem that precipitated the founder’s return. In Yahoo’s case, it is fundamentally strategic; Yahoo has been eclipsed by Google’s powerful and superior strategy. I wouldn’t bet on Jerry Yang being able to fix it any time soon because he brings no track record of fixing fundamental strategy problems. In the case of Starbucks and Dell Computer, problems may be more operational, making it quite feasible for Mr Schultz and Mr Dell to get their companies operating as effectively as they did in their prior reigns. Investors there have cause for encouragement. Arguably, Apple’s strategy problem was as bad as or worse than Yahoo’s – its strategy had left it a fringe computer maker sliding into irrelevance. But Jobs transformed it into a media and entertainment company in nothing short of a strategic reinvention. So maybe investors should take heart: returning founders are often highly talented and can be as resourceful as Mr Jobs, despite the apparent odds.

Investors usually think the return of the founder after tough times is salvation, and why not? The founder has qualities that a new CEO from outside rarely offers – passion, knowledge and a sense of accountability for the business. Odds are that in the short term he has the best chance of success. He knows the business, its managers and, even better, is often revered by the people who work there. And therein lies the problem. In the medium term, the slide to a past perspective is inevitable unless the founder identifies an agenda for change. Mr Schultz was clearly aware of this when he called for a shift in the direction of the “Starbucks experience”. He has come storming back with a clear goal, an agenda for change and an appeal to employees – all good reasons for investors to embrace the boomerang CEO. In the long term, is he the only one who can run the business? Well, that’s the long term.

Rupert Merson
Businesses need to grow up as well as grow. Each stage of evolution makes different demands on management and nothing changes more than the role of founders. For most, it is a question of when rather than whether they should leave. History is littered with businesses whose growth has been constrained by their founders’ reluctance to recognise when they have become part of the problem. But they can return successfully if time away has helped them reflect. Fresh thinking plus experience of what first made the business special can be a powerful combination. “If we take an honest look at Starbucks today, we know that we are emerging from a period in which we invested in infrastructure ahead of the growth curve,” Mr Schultz notes in a letter to staff. Julian Metcalfe, returning to Pret à Manger in similar circumstances, made a point of not seeming “akin to the return of the Jedi”. He recruited someone else to the CEO role, appointing himself creative director. Mr Schultz hasn’t been so radical on his return. But he needs to recognise that it isn’t just a case of the good old days again.

865;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-01-14T23:26:45Z;Tiffany tarnished;;Breakfast at Tiffany’s? The luxury jeweller is now suffering alongside the local greasy spoon, as shoppers at all levels pare back purchases.Tiffany’s share price slumped 12 per cent on Friday, after disappointing holiday sales forced it to cut revenue and profit estimates. Tiffany’s backtrack looked moderate compared with recent revisions at many US retailers. Sears, for example, now says its fourth-quarter profit could drop 57 per cent.Yet with falling home prices and rising energy costs squeezing consumers, those dour views were expected. Retail shares, which dropped 18 per cent last year, have paid a steep price.Tiffany’s shortfall, however, sounded a new alarm. Luxury customers tend to stay unruffled by higher fuel and food costs. But a broad and rapid weakening in Tiffany’s US December sales suggests that pressure on consumers has intensified. Some wealthier shoppers might have slowed spending when the 2007 bonus season hit with less force than in recent years.Tiffany’s plight hardly comes at the hands of the rich alone. It also highlights cracks in Tiffany’s latest business strategy, which some on Wall Street have been too quick to call a success. Tiffany is bulking up sales to middle-income customers by offering more sterling silver items and opening stores in less hoity-toity locations. The strategy puts the brand’s cachet at risk, and could irreversibly dilute the value of its high-end baubles.In a different market, Starbucks has used a similar tactic to boost sales – peddling “affordable luxuries” to lower-income consumers who have to stretch further to reach them. Not surprisingly, those customers’ decisions to spend less cash have already hit results.Foreign shoppers taking advantage of the weak dollar are propping up sales at Tiffany, Saks and other higher-market retailers. But luxury sales are under pressure. If the economic slowdown drags on, the pullback will probably spread even further up the income ladder.Post and read comments on this Lex
866;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-01-11T19:45:04Z;The Starbucks romantic;;Howard Schultz claims that after 26 years with Starbucks, the world’s largest coffee retailer, his blood runs brown. He drinks five cups of coffee a day and his favourite drink is the double-shot non-fat latte, three-quarters full.The love affair with coffee dates back to 1981: he was living in New York and selling plastic Swedish housewares when he noticed that a small retailer in Seattle that sold only whole-bean coffee was buying an unusual amount of plastic coffee filters. He went to investigate, fell for both the coffee and the company, and ignored his mother’s advice to stick with the well-paying job he had.Now, after 13 years as chairman, removed from Starbucks’ day-to-day management, Mr Schultz has returned to his former role as chief executive with another impassioned mission: reinvigorating what he calls the “romance and theatre” of coffee-making that he says have been damaged in the retailer’s meteoric global expansion.The company is hardly in dire financial trouble. In 2007, it had revenues of $9.4bn, double-digit earnings growth and opened more than 2,500 new stores.But its share price slipped almost 50 per cent in 2007, as Wall Street worried that it had run out of room for further expansion in the US. In November it reported the first ever decline in customers visiting its US stores, fuelling fears that the broader economic slowdown could damp demand for cinnamon dolce Frappuccinos.Mr Schultz argues that something fundamental needs to be fixed at a chain that has grown from about 1,000 stores 10 years ago to more than 10,000 in the US and more than 5,000 in 42 other countries.The issues bubble about in the the postings on Starbucks Gossip, a website devoted to the company, its employees and customers. There the coffee purists who share at least some of Mr Schultz’s vision complain about the DTs – the drive-through windows now to be found in stores across the US – and the expensive frozen pastries and other food sold alongside the coffee.They miss the old Italian-made La Marzocco espresso machines, with their levered coffee fittings, now replaced with the automatic Verismo 801s that dispense hot espresso at the touch of a button.In February, Mr Schultz gave voice to the dissident voices within the company lamenting the loss of “romance and theatre” in a widely leaked memo to Starbucks’ other top managers. The 801s were so high that customers could not see the coffee being made. New FlavorLock sealed bags of coffee, introduced for efficiency’s sake, meant the stores no longer had the aroma of coffee that was part of their special appeal.“I am not sure people today even know we are roasting coffee. You certainly can’t get the message from being in our stores,” he wrote.His enthusiasm for the ro­mance of coffee harks back to a re­velatory trip to Italy in 1983, when he discovered a drink call­ed the latte, hitherto un­known to Americans, being dispensed with flair and style by baristas who seemed to know every­one’s name. He saw the potential for importing coffee bars.In his 1997 autobiography, Pour Your Heart Into It, Mr Schultz portrayed himself as a boy who became inspired with a burning desire to succeed as he grew up in public housing in the Canarsie area of Brooklyn. He became the quarterback of his school American football team, won a scholarship to Northern Michigan University and set out for the career in sales that eventually led him to Swedish coffee filters. He talks of bashert, the Yiddish word for a person’s allotted fate.Starbucks’ three literary-minded founders had given the company its name (after the first mate in Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick). Mr Schultz joined as retail director in 1982 but left three years later to found a chain of espresso bars. In 1987 he was back, taking over Starbucks for $3.8m. The company was floated in 1994.The same passion has generated enormously loyal employees. “He has the ability to share his vision with his people in a very personal manner,” says a former executive who worked at Starbucks during the dramatic growth years in the 1990s.Paul Argenti, a Tuck Business School professor who has studied Starbucks’ sometimes troubled encounters with fair-trade activists, says: “There’s nothing that happens at the company that is not touched by him in some way.”“I take Starbucks very personally,” Mr Schultz told the FT in an interview before the CEO news broke. As a boy he remembers seeing his father, a delivery truck driver, put out of work by a broken ankle – without health insurance or sick pay – which has underpinned the retailer’s commitment to ensure that its part-time staff can have access to the company’s health insurance. It has also turned him into one of the most outspoken advocates of US healthcare reform.Of late, he has worried that Starbucks has not been aggressive enough in defending itself from stronger competition in the US as fast-food chains such as McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts have started promoting speciality coffee more heavily.Mr Schultz’s decision to slow Starbucks’ US growth and concentrate on fixing the customer’s experience mirrors a similar strategy undertaken by McDonald’s since 2003. After deciding it had taken its “eyes off the fries”, the restaurant chain relaunched its brand in the US around the “I’m lovin’ it” campaign, emphasising the quality of its food.When he is not drinking coffee, Mr Schultz, 55, likes to read and cycle. He has two children, a son and a daughter, and now that they are both away at college (“a big adjustment”) his wife, Sheri – who put her own career as a designer on the back burner when they moved to Seattle – often accompanies him on his travels. And he sees his friends. “I still have most, if not all, my friends from the last 30 years.”Wall Street has given him the benefit of the doubt, with Starbucks’ share rising about 10 per cent the day after his return was announced. On Starbucks Gossip, barista “Vicky Verona” welcomed what she hoped would be a return to the old focus on the coffee.“Yes, I have become a button-pushing espresso monkey. No, I am not happy about it. Yes I am proud of the effort and care I put into every beverage I make. Yes, the La Marzoccos would be slower, but I would be proud of the finished product again.”

It was down 4.6 per cent at $39.16, after the telecoms group reported softness in its consumer business.Only healthcare stocks offered investors a safe haven while a boardroom reshuffle at Starbucks boosted the coffee chain.Equities suffered early in the day on unsubstantiated rumours of more financial problems at Countrywide Financial. Industrial and financial companies then continued to lag amid mixed prospects for the fourth-quarter earnings season, which begins on Wednesday.The S&P 500 rose as much as 1 per cent in early trade and proceeded to flit in and out of negative territory before closing 1.8 per cent lower at 1,390.19.The Nasdaq Composite slid 2.4 per cent to 2,440.51 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.9 per cent to 12,589.07.“When we have got off to a good start in the last few sessions those rallies have faded,” said Richard Sparks, senior equities analyst, at Schaeffer’s Investment Research. “That’s an example of the fear that’s out there and the resistance of traders to jump in feet first.”Financials opened higher on reports that Jimmy Cayne plans to step down as chief executive at Bear Stearns following a torrid few months in which the bank has suffered heavy credit market losses and its share price has tumbled.However, the shares fell 6.7 per cent to $71.17 amid a subsequent broad-based sell-off in financial stocks. Shares in Countrywide Financial, fell 28.4 per cent to $5.47, as the biggest US mortgage lender denied talk that it would file for bankruptcy.Underscoring the continuing problems facing US financial companies Merrill Lynch analyst Guy Moszkowski said he expected Citigroup to take a $16bn write-down of its $55bn subprime and collateralised debt obligation exposure for the fourth quarter.He also widened his loss estimate from 73 cents to $1.43 a share. Citi’s shares fell 4 per cent to $27.14, their lowest in more than five years.Pimco fund manager Bill Gross added to the malaise surrounding financials after he warned losses incurred by sellers of insurance against credit default may total $250bn this year.In another high-profile appointment, Howard Schultz, chairman and founder of Starbucks is to return as chief executive, replacing Jim Donald who oversaw a 42 per cent decline in the company’s share price last year.Shares in Starbucks rose 8.1 per cent to $19.86 after Bank of America upgraded the stockKB Home on Tuesday delivered a stark reminder of the pain inflicted by the US housing market slump after it fell to a $772.7m fourth- quarter loss and took a pretax charge of $403.4m. The company warned 2008 would be another tough year and its shares shed 9.2 per cent to $16.78.Other homebuilders also slumped after pending home sales fell 2.6 per cent in November from an upwardly revised October reading.Retailers also remained a market weak spot after SuperValu, the grocery chain, lowered its full-year guidance amid softer-than-expected sales, pushing the shares 16.6 per cent lower to $28.61.Family Dollar Stores posted a decline in first-quarter profit and cautioned that customers were “more restrained with their discretionary spending”. It fell 6.4 per cent to $16.19.Meanwhile Circuit City, the troubled electronics vendor, said same-store sales fell 11.4 per cent in December. Shares in the group rose 2.1 per cent to $4.30 after falling 78 per cent in 2007.Fourth-quarter season begins in earnest on Wednesday when Alcoa, down 6.4 per cent at $31 becomes the first Dow component to report.Average earnings for the S&P 500 are expected to decline 9.8 per cent, according to Thomson Financial.Although technology stocks are expected to deliver better earnings than most other major companies the Nasdaq has closed lower for seven consecutive sessions amid waning confidence in the sector’s ability to maintain last year’s stellar run.
868;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-01-08T19:27:53Z;Schultz to tackle growth after regaining Starbucks helm;;Iva, the barista at the Starbucks on 53rd Street and 6th Avenue in Manhattan, was recommending her “tall skinny latte” to customers, with a hand-chalked note that also encouraged them to “try it with sugar-free syrup”.At the Starbucks three blocks away, tall skinny latte was also the coffee du jour – although with a different note that it contained “only 90 calories”.In fact, the “authentic” hand-written notes are centrally dictated by a diary delivered regularly to each of Starbucks’ more than 10,000 US stores. They are also a sign of what Howard Schultz, the long-time chairman, now reinstated as chief executive of the company he built, might call the “commoditisation of the Starbucks experience” – something he complained of last year.Mr Schultz has resumed the CEO role he relinquished in 2000 after a year in which Starbucks’ share price fell almost 50 per cent, reflecting concerns on Wall Street that the coffee chain’s spectacular growth is slowing down.Much of the gloom among investors is linked to concerns over the potential slowdown in consumer demand – in November, the company reported its first decline in traffic at its US stores, and investors will be looking at its fourth-quarter results on January 30 for signs of problems linked to the broader economy.RBC Capital Markets analyst Larry Miller downgraded the stock to “market perform” in December after a management meeting, warning that US traffic growth “rests on a rebound in consumer spending, which is unlikely in the near term”.But Mr Schultz insists he is more concerned about longer-term issues created by Starbucks rapid growth. Since 1990, when it had just 84 stores, Starbucks has grown to more than 15,000 company-owned and licensed outlets in more than 40 different countries. It says it wants to open another 10,000 stores in the next four years.Mr Schultz argues that in the US something has been lost along the way – warning that Starbucks has become a victim of “our own tremendous success”.It isnow facing a range of up-and-coming smaller competitors, such as Caribou Coffee, a Minneapolis chain with 475 stores, and San Francisco-based Peet’s Coffee and Tea, with just 160 stores. McDonald’s, the hamburger chain, is also planning to expand the introduction of speciality coffee machines across its 14,000 US store network, creating its own barista positions.Starbucks, says Mr Schultz, will now slow growth of the US stores, having originally planned to open more than 1,600 stores and outlets this year. It will focus on improving the quality of service and introducing new products and store designs, while redirecting capital investment in stores abroad, where it had previously planned 900 new outlets this year.His remarks to investors on Monday night about improving the state of the US businesses included talk of innovation, through new drinks and services, making better use of the company’s loyalty card information, and strengthening the company’s reputation for ethical sourcing of its beans.But he led off by talking about the staff who are at the centre of the effort to communicate the company’s “authenticity”. Starbucks would examine “how we engage our store partners, and the training and tools we offer them to be able to focus on the customer”.Employee engagement is one of the biggest issues facing any leading food or non-food retailer. The specific challenges for Mr Schultz were set out in a recent book, Punching In, by Alex Frankel, who worked as a trainee barista in a San Francisco Starbucks outlet in 2005.He recounts a chaotic introduction to the company, with no time to read the extensive spiral binders of training information, and a feeling that the employees were simply “slapping together” an overly expensive beverage, without any of the “romance and theatre” Mr Schultz says is at the heart of its brand.The corporation has already tried to infuse its more than 144,000 mostly part-time US employees with Schultz-style enthusiasm, giving them a “Coffee Passport” to encourage them to sample the range of coffees on sale. It also operates a “Green Apron” system that rewards employees with special badges who respond appropriately to customers.Investors, meanwhile, seemed inclined to believe Mr Schultz could somehow reverse what for most mass retail outlets is a seemingly inevitable slide into “commoditisation”.
869;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-01-08T00:53:50Z;Starbucks’ Schultz returns as CEO;;Howard Schultz, the chairman of Starbucks, is returning to the post of chief executive, replacing Jim Donald, in response to a sharp fall in its shares and growing anxieties about the impact of rapid growth on the company’s brand and performance.A company statement said the move was part of a set of initiatives aimed at “refocusing the company on providing customers with the distinctive Starbucks experience, and building on Starbucks’ legacy of innovation”.Mr Schultz has been chairman since stepping down as chief executive in 2000 after 13 years.Last year he issued an internal company memo to Mr Donald, who joined Starbucks in 2002 and became chief executive in 2005, warning of what he called “the commoditisation of the Starbucks experience”.Mr Schultz joins a growing list of founders or former chief executives – including Apple’s Steve Jobs, Charles Schwab at his brokerage, Jerry Yang at Yahoo and Michael Dell at the eponymous computer maker – who have been called back into action to revive their companies’ fortunes.He said moves to automate coffee making in the interests of efficiency had damaged the “romance and theatre” of a visit to the stores. Starbucks shares have fallen 48 per cent over the past 12 months. They rebounded 8 per cent in after-hours trading on Monday.Mr Schultz said his agenda would include slowing the pace of new store openings in the US and closing under-performing locations, and redeploying capital originally assigned to the US to increasing the profitability of its overseas operations.“I do not believe we are even close to saturation in the US …The long-term growth trajectory remains strong,” Mr Schultz told the FT.On an analyst call he said that he believed Starbucks could “enhance” its business despite the “headwinds” of a slowing US economy and higher commodity prices. Starbucks opened 1,065 stores during the past year, making a total of 6,700.
870;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-01-07T23:22:11Z;US coffee wars;;Better latte than never. Starbucks’ decision to re-appoint chairman and coffee pioneer Howard Schultz as its chief executive will not solve its problems overnight. But with the battle over specialty coffee rapidly escalating in the US, and its shares off almost 50 per cent in a year, Starbucks is taking the same route as Dell, Yahoo and others of turning to its founder to sort out the mess.The change comes as McDonald’s is turning up the heat by launching coffee bars at nearly 14,000 US locations. Admittedly, the fast food giant, better known for cheeseburgers than cappuccinos, may be biting off more than it can chew. But with McDonald’s tapping the high-margin coffee business for new growth, Starbucks cannot ignore the threat.McDonald’s has trounced competitors on its established turf with popular new menu items. But it will have to do more than poach a few Starbucks customers to justify an aggressive move into speciality coffees. McDonald’s has to convince its own customers to trade up – many of whom head for the Golden Arches for value meals, not for fancy coffee. With the US economy slowing, those customers are more likely to downgrade to even cheaper items.At the other end of the scale, few coffee aficionados rely on McDonald’s for their morning fix. Higher-end coffee drinkers will remain tough to recruit unless they decide that their usual Starbucks latte is too expensive.Starbucks brought some of this on itself, by becoming so ubiquitous that it naturally rubbed up against fast food chains. Mr Schultz’s appointment, alongside a pledge to slow growth in the US, is a clear acknowledgement of its missteps. Starbucks built up its customers’ coffee loyalty over decades, while McDonald’s seems convinced it can do so far more quickly. As Starbucks’ retrenchment shows, companies that deviate from their strengths often come to regret it.Post and read comments on this Lex
871;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-01-07T22:16:38Z;Wall St higher in volatile session;;Wall Street stocks ended a volatile session mostly higher on Monday as cautious traders tentatively took steps to stem the worst start to a year for US equities since 1932.In a reversal of last year’s market leadership healthcare, utilities and consumer staples companies spurred gains as investors fearing a recession sought defensive stocks.Energy and mining companies were sold as commodity prices retreated while technology shares fell for a seventh consecutive session as confidence ebbed away on fears of slowing growth.Although investors found pockets of strength in biotechnology and telecommunication, investment banks retreated on fears of further writedowns in the sectorInvestors also became nervous after Washington confirmed a naval incident involving Iranian vessels.The S&P 500 fluctuated throughout the session but closed up 0.3 per cent at 1,416.18. The gains were far from convincing with almost half of the index’s members closing to the downside.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent to 12,827.49, stemming a fall of 3.5 per cent in the first three days of this year, its worst start in 76 years.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent lower at 2,499.46, having twice fallen as much as 1.3 per cent in the session before rebounding. Shares in computer hardware companies trailed.Traders kept a close eye on support levels in the futures market. The March S&P 500 contract was at 1,424, just shy of its contract low of 1,418 set in November.“The stock market is starting off 2008 in a fairly challenged state with earnings estimates under scrutiny, credit conditions still very unstable and recession fears pretty much everywhere,” Tobias Levkovitch, chief US equity strategist at Citi Investment Research, said.The fourth-quarter earnings season starts this week with US corporate profits expected to fall 9.8 per cent, according to Thomson Financial, marking a second consecutive quarter of negative earnings growth.Average earnings fell 4.5 per cent in the third quarter of 2007, the first year-on-year decline since the start of 2002, as writedowns at financial companies and losses in the homebuilder sector dragged profits into negative territory.Expectations for this year are much improved but Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank, said Wall Street projections for 15.1 per cent earnings growth in 2008 were “wildly optimistic”.Alcoa will on Wednesday become the first Dow component to report fourth-quarter results. Its shares fell 5.1 per cent to $33.11 after analysts cut earnings estimates, citing lower aluminium prices. The SPDR exchange-traded fund for the materials sector fell 1.2 per cent to $40.29.The technology sector was in focus as the Consumer Electronics Show got under way in Las Vegas. Tech outperformed last year but the sector fell sharply last week after Intel was downgraded by JPMorgan. IBM fell 1.1 per cent to $100.05 after UBS downgraded the shares from “buy” to “neutral” citing exposure to the financial services sector.UBS analyst Ben Reitzes also cut his price target on the stock from $133 to $113. Dell shed 3.8 per cent to $21.26 after the same analyst slashed his price target from $29 to $25.Also in the technology sector, CNET Networks slipped 1.4 per cent to $8.44 after a consortium of investment funds led by Jana Partners said it was looking to take over the online media company’s board.Healthcare companies made ground after Morgan Stanley upgraded the shares of Eli Lilly. It rose 5.3 per cent to $54.55. The S&P pharmaceuticals index gained 0.8 per cent to 373.32 points.The biotechnology sector gained after Celgene’s 2008 earnings guidance pleased investors. Celgene added 1.7 per cent to $50.49. Biogen Idec rose 7.2 per cent to $59.22 after its 2007 profit forecast beat estimates.A report that McDonald’s was to launch coffee bars at 14,000 US restaurants spurred a 1.7 per cent gain to $58.03.Starbucks gained 1.5 per cent to $18.38 in spite of the threat to its position. The shares have fallen 10 per cent this month.Investment banking stocks were weak amid fears of further writedowns as earnings season approaches.A broader index of financial companies rose with Sallie Mae leading the way, up 7 per cent at $17.83.
872;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-01-03T07:39:15Z;Lessons from Nestleé’s coffee break;;It is the New Year: time to make resolutions and decide which Christmas presents we actually want to keep. The best thing Santa brought this year was a gadget I want to show off to friends: not an iPod or a Wii, but a Nespresso machine.Nestlé’s star product has pride of place beside our kettle and I enjoy sliding aluminium pods of coffee into the slot at the top, pushing a green-lit button and watching a rather nice shot of espresso gurgle out and into a cup, covered with Crema that I used only to get at Starbucks or other coffee bars.That thrill may soon disappear, but there are other things to appreciate. One is the dozen shiny-coloured “grand cru” pods the machine takes. When I buy them online (as one of 3.1m members of the Nespresso club) they will be delivered to our home by a UPS man in a uniform of a similar brown to the “Livanto” pod, which holds a “uniquely rounded and well-balanced espresso characterised by delicate woody and cereal notes”.Then there are the Nespresso boutiques – not just plain bars – where I can feed my Nespresso habit. I visited the one in Bloomingdale’s in Soho, New York, this week and was served a seasonal almond espresso shot (not as bad as it sounds). The boutique itself, one of 40 intended for the US, has the feel of Switzerland rather than Seattle. Instead of velvet sofas and comfy music, it has hard surfaces, bright colours and European hostesses.Stop there, you may think. I want to drink coffee, not join a cult. And there is something about all this – matching machines and pods, George Clooney advertisements in Europe, Sharon Stone’s unveiling of its flagship boutique on the Champs Elysées – that is totalitarian. Nespresso is “an experience” rather than coffee, Nestlé told analysts last year and, boy, is it all-enveloping.But one cannot argue with success. Nobody forced Santa to spend $229 on the Nespresso Essenza machine in my home, nor me to buy pods at $5.40 for 10. Yet Nestlé leads the global market in “single-serve coffee”, as the burgeoning category is known, and its customers bought 1.4m Nespresso machines and 2.3bn pods in 2006.There must be lessons here.One is that there is surprisingly strong demand for goods and services that are a step below luxury but a cut above the ordinary – call them premium, luxe or “affordable luxury”. It did not occur to me before the Nespresso came along that I ever needed such a thing. Now that I have it, however, I am attached to it.The trick is to make such goods alluring and to set a price that is steep but affordable. UK newspaper executives sometimes moan that consumers refuse to pay 50p for a newspaper when they spend £2 on a coffee at Starbucks, but a newspaper is not the same thing as a Starbucks espresso. A shot of Nespresso – essentially – is the same.“People can have their own coffee shop at home. They save because, even though it is more expensive than drip coffee, it is still a third of the price of Starbucks,” says Jay Brewer, founder of singleservecoffee.com, a website devoted entirely to, well, you get the idea.A second lesson is that you can make more money with a combination of goods and services than by simply selling objects alone. Nestlé is only one among many companies that saw the opportunity for pod coffee machines. Philips and Douwe Egberts produce the Senseo machine, Kraft and Braun the Tassimo and Keurig, the US office coffee machine maker, has its own range of home devices.Nespresso is not only the most expensive contender, but the most proprietary. Many roasters make “K-Cup” pods to fit in Keurig machines and other machines are, to differing degrees, open to other pod-makers. But the only pods which fit a Nespresso machine are Nespresso pods and you can only buy them through Nespresso.There is an obvious similarity between this and Apple’s iPod/iTunes combination, which comprises a physical device and an online service to fill it up. But Nestlé does not even have to share its revenues with others in the way that Apple does with music companies, apart from paying coffee growers for beans and film stars for endorsements.A third lesson is that some products are tricky to launch because they require co-operation between various industries – iPod/iTunes being an example. Since you need both a machine and coffee to make espresso, all kinds of partnerships and joint ventures have been launched by food companies and device makers.Nestlé did not make machines, nor did it have an established espresso brand – it was most famous, when I was young, for making Nescafé freeze-dried instant coffee. But it launched a new brand in Italy and Switzerland, made deals with machine manufacturers and steadily extended its presence around the world.That leads to my final lesson, which is that successes usually do not occur overnight. Nestlé patented some of its pod technology in 1976 and did not start making Nespresso machines until 1986. Even then, it largely confined its efforts to commercial machines: a decade ago, it was selling only 75,000 machines a year.By the time manufacturers were able to turn out high-pressure espresso machines for less than $300 each, it had the technology and the brand to sell direct to consumers. That has left companies with more established espresso and cappuccino brands – including Starbucks and Illy – trying to catch up.Thus, despite the naff eurotrash marketing and unsettling boutique decor, there is a lot to emulate about how Nespresso has inveigled itself into my home (and those of a few others in New York this Christmas, to judge by a straw poll).With that, it is time for my morning cappuccino.john.gapper@ft.comPost and read comments at John Gapper’s blog
873;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2008-01-02T22:14:28Z;Wall St start to new year worst in 25 years;;US blue-chip stocks on Wednesday suffered the worst start to a new year in 25 years after an index of manufacturing fell sharply, raising fears that the US economy is slowing more than expected.Energy stocks were a lone bright spot as crude oil prices touched $100 a barrel, but the spike in crude accentuated selling of a broad range of transport and industrial companies. Technology stocks were particularly weak after an analyst downgraded several semiconductor companies.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.7 per cent to 13,043.96 points, its worst percentage decline on the first trading day of a year since 1983. The S&P 500 closed 1.4 per cent lower at 1,447.16 and the Nasdaq Composite shed 1.6 per cent to 2,609.63.The Institute for Supply Management’s survey showed that manufacturing weakened unexpectedly in December. The ISM index fell 3.1 percentage points to 47.7 last month, against expectations it would be little changed. A reading of 50 marks the line between growth and contraction.“Clearly the worries that we finished 2007 with are continuing into 2008, with these ISM numbers coming out so weak,” Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management, said. “The Fed is caught between a rock and a hard place trying to fight inflation while dealing with the slowdown in US growth.”Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s December meeting emphasised the difficulty of “unusually uncertain” economic conditions and indicated the Fed remained “exceptionally alert” to the possible need for further rate cuts.The futures market fully priced in the likelihood of at least a 25 basis point cut at the end of this month compared with a 68 per cent chance a week ago.Semiconductor stocks were sold after Banc of America Securities downgraded eight companies – three of them to “sell” – saying a cyclical recovery had run its course, while inventories had risen above equilibrium levels.BofA analyst Sumit Dhanda cut Intel to “neutral” and told investors to sell shares in Advanced Micro Devices. The shares fell 4.9 per cent to $25.35 and 4.8 per cent to $7.14 respectively. The PHLX semiconductor sector index lost 2.9 per cent to 396.34.Also in the chip sector Qualcomm fell 2.4 per cent to $38.39 after it said it expected an “immediate short-term impact” from a court ruling that it must halt chip sales that infringe patents belonging to Broadcom. Broadcom gained 1.5 per cent to $26.52.Amazon outperformed after Citigroup told investors to buy the shares citing expectations of strong revenue growth and margin expansion. The shares gained 3.9 per cent to $96.25.Transport groups struggled as oil prices soared and after JPMorgan downgraded FedEx from “overweight” to “neutral” because of weak freight demand and higher fuel costs. The shares fell 3.9 per cent to $86.16.YRC Worldwide, the trucking company, fell 9.7 per cent to $15.43 after warning it expected to incur charges in the fourth quarter related to previous acquisitions. Goodyear Tire & Rubber fell 5 per cent to $26.82 after Goldman Sachs said that cost inflation was acting as a large offset to cost savings activity.Investors also sold restaurant chains after Bear Stearns downgraded the sector to “underweight”. Analyst Joseph Buckley cut Starbucks to “peer perform” from “outperform” because he expects less affluent consumers will start to feel economic pressures. The stock fell 5.7 per cent to $19.31.Shares in Industrial companies declined after the ISM report and as Citi downgraded Textron, the industrial conglomerate, to “hold” from “buy”. The shares fell 6.3 per cent to $66.81.Financials fell heavily as National City said it would slash its dividend by almost 50 per cent and that it planned to raise more capital to cope with credit market turmoil. The shares dropped 5.3 per cent to $15.59. The S&P investment bank index shed 3.5 per cent with Morgan Stanley, down 4.1 per cent at $50.95 and Lehman Brothers, 5 per cent weaker at $62.19.Newmont Mining, the world’s second largest gold producer, rose 7.3 per cent to $52.39, the best performer on the S&P, as gold prices surged to a record high.As oil prices rose, energy stocks benefited. Transocean, the world’s largest offshore drilling company gained 2 per cent to $145.95.
874;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-12-26T19:31:24Z;Sifting for the grains of success;;"The Granularity of Growth; Making choices that drive enduring company performanceBy Patrick Viguerie, Sven Smit and Mehrdad BaghaiCyan/Marshall Cavendish, $45/£19.99There is no such thing as a growth industry. No, this is not the latest doom-laden forecast for 2008. It is the penetrating insight offered by three management consultants – two from McKinsey, the other a former McKinsey partner – in this thought-provoking new book.Too often people speak in the most general terms about market trends. “The world’s ageing population will generate increasing demand for healthcare,” we might say, or “You have to invest in the booming Chinese economy.”But closer analysis reveals these sweeping remarks do not help you to understand how businesses actually make money. “Most discussions of megatrends take place at a very broad and superficial level,” Viguerie, Smit and Baghai argue. “That may be fine for financial commentators on TV or casual dinner-party chat, but it’s not much use if you happen to be the CEO of a large company trying to make decisions about where to compete or to allocate resources.”Consider a customer walking into a branch of Starbucks. Will he or she simply order “a cup of coffee”? Unlikely. The customer makes a specific and deliberate choice. In economies and product categories this effect is magnified on an industrial scale. So, the authors say, managers’ understanding of markets has to go much deeper, down to a “granular” level. “We believe that the leaders of large institutions need to avoid taking an averaged view of all their businesses; instead, they should manage them with greater focus at a more detailed level, while continuing to take advantage of their scale,” they write.McKinsey has hired a team of data analysts based in India to carry out what the firm calls “granular growth decompositions” – a detailed study of the way companies make money. They have separated this revenue generation into three main categories: mergers and acquisitions; “portfolio momentum” or growth in revenue achieved in the markets where a business competes; and “share gain” or achieving a greater share of a given market.Their findings are pretty startling. For one thing, M&A does not seem to be an inevitably value-destroying route. Indeed, the coming slowdown could be a great time to make some smart acquisitions, the authors say.Second, “portfolio momentum” is of supreme importance. This vital measure of strategic performance reveals the wisdom of decisions taken many years earlier. The authors quote approvingly the candid thoughts of an ex-CEO of Shell, Lo van Wachem: “The actual revenue I realise today is grossly dependent on the energy reserves acquired and explored by the two CEOs before me, and CEOs two generations after me will reap the rewards of my efforts.”Third, agonising over market share can be a waste of time, however important we believe it to be. Have “superior insights” or “truly distinctive capabilities” instead, they advise. “If you don’t, you’ll find your competitors’ execution soon matches yours, and your market-share performance will take a dive …stalling your growth programme.”McKinsey’s analysis has confirmed the authors in their belief that a business’s success depends heavily on the markets in which it operates. “So the next time a company announces stellar performance, it’s worth taking a closer look to see how much of its growth came from better steering, and how much from a favourable tailwind,” they write. “What is driving performance: execution or strategic choices?”Practically, a company like Procter and Gamble seems to have taken the granularity message on board. Its skilful brand management embodies this. And yet, P&G’s rival Unilever arguably tripped up in recent years by cannibalising its own brands, getting its granules in a twist.So “going granular” is not easy. And doesn’t it all sound rather time-consuming? It needn’t be so. “In our experience …the critical issues affecting growth are brought to light immediately, making the dialogue between the executive board and the business unit much more specific,” the authors say. “In most cases, the number of issues discussed doesn’t increase, but the specificity and quality of those issues rises dramatically.”In 2008, you can stop worrying so much about market share and get to grips with choice market granules instead."
875;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-12-26T18:24:55Z;Outside Edge: Starbucks bows to the Italian baristi;;The Starbucks diaspora reached six more countries this year, including Russia and Egypt, bringing the total to 43. Among those countries where the chain is not: Djibouti, Mongolia, Italy. (I originally wrote “Jordan”, but it turns out Starbucks is there.)Italians, as everyone knows, are fixated on their caffeine: the breakfast of champions is an espresso inhaled while standing up. It seems incomprehensible that Starbucks has not felt able to launch lattes in Livorno, or flog frappuccinos in Florence. Could 2008 be the year?Many Italians feel their country is immune to invasion. Mention Starbucks and you will receive a load of steam and froth about the quality of the beans, the desirability of proper cups, an aversion to American imperialism and the all-powerful Italian barman, or barista, and his informed conversation on last night’s football.Italians do cherish the barista who knows their order. It cannot be easy. One banker told me: “My barman has been at the same bar for at least 10 years. Even though the four of us [in the family] have different coffees – macchiato, cappuccino d’orzo, a marocchino and a cappuccio. We don’t have to order: he serves them as we enter.”I should explain that a macchiato is an espresso with a dash of hot foamy milk, a marocchino is a bit like a small cappuccino with cocoa powder, a cappuccio is Milanese for cappuccino and a cappuccino d’orzo is not coffee at all but some substitute made of barley.But Starbucks can play the bewildering game too. You could order a “half caff, dry, quad, tall white soy mocha”, and then settle down to your steamed white chocolate and (no foam) soya milk with two shots of regular and two shots of decaffeinated espresso, served in a 12oz cup.It is true that the best Italian coffee would blow Starbucks away, but I suspect the chain could win on trendiness and innovation. The reasons for Starbucks’ absence are more mundane.Starbucks would be pitched into huge competition in Italy without offering a better price. An espresso in Italy usually costs less than €1, while a double espresso is €2 at Starbucks in Paris and you cannot buy a single. Service would have to be faster – Italians expect their coffee in seconds.Also, foreign multinationals have historically had a hard time navigating planning laws in Italy to build a network quickly and with enough scale.Howard Schultz, the man most closely associated with Starbucks’ success, derived his ideas from a trip to Italy. “It’s more out of humility and respect that we’re not in Italy,” the company told me. “We would want to be very careful . . . It’s not for business reasons and Italy is not less of a strategic priority.”Maybe so, but the company has made more of a priority of 43 other countries first. Whatever the logic, I’m sure the barista on Venus is more worried than the one in Venice.The writer is the FT’s Milan correspondent
876;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-12-19T19:56:26Z;Rivals vie to operate on costly healthcare;;"Attempts have been made before to reform the increasingly expensive US healthcare system. The previous occasion was in 1993, when the 1,342-page reform plan of Hillary Clinton, who was then first lady, was a spectacular flop.The 2008 election is shaping up to be another such crossroads for a healthcare system that is significantly costlier than it was when congress found “Hillarycare” wanting.But the nature of the debate has altered radically in the past few years. While most of the presidential challengers – and, particularly, the Democrats – are focusing on extending coverage to America’s 47m uninsured, reform is increasingly framed as an economic as well as a moral imperative.The US now spends 17 per cent of its gross domestic product on healthcare – roughly double the average for wealthy countries. Much of this burden falls on employers, who are pointing with increasing frenzy to the disadvantage of competing with countries that fund their healthcare through tax revenues. Contributions to employee healthcare premiums add $1,500 (€1,046, £750) to each car that General Motors produces. Starbucks pays more in healthcare than it does for coffee beans.The second big shift is the focus on affordability for the large majority of Americans who do have health insurance. Healthcare inflation regularly outstrips general inflation and premiums have almost doubled since 2000. Half of all US families pay a quarter of their income on health insurance. And half of all personal bankruptcies are due to a medical crisis.Finally, politics has caught up with preventive medicine. Three-quarters of the national health bill is spent on treating people with chronic diseases, particularly ones relating to obesity, such as diabetes, heart disease and hypertension.Led by Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, who has lost 110lb (50kg), candidates from both parties are talking about prevention as the best way to reduce costs. “Focusing on prevention rather than systems of financing is the best way to build a bipartisan consensus for reform,” said Ken Thorpe, chairman of the Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease, a diverse group that
includes the National Association of Manufacturers and the Service Employees’ International Union.“It’s also the best way to reduce costs.”That is the extent of bipartisanship. The three leading Democratic candidates – Mrs Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards – all favour creating a universal healthcare system, giving subsidies to the uninsured so they can afford to sign up.All would require insurance companies to accept any applicant, regardless of their health risks. All would provide tax breaks so that small businesses could afford to provide coverage to employees. The three plans would cost between $60bn and $120bn a year – partly paid for by rescinding President George W. Bush’s tax cuts for the wealthiest.Of the three, Mrs Clinton, who admits she “bears the scars” of her 1993 attempt, places most emphasis on choice. She is at pains to point out that her plan would not create a new federal bureaucracy. The only serious difference between candidates is that Mr Obama’s plan omits the “individual mandate” that would compel the uninsured to take out coverage, much as drivers are required to have car insurance.The Republicans are much lighter on detail. Almost all the party’s leading presidential challengers model their proposals on Mr Bush’s health savings accounts, which offer tax incentives for individuals to set up portable health insurance.They argue that greater competition will drive down costs, much as the Democrats argue that bringing the uninsured into the net will reduce costs by pooling risk more efficiently.Whichever Republican becomes the nominee will probably have to develop a more comprehensive plan, taking into account the healthcare anxieties of the Middle American swing states. Healthcare now ranks second or third among voters as an issue of concern."
877;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-12-19T16:03:28Z;Going undercover in the corporate workplace;;"Curious to know what happens behind the ”employees only” doors of some of America’s biggest companies, business journalist Alex Frankel went undercover to find out how these giants try to win the hearts and minds of their thousands of retail and service employees.His book, Punching In, is reviewed by the FT here. and recounts his experiences at half-dozen companies including UPS, Gap, Starbucks and the Apple Store. He answered your questions on corporate culture on Wednesday 19 December.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..After your experiences, did you admire the people who do those jobs all the time, or think that they were being exploited?
Trudy, LondonAlex Frankel: I came away feeling admiration for most of the people with whom I worked. The places where I worked tended to spend a bit more per hour on their employees than other employers and this made them workplaces where the focus on people was higher than in other lower paid places. Also, because of the transient nature of the front-line jobs where I worked, I found that if people were truly unhappy they would often leave for other better offers. (If Gap was not working out, people would leave for H&M.)Enterprise Rent-A-Car was the one workplace out of the five where I worked where I found the employer to be a bit disingenuous in terms of what it promised employees and what those employees got in return. A lot of the new hires I met seemed to understand this discrepancy so I did not view them as exploited as much as playing along with a less than ideal system with the hopes of eventually profiting from their commitment to the rather long hours and demands of the job.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..Isn¹t most of the reason people work hard or not innate? Can a corporate culture really transform a lazy, clockwatcher into employee of the month?
Sergei, FranceAlex Frankel: It is probably rare that a corporate culture will transform a lazy person into a shining example of an employee. That said, if a person who might have not applied themselves in other jobs finds a workplace where he or she really feels as if he or she fits in and feels as if the job has meaning and makes life worthwhile, then that person may indeed rise to the occasion and give more to the job than he or she might have elsewhere.Companies that are in tune with their hiring and development of workers know that selection of workers is key so that the ranks of workers are chiefly filled with people who match the spirit of the organisation. This was a key finding I had in working at five retail companies.From the outside if might have appeared that places like Gap, The Apple Store, and Starbucks were all hiring from the same talent pool, what I found was that each company had its own criteria for finding people.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..If you were creating a retail chain today, what would be the essential elements of the workplace you would have to ensure all your staff worked hard and effectively. Are there examples of companies that already do these things?
AnonAlex Frankel: Great question. I would start by identifying what made my new retail chain new, exciting, and different both in terms of what we were selling, how we were selling it, and who the customers would be. With those key factors defined, I could then communicate these things clearly and effectively to possible applicants. Ideally those applicants would be attracted to my company by the way in which I was going to distinguish myself and do business and they would self-select for my particular retail chain.I would then have a good way to identify the best people to hire through a creative selection technique. I would then focus on creating a training system (like that seen in the Apple Store) which treated new hires as adults and allowed them to shadow veteran workers while learning the new job.For a quick example, let’s say my new retail chain will be solar-powered eco-friendly pizza stores that offer incredibly fast service and a high tech computer back end for ordering. Having communicated this message using my branding I will then hope to attract those employees who care about what I am doing and want to get involved. The best applicants will arrive at their interviews very much subscribed to my business approach.To your question, yes, many companies do a lot of these things right, though they may not get every piece perfect. The Apple Store, Starbucks, Whole Foods (the grocery chain), and Pret a Manger are all good examples.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..Do you think that the corporate culture has to be defined around the core values of a single corporation or this is a broad phenomena, which may be cultivated across different industries?
Viktor O. Ledenyov, UkraineAlex Frankel: I think that any corporate culture, no matter what industry, simply has to represent some distinguishing characteristic about a given company. This seems basic, but many companies fail by trying to be like their competitors instead of fashioning their own identity.The most common way I found that corporate cultures are built is by aligning the company with the ideals of a founder. This makes sense, as presumably that founder had a new vision which was articulated and which laid the ground work for the new company.As a new Starbucks barista, for example, you learn about the values of its chairman Howard Schultz. He is not the founder but is treated as such. Enterprise Rent-A-Car teaches employees about its founder Jack Taylor and Gap tells new hires about founder Don Fisher. So though core values of companies may differ, as long as they are able to isolate what makes them unique, they will be able to design a lasting, strong culture.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..My question is about individuality and innovation. Doesn’t the successful introduction of a uniform corporate culture across a big company mean that the employees ability to contribute new ideas is squashed? How can they express the new ideas important to keeping a company moving forward?
Harjit Singh, IndiaAlex Frankel: In the best cases, a uniform corporate culture will still be one in which organic changes by employees will still be possible. A good example here is UPS. My perception of UPS, as a worker there, was largely shaped by the people I worked with. To me they were the purveyors of the culture as much, or more than, the corporation. As an employee I got messages and information from the company in terms of dress codes and manners of operating but a lot of what I learned was channelled by the people who I worked alongside.UPS, a 100-year-old company this year, certainly has prescribed ways of operating but I found that though the central tenets of the company were fairly set, the employees had a bit of latitude and could take the culture in new and different directions.A place with hard and fast rules and regulations can still have a loose, adaptable culture. One thing lacking in most of the front-line workplaces was a feedback loop, however, that allowed employees to share much information with headquarters and in this regard the ability of these workers to share ideas is not promoted as it should be.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..With a workforce mobility that now sees employees constantly moving to new employers, because of opportunities or reorganisations, loyalty to employers must be affected. How has this influenced the indoctrination of employees into their corporate cultures?
Charles Kreidl, Chicago, Illinois, USAlex Frankel: There is no doubt that loyalty and turnover are huge issues in the front-line retail environments where I worked (Starbucks, Gap, et al.) as well as across the board. Those companies which really focus on creating a place where people want to work and which match a workplace culture with an employee style are ahead of the game. Also, companies that offer benefits to even entry level employees that are better than the competition have a major advantage.A noteworthy example here is Starbucks which is well known for offering solid health insurance benefits to employees who work more than 20 hours per week. What this means is that even if a given employee may move cities, he or she often stays with the company and simply starts working at a new location when he or she moves.This type of loyalty has tangible benefits to the company by lowering acquisition and training costs and boosting employee morale. The trick here for companies is to trust that the expense of good training and culture building will pay off in the long run by building a staff of committed, loyal employees.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..What were the dumbest things you were asked to do during applications? What is your opinion of the selection processes you went through?
AnonAlex Frankel: Selection for the front-line workplaces where I applied was a quite varied experience. Chiefly applications broke down into two approaches - either paper or online applications. A paper application, such as the one provided by Starbucks, was fairly straightforward and online applications went from simple to more complex.The most in-depth online applications had me answer up to 200 personality-related questions such as ”Do you engage in gossip” and ”Do you like to be among large crowds.” These high tech applications would then evaluate my answers using algorithms and presumably determine whether I would make a good match at the place where I was applying. The electronics retailer Best Buy was one company that used these screening tools. Interviews were also interesting, including group interviews in which up to ten applicants were interviewed en masse.Companies such as Gap that did nothing creative in the interview process were less interesting than a place such as The Container Store (a chain of some 30 stores) which included very creative ”auditions” to determine which applicants were the best.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..Is there really such thing as corporate culture in multinational corporations or are there merely many sub-cultures under the single umbrella of the corporation?
Ajay MalhotraAlex Frankel: I think in the most effective of the multinational corporations there is certainly a uniformity in the corporate culture so that it is fairly similar whether you might be in New York, London, or San Francisco.Starbucks, for example, may have slightly different rules and codes in Europe and the US, but by and large the experience a worker will have working in a store in one location and another will be fairly similar. This uniformity is a key part of the Starbucks approach and promotes both a similarity of experience for customers as well as employees who may end up moving work locations. At less organised companies there are likely more regional differences.I myself worked primarily in the San Francisco area to do the research for my book so I was not able to directly compare workplaces in different places but research seems to show that a specific corporate culture tends to permeate a given company if that company is focused on expanding that culture (as is the case at Starbucks).…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..What were the most important corporate qualities you experienced that created the most efficient working environment, i.e. in terms of a drive to perform, employee loyalty and willingness to go beyond the standard task at hand?
Adam Keats, LondonAlex Frankel: For me, the best corporate environments in which to work were those in which the corporate culture or spirit was communicated clearly by the company or, ideally, communicated from one employee to another.In terms of what made a particular workplace one in which I felt as if I wanted to work harder and stay longer, one of the key pieces for me was how the training was conducted. If the tone and manner and information conveyed during training was clear and also came across in a way that did not talk down to employees I was most interested in paying attention.The Apple Store in which I worked was notable for its strong training and for giving the newly hired employees the time to digest.…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..About the expertAlex Frankel is a writer based in San Francisco.

878;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-12-12T19:32:31Z;On the customer frontline;;"Punching In: The Unauthorised Adventures of a Front-Line EmployeeBy Alex FrankelCollins, $24.95/£14.99They must be slapping themselves on the back at the Texas headquarters of Container Store, retailer of boxes, shelves and other “storage solutions”. For when Alex Frankel, author of Punching In, tried to get a job at Container Store by posing as a storage fanatic, he failed to get past the first interview.When it comes to staffing, Container Store – which prides itself on the thoroughness and intensity of its training – has decided to spend what it takes to get the committed storage fanatics it wants to interact with its customers. It has some of the lowest turnover rates in the sector and famously good customer service.For most mass-retailers, however, the challenge is to find the right balance between costs and quality of service – while remembering that their vast enterprises are ultimately at the mercy of employees who face the customers.But how do you motivate the staff who constitute a retailer’s chief expense? And how do you prevent a surly employee from leaving a potential customer either indifferent or, worse, hostile? Mr Frankel’s entertaining and well-written book offers some grass-roots insights. A business journalist, he decided to seek work at some of America’s leading customer-service companies in an attempt to find out what works, and why – and what does not.Container Store did not want him after a preliminary interview. At Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, and at Whole Foods Market, the organic and natural grocer, he did not even get past an online questionnaire, apparently failing some kind of credibility algorithm in his attempts to answer a range of ethical and personal questions.But luckily UPS needed seasonal workers in San Francisco, launching a project that then took Mr Frankel into jobs at Starbucks, Gap and Apple, as well as a stint at Enterprise, the car rental company.It is anecdotal, but fascinating. As they fight the Christmas rush, it becomes apparent that UPS’s drivers are the core of its esprit de corps – they serve as empowered non-commissioned officers who have risen through the ranks, and who pull it all together when things start to
go pear-shaped on the beaches.Mr Frankel gets minimal training before going out on his truck, but he is sucked into the corporate values by the drivers and feels guilty about taking a day off.Starbucks, on the other hand, sounds more like a ship with a panicking crew in a storm of caramel-flavoured Frappacinos. There are vast manuals of staff instruction, but no time to read them. New staff learn largely on the job from any colleagues who are nice enough to help them, before being thrust in front of a queue of customers demanding ever-more-baroque confections.Perhaps the biggest shock of the book is Enterprise, a company that has gained attention for its support of the Net Promoter Score-based system for assessing how well it is doing with its customers.The formula, developed with Bain consultant Fred Reichheld, relies upon customers rating the company according to whether or not they would recommend the service to a friend.But it turns out Enterprise’s well-trained staff – many of them recent college graduates – are probably more concerned about selling add-on insurance than they are about their scores. Insurance is the main factor that determines whether or not they will rise through the ranks of what sounds like a parody of entrepreneurial culture, which preaches that everyone can succeed if they only try hard enough. Clearly, Frankel did not buy it – although it seems to work with most of his colleagues, at least those that do not burn out and start sharing their disgruntlement at www.failingenterprise.com.There may be no great revelations about management training theory in this book,
but it does lift the veil that conceals the other side of the counter.And in the unlikely event of armed hostilities ever breaking out between UPS and Starbucks, I know which side I would back."
879;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-12-10T07:01:45Z;Green supply chains: moving beyond logistics;;As companies start to examine the environmental footprint of their supply chains, attention has often focused on transport and logistics. But while the movement of products across the globe is one of the most visible signs of the contribution of supply chains to climate change, many organisations are starting to look for efficiencies throughout their operations, taking decisions on sustainability back as far as the design stage.Of course, with rising fuel costs, the argument for addressing transport issues is a compelling one. And there is plenty of room to iron out inefficiencies in long-distance cargo haulage.“In Europe, typically 25 to 30 per cent of vehicles are running around empty that’s because we’re not optimising the backhauls or because vehicles are ending up in the wrong place,” says Jonathan Wright, a senior manager, supply chain practice at Accenture.Some forms of transport are more energy-efficient than others. Ocean-borne shipping is generally seen as the most carbon-efficient means of freight transportation, for example. Companies are exploring the idea of putting some products on barges, while others argue that countries with canal systems, such as the UK, should put them back into commercial use.“One of the things companies are looking at is whether they have to go with a pure strategy or whether can they go intermodal,” says Jayashankar Swaminathan, a professor at University of North Carolina’s Kenan-Flagler Business School. “Not everything has to go through aircraft or trucks. Ships and rail could be part of it, or a combination, so you’re not only optimising cost but also fuel efficiency and the amount of pollution you’re causing.”However, Prof Swaminathan points out that the configuration side of the supply chain – that is, where products are being made and stored – also drives efficiency. “It’s about where you have the warehouses, suppliers and manufacturing facilities,” he says. “If you want your supply chain to have minimum cost but also minimum effect environmentally, you have to go back and revisit those things.”Part of the problem lies in the consolidation of many industries. When companies merge with or buy other companies, they may find that warehouses and transport networks are no longer in appropriate positions for the new business, generating more truck movements than necessary.“You’re adding warehouses to the next bit of demand,” says Mr Wright. “And you may find you have a warehouse on one side of a European border and one on the other side. It takes a long time and it’s quite complex to merge those two supply chains and work out that you need, say, one big warehouse and three satellite warehouses. That fundamental restructuring requires some thinking.”A re-examination of transportation can prompt this kind of thinking. In the US, when Business for Social Responsibility started working with companies to assess the emissions associated with transport, it found participating companies using the information more broadly than expected.“We’ve got some of the big shippers like Starbucks and Timberland feeding that information into [warehousing and manufacturing plant] siting decisions,” says Eric Olson, BSR’s head of advisory services.With buildings thought to generate about 40 per cent of the world’s greenhouse gases, many companies are looking at the green credentials of their warehouses. Sainsbury’s, the UK retailer, has established a warehouse in Northampton designed to reduce carbon emissions through devices such as air-tight freezers, energy-efficient lighting, wall-mounted photovoltaic panels, solar walls and a power plant that reuses heat generated by air conditioning.But while the logistics side of global supply chains provides many areas in which companies become more efficient and sustainable, organisations are also starting to look more broadly across the chain for environmental improvements.“What progressive companies are looking at is a lifecycle assessment and plotting through their entire supply chain the relevant inputs and outputs at each stage, whether energy or materials,” says Omer Abdullah, managing director of the smart cube, a London and Chicago based professional services firm.This takes companies all the way back to the design stage of their operations, where they can reduce or eliminate toxic chemicals or make the product easier to take apart at the recycling stage. Packaging design also has an impact. Better designs help not only cut down on materials use but also reduce transport-related emissions because more items fit into each container.For companies taking the lifecycle assessment approach, the areas of focus may vary according to the products they make. “If you’re Unilever and you find four-fifths [of the carbon emissions generated by the product] comes from in use by customers, then you’ll focus on that aspect with, say, smarter washing campaigns,” says Tim Brooks, a senior account manager at Greenstone Carbon Management. “Whereas others might focus on the energy used to manufacture the product.”The other challenge is that supply chains have become highly complex, with dozens of companies contributing parts and processing to products before they reach the shops. Verifying the green credentials of dozens of suppliers and their suppliers is costly and difficult.As a result, many companies are turning to environmental certifications such as ISO1400 as a means of ensuring suppliers adhere to their own standards.In this respect, Mr Abdullah sees big brands as a force for good, pushing environmental standards down the supply chain. “When Wal-Mart sets the parameter for suppliers to work from it’s a significant thing, because who is saying no to Wal-Mart?” he says. “We’ve been seeing an anti-brand backlash in recent years, but this is a great example of how brands are driving things forward.”
880;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-11-23T02:03:49Z;Stores warned of gift card backlash;;US retailers are this season facing the first signs of a backlash from consumer advocates over one of their most profitable lines – sales of gift cards, which the National Retail Federation expects to be worth about $26.5bn (£12.8bn, €17.8bn) over the holiday period.More than half of all US shoppers are likely to buy a gift card, according to the NRF, and more than 80 per cent of them will buy more than two.The forecast 5.7 per cent increase in sales compares with the 4 per cent growth expected for overall retail sales.But earlier this month, Consumer Reports, published by the non-profit Consumers’ Union, ran a full-page advertisement in the New York Times highlighting the fact that customers threw away an estimated $8bn last year as a result of unused, lost, damaged or expired cards.“Easy money for retailers. Lost money for you,” the advertisement read.A national survey by the group in October of 1,003 adults found that 27 per cent of those who received gift cards in the previous holiday had still not used one or more of them.Gift cards, which are pre-paid and store-specific, started catching on in the US at the start of the decade. This year more retailers have started reporting both the extent of their gift card liabilities, and the revenue accruing from unused or so-called broken cards.Gap, the clothing retailer, said its gift card liabilities stood at $337m in February this year. It also recognised $31m of income last year when it shortened the period after which it considered a card “broken” from five to three years.Best Buy, the electronics retailer, recorded a $19m gain from broken cards last year, bringing to $78m the total gain since it started recognising the revenues three years ago.It considers a card broken after two years, and had gift card liabilities of $494m in March.Nordstrom, the upmarket speciality fashion store, estimates that 3.5 per cent of all the cards it sells are never used, and has recognised $13.3m since it launched its programme in 1999. Starbucks, the coffee company, recognised $4.4m in unused card income in 2006.Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer, does not give numbers for its gift card liabilities, but Target, its smaller rival, had $338m in gift cards outstanding in February this year.Amazon, the online retailer, had $183m, up 40 per cent on the previous year, representing 1.7 per cent of its total sales.Retailers, attracted both by the sales and the interest-free loan provided by gift card purchases, continue to expand their offerings, with company’s such as Safeway’s Blackhawk subsidiary now stocking “gift card malls” in supermarkets and drug stores.Innovations include DVD-readable cards used by Best Buy and Circuit City, while Starbucks and others encourage customers to go to their website to customise their card designs.In another sign that consumers may be increasingly aware of the costs of cards, a new website, Leveragecard.com, will next week offer interest on gift cards held online on a site that will allow users both to manage gift cards and retailer loyalty programmes.“We can actually offer 3.65 per cent to people that purchase cards through the site,” says Mark Roberts.
881;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-11-19T18:41:49Z;The Short View: Decoupling;;Fans of decoupling may find their paradigm tested this week.To recap: decoupling assumes the rest of the world no longer catches a cold when the US sneezes. It merely offers an indifferent gesundheit and carries on its way.Strong economic growth in the BRICs – Brazil, Russia, India and China – and elsewhere, means the global economy is no longer so dependent on the US, goes the reasoning.Emerging markets’ sharp outperformance versus Wall Street since the subprime- induced slowdown appears to support the assumption.But has the divorce truly inured global markets to evidence that the US consumer, and thus the bulk of the economy, is buckling under the stress of a weak housing market and high gas prices?Only last week, China’s commerce ministry warned that the nation’s exports would be “devastated” if the US slowed further. But as China’s biggest export market is the European Union, Beijing clearly still believes in contamination.So this week’s traditional start to the US holiday shopping season may prove to be a defining moment – if not for its economic significance, then for its effect on market sentiment.Unfortunately, the run-up to Black Friday – the day after Thanksgiving when retailers’ ledgers are supposed to show a good profit – has not been propitious. A few days ago, retailers JC Penney and Kohl’s delivered disappointing results, while Starbucks noted its first quarterly fall in customer traffic at its US outlets.The fear is that if consumers prove reluctant to shop during the festive season, they really are suffering.Thus, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for November, to be released on Wednesday, is rich with promise for traders.Investors from Wall Street to Shanghai will be hoping shoppers are as pumped up as the balloons in the Macy’s Thanksgiving parade.
882;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Weak data and FedEx raise fear of slowdown;;Investor worries about a US economic slowdown deepened on Friday after reports that industrial production had dropped unexpectedly and FedEx, a bellwether of economic activity, issued its second profit warning in two months.Weak industrial figures for October and meagre demand for freight on the part of FedEx customers raised fears that global economic growth and the weak dollar would not be enough to offset plunging house prices and waning US consumer confidence.“The key lesson from today’s weak manufacturing figures is that strong export growth is insufficient to prevent the manufacturing sector from slowing down in the face of domestic headwinds,” Nigel Gault, US economist at Global Insight, wrote in a note to clients.The poor news came a day after sluggish results from Starbucks and retailers JC Penney and Kohl’s suggested housing woes were affecting consumers.US industrial production fell 0.5 per cent in October, the biggest decline since the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the Federal Reserve said. The fall confounded economists’ expectations for a rise of 0.1 per cent.FedEx added to the gloom by slashing its forecast for the quarter to the end of November. FedEx linked the downgrade to rising fuel costs and “weak” demand for smaller, urgent shipments between businesses.Shares in FedEx, which had cut its full-year earnings forecast in September, fell 4.5 per cent. Starbucks shares lost 3.9 per cent to close at a 52-week low.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.15 per cent at 13,090.38 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.03 per cent at 2,617.79.Starbucks reported its first decline in customer traffic in its US stores after the market closed on Thursday. Although fourth quarter earnings rose 35 per cent the company lowered the upper end of its fiscal 2008 guidance and the stock was down 8.6 per cent at $22.02.Shares in FedEx slid 4.1 per cent at $97.19 after it cut its second quarter earnings outlook citing the impact of higher fuel costs. Robert Baird downgraded the stock from outperform to neutral. The Dow transport index was down 1.6 per cent at 4564.85.Advanced Micro Devices rose 0.4 per cent at $12.75 after Abu Dhabi-based Mubadala Development took an 8.1 per cent stake.Cisco Systems rose 1.9 per cent at $29.85 after the company raised its share buyback programme by as much as $10bn, or 6 per cent of shares outstanding.Hewlett-Packard was up 1.9 per cent at $49.84 after Morgan Stanley raised the stock to an ”overweight” from ”equal weight.”In economic news, foreign investors continued to remain cautious about investing in US markets. Net acquisition of long term securities by foreigners was $5.8bn in September but total net flows were -$14.7bn. The figure is an improvement on August, when capital outflows were In August outflows were $150.7bn, revised from $163bn.Meanwhile US industrial production fell for the first time in five months, down 0.5 per cent in October. Economists were expecting a small increase.Jan Hatzius, economist at Goldman Sachs said total credit losses linked to the housing slump could reach $400bn which would have a “dramatic” impact on leveraged investors.“If leveraged investors see $200 billion of the $400bn aggregate credit loss, they might need to scale back their lending by $2 trillion,” he said.Treasury bond prices were weaker after a sharp rally on Thursday. The yield on the two-year Treasury note was up 2 basis points at 3.34 per cent, after a decline from 3.51 per cent on Thursday.“The looming year-end and the increasing pace and threat of mortgage debt downgrades has the Treasury market on the run again,” said William O’Donnell, strategist at UBS. “It’s becoming more clear that the tentacles of the crushing weight of the housing recession are spreading and gaining a tighter grip on the financial markets globally.”Interest rate futures fully price a cut in the Federal funds rate to 4.25 per cent from 4.50 per cent in December.But Randall Kroszner, Federal Reserve governor, said on Friday that policy makers were unlikely to cut interest rates further.“The current stance of monetary policy should help the economy get through the rough patch during the next year, with growth then likely to return to its longer-run sustainable rate,’’ he said in a speech in New York.European stocks were lower ahead of the open on Wall Street. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index was down 0.4 per cent and in London the FTSE 100 was also down 0.4 per cent. Asian equity markets closed lower after Wall Street’s losses on Thursday.

Production undershot economists’ expectations of a 0.1 per cent rise. Last month industrial output rose 0.2 per cent.The largest decline in production came in utilities, following an unusually mild October that eased demand for gas. But consumer goods also showed a sizeable decrease in production, indicating that the worst US housing slump in 16 years and the credit squeeze could be spilling over into the manufacturing industry. Construction, mining and manufacturing output were also lower.Capacity utilisation, which is a measure of the proportion of factories in use, fell to 81.7 per cent from 82.2 per cent.“Production was weak across almost all major sectors in October, a broadly based decline that indicates a weakening economy,” said Nigel Gault, US economist at Global Insight.The weak figures came as a series of other signals have pointed to a downturn in the economy.Fedex, the delivery and logistics company viewed as a bellwether of the US economy, issued its second profit warning in two months on Friday as it highlighted falling demand for shipments of freight.It was just the latest company to cut its profit outlook because of fears over the US economy.Starbucks said on Thursday that the number of people coming into its stores had fallen for the first time ever, while JC Penney warned that the state of the economy was hitting consumer’s wallets.The worrying signs in retail were complemented by softer weekly jobless figures on Thursday, which showed more people applied for unemployment benefit than expected.“The very definition of recession is a decline in both employment and production, both of which could well be either under way or at risk of occurring in the first quarter of next year,” said Tony Crescenzi, an economist at Miller Tabak.Industrial production may receive a boost from the weak dollar, currently at a record low, which has helped spur international demands for US goods.Stocks fell, yields on Treasuries rose and the dollar fell after the release of the figures.The growing signs of weakness put pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates further at their next rate-setting meeting. But the Fed is worried that inflation, which on Thursday rose sharply because of higher energy and food costs, still poses a risk.
885;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks stirs concerns over economy;;"Shares in Starbucks slumped after the café chain on Thursday stirred concerns about the health of the US economy when it reported its first quarterly fall in traffic at its US stores and announced plans for its first television advertising campaign.The planned holiday season advertising comes as Starbucks acknowledged that its supposedly “recession proof” sales of frappuccinos and flavoured latte drinks were feeling the impact of broader slowdown in US consumer spending.Shares in Starbucks fell 8.6 per cent at $22.02. The company’s shares are now down 38 per cent this year.Announcing fourth-quarter results, Jim Donald, chief executive officer, said the company was “seeing this pushback that other retailers have described’’ and that a July price increase of about 9 cents a cup in the US had also hurt traffic.In another indicator of consumer strain, two mainstream US retailers, JC Penney and Kohl’s, on Thursday blamed economic concerns for disappointing quarterly results, and lowered forecasts for the holiday quarter.The world’s biggest coffee shop chain reported a 35 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings, with net income for the quarter of $158.5m, or 21 cents per share. Revenues increased 22 per cent to $2.4bn.However, its US per store transactions fell by 1 per cent during the third quarter although the average transaction value increased by 5 per cent.It cited weak consumer spending for its forecasts of 2008 earnings below many Wall Street estimates. It predicted comparable-store sales growth for 2008 of 3 per cent to 5 per cent, against its long-term targeted range of
3 to 7 per cent.Starbucks opened 1,065 stores during the last year. It said it would open 100 fewer US stores in 2008, in “a pause” in continued growth.Its shares fell 8 per cent to $22.10 in after-hours trading."
886;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.

Yesterday the chancellor hosted a working breakfast for over-privileged oldsters.The pride of the financial services industry trooped into Downing Street yesterday morning for their twice-yearly “high-level” whinge-athon with the chancellor. Some churlish types have voiced doubts about the value of this meeting but such events are hugely therapeutic for an outsider class in society that can struggle to give vent to its feelings.Thanks to Mr Darling these often isolated and frequently derided figures are given an opportunity – over Alpen and pain au chocolat – to express themselves in a way that others in society take for granted, but that is denied to corporate titans.They may be rich and successful but do they ever get to sit in the staff canteen bitching like normal people?Now, thanks to Mr Darling, they can sit around a table grumbling about Heathrow airport, the Financial Services Authority, the number of roadworks in the capital, the queues in Starbucks and the quality of the coffee in the third-floor vending machines.

The FT has been offered an early draft of his thinking. “Prison can be jolly inconvenient. There is a general lack of privacy and it is often hard to get anything done.“Arms deals, for example, are highly sensitive yet there are few places where one can meet discreetly to order a consignment of, say, Stanley knives. The latrines may be free but do not present a good corporate image.“There are very few places to entertain guests. The visiting rooms are drab and charmless. Uplights, some Chesterfield couches and a bar would do wonders for the ambience.“Entertaining is a challenge. A chap may wish to hold an evening soirée or dinner party. But it is hard to achieve the right atmosphere with a 9pm lights out. Lock-up makes such gatherings ever harder. Surely we can take a chap at his word if he says he will return to his cell after the cheese plate. There is no need to treat people like criminals. It is also very hard to get the quality of ingredients a good host needs. The quality of prison victuals is truly shocking.

888;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-10-31T19:14:54Z;Milk costs;;Record-high dairy prices have eaten into margins at companies whose products list dairy as a primary ingredient. The US has stepped up production to counteract supply shocks in Europe and Australia, and prices should ease next year. But milk future prices suggest that the timetable for relief is moving further into 2008, as accelerating demand continues to overwhelm supply.Global population growth and booming consumption in developing countries have strengthened demand for dairy products. But European Union exports have dropped sharply in recent years because of cuts in farmer subsidies and stronger local demand. Droughts have shrunk Australia’s surplus, and production costs have risen worldwide as a result of higher fuel, fertiliser and cattle feed prices. Exports from the US, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Ukraine have only barely offset these declines elsewhere, according to Rabobank. And once-huge stockpiles of butter and dry milk powder in the EU and US are gone.Costs have spiked for most commodities, but dairy has led the charge. November prices for the type of milk used to make cheese are up 85 per cent from a year ago, while yoghurt milk is up 141 per cent and skimmed milk powder 155 per cent. High input costs are pressuring margins at chocolate-makers Hershey, Nestlé and Cadbury Schweppes, yoghurt-makers General Mills and Danone, and Domino’s and Starbucks. Kraft on Wednesday blamed soaring dairy costs when it reported a 20 per cent drop in third-quarter profits.Most dairy-dependent companies have responded by raising prices, and consumers have so far accepted costlier KitKats and Kraft cheese slices. But if global dairy demand continues to accelerate, prices may not soften as much as forecast – and foodmakers may have limited headroom for further price rises.
889;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-10-30T07:28:10Z;Strangely winning ways;;It was not the kind of Valentine’s Day greeting Jim Donald would have been hoping for. On February 14 this year the Starbucks chief executive received a startling memorandum from Howard Schultz, company chairman and chief global strategist.In recent years, Mr Schultz wrote, the company had made “a series of decisions that, in retrospect, have led to the watering down of the Starbucks experience and what some might call the commoditisation of our brand …Some people even call our stores sterile, ‘cookie-cutter’, no longer reflecting the passion our partners feel about our coffee,” he went on.Above all, Mr Schultz mourned the loss of “the passion that we all have for the true Starbucks experience”. Just like the Righteous Brothers in their classic 1965 hit, Mr Schultz looked at his company and declared: “You’ve lost that loving feeling.”Strategy gurus tell us that businesses have to differentiate themselves in the market if they want to achieve a competitive advantage over their rivals. Customers will not be interested in a “me-too” experience that offers nothing not already available at a similar (or better) price from another well-established player.A superior product or service may help you pull away from the pack for a limited period of time. But products and services can and will be copied sooner or later.Much harder to imitate is the unique culture your organisation possesses. So, far from “benchmarking” yourself against your competitors’ best practices and formalising the way you do things to eliminate quirks and eccentricities, maybe you should be heading in precisely the opposite direction. Accentuate your differences, even to the point of becoming a little bit weird.This is the intriguing argument put forward by Dan Cable, professor of management at the Kenan-Flagler business school at the University of North Carolina. His new book, Change to Strange – Create a Great Organisation by Building a Strange Workforce, is, appropriately enough, one of the more unexpected business primers you could ever wish to read. “If you want to stand out above your competitors, you can’t just be ‘normal’,” he declares in the preface.Consider Ikea. Until recently, you could not buy anything from Ikea online. Instead, you had to join all the other pilgrims on the trek to the out-of-town store. Ikea didn’t just make life difficult for its competitors with its ultra-tight pricing and simple yet pleasing designs. It actually made life difficult for its customers too. You had to really want to shop there to put up with the compulsory round-the-store trudge and the indignity of the frequent calf-and-ankle-shattering trolley collisions.Ikea is strange. It pursues its design vision in an extreme and uncompromising way. But it has an intensely loyal following. The line between culture and cult has been deliberately blurred. And the company reaps the rewards.If the Swedish furniture giant feels like a particularly unusual example of strangeness that has limited relevance for more mainstream businesses, perhaps the story of General Electric’s aero-engine mechanics will be more persuasive.Yes, GE, that performance-focused, Six Sigma-ed home to order and normality in fact boasts elite engineering teams of dazzling strangeness. Who would have thought that the company Jack Welch built would contain self-managed teams, with rotating leadership roles and an ethos of consensus-building? But during the aerospace industry recession of 2001-03, GE’s plant in Durham, North Carolina, remained profitable and did not have to lay off a single employee. How strange.How can you capture and inculcate this sort of productive strangeness? Picture a hot dog eating contest, Prof Cable suggests. The winner is not usually the fattest person but someone who “executes a process like a machine”, he says. “The devotion to the craft is sort of unparalleled …it inspires awe. ‘That dude is strange,’ you say, but you also find yourself impressed and intrigued. And sure as hell unwilling to imitate it.”The trick, Prof Cable says, is to find your organisation’s equivalent of a hot dog eating contest. “What strange activity is it that you and your workforce have mastered better than anybody else? What can you create in your market that inspires incredulity in both your customers and your competitors?” Sure, this is not normal behaviour. It is obsessive. But it will set you apart – and be hard for rivals to copy.“It’s not about the coffee,” declares a new book to be published early next year, written by former Starbucks president Howard Behar. Exactly: it’s about a healthily obsessive state of mind, a commitment to doing something differently from and better than everybody else.Starbucks grew from being a US-based company with 1,000 stores to a global monster with more than 13,000. It became much more efficient. But, according to Mr Schultz, important things got lost on the way: the aroma of coffee, for example, and the sight of staff scooping coffee beans and pouring them into grinders with nice shiny dispensers. “Some stores don’t have coffee grinders, French presses [cafetières] from Bodum, or even coffee filters,” he complained in his memo.Strange. And yet, at the same time, not nearly strange enough.stefan.stern@ft.comRead and post comments online at www.ft.com/stern
890;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-10-25T05:27:26Z;Cains Beer Company: Brothers’ brew for success;;“Liverpool in a pint” is the promise of Cains, the city’s venerable brewer – and those pints, like the city itself, come in many different flavours. From lagers to milds and bitters through a monthly rotation of seasonal beers, aficionados of Cains’ award-winning ales have been given plenty of choice by Sudarghara and Ajmail Dusanj, who bought the company in 2002.The brothers’ story is one of the more unusual in the UK drinks industry and makes Cains stand out among its peer group of small family brewers. Sudarghara, 42, and Ajmail, 40, came to Liverpool and to brewing via a circuitous route – starting their entrepreneurial careers by expanding the family string of fish and chip shops in Kent, southern England, before taking over a drinks distributor in the Midlands. Before they bought Cains, Sudarghara admits, they did not even like ale: “We were lager and lime drinkers,” he says.Cains was founded in 1850 and the brewery, on a 10-acre site near Liverpool’s Anglican cathedral, went through many hands before the Dusanj brothers bought it for £3.4m from a Danish company. Subsequently they have given a much stronger image to the brewery’s branded output and have cemented loyalty within the city by becoming the “official beer” of the city’s 2008 Capital of Culture year.The brothers have also substantially increased the volume of brewing and canning that Cains does for third parties, including other brewers and supermarket chains. Employment at the brewery has increased from 56 to about 100.The next stage of the brothers’ strategy for Cains became evident in June when they used it as a vehicle for a reverse takeover of Honeycombe Leisure, a publicly-quoted regional pub chain.As a result the renamed Cains Beer Company now has 950 staff, a stock-market listing – one of relatively few quoted companies left in Liverpool – and an estate of more than 100 pubs that are selling Cains beer. The chairman of the company is Roy Morris, a well-known business leader on Merseyside and former chief executive of Rathbone Brothers.For many years in the UK such vertical integration was discouraged by competition authorities, leading many bigger brewers to dispose of their pubs. But rules have been relaxed and integrated brewing has come back into fashion. Cains remains a small force but Sudarghara, chief executive, says “the timing is fantastic” and has ambitions to expand to 1,000 pub outlets within five years.First the brothers have to show that they can turn round the newly acquired pub chain, which was underperforming. They plan to do so with retailers’ attention to detail and an aggressive rebranding of many pubs. Mr Dusanj expresses admiration for outlets such as Starbucks or the Loch Fyne group of restaurants, linking good produce to a strong brand. “We are going to be loud about [the pubs] being owned by a brewery,” he says.The brothers and their families and parents have moved en masse to Cheshire and Sudarghara says Liverpool, with an entrepreneurial history, is a good place to do business. “If we were in any other city in the UK I do not believe we would have been the main sponsor of the biggest event in Liverpool’s history. The response we have received has been brilliant,” he says.
891;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Hershey share price drop leaves bitter taste;;For the Hershey Trust, the largest shareholder in American chocolate-making legend Hershey, Thursday’s share price drop was the latest in a run of bad news.This month, the trust complained that its assets had lost more than $1bn in market value, due to Hershey “underperforming both the market and its own stated expectations”.With the trust holding about 30 per cent of Hershey’s shares, the fall on Thursday of 4 per cent in the company’s share price will have reduced the market asset value of its investment by well over $100m.Richard Lenny, chief executive, is stepping down in December, after a tense relationship with the trust, signalling a new period of upheaval five years after the company was forced to abandon a proposed sale of the company to Wrigley, the rival confectioner, amid intense local opposition to a deal in Hershey’s home state of Pennsylvania.The trust’s unease about the way Hershey is being run led to renewed speculation about a possible tie-up with Cadbury, the UK confectioner, with which the trust is understood to have held talks this year.But the statement from LeRoy Zimmerman, its chairman, also highlighted its dependence on the fortunes of the company in which it has invested more than half of its assets.The trust was set up to fund the workings of a charitable school established in 1909 by Milton Hershey, the company founder, in the town that also bears his surname. It controls about 80 per cent of the voting rights in Hershey.In 2005, according to a legal study of the trust by Robert Sitkoff, of Harvard Law School, and Jonathan Klick, of Florida State University, 54 per cent of the trust’s $8.7bn assets were invested in the company, which accounted for 43 per cent of its annual revenues.In a paper to be published in the Columbia Law Review in spring, Mr Sitkoff and Mr Klick argue that the failure of the 2002 sale “destroyed roughly $2.7bn in shareholder wealth”, based on the increase in the value of its shares prior to the breakdown of the 2002 deal.They also argue that lack of a more diversified investment strategy has damaged the trust’s principle objective of funding the Milton Hershey School.Mr Sitkoff, an expert on the law covering charitable trusts, argues that the trust’s failure to diversify its investments – which was one of the objectives of the planned 2002 sale – runs counter to legal principles agreed for US states under the Uniform Prudent Investor Act of 1994.“Outside of Pennsylvania I believe that the trust’s controlling interest …would be not only not wise, but probably not legal,” he says.A 1999 Pennsylvania statute had exempted the Hershey trust from any duty to diversify its investments. After the failure of the 2002 sale, the state passed additional legislation requiring a trust to take into account “the special relationship” and the “economic impact” of any business asset sale “on the community”.That move reflected the intense politics surrounding the 2002 sale, which was abandoned after Michael Fisher, the state’s Republican attorney-general, who had reportedly previously advocated divestment, decided to oppose any deal.Mr Zimmerman, a former state attorney-general, argued last week that the trust’s “resolve to retain its controlling interest” was “an obligation both of our stewardship, and of Pennsylvania law”.Mr Sitkoff points out that trust documents do not stipulate how its assets – which are surpassed by only five US university trusts – are to be invested.He also argues there are questions about whether the trust should benefit from federal tax exemptions when its primary duty to maximise returns for the school are subordinated to the political concerns of the local community. “Preserving local control of the company is not a charitable activity that merits the federal tax exemptions,” he argues.Mr Zimmerman seems unlikely to face much dissent within the trust’s board over the commitment to the Hershey stake.All seven of the trust board members who voted for the Wrigley deal were removed after it failed, and the 17-member board was shrunk to 11, which include the CEO of Hershey. Among the other 10 board members, six have strong ties with the school or state and four of those live close to Hershey.Chocolate maker to raise the bar on marketingHershey said on Thursday it planned to increase marketing and promotional spending as it announced a fall in third-quarter sales and profits, and lowered its earnings forecast for the year, writes Jonathan Birchall in New York.The company also said its efforts to gain market share through its “limited edition” products, such as Hershey’s Kisses with chocolate truffle, had faltered, and that it was seeking “more sustainable” product development.Hershey also pledged to expand further into the rapidly growing premium chocolate sector, following a new partnership to make premium chocolate for Starbucks, and the launch last year of its new Cacao Reserve brand.Hershey’s earnings for the third quarter fell 66 per cent to $62.8m, or 27 cents per diluted share, and included a pre-tax charge of $151.9m associated with the restructuring of its factory base and the building of a new facility in Mexico.Hershey’s shares closed down 2.8 per cent at $43.05 in New York.
892;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-10-14T17:51:48Z;Price of coffee jumps to 10-year high;;Coffee prices have surged to a 10-year high, pushed by fears that a drought in Brazil, the world’s largest producer, might halve its crop for the second year in a row and concerns about the Vietnamese harvest.Néstor Osorio, executive director of the International Coffee Organisation, said the coffee market remained “tight, with low stocks” after recent poor harvests.“Brazil is suffering from lack of rain.”Mr Osorio added that there were concerns about coffee quality in Vietnam, the world’s second-largest producer.Brazil’s coffee output fell 23 per cent this season to 32.6m bags, cutting global production to 114m bags, almost 6 per cent lower than the previous season.The lower production comes as coffee enjoys a period of demand growth in developed countries, spurred by the consumption habits of younger people after strong marketing efforts by coffee chains such as Starbucks.In the past five years coffee demand has increased 8 per cent in the US and almost 6 per cent in Europe.In the UK, where per capita consumption has been historically lower, coffee demand jumped 35 per cent between 2002 and 2006.Traders said the price direction would depend on Brazil’s rains. If the drought persisted, Arabica coffee might jump above $2 a pound. But if it rained, prices would drop towards $1 a pound.The price movement in London was amplified by fears of a speculative market squeeze.Nestlé, owner of the Nescafé brand and the world’s biggest buyer of raw coffee beans, has been increasing its coffee prices globally, while Procter & Gamble, which owns the Folgers brand, put up prices at the start of the year.Additional reporting by Jenny Wiggins in London
893;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-10-12T18:07:29Z;Counterfeiting in China;;After serving for at least two decades as the world’s favourite manufacturer of cheap goods, China is struggling to upgrade itself into an “innovation society”. But innovation does not always lead to profits. In a country where low prices matter more to consumers than brands or quality, counterfeiting runs rampant and enforcement of intellectual property rights is toothless.Some enterprising counterfeiters in China refill brand-name perfume or liquor bottles. Others make extra, unauthorised batches of products at contract manufacturing facilities and sell them on the side. China has pledged to enforce its loose piracy laws more aggressively and it is cracking down ahead of the 2008 Olympics. But in a complaint filed with the World Trade Organisation (and backed by Japan, the European Union, Mexico and Australia), the US says China’s inaction costs its businesses billions of dollars a year.The WTO inquiry could result in sanctions but it could also merely stall already slow trade negotiations. Corporate pragmatists are searching for ways to fight IP piggybackers unilaterally but they have limited options. Slim profit margins in China make it hard to justify expensive product design changes that might prevent tampering or copying.Individual lawsuits, though, can be sporadically effective – Starbucks and Ferrero Rocher both won landmark cases against copycats. Many companies with low-grade facilities in China still keep their crown jewels overseas for fear that key processes or designs will be stolen. China’s inadequate IP law enforcement also undermines its own companies, which shirk research and development because of the lack of safeguards.Most foreign businesses, unwilling to leave China, are resorting to patience. As China’s masses are nurtured to middle class status, brand names and higher-quality goods may slowly build cachet. Widely pirated products, including software, could morph into industry standards that generate substantial revenue. And, as its own industries develop, China may finally feel compelled to toughen up its IP protection.
894;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-10-11T19:08:49Z;Music industry changes its tune;;As the music industry struggles to reinvent itself for the digital age, some of its most bankable artists are the ones calling the tune.Madonna this week neared a landmark deal to leave Warner Music, her long-time label, for Live Nation, the concert promoter.The 10-year contract would pay more than $70m in cash and stock advances for albums, tours and merchandise, according to people familiar with its terms. Altogether, it could be worth well over $100m for the Material Girl.To record executives and Wall Street analysts, Madonna’s deal represents either a bold bet or an extravagant one by Live Nation that it can break into the broader music industry. Michael Savner, a Bank of America analyst, noted on Thursday that Madonna would turn 60 in the contract’s last year.What is beyond dispute is that the deal is another indication that the collapse of compact disc sales – long the record companies’ lifeblood – is scrambling the traditional relationships between talent, labels and concert promoters that have governed the industry for decades.“It is inevitable,” Barry Diller, chief executive of IAC, which owns TicketMaster, told investors last month.“The idea that these are going be separate horizontal pots is over.”This week, Radiohead began distributing digital versions of its new album, inviting fans to pay as little or as much as they wanted. The band achieved enormous publicity for the move with no help from any record company’s marketing machine.In recent months, Prince has given away his last album through a UK newspaper to promote concert sales, Paul McCartney has signed with Starbucks, and the Eagles have agreed an exclusive US distribution deal with Wal-Mart.Such artist-driven challenges to record companies’ traditional model seem to be adding new meaning to the term one-man band.Yet the record companies themselves are among those most aggressively deserting the traditional business model.With digital sales failing to make up for double-digit declines in physical sales, labels are now trying to participate in all their artists’ revenue streams – from touring to ringtones and merchandise.Universal Music and Warner have invested in artist management groups, and Sony BMG and EMI have laid out plans to sign more “360-degree deals” with new artists. “The idea is, let’s become a talent developer rather than a CD seller,” Rolf Schmidt-Holtz, chief executive of Sony BMG, told the Financial Times last week.Inevitably, the companies that own such assets are not eager to give them up, and – as with Live Nation – are in turn trying to move closer to artists. But Edgar Bronfman, Warner Music’s chief executive, argues that record companies have an advantage in this clash: their ability to find artists early in their career.“Ticketmaster and Live Nation theoretically, potentially are a competitor, but frankly, we’re seeing artists so much earlier,” he told a conference last month.Warner could strike all-encompassing deals on profitable terms, he said, while the promotion agencies would have to “pay retail”.The Live Nation deal is certainly an indication of the power that established artists enjoy in this new environment.One of its remarkable features, however, is that rights to Madonna’s catalogue will remain with Warner. Without these, Live Nation’s deal may not make economic sense.Warner may be losing one of its biggest artists, Mr Savner of Bank of America said on Thursday, but “the bigger risk, in our view, would be to overpay for an artist that does not seem to be generating the revenue to support the contract being discussed”.There have been similar fears about the balance of power between music companies and artists before. In 1992, Madonna set up her own record label, Maverick, following the example of artists such as U2 and Led Zeppelin.None made a dent in the power of the music majors, however, and Madonna was bought out of Maverick by Warner in 2004.“They’re no better at doing business than record executives are at singing,” one seasoned industry member said on Thursday.Analysts believe that only the world’s biggest acts can afford to go solo and note that few of these are turning their backs on the industry altogether.Radiohead is in talks with the major labels and independents to market the CD it intends to issue in January, and the Eagles have turned to Universal for their distribution needs outside the US.Music executives are still irked by such initiatives, however, noting that only the investment they have made allows established artists to go it alone. “Ours is the seed capital that really makes an artist’s brand,” Mr Bronfman commented.For every band “discovered” on MySpace, thousands of undiscovered talents still struggle. The vast majority of artists still need labels to break them and then promote them. But if Live Nation’s gamble pays off, then it may be a concert promoter or ticket vendor that grooms – and profits from – a future queen of pop.

896;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-10-05T18:25:02Z;Starbucks loses froth;;After a frenzy of store openings, Starbucks’ US growth prospects are cooling. Growth in footfall has waned and prices have gone up to offset higher dairy, staff and rental costs. New stores are also cannibalising existing units, and the coffee chain has grown more reliant on riskier international growth.Dollars and cents aside, Starbucks also faces strategic questions. Some of its stores have grown cluttered and inefficient, and sales expertise has dwindled as the ranks of baristas have swelled. The company has rightly slowed its growth ambitions and should consider taming them further if it wants to position itself as the best coffee house on the block. In spite of these growing pains, Starbucks still hardly needs to check over its shoulder on its competitors.New coffees at Dunkin’ Donuts and McDonalds have won accolades but are pitched at the lower end of the market. Starbucks’ recent price increases may repel a few customers and a $4.50 latte will become harder to justify if the US economy stumbles. But, even then, many Starbucks devotees are expected to stay loyal to the small, high-margin luxuries it peddles. To hedge its bets, Starbucks has also expanded its ready-to-drink coffee venture with Pepsi and joined with Kraft to sell individual coffee pods for home machines.After slumping by one third in the past year, the company’s shares trade at about 25 times estimated 2008 earnings. Forecasts for earnings growth of at least 20 per cent next year help justify a premium to the market. But Starbucks is under pressure to turn its international business, which now accounts for just 10-15 per cent of operating profit, into its growth engine. The rapid roll-out will be bumpy and international margins – still only half those in the US – must improve. With plans to treble the global store count still intact, Starbucks’ executives could probably use a cup of coffee.
897;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-10-03T07:26:02Z;McDonald’s: Le Big Mac at home in land of slow food;;France is probably not a country one would associate with a booming trade in Big Macs. After all, this is a nation known for its love of good food and wine. It is also here that a group of sheep farmers led by José Bové became overnight folk heroes after dismantling a McDonald’s in the south of France eight years ago.Such is the Gallic resentment of the US fast food chain that the country’s influential daily Le Monde once warned that McDonald’s “commercial hegemony threatens agriculture and [its] cultural hegemony insidiously ruins alimentary behaviour – sacred reflections of French identity”. Yet nationalist rhetoric has done little to stem the growth of McDo, as the Golden Arches are referred to in France.The country is now McDonald’s most profitable subsidiary in Europe, with 2006 sales hitting €2.7bn ($3.8bn). That is a 9.8 per cent increase from the year before and is nearly twice the sales growth seen in the US during the same period.Having opened 29 restaurants – or 4 per cent of the chain’s new outlets worldwide – last year, the group has 1,085 in France. Together, they accounted for 31.5 per cent of total operational profit made in Europe, ahead of the UK and Germany.For Jean-Pierre Petit, chief executive of McDonald’s France, its success in the land of simmering cassoulets and slow food can be attributed to a combination of social changes – such as the rise of the two-income family – shrewd branding and sheer luck. “Luck because we are in a market where there are relatively few other fast food chains,” he says.While the growing number of working parents has contributed to the need to eat in a hurry, Mr Petit says the group’s strategy of positioning itself as a casual diner rather than a fast food restaurant has been important.Under Denis Hennequin, Mr Petit’s predecessor who is now head of McDonald’s Europe, McDonald’s France established a design studio in Paris during the 1990s and started spending money creating more congenial and sophisticated environments in its restaurants.In place of the bright fluorescent lights and tacky bolted-down plastic yellow and white furniture that have become ubiquitous fixtures in the US, visitors to McDonald’s in France find low lampshades, wooden tables, upholstered seating and (imitation) leather banquettes.Some have TV screens, internet connections and iPod stations. There is not a single Ronald McDonald in sight. In a company that made its fortunes from standardisation and cost cutting, Mr Hennequin’s strategy for McDonald’s France was revolutionary.But the gamble paid off and the result is that the typical French consumer spends €9.47 per visit, about twice that spent in the US.“French people want quick, affordable food but they also want to be able to sit down and eat a hot meal,” says Mr Petit. “At the moment, between expensive sit-down bistros where you will spend €20 on lunch and a cold sandwich from the boulangerie, there’s not a lot of choices in between,” he adds. “By creating a pleasant environment where customers can stay and enjoy a full meal, we are filling in that gap.”US executives were so taken with the result that some of them have begun to launch the US’s own redesign plan while Mr Hennequin was asked do the same in Europe.Other chains such as KFC have now moved to overhaul the interiors of its French outlets.The menu has also been fine-tuned to cater to local palates. While Big Macs and French fries remain standard fare, the group has added items such as the Croque McDo, its take on the croque monsieur grilled emmental cheese and ham sandwich, to its offerings. French fries are served with mayonnaise, espresso comes with a piece of chocolate and French pastries such as lemon tartelettes and flan are de rigueur at its Starbucks-like McCafés.But operating in France has not been without difficulties. In a country of a 35-hour work week, 20 per cent value-added tax and strict labour laws, McDonald’s France had its fair share of run-ins with labour unions. Workers at one McDonald’s in Paris went on strike for 112 days to protest against their working conditions.The need to show McDonald’s supports French farmers and workers became only more urgent following Mr Bové’s protest in 1999. The incident prompted the group to begin a large advertising campaign listing how many French cows, chickens, potatoes and heads of lettuce it used each year.It also started running an “open doors” programme where customers are invited to take tours of its kitchens and meet with suppliers.The campaign appears to be working.Today cash registers at McDonald’s France are ringing up 1m sales a day.
898;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-09-27T20:23:51Z;Wall St higher despite poor housing data;;"Wall Street shrugged off a sluggish start to close higher on Thursday after some poor data on new home sales had weighed on sentiment.The S&P 500 ended the session 0.4 per cent higher at 1,531.15. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3 per cent at 2,708.12 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent at 13,911.80, within 0.6 per cent of its all-time high.Stocks were earlier depressed by a fresh blow to the housing market as new home sales dropped to their lowest level in seven years.New-build sales fell 8.3 per cent in August to 795,000. Analysts had anticipated a
5 per cent decline. New home sales have fallen 21 per cent in the last year.The median home sale value fell 7.5 per cent from $246,200 to $225,000, its lowest since January 2005. There were 1.5 per cent fewer homes on the market, but they are taking longer to sell. The inventory of unsold new homes would take 8.2 months to clear at the current pace of sales, the longest since March.“Homebuilders have engaged in some aggressive price cuts to try to move their bloated inventories, and this showed up in a plunge in average prices,” economists at Morgan Stanley noted. “Inventories will need to be brought down into the five- to six-month range to restore some balance to the market.”The S&P homebuilders index rallied in afternoon trade to close 2.2 per cent higher at 410.64 but is down around 10 per cent over the past week.KB Home underscored problems in the housing market after it swung to a third-quarter loss. In the three months to August 31, KB fell to a $35.6m loss, compared with a profit of $153.2m in the same period last year. The shares also rallied to close 2.6 per cent higher at $24.71.Moody’s and McGraw-Hill, owner of S&P, saw big gains , up 6.3 at $50.37 and 4.8 per cent at $52.09 respectively, after the credit rating agencies convincingly answered questions before the Senate banking committee about their role in the sub-prime mortgage crisis.Elsewhere stocks remained buoyant, reflecting investors’ expectations of further rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.On Thursday the futures market was predicting an 88 per cent likelihood of a 25 basis point cut at the end of next month. That has placed a floor under the market, say traders. The rebound in stocks in the past week has caught some bearish investors offguard, and as the end of the month and the quarter looms, money managers are boosting their exposure to equities. “Some funds that were behind are now putting money to work,” said Anthony Conroy, managing director at BNYConvergex Group.In other economic news weekly jobless claims fell 15,000 to 298,0000, the lowest level since May 12 and much better than the 315,000 reading expected by economists.The latest estimate of gross domestic product for the second quarter showed the economy grew at a 3.8 per cent annual rate. That was weaker than the previously reported 4 per cent rise in growth, although the downward revision was expected by investors.Inflation measures were a touch higher, with the price index for personal consumption up 4.3 per cent versus the prior estimate of a 4.2 per cent rise and a gain of 3.5 per cent during the first quarter. The core PCE, a gauge that excludes food and energy, rose 1.4 per cent, higher than a prior reading of 1.3 per cent.Insurance stocks saw gains on Thursday after an analyst at Goldman Sachs raised his third-quarter profit estimates on the sector citing a mild hurricane season.Among the leading 10 sectors on the S&P 500, energy, materials, technology and industrials once again dominated advances.Equity investors are pursuing stocks with international exposure, traders say, as the dollar again fell to a record low against a basket of currencies.The S&P materials index climbed 1 per cent to 261.79. It has gained around 17 per cent since the credit squeeze hit in August. Energy stocks also saw late gains after crude oil jumped $2.58 to $82.88.Caterpillar, up 1.1 per cent at $77.47, and Alcoa, 1.4 per cent higher at $39.00, led gains on the Dow. Starbucks fell 2.6 per cent to $26.78 after an analyst at Banc of America cut his rating on the stock."
899;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-09-21T19:47:38Z;Johnson bookmarks Borders;;Luke Johnson, whose office is lined with books, says he is “passionate” about books.Which is just as well since Friday his private equity group’s purchase of Borders’ operations in the UK and Ireland made him the UK’s third-largest book retailer.At an initial price of £10m in cash with a further £10m depending on future performance, analysts say Risk Capital Partners has a good chance of making a success of the business despite the difficult circumstances faced by the industry.Intensifying competition from supermarkets and internet retailers such as Amazon, as well as from other high street booksellers, has resulted in falling profits.Waterstone’s and WH Smith are the leading operators, with 21 per cent and 15 per cent of the market respectively.Borders, the US-based bookseller, faces similar pressures in its home market. Freddie George, retail analyst at Evolution Securities, said the US group was to sell its UK operation because it lacked critical mass. However, it is to retain a 17 per cent stake and control over the in-store Starbucks and Paperchase concessions.“The stores are mostly well-invested with new outlets in excellent locations,” said Mr Johnson. “Borders and Books etc saw about 30m customer visits last year with an average dwell-time of an hour.”Mr Johnson is renowned for developing restaurant chains such as Pizza Express and Giraffe into strong brands but, the son of historian and journalist Paul Johnson, he has a longstanding love of books.“I am passionate about books and have faith in the prospects for the industry,” said Mr Johnson. “I am a believer in experiential shopping and with its depth and range Borders should be the real book lover’s first port of call.”He said he had been studying the industry for several years. Five years ago, he added, he had investigated the possibility of buying Waterstone’s before it was bought by HMV.Risk Capital, which he funds with three partners – Mark Farrer-Brown, Ben Redmond and Bobby Hashemi – also runs the GRA (Greyhound Racing Association), Patisserie Valerie, Public Recruitment Group and East, the women’s fashion retailer.Mr Johnson denied Borders would be promoting his recently published title, The Maverick.
900;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-09-18T10:56:57Z;Societies under the magnifying glass;;Margaret Mead, the anthropologist, once said: “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has.” It is a truism of modern politics that one person who feels strongly about something has far greater influence on what happens than the 10 people who mildly disagree.In Microtrends, Mark Penn, one of the US’s foremost political consultants and architect of Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid, takes this axiom to imaginative new levels. Sometimes compared to Karl Rove, George W. Bush’s “boy genius”, whose brilliant microtargeting made all the difference in the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections, Penn comes from a more esoteric background.Whereas Rove’s resumé is about winning elections for Republicans (again and again, until recently), Penn has offered his services to multinational corporations and foreign political parties, not all of them ideological bedfellows. Alongside Tony Blair, whose letter of thanks is proudly framed on Penn’s office wall, he has worked for Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia – hardly the Italian counterpart of Penn’s Democratic party.Thus Penn is as much a business consultant as he is a political junkie – a symbiosis that helps explain why so much of his book is so original. Penn’s thesis is that change in today’s world is driven by small trends that are started below the radar and which creep up on us unexpectedly. The era of megatrends belonged to the Ford economy, which offered mass produce and limited choice. Today’s world is characterised by Starbucks which offers hundreds of potential combinations to its finicky customers. To take liberty with Penn’s analogy, forget the 50 per cent who order straight lattes. Focus instead on that small group of fanatics who insist on a hazelnut dusting with their skinny doppio machiattos.A more vital analogy might be to contrast the cold war with today. In today’s world it does not matter as much as it used to how many men Russia has in uniform. Dwell instead on those small groups of radicals who are scouring the internet for new terrorist technologies. For Penn a microtrend becomes significant when it captures 1 per cent of society. “It’s not just that small is the new big,” writes Penn. “It’s that in order to know what is going on, we need better tools than just the naked eye and an eloquent tongue. We need the equivalent of magnifying glasses and microscopes.”Most of the book is an illustration of 75 microtrends that Penn has spotted. Of these at least 40, including the emergence of Protestant Latinos as a decisive swing vote in US politics, the growth of “New Luddites” (the 17 per cent of Americans who have tried and rejected the internet), and “aspiring snipers” (the 1 per cent of American youths who want to become professional marksmen) are wholly counter-intuitive. There are the “young knitters” (the 5.5m young Americans who prefer clicking needles to computer mice), the growth of “cougars” (women who date much younger men), the sun-haters, who Penn believes may become as influential as the anti-smoking lobby (already there is a class action suit by skin cancer sufferers against sun lotion makers) and “pro-Semites” – the four in 10 non-Jewish Americans who would be “very interested” in marrying a Jew.Penn’s range of examples is giddying. But if there were a thread linking up Penn’s warren of mini-societies it would be the growing power and versatility of women in the modern world. Most political consultants already know that 54 per cent of American voters are female. As Penn famously demonstrated when he persuaded Bill Clinton to target “soccer moms” in 1996, women hold the whip-hand in US elections. But how many advertisers know that single women buy more than twice as many homes in the US every year as single men? Or that women outspend men on technology by a factor of three to two? Or that females are now the majority of car-buyers in the US? Not many, to judge by the persistence of testosterone-driven car commercials, which emphasise speed and extreme sports over roominess and practicality (facets that women buyers prize more highly, says Penn).If there is a weakness in Penn’s otherwise riveting book, it is his reluctance to tease out the broader implications of these microtrends, not least for the future of politics. But then again perhaps he does not need to. Or perhaps it is a trade secret. “Women are the majority in law school, the majority in college and the majority of voters,” he writes. And soon – who knows? – one of them may be president.
901;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-09-03T21:05:47Z;Starbucks in coffee link-up with Kraft;;"Starbucks is to start selling its branded coffee through Kraft’s “Tassimo” home
coffee machines as footfall in its US stores slows and Americans return to drinking coffee at home.This is the first time that Starbucks, which has contracted Kraft to distribute
its packaged coffee in supermarkets, has sold coffee under the Starbucks brand name for use in home coffee machines.Food companies such as Kraft and Nestlé have been trying to compete with coffee chains by developing machines that can brew expressos and cappuccinos at home.Total sales of these so-called “pod” systems – the machines use small pods of ground coffee and also take tea and hot chocolate – rose to $99m in 2006 from just $8m in 2001, according to research from Datamonitor and the National Coffee Association.Starbucks, which continues to expand aggressively with 2,400 store openings around the world this year, is starting to find it more difficult to persuade new customers to come into its coffee shops in its home market.Last month, it said traffic through its US stores grew less than 1 per cent in the third quarter, blaming the weakness on lower consumer spending as people went out less.Meanwhile, more Americans are drinking coffee at home today than they were a year ago, suggesting that the popularity of coffee chains may be waning.Some 77 per cent of coffee consumers drink at home today compared with 74 per cent a year ago and 81 per cent in 2001, according to the US National Coffee Association.The agreement between Starbucks and Kraft is likely to be mutually beneficial.Kraft has been trying to improve the quality of coffee it sells to revive declining sales of ground coffee in the US and Europe.It has overhauled its Maxwell House brand, packaging it in new large square plastic containers, and now uses only arabica beans.Mary Beth Stone West, president of Kraft North America Beverages, said: “It’s about reinventing mainstream coffee.”However, the new packaging has already provoked competitor Procter & Gamble to file a lawsuit against Kraft, alleging that the owner of Maxwell House has infringed a patent on the plastic containers in which it sells its Folgers coffee brand.Kraft and Starbucks have also been trying to create a “virtual cafe” experience for consumers in supermarkets by creating special coffee sections that evoke the feel of a coffee shop.The new aisles have been created in some 2,000 supermarkets in the US and Kraft hopes to have them in 4,000 by the end of next year.Wendy Piñero, vice-president of Starbucks’s global consumer products business, said demand was increasing for the company’s “at home” products, which included packaged coffees sold in supermarkets."
902;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-09-03T18:16:20Z;The flipside of disaster and despair;;About 10 years ago I was in an elevator with Chubb Rock, the rapper. Our apartments were next to each other in the hotel we lived in. And that’s the last time I will mention Chubb here, except to say that everything was possible in the 1990s in New York City.Economic growth was oozing out of the sidewalk and seeping into the cafes, onto the backs of napkins in diners, into the offices that were springing out of previously warehouse-ridden areas of the city. Everyone was raising money.But for what? For some of the stupidest ideas you’ve ever heard: portals for left-handed sports lovers, Geocities wannabes, even calendar sites. As an aside, I invested in a calendar site, Yourday.com. It was bought for breakeven (in restricted stock) by Deltathree, a voice-over- internet company, when the stock was at $27. As I write, it is at 84 cents.(As a further aside, there’s the urban rumour that the first online calendar was made by a New York University student in the mid-1990s and was bought by Yahoo in 1996 for $10m. I don’t know if this is true or not). Everything was insane and everyone was on an Indiana Jones-style hunt for the Lost Ark, filled with money.I miss those days. It is rare that the world we live in melds with the land of Oz, where wizards and witches grant immortality, love or wisdom on those they favour. I feel like I squandered that magic, or didn’t quite know what to do with it, and only in brief moments can summon it up again for a spell or two.Is it an age thing? I’m 10 years older after all. Or are the 2000s different, with worry and fear dominating instead of hope and greed?There is nothing wrong with greed. It creates railroads, grows beautiful tulips, builds underwater cables to Europe. But now I hear otherwise smart people tell me the “consumer is dead”.People are worried about “subslime”, in spite of it being 1 per cent of all mortgages. Some people are concerned about “inflation”, in spite of the Commerce Department price gauge being up only 1.9 per cent from a year earlier. Others seem to be worried about “deflation” because housing is going down the drain and people will stop buying fireslate kitchens.What happened to Y2K? That was the worry of the 1990s, while the early 2000s gave us bird flu. The occasional hurricane would rip through, and we could worry about that.But now we have real things to worry about. You’re going to lose your house, for instance. I don’t care that you’ve been making your payments and you have a fixed-rate loan. Turn on the television or read the newspaper for God’s sake. You’re going to lose your house! Wake up!OK, I give up. I’ll be worried also. In fact, I’ll do all of the worrying for all of us. Let’s find some stock plays that can make money from the worries.Let’s be frank. It is hard to get a loan. Five weeks ago you could have called up your bank and said “I have a gun pointed at my head and will shoot unless you lend me $1m.” And it would have given it to you with a 2 per cent adjustable-rate mortgage.Now, everyone I know has suddenly been categorised as subprime. You need 40 per cent down and maybe the rate will be 8 per cent.So if you need money, no problem. Take off your gold-plated watch and go down to your local Cash America pawn shop. They will be happy to loan you the money at a high interest rate. They are like the Starbucks of pawnshops. And by the way, the president of the company just bought $1m shares of stock.Worried about all the distressed debt out there? No problem. Load up on some great investors, such as Leucadia. I have no idea what they are up to, but my guess is they are backing up the truck on distressed debt marked inappropriately at pennies on the dollar, while hedge funds dump that paper.Worried about your power going out in a hurricane if you live on the coast of Florida? I have a solution for you: Clean Harbors makes the gas generators to replace that power. They cleaned up in the 2005 hurricane season and will do so again.Worried about being caught while doing drugs in the workplace? Hedge your bets by investing in Psychemedics, the company that does the drug testing for 10 per cent of the Fortune 500 and pays a 3.5 per cent dividend. They are like the Starbucks of drug testing. And don’t worry, they have paid their dividend for 44 quarters in a row. They won’t miss now.I miss the 1990s. To misappropriate Robert Frost – from what I’ve tasted of desire, I hold with those who favour fire.james@formulacapital.com
903;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-08-27T16:26:57Z;Mocha and music as Starbucks serves up a record label;;The signing earlier this month of James Taylor to Hear Music, the record label owned by Starbucks Entertainment, completes a triumvirate of “heritage” artists that includes Paul McCartney and Joni Mitchell.Hear Music has made a hot start, with McCartney’s Memory Almost Full album, released in June, already boasting global sales of more than 1m. About half of its 500,000 US sales have been in Starbucks stores.As music companies struggle with the economics of declining footfall at retail, Hear Music is an attractive proposition to such veteran acts. A partnership between Starbucks Entertainment and the Beverly Hills-based Concord Music Group, it has far lower overheads than a major label and an umbilical link to its own distribution network: Starbucks’ 13,000 stores worldwide and their 44m customers a week.Mitchell’s Shine album, due for September 24 release, is her first after nearly a decade of disillusionment with the music industry. Her signing may tempt doubters to observe, paraphrasing one of her lyrics, that they paved paradise and put up a coffee shop.But Mitchell’s manager Sam Feldman says both commercial and creative considerations are behind the move. “There are two main ‘added-value’ reasons for doing a deal with Starbucks,” he says. “There’s an initial purchase that’s guaranteed and non-returnable, and an absolute guarantee that your artist will be placed on the counter where people will see, hear and be able to buy the CD instantly.”And Hear Music is not only a home for sixty-something acts. It is also developing such young artists as Brazilian discovery Ceu, whose music has shades of samba and Sade, or “after hours jazz-soul” prospect Sonya Kitchell, from Massachusetts.Hear Music CDs are also racked at traditional music shops, and it has four outlets in the US that the company characterises as music stores first and coffeehouses second.However, UK trade body the Entertainment Retailers Association is ambivalent: “It’s good to see people showing some faith in music retail, because people have been too quick to write it off. But people need to be aware that Starbucks are not in the music business and never will be. They’re in the coffee business and they’re looking to create a marketing halo effect around the brand.”Ken Lombard, president of Starbucks Entertainment, rejects the suggestion that CDs are now a support act to a decaf Frappuccino. “We heard the comments, and frankly from the beginning we made it clear this was not a way we were trying to generate more coffee sales.”Mr Lombard, before joining Starbucks in 2004, was president for 12 years of the urban development company Johnson Development Corporation, owned by former basketball player “Magic” Johnson.“I come in with a tremendous passion for music,” he says, “but an approach that’s going to be fresh and is not tainted by the way the labels have conducted their business.“You cannot have, as your business model, an approach that you can only sign artists you feel can achieve multi-platinum coming out of the gate. You’ve got to figure out a model that allows for profitability if it’s a new artist and you’re going to sell a couple of hundred thousand records.”Mr Feldman agrees. “Majors, for the most part, have been working on a flawed model. They’ve been investing an inordinate amount of money in artists in the hope that some of them will turn into blockbuster commodities.”Is Hear Music another sign of consumers’ disenchantment with the traditional music store? “The record shop used to provide a cultural, tastemaking, browsing and buying experience, but no longer,” says John Benedict, who co-owns the independent label Just Music. “Now, customer attraction is multi-media, multi-faceted and multi-channelled.”Mr Benedict says his label targets the broadest possible audience – for example with its electronica act Honeyroot – via TV, commercial and movie placements, as well as video exposure via YouTube and mobile phones.“The record shop has, in the main, sadly become more blunt instrument than sharp end, and it is reduced to selling what the customer has already decided to buy, at the lowest price possible. It’s our job as a small label to have already created that demand.”Hear Music’s releases are distributed by Universal. Mark Crossingham, of Universal Music Group International and Concord’s general manager in London, says the relationship with Hear Music has started fruitfully. “We sold more copies of the McCartney album outside North America in its first three weeks than his last EMI album has sold in total outside North America.”He says that on his walk to work on the day the album was released, “before I’d even reached the local HMV, I’d passed three branches of Starbucks, all with posters for it in their windows, CDs racked by the till and playing the album”.
904;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-08-26T21:25:12Z;Valuations not written on tablets of solid stone;;Official values in UK commercial property are holding their ground. But equity investors are blowing a raspberry at them.The slide in real estate company values on the stock market has turned into a rout in some cases, with one big stock, Mapeley, down 41 per cent from its peak in April.Valuations in real estate are not infallible. They are carried out in a professional manner by very experienced people, for sure. There is an entire “red book” with strict rules governing how valuations are done.But the resulting numbers are not written on tablets of stone. Instead, they are the best possible result of a rather subjective process.Ultimately, the value of a building is not based on its size, its architecture, its height or its proximity to the nearest Starbucks. Instead, it is a multiple of its rental income.In other words, a building with annual rents of £10m could be worth £50m (yields in Ukraine a couple of years ago were 20 per cent, giving a valuation at a multiple of just five times income). Or it could be worth £200m in the City of London today, where a yield of 5 per cent is typical.When valuers go through a company’s portfolio, totting up the various buildings, they will use “evidence” from recent transactions. If similar properties have just sold at a yield of 4 per cent, that is the crucial figure. You take the rental income from your building, multiply it by 25, and hey presto.The only problem is that buildings sell at different yields depending on who the tenant is, how long they have agreed to stay there and with what type of lease.The £1.1bn HSBC Tower in Canary Wharf sold on a yield of 3.8 per cent in April. The neighbouring £1bn Citigroup headquarters sold on a yield of 4.7 per cent in July.To the untrained eye, that would suggest that office prices on the east London estate had fallen by 24 per cent in only three months. Instead, this was as much down to differences in the lease structures on the two deals as a factor of a weakening market.Rental evidence, as is demonstrated, can be highly debatable.It is not surprising that arguments sometimes occur between managers and valuers about the latters’ calculations.The issue is crucial to the debate about whether the UK commercial property market is weakening. The big listed property companies are trading at discounts of about 30 per cent to net asset value, reflecting deep pessimism about valuations on the part of equity investors.This comes after months of accumulated anecdotes suggesting falling prices – for secondary property at least – and some sellers taking their assets off the market after failing to tempt anyone. With borrowing costs higher, it has been much harder to finance purchases.Analysts at Merrill Lynch predict yields will rise by 65 basis points in the three years to 2009.But little solid evidence of this downturn can be seen in anyone’s numbers – yet.Data from the Investment Property Databank showed a minuscule fall in industrial and retail values in July, but also a rise in offices.Yet British Land’s quarterly figures and Brixton’s half-year results came out last week and both were strong.The question is: if pricing softened in the spring or summer, would this feed into the numbers yet?One chief executive of a listed company gives the following example. A deal is struck in December but does not complete until March. It forms part of the “transaction evidence” for valuations carried out in May for the six months to June 30 (this process can take six weeks or so).Those interim results may not be announced until August or September.In other words, if transactional yields rose this summer it would not necessarily appear until companies’ year-end results, published in newspapers next February or March.Tim Wheeler, chief executive of Brixton, is cheerful about his specific sector (industrial property around London) and points to a string of recent deals on ever-lower yields.But Mr Wheeler believes that – elsewhere – the industrial market is weakening. He points out that when deals do collapse they do not become “evidence”.“Outside the south-east there are many vendors who aren’t selling, so there is no transactional evidence, the valuers are beating their calculators and thinking prices should have moved down, but there is no evidence,” says Mr Wheeler.The question is addressed by Merrill’s analysts.“A valuer has a problem. Without evidence to point to, should an asset be valued on the ask [often the latest transactional evidence] or value on the bid or somewhere inbetween? Will valuers be brave enough to question the ask?”When prices were accelerating, executives often whinged that valuers reacted too slowly. They are unlikely to complain if prices reverse.jim.pickard@ft.com
905;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Dearer food on the menu;;While the Bank of England warned on Wednesday of a “particularly uncertain” outlook for food prices, food producers were clearer: they think prices will keep going up.Prices for all kinds of food – from staples such as meat and bread to more indulgent goods like coffee and chocolate – have risen this year as stronger global demand for agricultural raw materials pushes up the cost of ingredients for food producers.Restaurants and cafes have already begun to pass on increases, with coffee chain Starbucks raising prices on cappuccinos, lattes and other drinks in the UK by 3 per cent at the end of May.Food-price inflation has slowed in recent months, dropping 0.4 per cent in July from June, according to the British Retail Consortium. However, both the consortium and the Bank of England have warned that the recent flooding could revive pressure on prices.Kevin Hawkins, the director- general of the BRC, said this month that food-price inflation was “impervious” to interest rate changes.“If, as a result of [July’s] heavy rainfall, food inflation increases over the next few months, a further hike in interest rates will do nothing to curb it.”The floods damaged vegetable and grain crops and are expected to result in relatively poor harvests for vegetables such as peas and broccoli, meaning that prices could rise around Christmas.Industry analysts say they expect frozen pea manufacturer Birds Eye to put prices up by about 10 per cent this year. Birds Eye said on Wednesday that while it expected lower harvest volumes, it had not yet made a decision on prices. “We will evaluate the full effects at the end of the harvest.”Flour millers say unprecedented rises in wheat prices over the past 12 months may lead to further increases in bread prices early next year. The National Association of British and Irish Millers (Nabim) said: “Across the board, we’re going to be feeling further price inflation than we initially thought a month ago.”Prices for the best kinds of breadmaking wheat have almost doubled to £175 per tonne over the past 12 months as demand exceeds supply. Yields on this year’s UK wheat harvest are expected to be 10 per cent lower than last year, in part because of the flooding. Europe’s wheat crop will also be smaller than expec­ted after drought in eastern Europe and wet weather elsewhere.Wheat futures traded on the Chicago Board of Trade hit 10-year highs on Wednesday amid concerns that the US Department of Agriculture’s monthly grain report, released on Friday, will lower its wheat production forecasts. “We fully expect them to cut a little bit off world production,” Nabim said.Meanwhile, specialist fish manufacturer Young’s this week warned of an “upward trend” in seafood prices, in part due to stronger demand in Asia as economies expand and incomes rise. The company said it expected its prices to increase some 5 per cent over the next six months.Meat is one food that might actually fall in price, following the food-and-mouth outbreak. Meat producers are worried that a long export ban would force them to sell meat in the domestic market, pushing prices down.The National Beef Association asked retailers and processors on Wednesday not take advantage of farmers’ vulnerability and reduce slaughter cattle prices.Even if the overall trend for food prices is up, the Bank of England pointed out, the increase in households’ spending on food can not be attributed solely to food inflation. It warned that retailers are encouraging consumers to switch to more expensive brands.Food analysts say that supermarkets have been tapping into consumer demand for healthy and ethically sourced foods and pushing organic and premium own- label ranges, because they can charge more money for them.Christopher Gower, a food analyst at Man Securities, said: “If you’re Tesco or Sainsbury, you want people to buy premium products.”
906;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-08-06T17:41:13Z;Starbucks needs to wake up and smell the comedy;;"All the world’s a stage, but in August the only stage that matters is Edinburgh in Scotland, where huge numbers of artists and performers converge every year for three weeks of frenzied activity. The carnival spirit is unleashed and lovers of theatre, comedy, books, film, jazz and classical music are, for a limited period only, in heaven.The so-called Fringe festival, the largest element in this surge of creativity, is in its 61st year. It outgrew the mainstream festival a long time ago, and this month will play host to more than 2,000 shows in 250 venues around the city.It is the unlikeliest of marriages: between Edinburgh’s austere, dignified beauty, and the at times raucous vulgarity of the actors and comedians. And what variety is on offer. This year you can choose between Jihad – the Musical, a comical look at the ungrammatical “war on terror”; Oh F***! I’m 40, poignant and uproarious reflections on the realities of midlife by (full disclosure) my friend Richard Herring; and no fewer than three productions of Macbeth – one on stilts, another performed as a walking tour of the city’s Old Town.Holidaying executives, hoping to recharge amid all this artistic experimentation, might not expect to pick up ideas to take back to work with them in September. But perhaps they shouldn’t switch off their business brains altogether. As William Taylor and Polly La Barre pointed out last year in their entertaining book, Mavericks at Work: “The Fringe is more than performance art. It is a colourful symbol of the performance of open-source innovation.”No one, not even the Fringe’s “artistic director”, is in control of the event. It is a self-organising system formed by the collaboration of artists, venues, audience and press. It is noisy and chaotic but also immensely creative. And hidden among the hopeful amateurs and, frankly, dross, there is the occasional gem.I chanced upon one of these gems at a London preview a few days ago. But before readers lurch off in the direction of something more interesting and useful, such as a table of 10-year government bond spreads, be warned: here is one Fringe production that has an important message for business leaders.The show goes under a more or less self-explanatory title: The Two Closest Starbucks in Britain. In it comedian Owen Powell describes how he tried, with the aid of a pedometer, to find the two branches of the global coffee chain that are nearest to each other in the UK.The ubiquity of Starbucks outlets is a well-known phenomenon and has received comic treatment before. In an episode of The Simpsons, every shop bar one in the Springfield mall is a Starbucks and that last one (In and Out Piercing) is about to be shut down and replaced by a . . . Starbucks. In Shrek 2, a giant gingerbread man crushes a branch of “Farbucks”, whose terrified patrons run across the street where, happily, they immediately find another one.Powell’s show is different. There is no explicit (or even implicit) satirical purpose to it. He has not split off from some anti-globalisation march to perform an angry protest. He even uses PowerPoint, for goodness’ sake.Gently but perceptively, Powell merely points out that this great modern business does seem to be rather dominating the landscape, and on a global scale. He has the evidence to prove it. He has personally counted the number of steps required to travel between, for example, the two branches of Starbucks in London’s Villiers Street, just off the Strand. (It is 108 steps, in case you were wondering. And no, these two are not the closest Starbucks in Britain, not by a long chalk. Go and see the show if you want to find out which ones are.)Business has started to worry about vociferous protesters and militant NGOs that line up to decry all its works. But this is just the froth on the surface.What could really threaten your company are the sullen, resentful types who do not speak up but notice how clumsily and tactlessly you present yourself to the world. Last month’s closure, by popular demand, of the Starbucks in Beijing’s Forbidden City was a striking example of what can happen to global businesses when they do not mind their manners.When the Edinburgh festival is over, the board of Starbucks should fly Powell over to Seattle – first class of course – to perform his show. It is certainly the only half-decent PowerPoint presentation I have ever seen. And the total cost would be far less than getting a strategy consultant in for half a day.But never mind the coffee: if you are going to Edinburgh this summer, make sure you try a fish supper from the l’Alba d’Oro on Henderson Row in the New Town.And when the nice person behind the counter asks whether you want “salt ’n’ soss wi’ tha’”, do yourself a favour and say yes.Owen Powell will be performing ‘The Two Closest Starbucks in Britain’ at the Pleasance Cellar, Edinburgh. www.whatareyoulaughingat.co.ukstefan.stern@ft.com"

The S&P 500 index closed up 0.4 per cent at 1,472.20 while the Nasdaq Composite index was 0.9 per cent higher at 2,575.98The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.8 per cent at 13,463.33. The gains added to Wednesday’s strong last-minute rally which took place amid near-record trading volumes on most equity and derivatives exchanges.Solid earnings from Nokia sent shares in the mobile phone maker 8.8 per cent higher at $30.90 on the New York Stock Exchange.Viacom reported higher revenues and a narrower-than-expected quarterly loss, aided by strong DVD sales and the success of the hit film Shrek The Third. Its shares gained 1.9 per cent at $38.50. These results came closely on the heels of strong figures from Walt Disney and Starbucks after Wednesday’s market close.Walt Disney reported a rise in quarterly profit, lifted by strength in its TV and theme park businesses. Shares in the group rose
1.6 per cent to $34.36.Starbucks also posted higher profit and sales. Its shares rose 2.9 percent to as high as $28.00, though by late morning they were down 0.2 percent at $27.15 on the Nasdaq.Eastman Kodak swung to a profit, helped by continued cost-cutting efforts and a hefty gain from the sale of its healthcare group. It rose 5.4 per cent to $26.93.CVS Caremarkrose 3.5 per cent to $36.79 after the company said its second-quarter net income more than doubled in its first full quarter as a combined company.However, the market remained pre-occupied with subprime-related issues as mortgage lender Accredited Home Lenders said it was not certain it would continue to operate due to the adverse conditions in the subprime mortgage market. AHL shares plunged 35.32 per cent to $5.31.Analysts cautioned that stock markets were likely to continue to display significant volatility. Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers, said the CBOE’s Vix index of market volatility had retreated from Wednesday’s peak of 26.22 as investors braced for “peak-
selling”.“Although a sense of calm returned as the Dow rang up a 1.1 per cent gain [on Wednesday], the Vix remains notably elevated and is now set to close above a value of 20 for the sixth straight session,” Mr Wilkinson said.“Judging by the fact that the Vix is lower by 9.6 per cent today [on Thursday], while index values are mixed, makes it hard to tell whether investors are stepping back or adding new positions,” he added.NYSE Euronext shares fell 2.7 per cent to $74.91 after the transatlantic stock exchange reported a rise in second quarter earnings.The earnings report reflected the first time that the pan-European exchange Euronext, which was bought by the New York Stock Exchange earlier this year, contributed to earnings.In deals news, financial data processor Fiserv said it would acquire the electronic payment processing company Checkfree for $4.4bn in cash, soothing recent concerns that dealmaking would wane on Wall Street amid credit market troubles. Shares in Checkfree soared 23.3 per cent to $45.40 on the news.Dellrose 1.5 per cent to $28.18 after it agreed to buy the ASAP Software unit of Corporate Express for $340m.Shares in Clorox fell 7.3 per cent to $57.14 after the bleach manufacturer unveiled a lower-than- expected quarterly profit due to rising promotional and ingredient costs and subdued sales growth.Wall Street also responded to better-than-expected economic data as the US Labour Department said that jobless claims were up 4,000 to 307,000 on a seasonally-
adjusted basis in the week ended July 28. Analysts had expected a rise of 9,000 claims for the week.The Commerce Department said June factory orders rose 0.6 per cent, less than expected, on lower orders for automobiles, computers and electrical goods.Traders were awaiting Friday’s release of July non-farm payrolls, a closely watched indicator of US economic health.The data will be even more keenly watched than usual because of concerns about US housing market weakness."

The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.3 per cent at 2.553.87, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.1 per cent higher at 13,362.37.The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies advanced 0.2 per cent to 77.91.Stocks staged a late rally having looked on course to end lower just half an hour before the close.Exxon Mobil rose 3.6 per cent in the last half hour of trading alone to finish the day up 0.8 per cent at $85.84.Less defensive stocks rocketed higher at the end of the day. In the last 35 minutes of trading, energy stocks gained 2.35 per cent followed by materials, up 2.26 per cent and financials, up 2.25, according to Bespoke Investments.A third Bear Stearns hedge fund revealed that it had put a halt to investor redemptions, adding to rising concern. Shares of the investment bank were down 2.4 per cent at $118.30.Several other financial stocks fell victim to credit concerns. ETrade Group fell 5.5 per cent to 17.50 while Ameritrade was 3.2 per cent lower at $16.40.Shares of Beazer Homes dropped 17.9 per cent to $11.48 on the New York Stock Exchange having been down 40 per cent at one point, as worries about widening fallout from the credit crisis in the US persisted. But Beazer’s denial that it faced bankruptcy appeared to lift sentiment elsewhere late in the session.Its slide had hit shares of other home builders, sending the S&P home builders index down to 508.1 at one stage before recovering to end down 0.6 per cent at 548.26.Other home builders’ stocks were also dragged lower.Hovnanian Enterprises fell 9.7 per cent to $11.95, Meritage Homes dropped
6.4 per cent to $18.25 and WCI Communities sank 14 per cent to $7.59.In a demonstration of the extent of volatility in the market, many homebuilding stocks had regained earlier losses amid continuing nervousness.Wall Street had fallen sharply on Tuesday after American Home Mortgage said lenders had cut off its access to credit and that it might have to liquidate its assets.And the market remained extremely volatile on Wednesday, with the Vix volatility index moving above 24, its highest level of the current bull market.Early in the session stocks had responded positively to remarks from Hank Paulson, Treasury secretary, that the market impact of the US subprime mortgage fallout was largely contained and that the global economy was as strong as it had been in decades.A welter of economic data failed to provide clear direction. The Institute for Supply Management reported that nationwide manufacturing activity fell to 53.8.On a more positive note, the National Association of Realtors’ pending home sales index jumped 5 per cent to 102.4 in June. Analysts had forecast the index would slip another 0.6 per cent after a revised 3.7 per cent drop in May. Challenger, Gray and Christmas, a job placement firm, showed that planned job cuts in July fell 23 per cent from June to a 12-month low.Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp finally won its battle to buy Dow Jones, the publisher of the Wall Street Journal, for $5.6bn.

0.9 per cent to $8.43.Earnings news from several other companies provided a mixed bag for investors. Kraft Foods shares fell 1 per cent to $32.43 after the company reported higher quarterly profit.Time Warner delivered a rise in net income in its second quarter as growth at its cable division offset falling revenues in film, television and its AOL internet operations.Qwest Communications fell after the telecoms group said second-quarter profit rose but missed expectations.

909;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Kraft warns of ‘perfect storm’;;Kraft chief executive Irene Rosenfeld on Wednesday warned of a slowdown in milk consumption as soaring milk prices lead people to eat and drink fewer dairy products.“2007 is shaping up to have the highest average dairy prices on record,” Ms Rosenfeld said. “The high cost of milk is beginning to slow consumption.”Around half the milk consumed in the US is done so in the form of cheese, according to the country’s National Milk Producers Federation. Around 30 per cent is consumed in the form of liquid milk.Kraft has been raising prices on its cheese products, which include Kraft Singles and Philadelphia Cream Cheese, between 5 and 12 per cent this year to try and offset falling sales and higher raw material costs.Ms Rosenfeld said that “a perfect storm” had developed in the dairy market as high animal feed costs, a drought in Australia and rising demand in Asia and Africa combined to push up the price of raw milk and milk powder.Cadbury Schweppes, the UK-based confectionery group, also complained about higher dairy prices on Wednesday, estimating that they would raise its costs by some £20m in the second half of the year.Meanwhile Starbucks, the US coffee chain, this week said higher milk prices contributed to its decision to raise prices by around 9 cents per for its hot coffees and frozen drinks like Frappucchinos.Kraft’s shares fell 11 cents to $32.64 in early morning trading in New York after the group reported a 2 per cent fall in second quarter diluted earnings to 50 cents per share.However, Kraft raised its full-year financial forecasts. The food group now expects to produce organic net sales growth of more than 4 per cent this year, and earnings per share of between $1.55-$1.60.Kraft’s second quarter sales, excluding exceptional items, grew 4.1 per cent on the back of strong sales in its American beverages business, which includes packaged coffee brands like Maxwell House, Starbucks and Tassimo.Ms Rosenfeld said sales of premium coffee brands like Starbucks and Tassimo were growing faster than mainstream brands.“The consumer palate has gotten more sophisticated in virtually all food and beverage categories,” she said.

Shares in KB fell 1.3 per cent to $39.89. The S&P homebuilder index was 1.7 per cent lower amid further losses among companies in the sector.The S&P closed 0.4 per cent lower at 1,505.71 points, after it rose to a high of 1,514.84 after the Federal Open Market Committee statement was released. Financials, utility and energy sectors closed lower yesterday.The FOMC said the economy grew at a moderate rate during the first half of this year, despite “the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector.” In terms of inflation risk, policy makers said core inflation was no longer “elevated” but that “a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.”“A Fed that describes the economy and inflation in friendlier terms than before is generally treated bullishly in the markets, particularly the stock market,” said Tony Crescenzi, strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. He said a lakcluster response from stocks likely indicated “further evidence of the depth to which fears about credit conditions have increased.”Amid investor worries about how troubles in the US mortgage market would play out across structured credit markets, the FOMC did not specifically address the US mortgage market.Equity volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index, ebbed further yesterday, but rose from its low after the FOMC. The Vix was 0.4 per cent lower at 15.47 after a 17.9 per cent decline from a three-month peak on Wednesday.Technology was in the spotlight yesterday and the asdaq Composite led the broad benchmarks during the day and closed 0.1 per cent higher at 2,608.37.Brokerage upgrades for Intel, up 0.6 per cent at $23.92, and Cisco Systems, up 2.1 per cent at $27.85, boosted technology stocks.Also helping the sector was a 1.8 per cent rise to $28.45 in Dell. Amazon rose 1.1 per cent at $68.89, taking its gain for the year to 76.5 per cent.RBC Capital Markets raised its price target for the online retailer from $45 to $75 and said high levels of short interest and a concentration in holdings would limit any selling pressure in the stock.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.4 per cent lower at 13,422.28. A birght spot for bluechips was General Motors, up
2 per cent at $38.15 with shares reaching their highest level in over two years. The carmaker agreed to sell its Allison Transmission commercial and military business for about $5.6bn to the Carlyle Group and Onex Corp, two private equity firms.One sector in the news on Thursday was airlines.The American stock exchange airline index gained 2 per cent, trimming

Harbinger, which controlled only 10 per cent of voting rights at the meeting because it bought some of its shares after the March 31 cut-off, had sent a letter to all 21,000 shareholders urging them to reject the deal.It claims Doutor engineered the Y130bn ($1.05bn) deal to dilute the fund’s stake and forestall a potential takeover. It is also critical of the merger terms, which give shareholders in each company 50 per cent of the new entity in spite of Doutor’s larger market capitalisation and sales.Eli Benson, director of investments at Harbinger, accused management of misleading investors with an excessively pessimistic assessment of Doutor’s prospects as a standalone business. “They were trying to scare shareholders,” he said.The battle is part of a broader rise in investor activism in Japan. Minority shareholders, many of them foreign, have pushed for changes at a string of companies, although managers have often been able to check their influence with poison pills and other defensive measures.
912;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-06-21T21:51:48Z;Wall St up in volatile session;;Wall Street rallied on Thursday after an uncertain start in equities reflected a similar pattern in other markets, suggesting investors are starting to seek a higher risk premium across asset classes.“The volatility we are seeing across stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities is not of the run-for-the-door type – more a reduction in overall risk,’’ said Michael Kastner, portfolio manager at SterlingStamos.He said a tweaking of positions by equity hedge funds with long/short strategies had the potential to create choppy trade in the overall market.The S&P 500 index rose 0.6 per cent to close at 1,522.19 – rebounding from a low of 1,504.75 earlier in the day.A survey of regional manufacturing activity by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve was much stronger than expected and sparked a recovery in stocks at midday.Within the S&P, energy stocks rebounded from a sharp loss on Wednesday but financials lagged among the 10 leading sectors. The rebound in financials on Thursday, left the sector less than 1 per cent higher for the year.Shares in Bear Stearns bounced back from a low of $140.44 early in the day and gained 1.8 per cent to $145.81, as investors hoped that troubles at two of its hedge funds were contained.Analysts said wider credit spreads still warranted being watched by the equity market.“The widely advertised liquidation of hedge funds invested in the subprime mortgage market is causing some ripples in the credit markets and credit spreads are widening,” said Tony Crescenzi, bond strategist at Miller Tabak & Co.Technology led gains on Thursday, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.65 per cent to 2,616.96, boosted in part by a 2.8 per cent rally in the semiconductor sector. Advanced Micro Devices was upgraded and the chipmaker rose 7.9 per cent to $14.72.Blue chips also rebounded from early losses and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 13,545.84.In spite of worries about the recent rise in rates, deal activity continued at a brisk pace on Thursday.Luxottica, the Italian eyewear maker bought Oakley, a US rival in a $2.1bn cash deal valued at $29.30 a share. Shares in Oakley rose 12.8 per cent to $28.45, while Lux gained 9.1 per cent to $38.02.Another cash deal involved Equity Inns, the hotel and motel real estate investment trust. An affiliate of Whitehall Street Global, a real estate fund owned by Goldman Sachs, bought Equity for about $1.26bn and its shares jumped 17.2 per cent to $22.68.Since Friday, about $16.6bn in deals have been announced, not including Home Depot’s $10.3bn sale of its supply unit. Analysts said the buy-out boom shows little sign of being hurt by higher long-term bond yields.Analysts at Bespoke Investments said there had seemed to be a dry spell in deals early last week. “One week later, M&A deals are back to their average levels over the last year.”Meanwhile, shares in Kraft Foods jumped 6.6 per cent to $36.75 on news that Nelson Peltz, the activist investors has purchased a 3 per cent stake in the food company and plans to seek asset sales.A number of earnings warnings on Thursday rattled various stocks. H&R Block fell 3.25 per cent to $22.04, after posting a fourth-quarter loss, hurt by problems at its mortgage lending arm.AG Edwards said fiscal first-quarter earnings rose 7 per cent and results shaded estimates. The brokerage fell 0.4 per cent to $86.23.Shares in Sonic fell 8.9 per cent to $21.72 after the restaurant group lowered its fiscal fourth-quarter outlook due to higher prices for dairy and soybean oil, and rising labour costs.Cheesecake Factory also forecast second-quarter revenue growth below analyst expectations, and that move sparked brokerage downgrades. The stock lost 7.1 per cent lower at $24.85.Starbucks fell 3.9 per cent to $26.26 after the coffee chains’ chief financial officer said meeting the top end of its 2007 earnings outlook would prove “very challenging”.Shares in Andersons, an ethanol and grain producer, surged 12.6 per cent to $45.50 after the company increased its full-year profit forecast.Dow Jones fell 1.6 per cent to $59.71 as General Electric and Pearson, the publisher of the FT dropped plans to bid for the company.After the close of trading on Thursday, Blackstone Group, the private equity firm, finalised the terms of its initial public offering. Amid strong subscription, the IPO was priced at $31 a share, at the top of the $29 to $31 range and values Blackstone at about $33.6bn. The stock will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.
913;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-06-21T08:22:06Z;Ethiopia inks Starbucks trademark deal;;Starbucks and the Ethiopian government reached an agreement that settles a dispute over the country’s bid to trademark its coffee beans, according a joint statement released on Wednesday.The US coffee chain had been accused by Ethiopia and aid agency Oxfam of attempting to block Ethiopia from obtaining trademarks for its best-known beans – Sidamo and Harrar.The agreement allows Starbucks to use and promote the Harrar, Sidamo and Yirgacheffe designations in markets where trademarks exist, as well as where they don’t, the statement said.The US Patent and Trademark Office awarded Ethiopia’s Yirgacheffe coffee a trademark in 2006.Starbucks had previously stated that it would not oppose Ethiopia’s efforts to obtain trademarks, but the agreement goes further.”This is a broad agreement that addresses distribution, marketing and licensing,” Sandra Taylor, senior vice president of Corporate Social Responsibility at Starbucks, told Reuters.It includes the license of certain trademarks and language that recognizes the importance and integrity of Ethiopia’s specialty coffee designations.Currently, about 2 percent of Starbucks’ coffee purchases are from Ethiopia, but the amount could increase as the company plans to raise its coffee supply from East Africa.”Our customers know that some of the highest quality coffees in the world come from Ethiopia,” Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz said in the statement.Dr. Samuel Assefa, the Ethiopian Ambassador to the United States, praised Starbucks.”What we have learned in our dealings with Starbucks over the last several months is that the company listens to its stakeholders’ concerns and is attentive to the plight of the poor farmers who produce the finest specialty coffees in the world,” he said.In theory, the trademark agreement could boost income for Ethiopian farmers by allowing the country to negotiate purchasing conditions for coffee roasters or retailers that want to use that name.About a quarter of Ethiopia’s 80 million people live off the coffee farming industry. The country’s average annual income is around $1,000.
914;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-06-12T20:30:23Z;Record bond yields sink Wall Street;;"Wall Street slumped on Tuesday, as the 10-year bond yield reached its highest level in five years, and cast a bearish pall over equities.Rate-sensitive stocks, such as utilities, real estate investment trusts, home builders and some financials were on the defensive.Bearish sentiment was also reflected in lower transport stocks and a further pullback in the steel sector.Stocks largely tracked the change in bond yields on Tuesday. When yields showed signs of stabilising during the early afternoon, stocks turned higher. But, late on Tuesday, when yields rose to fresh highs, that ultimately sank stocks.The S&P 500 index closed 1.1 per cent lower at 1,492.99.Telecoms and utilities were the weakest main industry groups in the S&P.Concern has been growing among stock traders that higher yields would slow merger and acquisition activity as financing costs for deals increased. The past week has seen just $1.8bn in announced M&A deals, the lowest since November.Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said: “Investors relying on mergers and acquisitions to boost prices are likely on edge wondering whether the decline is a result of rising interest rates or summer
doldrums.”Stephen Wood, portfolio strategist at Russell Investment Group, said: “Private equity could become more selective about new deals.”The rise in rates has also prompted investors to calculate whether equities still look attractive compared with fixed-income securities that now offer higher yields.Mr Wood said: “Fixed income has become more attractive, but stocks still look better. The prospect of stronger growth in the US has been behind the rise in yields.”David Shairp, global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said: “The stock/bond decision has become more finely balanced after the bond market shake-out.“Relative to bonds, equities offer reasonable but not compelling value.”Bond traders said the May retail sales report, due on Wednesday, and consumer prices data, released on Friday, would provide the market with some fundamental news to place the recent rise in yields in context.Mr Shairp said: “The equity pullback may have further to go, as markets come to terms with the carnage in the fixed-income markets and they have a chance to digest their gains since March.”On Tuesday, equity volatility rose. The Chicago Board Option Exchange’s Vix index of S&P volatility gained 12.2 per cent to 16.50, but closed below last week’s peak of 17.09.Quarterly option contracts expire this week, and that could also spark sharp moves in the S&P index said analysts. Technology and blue chips both closed lower.A narrowing in second-quarter guidance from Texas Instruments, down 2.1 per cent at $35.04, hurt chip makers.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.9 per cent lower at 2,549.77.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 1 per cent at 13,295.01. Of the Dow’s 30 stocks, 27 closed lower on Tuesday, led by a 2.6 per cent fall in AT&T to $39.08. The Dow Transportation Average lost 1.9 per cent, and closed at its lowest level since mid April.A bright spot among blue chips was a 1.2 per cent rise to $22.20 in Intel as it bucked the sell-off in other chip-makers. McDonald’s up 0.45 per cent at $51.48, and Alcoa, up 0.1 per cent at $39.34 were the other Dow stocks to close higher.In earnings news, Lehman Brothers reported net income rose 27 per cent over the past year to a record $1.3bn. The stock rose 0.5 per cent to $76,06, and pared an earlier rise to $78.19. The stock remains 2.6 per cent lower for the year and set a high for the year of $85.80 in early February.The bank said its diversified operations helped offset a 14 per cent fall in its fixed income revenues, from bonds, derivatives and credit products, due to ”continued weakness in the US residential mortgage business.”Countrywide, the largest US mortgage lender, said that while it boosted home loans by 15 per cent in May compared with a year earlier, its foreclosure rate had doubled. Shares rose 0.7 per cent to $38.10.Yahoo fell 1.1 per cent to $27.05 as its annual shareholder meeting was held.Starbucks rose 0.7 per cent to $27.74, rebounding from an earlier decline when Goldman Sachs removed the stock from its “conviction buy” list.Uniphase rose 3.5 per cent to $13.47 after a brokerage upgrade.Shares in Take-Two Interactive gained 2.1 per cent to $19.33 after JPMorgan upgraded the video game publisher to “outperform”.Dean Foods fell 4.3 per cent to $31.07 after it cut earnings estimates for the second quarter and the year because of higher milk prices.Shares in American Commercial Lines fell 9.1 per cent to $26.27 after the transportation company also cut its earnings outlook."
915;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-05-21T12:21:54Z;‘I put up with noisy opera-goers’;;It was during the interval in the ”family circle” at New York’s Metropolitan Opera that the elderly lady with the German accent told the guffawing man in the row behind us that Mozart’s Magic Flute wasn’t supposed to be funny. She wasn’t much taken either by the production’s flapping puppets and dancing bears. ”With Mozart, it is only the music that matters,” she insisted. So bad luck librettist Emanuel Schikaneder. This kind of engagement is part of the Faustian pact you strike when you subscribe to an eight-opera series for just $25 a ticket.It is a remarkable deal. When the season ends next week my wife and I will have seen - albeit at something of a distance - one completely new opera (Tan Dun’s The First Emperor, directed by Zhang Yimou), as well as three new productions, including Puccini’s Madame Butterfly directed by Anthony Minghella. We will also have heard Deborah Voigt and Placido Domingo.But when our invitation to resubscribe to the 2007-8 season arrived (”Are we free on Thursday, April 10, 2008, honey?”), we had to pause for thought. Our visits had coincided twice with those of our friend with the accent, and we had also learnt - unavoidably - of her strong views on gender relations in Japan. But hers was comparatively normal behaviour up in the family circle.We recalled a snowy night in February when we arrived for Jenufa just as the lights went down, causing the senior citizen who had draped his coat over our seats to curse loudly at my wife. This same man was responsible for a bout of extreme rustling at the emotional end of the first act. Somehow the fact that his friend was wearing strap-on east European binoculars only added to the annoyance. And the second act was spoiled when an elderly man slipped into an empty seat nearby and started cracking and eating nuts.It is also hard to spend the first 90 minutes of Otto Schenk’s production of Mastersingers sitting next to a man with the respiratory issues of a Wagner-loving Darth Vader. You can’t ask someone to stop breathing, although the front of house manager kindly moved us for acts two and three (albeit to seats behind a man checking his messages on an illuminated mobile phone).But there is something besides ill manners going on at the back of the Met, I realised after talking to Grant McCracken, a social anthropologist who advises businesses. We were discussing not opera, but the Starbucks coffee chain. Starbucks, it seems, faces the challenge of encouraging its customers to linger a while, but not to fall asleep, and certainly not to change their socks. People should feel comfortable, but not too comfortable, because that, McCracken told me, is when they can start to behave in unwelcome ways.That’s when I realised that eccentricity of the nut-cracking sort could be part of the subscription mind-set. I was already taking sandwiches to eat in the interval. How long before I started drinking tea from my flask during Wotan’s Farewell?It was then that I experienced a small epiphany. Back in April there had been a crying baby incident during Handel’s Giulio Cesare. To say it was unwelcome is an understatement. But after talking to McCracken I reminded myself of the Met’s shortened versions of The Magic Flute put on for children around Christmas. The auditorium was filled with a crowd that cheered as the chandeliers went up while the ushers shouted in vain, ”No photographs!”A merry background buzz rose and fell all the way through - including from our own five-year-old son asking, ”Is he dead?” or, ”Why he’s jumping?” There was a definite vitality about it all.So perhaps this could be a way of preventing us regulars getting too comfortable and perhaps just a little too strange. Bring in the babies and the under-11 crowd. After all, they do call it the family circle.
916;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-05-18T17:25:40Z;Whitney Tilson: Not-to-be-missed tips for value hunters;;"My recent column detailing the 10 investment traps I’ve identified prompted several readers to ask if I have a comparable list of the opposite – types of opportunities that are likely to lead to good investment outcomes.I do, and happily it’s a bit longer than the list of traps. Given that the first step to successful investing is knowing which ponds to fish in, here are the 15 most common types of value opportunities I have been able to capitalise on in my investing career:● Out-of-favour blue chips. Even the greatest companies encounter problems or otherwise fall out of favour. We bought McDonald’s a few years ago when it fell below $13, believing in its assets and that it could return to its former glory through better management. The shares now trade above $50.● Turnrounds of broken businesses. It’s difficult to fix a truly broken business, but when it happens, the returns can be extraordinary. One of my best investments ever was CKE Restaurants, which engineered a spectacular turnround at Hardee’s due to its new Thickburger menu. The shares, as low as $3 in 2003, are now above $20.● Cyclicals at the bottom of the cycle. Success here usually involves correctly anticipating when a cyclical industry will rebound, though precision is not necessary as long as the company has a strong enough balance sheet to weather the tough times.● Distressed industries. Our buying auto-systems maker Lear last year below $20 when its prospects were considered most bleak is a successful example of buying a good company in a distressed industry. Its shares have more than doubled off their lows.● Overlooked small-caps. Among the 5,000 or so publicly traded US stocks that have no analyst coverage are fine businesses that are cheap because no one is paying attention to them or the stocks are thinly traded. A good example we’ve owned for years is Weyco Group, which makes Florsheim shoes.● Fallen growth angels. When high-growth companies slow down, growth and momentum junkies often sell indiscriminately, which can create great opportunities for value investors. Just be careful not to anchor on the stock’s previous price or earnings multiple, which are no longer relevant.● Growth at a reasonable price. These are also high-quality growth businesses, but the stocks haven’t fallen. They may not appear cheap on traditional valuation metrics, but can be excellent investments if the high growth can be maintained. Starbucks over the years has been a great example.● Piggybacking on activism. There are select opportunities to invest alongside experienced activist investors pushing for prudent change. One of our most profitable investments over the past two years, for example, was following Pershing Square and Trian Group into Wendy’s International, which has more than doubled.● Spin-offs. Many significant stock-price inefficiencies can occur when a company is spun off. A recent example we currently own is Mueller Water, which operates largely under Wall Street’s radar and is uniquely positioned to benefit from needed investment in US water-system infrastructure.● Post-bankruptcies. There are also many reasons why companies emerging from bankruptcy can be inefficiently priced, not the least of which is investors’ reticence to back a recent loser. We’ve almost tripled our money in less than two years owning shoe retailer Footstar, which came out of bankruptcy with a solid balance sheet and plan for reviving itself.● Let someone else do the investing. Certain public companies, including Berkshire Hathaway (which we own), Loews, Leucadia National, Alleghany and White Mountains Insurance are structured as investment vehicles for proven value investors. At a reasonable price, it can pay to let these investors do the heavy lifting for you.● Free/mispriced option. In these situations, one or more ongoing businesses justifies the current market price and an investor gets a valuable option – in the form of a new market opportunity or turnround of a floundering business – for almost nothing. In Wendy’s, we thought the value of its Tim Hortons restaurant franchise was worth the entire stock price two years ago, so we were getting the Wendy’s brand restaurant and franchising business for free.● Declining cash cow. At the right price – and if management wisely milks the business and allocates capital – the stock of a declining business can be a great investment. The shares of Deluxe, the leading check printer that many investors had abandoned, have tripled over the past year thanks to cost cutting under a new chief executive.● Oddball companies. Certain companies have revolutionary business models that are poorly understood, resulting in cheap stock prices. Classic examples are Southwest Airlines, Dell and Kinder Morgan.● Discount to the sum of the parts. Many companies lend themselves to valuing their different pieces and can be a great buy if the whole is trading at
a sufficient discount to the pieces. We own Tyco because we think the three companies that will emerge from it in the next few months are worth more than $40, versus today’s share price below $33.Whitney Tilson is a money manager who co-edits Value Investor Insight and co-founded the Value Investing Congress. feedback@tilsonfunds.com"
917;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-05-04T14:43:29Z;S&P 500 edges closer to all-time high;;"Wall Street stocks were moving higher by mid-morning on Friday, buoyed by talk of further deal activity involving Yahoo and Microsoft, and the tailwind of a soothing monthly jobs report for April.Talk of a possible merger between Microsoft and Yahoo was the latest in a wave of acquisition activity that has helped drive stocks higher in recent weeks. Activity in the media sector continued to percolate when Reuters Group said on Friday that it had received a preliminary takeover offer from an unnamed suitor.Less than an hour after the opening bell, Microsoft shares were 1.55 per cent lower at $30.49 while shares of Yahoo had surged 17.8 per cent to $33.19.The prospect of the two companies joining forces was discounted by some analysts.Scott Kessler, internet software analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research, said the two companies “already have significant global reach and expansive online offerings,” and that their respective “internet businesses have struggled, we think, due largely to monetization shortcomings, which such a merger would not address.”Mr Kessler also said: “Ironically, the companies’ advertising partnership ended last year; we think something similar would make more sense.”Aside from the latest deal talk, the stock market received further evidence that the economy was growing moderately which should help lessen inflation.Non-farm payrolls rose 88,000 in April, the slowest expansion in monthly jobs in two years. The gains were less than the forecast rise of 100,000 and the 177,000 jobs created in March. The unemployment rate rose to 4.5 per cent from 4.4 per cent while average hourly earnings rose 0.2 per cent in March for a gain of 3.7 per cent over the past year.The report boosted stock index futures, bond prices erased modest losses and turned positive, while the dollar lost ground.“The equity market had rallied into this report and the jobs report suggest the economy is entering a soft landing,” said Gerald Lucas, senior investment advisor at Deutsche Bank. He said the tone of the report would please the Federal Reserve, while low long- term interest rates and tight credit spreads would continue to nurture private equity activity in equities.At mid-morning the S&P 500 index was 0.5 per cent firmer at 1,509.51, and closing in upon its all-time closing record of 1,527.46, set on March 24, 2000.The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4 per cent at 2,576.37. The technology laden benchmark remains well adrift its March 2000 record of 5,048.62.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.3 per cent higher at 13,277.21, above its latest record close of 13,241.38 set on Thursday. The Dow has risen in 22 of the past 25 trading days and made 18 record closes so far this year.The yield on the 10-year yield fell 2.8 basis points to 4.646, while the yield on the two-year note dipped 2.8bp to 4.671 as the data kept the door open to rate cuts later this year said bond traders.The dollar fell after the payroll report and the euro rallied to a high of $1.3610. The dollar fell 0.4 per cent to 119.95 yen, and had slipped from a two-month high of 120.50 yen reached on Thursday.In earnings news on Friday, Eastman Kodak reported a first-quarter loss and shares in the company plunged 5.5 per cent to $24.55.Shares in Weyerhaeuser rose 6.9 per cent to $83.52, after the forest-products company swung to a profit in the first quarter and said it was considering strategic alternatives for its containerboard, packaging and recycling business.Late on Thursday, Starbucks said its fiscal second-quarter profits rose 18 per cent, meeting estimates. The company plans a stock buyback of 25m shares. Its shares fell 2.1 per cent at $30.96.Economists said the April jobs number would keep Federal Reserve policy on hold and suggested the economy was poised to rebound in the coming months.“We believe that the recent pullback in jobless claims, significant strength in withheld tax collections and a swing to more favourable weather conditions in parts of the country points to a rebound in employment growth in May,” said David Greenlaw, economist at Morgan Stanley.In turn, that could raise concerns about higher inflation, an issue that still concerns policy makers at the Federal Reserve.“Given our expectations for a pickup in economic activity, we would expect somewhat stronger job creation and higher wage pressures going forward,” said economists at Bear Stearns.For now the current state of the US labour market “is ideal from the Fed’s perspective of keeping policy on hold despite concerns that inflation may not moderate,” said Bear Stearns.The Federal Open Market Committee meets next Wednesday and the federal funds rate of 5.25 per cent is seen remaining unchanged.Mr Greenlaw said: “We still believe the Fed will hold rates steady and issue a statement that contains only very minor modifications.”"
918;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-05-03T22:45:37Z;Starbucks in U-turn on Ethiopian coffee;;Starbucks appeared to reverse its opposition to Ethiopia’s plans to trademark high-grade types of coffee on Thursday, agreeing in principle to sign a licensing, distribution and marketing agreement with the country where coffee was discovered.The agreement, which could be sealed this month, would recognise “the importance and integrity of Ethiopia’s speciality names” – Harar, Sidamo and Yirgacheffe – Starbucks said in a joint statement with the Ethiopian intellectual property office after two days of talks.The statement suggests an end is in sight to the longstanding and at times acrimonious dispute, with a potential victory for one of the world’s poorest nations.Starbucks’ initial opposition to Ethiopia’s trademarking plans prompted Oxfam, the development charity, to launch a campaign against the US company last year. Oxfam accused Starbucks of thwarting Ethiopian efforts to win a fairer price for the coffee grown by its farmers, estimating that the use of trademarks could bring them an extra £50m ($99m, €73m) a year.Some 15m Ethiopians depend on coffee for a living. The Ethiopian government, in association with farmers’ associations, believes that owning trademarks for its highest-grade beans will help win a greater share of retail prices on world markets. Ethiopia has won trademarks in more than 30 countries. However, Starbucks initially thwarted Ethiopian plans in the US, where it had made its own application for a trademark covering “Sidamo” beans. The National Coffee Association of America later filed against Ethiopia’s applications at the US patent and trademark office.Starbucks officials argued that trademarking could prove counterproductive for Ethiopia and recommended a regional certification scheme instead. However, the NGO campaign has become potentially damaging. The company has been on a public relations offensive in recent months, defending its business practices with poor coffee farmers. In February it agreed to increase coffee purchases in east Africa and fund a quality improvement project in Ethiopia.Thursday’s statement appears to amount to a U-turn. The deal’s details, including the price the company will pay for Ethiopian coffee, have yet to emerge.Stacey Crum, a spokeswoman for the chain, said: “Ultimately it is their [the Ethiopians’] decision how they want to proceed and we aren’t opposing that. There’s been learning from our side.”

The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3 per cent to 2,565.46 and remains well below its March 2000 record of 5,048.62.The release of the April employment report on Friday could well dictate whether the S&P’s old high is taken out soon, analysts say.After the S&P set its record in 2000, the index endured a tough period in which it hit a low of 776.76 on October 9, 2002. Its subsequent recovery has been powered by large gains in energy and materials stocks.By contrast, information technology still significantly lags behind the market, and only 18.6 per cent of stocks in the sector have returned to their March 2000 highs, according to credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s.Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P, said: “The bull market of 1995-1999 in technology, which saw the index go up seven-fold, is still 62 per cent below its March 2000 high and would need a 161 per cent facelift just to getBlue chips extended their recent march into record territory on Thursday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has now risen in 22 of the past 25 trading days, its best winning streak since 1929. Late on Thursday the Dow had rallied 0.2 per cent to a new record close of 13,241.38.In after-hours trade, Starbucks said its fiscal second-quarter profits rose 18 per cent. Shares were up 1.4 per cent at $32.07 after the closing bell. In regular trade, Starbucks rose 1.2 per cent to $31.62.Shares in Nortel were down 1.7 per cent at $24.85 in after-market activity as the telecome equipment maker’s first-quarter net loss narrowed due to higher revenue and better margins. Ahead of its quarterly results, Nortel rose 0.6 per cent to $25.28.A drag on the Dow was General Motors. The carmaker said first-quarter earnings fell 90 per cent from a year ago and blamed losses on problems in the residential mortgage business of GMAC Financial Services. GM shares fell 5.4 per cent to $30.69.Verizon led the rise in blue chips, climbing 3.7 per cent to $41.07. The telecom operator is up 8.4 per cent this week and set a 52-week high of $41.38 on Thursday, aided by gains in market share.Delta Air Lines rose 1.6 per cent to $20.72 in its return from a $3bn restructuring and bankruptcy filing.Shares in Bank of America were up 0.4 per cent at $51.23, after a Dutch court froze the planned sale of ABN Amro’s LaSalle unit to BofA.Dean Foods’first-quarter net income rose 21 per cent, but its shares fell 8.6 per cent to $33.75 as the company said rising milk costs would pull earnings for the year towards the low end of forecasts.Shares in Monster jumped 8.6 per cent to $47.83 amid speculation that the internet employment site may be bought out.Shares in CBS rose 0.8 per cent to $32.06 after the media concern reported a 5.9 per cent drop in first-quarter net income, but the results beat analysts’ estimates.JDS Uniphase plunged 13.9 per cent to $14.33, after the technology networking equipment maker posted a fiscal third-quarter loss and provided a sales forecast for the fourth quarter that was below estimates.Shares in Dow Jones lost 0.4 per cent to $55.71 after the company’s board said late on Wednesday that it would take no action on a $5bn offer made this week by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp.

Bert runs a $2bn fund of funds. “We’re kind of in trouble,” he told me.“How come?”, I said. “You guys are the best. You haven’t had a down month since you started seven years ago.”Bert is a worrier. When he says he’s in trouble it may mean something like Starbucks raising prices at his local outlet. Or, worse, like the last time he called me when he was upset that ABC had moved Lost from the 9pm slot to 10pm (“I can’t stay up that late!” he complained).“Well,” he said, “we returned 8.3 per cent last year. We returned 8.5 per cent the year before and 7.8 per cent the year before that. So we’re beating the risk-free investment by 3 per cent per year. And, you know, we beat the market in 2005 and, of course, in the bear market years we destroyed the market.”“Yeah,” I told him, “You suck. I can see why you have nightmares and your kids hate you.” I was kidding but I was almost angry about it.“The problem,” he said in that slow, methodical way of his, “is that investors are starting to ask the basic question: I can get 5-6 per cent sitting in a risk-free investment like T-bills. Is it really worth getting 2-3 per cent more than that and risk dealing with fraud issues, having my money locked up for years, having to keep track of everything, etc? I’m afraid investors are going to start pulling out.”And you know what? Bert’s investors are probably right. It’s not worth it. A friend of mine recently sold an expensive work of art and was looking to put his money to work in a fund of hedge funds. He asked me if I knew of a good one. I asked my friend: why would he want to flush his money down the toilet?It’s double-locked up: The fund of funds and then the underlying hedge funds. And it really is fees on top of fees. A 10 per cent return in a fund of funds means that the final, underlying investments have to return approximately 18 per cent. That’s very difficult when the market itself averages about 7 per cent and T-bills are at 5-6 per cent.There are 9,000 hedge funds out there. Nine thousand hedge funds aren’t returning 18 per cent. It would be amazing if there were an investment out there that was generating 18 per cent for 9,000 institutions while the rest of the world is making 7 per cent.My friend didn’t like my answer. “Why are you saying that? You run a fund of funds.”Well, what can I tell you? And I didn’t know what to tell Bert, either.He’s got a problem. The entire industry has a problem. Well, I shouldn’t say that. Citadel doesn’t have a problem. It can return 9 per cent a year for ever and institutions will love it. When you’re big enough, you’re an institution also.And SAC Capital won’t have a problem. How come? Because it returns 50 per cent a year. Hey, someone has to do it and they are the best, along with a select handful of others. But you can’t invest in them. I wrote to Steve Cohen once and asked if I could invest. No response. And why should he let me invest? Half his $12bn fund is probably his own money. He’s got other things to worry about. Let’s forget the fact that he’s on my IM buddy list.But let’s invest in SAC anyway. At Stockpickr.com, a website I set up and run, I keep track of the SAC Capital positions (among others) that he’s either been increasing or are new. He’s been piggybacking Carl Icahn a bit lately, so he’s still long Time Warner although my guess is he’s reducing that, along with Icahn. But a new position as of December 31 was WCI Communities, a company for which Icahn recently made a $22 per share offer because he felt it was very undervalued.Another new position is Ionatron. This company makes Buck Rogers-style laser weapons systems. It has $30m of cash in the bank, it loses money, but the Navy is evaluating its latest products and could decide any day. With SAC’s ability to do deep investigative investing, my guess is the managers feel comfortable the products will get sold. And with 24m shares short on Ionatron, there are an awful lot of people who will be waiting in line to cover their shorts.Another interesting new position is Radiation Therapy Services. It provides radiation services for cancer patients. This is clearly an area that is growing. It has a forward price/earnings ratio of 14 and trades for just 11 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, making it a potential buyout candidate. Analysts expect earnings to go from $1.26 a share in 2006 to $1.64 in 2007. Revenues have gone up every year since it went public.“Bert,” I finally said, “What are you guys going to do?”Bert, ever the worrier, said, “I just don’t know.”james@formulacapital.com
921;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-04-22T13:24:14Z;Work hard, play hard and stay in tune;;"Lunchtime visitors to UBS’s City offices might be surprised to see a grand piano in the middle of the foyer. If they are lucky, they might even see one of the company’s employees playing it.The bank recently had the impressive instrument installed so members of the company’s music club could spend their lunch breaks tinkling the ivories instead of grabbing a sandwich at Starbucks.In fact, the grand in the foyer is merely the most visible manifestation of an unusual corporate commitment to music. For employees interested in learning, UBS subsidises piano lessons. It has a partnership with the London Symphony Orchestra and puts on concerts in its foyer. And, as well as its music club, it has a choir and an orchestra, which will be holding its debut concert in September.Richard Hardie, the club’s president and vice-chair of UBS Ltd, says it arose out of the bank’s sponsorship of the LSO and its involvement in an academy in Hackney. “We were meeting a lot of people internally with an interest in music and thought there must be scope to establish a music club,” he says.Catherine Hayes, a member of the choir who works in human resources, says it allows her to maintain an interest from her student years. “I was a fresh graduate from Cambridge and very passionate about choral singing,” she says. “I thought I’d have to give all that up when I started work. Instead I went along to a music club session and found myself setting up a choir.”Chulayuth Lochotinan, a conductor from the operations department, says the idea for an orchestra was originally mooted at a meeting of the music club. Most of the members are from the bank, though there are also some players from the LSO. It gives employees from the different departments the chance to mix and, given the hours bankers typically work, it would be very difficult to do this if it was not at the office. “One person I know sometimes commutes from Kent with his cello,” he says. “I’m lucky. I only have to carry a baton.”UBS is not the only organisation whose employees are enjoying the sound of music. At the City offices of Allen and Overy, there are two music practice rooms with pianos. The law firm has a choir, organises ballet and dance lessons and, as part of its alumni programme last year, staged a performance of The Pirates of Penzance.A&O says that, beyond light relief from high-powered careers, its musical initiatives help promote work-life balance in a culture of long hours.According to UBS, groups such as the orchestras and choir – where talented individuals work together for a greater goal – also teach lessons for business. “If you’re managing a team of 40 people on our trading desk, you want world-class soloists who
can play as a team,” Mr Hardie says.If organisations expect more from their workforce than nine to five, this is exactly the kind of thing they should be providing, according to Arts and Business, an organisation that brings businesses and the arts together to create partnerships. “Companies often look after employees’ bodies by providing a gym, but they fail to look after their minds,” says Philip Spedding of A&B’s world division.“If an hour on the piano gets you out of a mental rut, then it’s a benefit for the business.”Of course, the downside of music is that there may be those whose enthusiasm outstrips their talent. Ms Hayes says this is not a problem in the UBS choir. “It tends to self-select. If you are unable to do it, then you probably realise this fairly quickly and you won’t enjoy being there.”But in public there have to be rules. “If you want to play the piano in the foyer,” Mr Lochotinan says, “you need to be recognised as a competent musician.”"
922;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-04-10T18:55:41Z;Seconds away – round one begins;;"The start of an election campaign always brings out brave hopes, only to be crushed later. On Tuesday we had Plaid Cymru looking for “significant gains” in the Welsh Assembly, while the Welsh Labour leader promised a “truly radical programme”, and even Ukip thought that fielding 1,000 candidates in the local elections would sweep it towards power.But the toughest battle is likely to be in Scotland, where the Scottish National Party looks set to give Labour a bruising. So Gordon Brown’s high profile in the campaign could come back to haunt him, although as one local says, the chancellor is at least preferable to prime minister Tony Blair on the “he’s a bastard, but he’s our bastard” basis.Smart of the Pensions Action Group, then, to go for Gordon’s jugular – the latest pension revelations – by launching a poster campaign in Scotland, and Wales, with a picture of Brown crushing a red rose and “Labour lets Gordon Brown destroy workers’ pensions”.Meanwhile, the nastiness of the fight in Scotland has been highlighted by the exposure in Scotland’s Sunday Mail of a minor indiscretion two years ago by Angus MacNeil, the SNP MP for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (the Western Isles) who sparked the cash for honours investigation. The Stornoway Gazette and the Hebrides News have leapt to MacNeil’s defence, exposing exaggeration in the original story and suggesting there is a vendetta against MacNeil. Sadly their readership is rather limited.Art for gawd’s sakeWhat is happening to culcha in this country? Sir Peter Maxwell Davies – one of the UK’s greatest living composers – on Tuesday attacked the government’s failure to bring
classical music back into schools.The government was, he said, “utterly Philistine” and Tony Blair’s “own horizons are rock and pop”. Warming to his theme, he remarked that “placing a rock beat behind Mozart’s Symphony No 40 is like sticking orange plastic boobs on the ‘Mona Lisa’ ”.Or, indeed, like writing a rap version of Wordsworth’s “I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud” and shooting a pop video on the banks of Ullswater, in order, according to Cumbria Tourism, to “engage the YouTube generation who want modern music and amusing video footage”. What a lot of hearts will be with pleasure filled by that.Cashless caféGo into a Starbucks and you are likely to be exhorted to take a Starbucks Card and load it with cash. It’s all part of that cashless society we hear about, which will soon fill our wallets with pre-pay plastic.The Starbucks card can be used, naturally enough, to pay for coffee in Starbucks. It’s easy to see the advantage for Starbucks in this – since the card was launched in November more than 150,000 have been issued and loaded with £1.7m, a jolly useful float for Starbucks.So what’s in it for the customer? Not a discount, sadly. Rather, says the chain, the card will “enhance the Starbucks experience for customers” by allowing them to pay more quickly. But the bottleneck at Starbucks is caused not by the paying for but by the making of the coffee. A speedier payment merely gives you longer to fiddle with those wooden stirrers while you await your latte.Meanwhile, there are disadvantages. “Please treat your Starbucks Card like cash,” warns the small print. If you lose it the company won’t refund any money spent before it has been alerted. And if you decide you don’t like the coffee, Starbucks will not repay amounts under £5 in cash.If these cards proliferate, retailers had better find more compelling reasons for us to use them. Otherwise carry enough cash for a coffee and a debit card for the rest.Three-in-oneA colleague came out of church one Sunday morning to find Sister Mary in fits of giggles. When she regained the power of speech, she explained: “It’s Father John. The man understands the Trinity, he can cope with dividing God into Father, Son and Holy Spirit, but when it comes to the recycling, he can’t manage separating the paper, cans and bottles.”"
923;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Starbucks under pressure;;Like coffee, every growth story eventually gets stale. One might be forgiven for thinking that Starbucks has finally reached that point. Since its November high, shares in the coffee shop chain have declined more than 20 per cent. A leaked February memorandum from Howard Schultz, the venerable chairman of Starbucks, only made matters worse.It is hard to argue with Mr Schultz’s blunt assessment that the chain’s quest for growth and efficiencies has had its drawbacks. Convincing customers to pay up for “the Starbucks experience” is the core of its business model. Dilute the romance and it becomes difficult to charge top prices for coffee that most connoisseurs would describe as decent but unspectacular. Worse still, it opens the door for the likes of Dunkin’ Donuts and McDonald’s, whose premium coffee beat Starbucks in a recent survey in Consumer Reports, an influential US magazine, even on taste.The real trouble, however, may be that Starbucks shares still trade at a generous 35 times this year’s earnings. Growing into that valuation will certainly be challenging. In its US home market, most of the food items Starbucks has been adding tend to command lower margins. Wages and rents are rising. New stores risk cannibalising sales at existing ones. Starbucks’ expansion may also have left it more exposed to an economic downturn in the US.In other parts of the world, Starbucks is rarely perceived as the “friendly neighbourhood store” Mr Schultz likes to evoke. Its ultimate growth potential in continental Europe is questionable, while expansion in developing markets is likely to put further pressure on margins. To defend its rating, Starbucks has little choice but to keep on boosting both the number of its stores and the size of its menu. Anyone tempted to sample the offering might find that it eventually leaves a rather bitter taste.
924;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;"Banquet in Beijing; seminar in Singapore";;"In Singapore, I kept being told how fast China is modernising and changing. And it is true that the first thing that you see as you come out into the arrival hall at Beijing airport is that symbol of American-led globalisation – a giant Starbucks.But yesterday evening I went to an official banquet, where the official style was very Communist – and the food was like something from Britain in the 1950s.I should explain that I’m travelling with a small group of American and European think-tankers, sprinkled with a couple of diplomats. I am the lone journalist. Last night we had dinner with Zheng Bijian, who is chairman of the China Reform Forum and the man who coined the famous phrase “peaceful rise” to describe China’s emergence on the world stage. But apparently these days even “peaceful rise” is deemed to be too provocative, so the new formulation is “peaceful development with harmonious characteristics”. I feel more re-assured already.Verbal formulas are pretty important round here. On a couple of occasions last night, Mr Zheng told us gravely: “Taiwan is a core national interest for China. We have no room for manoeuvre on this issue.” In other words – if the bastards declare independence, we’re invading. Otherwise, he was affability itself. We got the usual toasts of friendship. And we also got nine courses of food – starting with cream of mushroom soup and ending with banana split; all washed down by a cabernet sauvignon with Chinese characteristics.By the end of the evening, the combination of an excess of food and drink, jet lag and four hours of discussion of Chinese foreign policy was making me feel pretty peculiar. I felt that I was on the verge of a major intellectual breakthrough – or physical and mental collapse. Possibly both.By the morning, however, I was rejuvenated. Our group went off to the headquarters of the People’s Liberation Army. This is another place where they do things in traditional style. There is a rocket-launcher in the forecourt; glassy-eyed sentries with fixed bayonets guarding the doors; and a gigantic, silent, marble-floored entry hall. Unfortunately, the briefing was “on background”. But I will devote my FT column next Tuesday to Chinese security issues.The question of how peaceful China’s rise will be was also the subject of our seminar in Singapore, organised by the Brookings Institution and the Lee Kuan Yew school of public policy. Generally speaking, the Americans were pretty wary, the Asians pretty sanguine and the Europeans faintly bemused.The Americans are very mindful of the big increase in Chinese military spending and are also worried by potential instability inside China – and any potential knock-on effects on Chinese foreign policy.Kishore Mahbubani of the Lee Kuan Yew school put a different gloss on events. He says that Asians generally “think that the Chinese are going to make it”: they will manage their peaceful rise. He also thinks that China’s neighbours take a largely benign view of its intentions, both in the region and around the world. But, as Mahbubani acknowledges, there are two big exceptions to this Asian optimism: Japan and Taiwan. And there is no doubt that the lone Japanese participant in the Singapore seminar sounded at least as anxious about China as the Americans.Certainly history suggests that the rise of a big new power is often a fairly fraught affair. I was indirectly reminded of this, when I went to have lunch in Beijing with Richard McGregor and Mure Dickie of the FT. Richard had thoughtfully bought me a present: a pirated DVD of Leni Riefenstahl’s “Triumph of the Will”, which he had picked up for a dollar in a local market. It’s good to know that the Chinese are so interested in European history."
925;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-01-30T15:33:10Z;Staff to get a taste of Starbucks;;"Starbucks, already at the forefront of one revolution in Chinese consumerism by introducing espressos and double decaf mochas to a nation of tea drinkers, is planning an equally big contribution to Chinese savings habits.The US company, with 4,000 staff on the mainland, is putting the finishing touches on a plan to offer share options to all employees in the mainland cafés that it controls, becoming one of the first multi-nationals in China to broaden incentive packages from the boardroom to the barista.The initiative is attracting a lot of attention because it brings together three important trends in the Chinese corporate world: the renewed interest in equities, the gradual relaxation of the country’s capital controls, and the fierce battle among multinationals to retain talented staff.According to Eden Woon, vice-president of Starbucks Greater China, staff will qualify for the options scheme if they have been employed by the company since April last year and work more than 20 hours a week. (Staff in Shanghai and Zheijiang and Jiangsu provinces will not be included as stores there belong to a franchise controlled by Uni-President of Taiwan.)The plan will bring China into line with the group’s “bean stock” incentive plan that has been in place in the US since 1991.The Starbucks options initiative is one of the most ambitious, but a number of other foreign companies are beginning to experiment with the idea of employee stock plans, particularly in the information technology sector.Computer-maker Dell awards stock options to its middle managers, while Intel encourages staff to take part in the company’s global stock options plan. Microsoft awards shares in the company to staff to award them for excellent performance.Share incentive plans are becoming more important to multinationals in China because of the intensifying battle to keep good staff. Rapid economic growth and heavy investment are allowing employees with strong credentials to change jobs regularly at ever-higher salaries, to the extent that the American Chamber of Commerce says staff retention is one of the biggest challenges facing US companies in China. Yet the market for people with the technical and language skills needed to prosper at a multinational is limited.The popularity of stock options became apparent when Ebay’s Chinese partner EachNet was acquired by Beijing-based Tom Online. EachNet employees took the unusual step earlier this month of posting an online letter of protest to Meg Whitman, Ebay’s chief executive, in which they asked to keep their Ebay stock options.The staff said the options were a way of boosting their income given that their base salaries were “far below those at other multinational companies in China”.One of the obstacles to issuing stock options to Chinese staff has been controls that China uses to prevent capital outflows, which limit the ability of employees to take foreign currency out of the country to exercise their options.To get around this restriction, some companies have introduced “cashless” op­tions, which allow employees to capture profits from selling shares in the company without actually exercising any options.Although this allows companies to provide some form of stock-related incentive, such plans have not encouraged employees to hold company shares for any length of time, one of the underlying motives behind stock options.Other companies have introduced phantom options that award bonuses to staff based on the performance of the share price; however, such incentives have to come out of a company’s profits, which makes them less attractive.But with its foreign currency reserves now exceeding $1,000bn, the Chinese government has begun to encourage larger outflows of domestic savings. It is putting in place rules that would allow Chinese citizens to take as much as $50,000 a year overseas. This should allow employees of multi-nationals to build a significant investment in their company’s stock.The Starbucks plan comes at a time when there is strong interest among Chinese companies in stock option plans. At the start of last year, the government gave preliminary approval to state-owned companies listed on the mainland to issue options to staff. Since then, more than 100 companies, including Baosteel, the country’s largest steel company, and white goods maker Haier have announced incentive plans, subject to final approval by the regulatorsFor the government, employee options could provide a way to improve corporate governance standards at listed companies. As well as giving executives a sense of ownership in the company, it could help control corruption. One explanation for widespread bribery among managers of state-owned companies is the low basic salaries many receive.Xue Zhongxing, at consulting group Jingbang in Shanghai, says the stock options will help bring the interests of managers at state-owned companies into line with those of the shareholders.However, critics have warned that the incentive plans at Chinese companies will have to be carefully monitored to prevent abuse. Without close supervision, they say, executive stock options could become as controversial as they are now in Starbucks’ home country."

927;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2007-01-26T15:53:47Z;Undercover economist: Keep it real;;"It stands to reason that distance is dead. Electronic communication is better and cheaper than it’s ever been. Sitting on the sofa just now, I used a cheap laptop computer to log on to my neighbour’s wireless network and order a free quad-band mobile phone that – I am told – will let me make calls and send e-mails from almost anywhere in the world.More to the point, nobody would be remotely surprised to hear it. Virtual worlds, BlackBerries, video-conferencing from the local Starbucks – it has all become so easy, and so commonplace, so quickly.Intuitively, that should mean that geography becomes less important. E-mail and video-conferencing mean fewer flights. No more business conferences or meetings at Davos. Telecommuters don’t need to clog up the roads, and property prices in London and New York should slide as people carry out their investment-banking responsibilities from Anglesey or Iowa.It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that there’s something wrong with this argument. Despite the ease of communication and the fall in the cost of transporting goods, for most people geography seems to be as important as ever. People haven’t stopped flying for meetings and conferences; the World Economic Forum meetings are now a round-the-calendar circus in more than 10 countries. New York is one of the few places in the US where the property market isn’t stuttering. In the US, a few hotspot cities are sucking in ever-larger concentrations of young educated workers.So what is happening? To some extent, the same thing that happened to the paperless office. It turned out that all those computers made it easy and cheap to produce a lot of documents. Yes, the documents could in principle have been viewed on screen, but why not print them out?Similarly, e-mail, internet networking and cheap phone calls have made it easy to maintain a lot of relationships. In principle some of them could be restricted to cyberspace, but how much fun is that? The same e-mail that allows you to maintain a long-distance business relationship also creates demand for more travel as people try to establish those relationships in the first place.Closer to home, communication technology makes it easier than ever to arrange a drink with friends. Just e-mail a distribution list or post the invitation on your online journal. This spontaneity isn’t much use if your friends are hundreds of miles away.E-mail and mobile phones aren’t substitutes for face-to-face contact at all. As the economists Jess Gaspar and Ed Glaeser have pointed out, they are complements to it.Other technological changes have also strengthened the importance of place. If you can buy cars or films or insurance from anywhere in the world, why not buy from the place that hosts the best or cheapest producer? Cities that were once nationally dominant can become international champions too. It becomes more valuable, not less valuable, to locate in New York or London.Face-to-face meetings have always fostered trust and clearer communication. Nicholas Crafts, an economic historian who recently concluded a talk at Oxford with the message “Distance is alive and well,” believes that this is crucial.The modern economy demands ever more complicated, fast-moving and creative projects. Formal contracts just aren’t up to the task of keeping us honest in these circumstances, which means you need to be able to trust your colleagues – something that still requires you to look them in the eyes. The conference circuit is likely to be with us for a while."
928;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Courts define area between life and work;;"Forget work-life balance: America was founded on the notion that life is work, and work is life. Even in a world before CrackBerry – that craving for another e-mail fix – we Americans never knew the difference.But now, as broadband spreads through the heartland of the Protestant ethic, courts are increasingly confronting a quintessentially un-American question: when does work end and life begin? These days, more and more Americans work from the bedroom, the car, the beach or Starbucks. But when work is no longer a place, what are its boundaries?In America, this is the kind of existential question that judges and juries simply cannot resist. So now, in the early broadband era, US courts are trying to set some hard and fast guidelines for the work-life divide.Bosses, co-workers, spouses and friends may secretly suspect that working from home is not a real job, merely a form of subsidised sloth. But the courts seem pretty clear about it: telework is just like any other form of wage slavery. All the usual rules apply – and ignoring them can cost employers many millions of dollars.An upcoming study from WorldatWork, a human resources group that studies American telecommuting, finds a sharp rise in the number of US workers whose employers allow them to work from home, from 9.9m in 2005 to 12.4m last year – a 63 per cent increase over the 2004 figure of 7.6m. Add in another 16m self-employed telecommuters, and some 29m people are teleworking at least one day a month – nearly 20 per cent of the workforce.WorldatWork says the increase is driven not just by technology (the rise in broadband and wireless internet penetration in American neighbourhoods) but also by those old work-life balance blues. Throw in the cost of petrol, the clogging of ever more traffic arteries – and a dash of social angst at global warming – and it starts to seem odd that the other 80 per cent of the workforce is still stuck in an office.But teleworking is no panacea – certainly not for employers faced with new forms of legal liability for what all those teleslaves are doing when everyone else is safely behind a desk.Are they taking their lunch breaks? If not, that could trigger massive liability under federal and state wage and hour law. Do they have to be paid even though the company’s computer servers are down, and they cannot possibly be working? One class-action lawsuit filed recently in California tests that seminal issue of the telework era: who pays for computer downtime? Where does
real life end and telework begin?Everyone – from auto insurance claims adjusters to pharmaceutical sales representatives to technical support geeks – seems to be getting in on the new mini-litigation boom in the telework sector. Much of the litigation turns on whether the strict overtime provisions of federal and state wage and hour law apply to teleworkers – and not every court has found in their favour.But if employers lose such cases, it can cost them millions, since large numbers of workers and stiff penalties are often involved.So what is a boss to do? Employment lawyers say companies need clear written rules for teleworkers covered by wage and hour laws – such as a ban on overtime and mandated meal breaks.But how would they enforce such rules? Call all those stay-at-home mums doing a bit of claims adjusting on the side and ask whether they have had their noontime salad yet? Under federal law, it is not enough just to forbid someone from becoming a workaholic. If a manager knows that hourly employees are regularly working through their lunch and cigarette breaks – even at home – the company can be liable.And what about workplace safety? The dreaded OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the federal workplace regulator) does not inspect home offices, but that does not get employers off the hook. Once again, the lawyers say employers should have strict rules about home office safety, but what does that mean: reminding home workers every six months to check their smoke detector batteries? What if the teleworking mum takes a minute to throw in a load of laundry and breaks a leg falling down the stairs to the laundry room? What if other injuries occur, that cross the blurry line between life and work – say the claims-adjusting mum’s toddler trips over the cord to her CrackBerry cradle and breaks a tooth, or worse?As always in America, where there is uncertainty – and new forms of social organisation, such as telecommuting – there are lawsuits. But the idea of teleworking is no new thing: it has been an intermittent fad since the 1970s.It is time the courts caught up – before broadband makes us all workers without borders."

It won’t, but it might weaken their grip.The big brands have one huge advantage: they offer consistency. If you go to one of the well-known pizza, fast food or sandwich outlets, you know what you will get. Same if you go to one of the big hotel chains. You will not necessarily get the best, but if you don’t know any better, you will be safe. That is where the web comes in: it can make sure you do know better.If you click around, you will find review sites for pretty much anything. Products make up one side of it, but here the choice is nearly always between one big brand and another. I am more interested in areas where there is a genuine choice between multiple chains and the little guy, because here there is still a battle to be fought. If I can use my computer (or my mobile phone/PDA) to find that little gem round the corner, why would I go to the bland chain I know so well?Say I want a nice cup of tea and a bun in the morning. I am in London, so I go to the London Review of Breakfasts (londonreviewofbreakfasts.blogspot.com). This is a swishly designed blog site that likes to lay on the prose: “We love going out for breakfast. We love the hungry hours of anticipation …” Its subject is the ‘greasy spoon’, cheap and cheerful cafés that may well sell wonderful tea and buns, but may equally be dreadful. Here you can pick an area, see what cafés are reviewed, and find out about them. Or rather find out the opinion of one person, written with a nom de plume and rather stylishly (I suspect there may be rather fewer authors than there are authors’ names).But as this is a blog there is space for comment, which is where it starts to get interesting. My local café has a glowing write-up from ‘Herby Banger’, followed by two comments. One agrees it is wonderful, the other says it is a huge disappointment. Were I coming to my area, I wouldn’t rush to the place, because I don’t have enough information; the chain coffee shop on the high street might still draw me in.Nevertheless, we are in the early days of sites such as these and they will (I hope) grow. I found similar sites from Australia (thebreakfastblog.blogspot.com) and Canada (www.breakfastblogger.com), as well as a UK-based blog (www.eggbaconchipsandbeans.com) run by the author Russell Davies. The problem is that they all have too few reviews to provide a decent consensus. What I want is a café version of TripAdvisor, which is the mummy and daddy of user-provided review sites. It belongs to Expedia, the travel booking site, and is closely integrated into it – but as Expedia is an agent rather than a provider of facilities there is not (or should not be) any conflict of interest. No sign certainly that criticism is being censored.TripAdvisor (www.tripadvisor.com or www.tripadvisor.co.uk) says that it has ‘5m+ traveller reviews and opinions of hotels, vacations and more’. Volume of comments is not a problem. Look for New York hotels, and after a couple of clicks you will find reviews of 329, ranked by popularity. You can filter these by neighbourhood, price and star rating. The top rated hotel is the Sofitel New York, which shows that in the hotel world at least, chains can still be best. You can read 570 reviews of the Sofitel, each accompanied by ‘Liked’ and ‘Disliked’ comments, as well as ‘Tips/secrets’. The ratings are gathered together to show which type of visitor is likely to appreciate the hotels (couples/romantics apparently).TripAdvisor uses the full panoply of webbery to make the reviews more useful: information on the contributor (location, other reviews), hotel photos and ‘candid traveller photos’. Park 79 hotel (208th in the popularity index) shows what appears to be a door leaning up against a wall, along with a very mixed set of comments. You would have to read them carefully before deciding whether the pros were more important to you than the cons – but the information is all here. Of course you may decide that it’s safer to go to a chain you know, but at least you have the choice.Let’s assume that other review site become big and useful too, what sort of groups should be shaking in their branded boots? Sandwich bar chains are starting to eat into an area traditionally run by independents, so in London I would be looking at Gutter EATS (www.guttereats.co.uk), ‘the new way to find your lunch online’. This smart site lets you choose a district, see the outlets with the most stars, and read about them. The reviews are too few and too short to be a great help at the moment, but if word spreads I can see this being a real challenge to the chains (which are reviewed, but generally get dusty write-ups).As for pizzerias, in the UK a few big chains dominate; in the US I am told they have about half the market. TripAdvisor is starting to help, though in an unstructured way: I put ‘New York pizzerias’ into its search box and found 125 reviews. But there is always someone prepared to dedicate an implausible amount of time to anything at all, which is why I was not surprised to find Slice (www.sliceny.com),which call itself ‘America’s favorite pizza weblog’. It too is somewhat unstructured – more like a diary-style blog than a set of reviews – but there is a huge amount here. When Mr Slice gets his pizza map of New York working properly, this will be a seriously useful site.So there we are. The big brands can be challenged by the web, or rather by The People using the web. TripAdvisor must already be having an effect on the way people choose hotels, and the brands must be smarting. Am I being a hopeless optimist in believing that the onward march of the giants is unstoppable? I don’t think so, I really don’t.David Bowen is a website effectiveness consultant for Bowen Craggs & Co (www.bowencraggs.com). dbowen@bowencraggs.com"
930;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Enodis bolsters takeover defences;;Enodis on Tuesday said it would spend up to £130m on a share buyback programme and acquisitions as it bolstered its defences against would-be suitors.The world’s leading supplier of commercial cooking and refrigeration equipment is currently being stalked by Aga Foodservice, its UK rival, which last week raised its cash-and-shares offer to value Enodis at about 194p a share, or just under £790m, in a combined cash and share bid..Aga has until 11 December to make a formal bid but Dave McCulloch, Enodis chief executive, rejected the approach from his rival, which is about two-thirds Enodis’ size, as “not serious”.Over the summer, Enodis saw off two US rivals, Middleby and Manitowoc, which had indicated they were prepared to pay 195p and 220p, respectively.The approaches earlier this year prompted Enodis’ management to look at increasing returns to shareholders and review its strategy.Mr McCulloch insisted the company would look beyond small, bolt-on acquisitions. “We will be monitoring larger opportunities but these are very limited in number,” he said.He defended the company’s strategy of building close relationships with the big global chains, including McDonald’s and Starbucks, in a highly fragmented supplier market - Enodis is thought to be number one with a 7 per cent global market share.“Anyone who thinks they can consolidate this industry by making one or two acquisitions is badly mistaken,” Mr McCullocj told the Financial Times.The company unveiled its defence as it reported a sharp jump in full-year profits, driven by strong global demand and ahead of expectations. The shares rose slightly in late morning trading up ¾p to 200¾p.Pre-tax profits rose to £62.2m in the 12 months to the end of September, from £15.1m a year earlier, driven by strong operational performance, sharply reduced exceptional charges and lower financing costs. Underlying profits rose 45 per cent to £64m (£44.1m) on revenues up 15 per cent to £768m (£668m). Basic earnings per share were 9.7p (6.3p).Enodis plans to increase gearing to buy back up to 10 per cent of its shares in the next 12 months at a cost of around £80m. The higher leveraging of the balance sheet would also make £50m available for acquisitions in the first year but that number is likely to be bolstered by strong cash flows. Net debt levels are expected to increase net debt to around £170m, from £42m at the end of September.The company also raised its long-term margin target to 14 per cent and said it would hit its old 12 per cent target in 2009 against 10.7 per cent for the year to September.Mr McCulloch said the company was “off to a good start” and experiencing “strong” order rates in the current financial year. Enodis raised its final dividend 67 per cent to 2.17p from 1.3p, giving a total of 3p (2p). The company also plans to cut its dividend cover from 3 to 2.5 times over the next two years.
931;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T05:18:24+0000;Deflation danger still lurks in Japan economy;;Core consumer prices rose 0.2 per cent in September, less than expected, suggesting that Japan has not yet moved decisively out of deflation.The yen weakened against both the euro and the dollar as markets gambled that the weaker than expected inflation number would make it harder for the Bank of Japan to raise rates again this year. The currency fell to a record low against the euro of Y150.8 and to Y118.5 against the dollar.Analysts say the yen’s weakness is partly explained by the carry trade, in which investors borrow in Japan, where interest rates are ¼ per cent, and buy higher-yielding assets abroad.Richard Jerram, economist at Macquarie Securities, said: “This tells you that there’s still very, very little inflation in the economy.” But he said that, with the prospect of inflation edging up from November, the BoJ might still press ahead with another quarter-point rate rise before the year’s end.Excluding energy and fresh food prices, the US ­definition of core inflation, consumer prices fell 0.5 per cent in September against the previous year. Shinzo Abe’s new administration has made it clear it does not want another rate increase before deflation is decisively beaten, but has also indicated it will refrain from interfering with central bank independence.Core consumer prices were dragged down by falling prices of electronic goods, such as flat-screen televisions, as well as the lower cost of mobile phone services. The weight of these items has increased since the government rebased its CPI calculations to take account of recent spending patterns.The BoJ expects the effect of last year’s cut in mobile phone charges, which may have knocked 0.15 points off inflation, to drop out of the index from November.However, this week, Softbank, the third-biggest mobile phone provider, said it would cut prices sharply in a move that could spark another round of price wars.Elsewhere, there are some tentative signs of mild inflation. Next month, Starbucks will raise prices for the first time since it opened in Japan 10 years ago, with a short latte due to go up from Y340 to Y360. Tokyo utility companies have announced price rises of 1-2 per cent, while the trucking association is pushing for a price increase of 10-20 per cent.However, energy prices could be the decisive factor. Jesper Koll, economist at Merrill Lynch, said that, if oil prices continued to fall, the inflation rate could turn negative again next year.Mr Jerram said the potentially large impact of individual items such as telephone charges, rice and oil on the CPI showed there was a “low cushion against renewed consumer price deflation”.As a critic of the BoJ’s reluctance to adopt an inflation target, he said: “With price stability defined as a range between 0 per cent and 2 per cent, there is no barrier to prevent deflation being caused by short-term events.”The core CPI for Tokyo in October, which comes out a month ahead of national statistics, was up 0.1 per cent from a year earlier, down 0.1 excluding energy costs. In September it was stagnant.
932;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Technology takes coins from change jar;;"Bank of America’s Keep the Change debit card may be one of the most culturally esoteric products in the history of retail banking.The card, advertised on trains, taxis and telephone booths across New York, works just like a normal debit card – except that it automatically rounds up the value of any transaction to the nearest
dollar, and then transfers the balance from the customer’s current account to their
savings.So instead of paying $11.31 for a de luxe hamburger and soda, you pay $12 and the extra 69 cents goes into savings.The card is a somewhat perverse tribute to the change jar, a largely unsung icon of America’s domestic economy, used to hoard the pennies, nickels and dimes that seem to pervade everyday life.There are no official figures but Coinstar, a Nasdaq-listed company with revenues of $460m last year, estimates that $10.5bn worth of coins is idling in the US at any one time.Coinstar’s US coin-counting machines, mostly based in supermarkets, processed more than $2.3bn in change last year, issuing vouchers that can be redeemed for cash or used against purchases. The company, which also began operating coin machines in the UK in 2001, charges customers 8.9 cents per dollar for the privilege.The lure of Coinstar’s home-stored lucre has attracted Amazon, Apple, Starbucks and other retailers, which now have deals that allow counted coins to be turned into e-commerce shopping vouchers and in-store gift cards.Commerce Bank, a New Jersey-based regional bank, has also installed free coin-counting machines in its lobbies – all part of its drive to project a customer-friendly image.One theory for America’s deluge of coins blames state sales tax, which is generally added on top of any advertised price. A customer who prepares two dollar bills to pay for a $1.99 drink ends up fumbling for another bill when the cash register rings up a new total of $2.16.With no one keeping track, it is hard to trace trends. But over the past 20 years, opportunities to dispense change have diminished. City buses in New York used to take coins but now accept only prepaid cards. Toll barriers operate with smart cards. Public phones still take quarters, dimes and nickels, but who uses them? Tipping helps to keep things under control, yet still the change builds up.If technology has accelerated the growth of the American change mountain, it now also threatens its future. The big three credit card networks – Visa, Mastercard and American Express – have launched new, contactless credit cards (with a wireless chip) aimed at persuading people to use cards for smaller transactions – to buy hamburgers, theatre tickets and petrol.So there will not be any change. Not a cent. But with the advent of the virtual change jar, who needs it?

933;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-10-26T17:11:02Z;The Short View: Corporate America - red or blue?;;Should investors care about the political beliefs of executives? According to the managers of the Blue Fund, a mutual fund launched in the US in time for the mid-term elections, they should. The name (as in “blue states”) shows it is designed for Democrats. But its also shows republicans how to invest in line with their politics.Blue Fund looks at the political donations a company has made from corporate political action committees, and from the pockets of its three most senior executives. It argues that companies that consistently give the bulk of their political donations to one party, even when they are out of power (excluding those bidding for a share of the pork barrel), show true commitment.The research has yielded lists of “red” and “blue” companies, which gave 95 per cent of their donations to Republicans and Democrats respectively over the past 10 years. The bluest include Google, Apple Computer, Starbucks and Costco. The reddest include Exxon Mobil, Union Pacific, International Paper, Halliburton and Dell.Democrats will be pleased to know that the index of 76 “blue” companies has thrashed its “red” rivals under the Bush administration. Over the five years to June this year, the blue index gained 139 per cent, compared with 34 per cent for the S&P 500, which in turn beat the red index. Even excluding recent stars Google and Apple, the blues are easily ahead.How seriously should we take this? It may be a fluke. Republicans could argue that after such a rally it looks time to sell blue stocks, and they should dispute the Blue Fund’s contention that Apple’s principles have helped it to be more innovative than Dell. Dell’s political conservatism did not stop it from revolutionising its industry in the 1990s.Over a longer period, Dell and Apple do look principled. Both have been donating against their apparent self-interest. Under President Bill Clinton, Dell grew at 93.8 per cent per year, according to Bloomberg data, while Apple fell at a 4.6 per cent annual clip. Under President George W. Bush, Dell has limped along at 3.8 per cent a year, while Apple grew at 47.5 per cent. Go figure.
934;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-10-26T00:50:04Z;Indian regulation hampers retail growth;;"Barely a week goes by in India without a foreign retailer announcing some kind of plan to tap the country’s burgeoning consumer market.This week, there was talk of Starbucks entering India in 2007 while Spain’s Inditex, owner of the Zara brand, said last week it was targeting the country.But protectionist regulations have meant that the world’s biggest retail names remain conspicuously absent. Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, last week had to be content with an announcement that it was increasing its sourcing from India. It is an issue that irks some foreign retailers.“Why should the Indian people have inferior shopping?” asks Roger Corbett, consultant to Australia’s Woolworths, the country’s largest retailer, on a retail partnership with India’s Tata Group. “Why shouldn’t they have the benefit that international retailers would bring to India?”Organised retailing is virtually virgin territory in India, accounting for only about 3 per cent of the estimated US$200bn in annual sales generated by the sector. But this is growing fast and could reach 10 per cent of $400bn by 2010.There is no shortage of domestic operators targeting the market. Reliance Industries, one of India’s biggest conglomerates, is expected shortly to begin rolling out a $5.6bn retail network.Bharti Enterprises, run by telecoms tycoon Sunil Bharti Mittal, says it is talking to Wal-Mart, the UK’s Tesco and France’s Carrefour about partnerships but, as with Reliance, the details remain sketchy.The most concrete plan announced to date is that of the Tata Group, another of the country’s biggest industrial entities. Its Infiniti unit is rolling out electronics and consumer durable stores, with Woolworths acting as its back-end logistics agent.However, it is clear that Mr Corbett, who in September retired as chief executive of Woolworths and is now an independent consultant reporting to the Australian retailer’s chairman, would like to do more if only the regulations allowed it.Foreign multi-brand operators, such as Woolworths, Wal-Mart, Tesco and others, are barred from setting up and running their own stores in India until at least 2009.Mr Corbett warned that such protectionism was a threat to India’s economic growth and its efforts to gain access to foreign markets.“What’s going to happen if the government doesn’t accelerate the reform process is that there is going to be a logjam somewhere. Growth will stop,” Mr Corbett says.“If it [India] wants access to other markets, it has got to give access to its markets both at a capital and a product level. And if it does so then the Indian economy will continue to grow,” he says.The leftist allies of India’s ruling Congress party worry that large foreign retailers will drive the country’s millions of corner-store vendors out of business.Analysts say, however, that such fears are based on “fuzzy logic”. Small operators will have more to fear from groups such as Reliance, whose local knowledge will enable them to build scale more quickly than foreign groups.For his part, Mukesh Ambani, the head of Reliance Industries, says he is not against foreign direct investment in retail, which he says “must happen”. But he rejects arguments that regulations barring foreigners for the time being will give domestic groups an unfair advantage.“I think there is nothing like a first-mover advantage. In today’s world, the consumer will test you everyday,” he says.Ravi Raheja, group president of K Raheja Corp, one of Mumbai’s leading developers and retail operators, says he favours FDI as long as the market is given proper guidance on the expected timing and manner of any opening.But he says the current concern over protectionism is overdone, with most foreign retailers bar a few names already able to gain access through licensing or franchising or other arrangements. The delay in access would also not unduly hurt the chances of foreign operators when they did finally enter.“I don’t think they’ll be a long way behind. I just think the Indians won’t be so far behind them,” Mr Raheja says. As for the small shop-
owners, Woolworths’ Mr Corbett says it is a market reality that some of them will be swept aside by the rise of organised retailing.But Ranjan Biswas, partner and markets leader at professional services firm Ernst & Young, says the backlash will be limited. The existing small shopkeepers will adapt by becoming franchises for chains such as 7-Eleven or finding other such roles.“Don’t forget that the small shopkeeper is the face everybody knows. The neighbourhood has been coming to him for the past 25 years,” says Mr Biswas."
935;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
936;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-10-19T17:25:25Z;Ambitions of India’s retail revolutionary;;"For future archivists of India’s economic development in the 21st century, exhibit one may well be a scribbled-on napkin from a Washington DC Starbucks.It was just over a year ago, on July 18 2005, as President George W. Bush discussed the details of an historic civil nuclear agreement with Manmohan Singh, India’s prime minister. Two billionaire businessmen from the Indian delegation stepped out for a cup of coffee.The two men were Mukesh Ambani, probably the most powerful businessman in India, and Nandan Nilekani, celebrated chief executive of software giant Infosys. For Mr Ambani it was a chance to update Mr Nilekani on his plans for his half of Reliance Industries.A few weeks before, the petrochemicals to telecoms conglomerate created by his late father, Dhirubhai Am­bani, had been split in two to resolve a feud with his younger brother Anil.Mr Ambani, who retained Reliance’s petrochemical and refining businesses, told Mr Nilekani of his plans to revolutionise Indian retailing, a sector dominated by millions of “mom and pop” stores and unchanged in 200 years.Organised retailing still accounts for only about 3 per cent of the industry’s $250bn (£134bn) revenues. India is one of the most fragmented and archaic markets in the world. Although malls are springing up, supermarkets barely exist outside the four largest cities.Mr Nilekani, who spends his life picking apart and redesigning supply chains, grabbed a pen. Drawing arrows and lines to connect India’s farmers to their market of 1.1bn consumers, he urged Mr Ambani to focus less on the big box at the front end of the supply chain and more on the hidden logistics critical to bringing world-class retailing to a country with negligible rural infrastructure.“I still have that napkin,” says Mr Ambani in the Mumbai headquarters of his group, which turns over $20bn a year. In the coming weeks, the concept will be put to the test with the opening of the first few stores, to be branded Reliance Fresh, in three pilot states: Punjab, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh.Mr Ambani has committed to investing $5bn-$6bn to create, within five years,
a national “farm-to-fork” enterprise that he says will redefine India’s largest business group. The strategy has the backing of a government keen to push the development of impoverished rural sector.The scale of Mr Ambani’s ambition is legendary. In the 1990s he earned his spurs by masterminding the construction of a massive refinery at Jamnagar in Gujarat. At a time when refining was seen as a declining, low-margin industry, this was a business decision from left field.In an equally ambitious venture, India’s Mr Big, as he was called on a recent cover of BusinessWeek, is developing infrastructure for a new industrial and IT city near Mumbai.“Mukesh Ambani wants to be the richest man in the world,” says Adil Zainulbhai, head of McKinsey’s India practice. “Being in India today is like being in the US in the wild days of the dotcom era, when people got up and said, ‘I can change the world.’ Indian chief executives have outrageous aspirations. They have no fear. And Mukesh is just the biggest of them all.”No sector is set to change more than the retail sector. For India’s estimated 10m small shopkeepers, many of them first-time entrepreneurs who have left low-paying rural jobs, Reliance’s retail launch will sound the starting gun for a breakneck consolidation.Analysts forecast organised retailing’s share will rise rapidly to 10-12 per cent in five years. The new chains, benefiting from scale economies and access to better terms of trade and finance, will put local shopkeepers to the wall.For Indian businessmen such as Mr Ambani, the attractions of the retail sector are obvious. Foreign retailers are for the moment largely shut out by the country’s restrictive investment rules. Supermarket groups such as Carrefour, Wal-Mart and Tesco that sell a range of branded products to end consumers are completely barred. Only single-brand retailers such as Louis Vuitton, irrelevant to the mass retail market, and cash-and-carry wholesalers such as Metro, have so far been allowed into India.“It’s the wild west in the retail sector, completely open, and if you’ve got an idea that is better than somebody else’s you’ll succeed,” says Mr Zainulbhai.Protectionist policies have afforded Reliance and others three to five years’ grace to establish themselves. Mr Ambani says he doesn’t fear the arrival of global players. “[Foreign direct investment] must happen. We must open up the retail sector. India’s market potential is huge and there is space for at least five to six players.”Indian business houses are courting major foreign retailers that are looking to gain a foothold in a market with attractive long-term prospects. Yet Reliance is seen as the Indian group best placed to go it alone.Reliance is confident it can acquire the skills, technology and knowhow without foreign direct investment in its retail subsidiary. “This is a mature industry with thousands of man years of management experience and we have hired guys from Wal-Mart, Tesco and Carrefour,” Mr Ambani says.The key challenge facing Mr Ambani and his rivals is India’s infrastructure bottleneck. Average freight costs as a percentage of imports are 10 per cent in India, compared with a global average of 6 per cent, according to Morgan Stanley. India invested $10.9bn, or only 1.4 per cent of gross domestic product in all forms of transport infrastructure in the last fiscal year, compared with $95.7bn, or 4.3 per cent of GDP, for China.Moreover, Reliance will not have the retail market to itself. Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman of telecoms group Bharti Enterprises, has said he is talking to Wal-Mart, Tesco and Carrefour about a partnership. Tata Group, another of India’s largest conglomerates, recently launched an electronics and consumer durables chain with Australia’s Woolworths running its supply chain.Most analysts believe Reliance will have an advantage. Before the group was split up, Mr Ambani and his brother Anil rolled out a national mobile telephony network from scratch. Today it is the second largest in the country.“Reliance has great experience in the telephony business, which allows them to understand how retailers and consumers think,” says Ranjan Biwas, partner and markets leader at Ernst & Young, the professional services firm.Mr Ambani seems more willing to invest than his competitors. He argues that the Indian farmer is a largely untapped resource – essentially efficient but lacking cost-effective ways of getting goods to the market. Building the links between the farmer and the consumer will cost billions of dollars, which means the losers in Indian retail will be those who blink first.“That’s Mukesh’s strategy: put a lot of money in and see if you can scare off everyone,” says Mr Zainulbhai. Never has so much ridden on a napkin.When 400,000 apply for the jobFor India’s largest companies, scaling up operations to the size Mukesh Ambani envisages in the retail sector takes more than just capital – it requires tens of thousands of qualified staff.The problem is acute in a sector such as organised retail, which will have to compete for a similar talent pool with established industries such as banking.“There aren’t enough good people to be running these businesses, especially of this scale,” says Ranjan Biwas of Ernst & Young.Yet India’s new retailers can take lessons from other sectors in managing the talent issue. ICICI Group, which owns India’s largest private bank, two large insurance companies and a brokerage, is used to large-scale recruitment – it expects to add 30,000 to 40,000 employees a year for the next three to five years as it expands into new areas of India’s underdeveloped financial market.The group receives 400,000 CVs a year through an internet portal, which automatically filters them down to 100,000 before dividing them into different “buckets” according to a candidate’s education, skills and experience.K. Ramkumar, head of human resources at ICICI, says the group tests candidates online before calling in a staggering 50,000 to 60,000 for face-to-face interviews.Tata Consultancy Services, the country’s largest information technology outsourcing company, added 8,919 people in the past quarter, bringing its total workforce to 78,028 people.S. Padmanabhan, global head of human resources at TCS, says making an offer to a candidate is far from the end of the process: “The demand is so much that the candidate usually has more than one offer in hand at any time.”This means the company has to be innovative to ensure the candidate is hired, even going so far as sending birthday greetings to potential recruits to make them “feel welcome”."

Labour MP Siôn Simon’s spoof is not the wittiest effort nor in the best of taste, although there was a point struggling to be made there. Dave is not just like the rest of us and he does push the happy family life bit a little too far.Simon’s friend Tom Watson’s “welcome to watsocam”, is more tasteful, if duller, and the yellow rubber gloves and Starbucks coffee mug are nice touches. But Cameron set himself up and he has to face the consequences.Still, the Tory leadership has found a silver lining – visits to the real thing have shot up. Well, you can’t appreciate the spoofs unless you’ve seen the original.Not a screw upYou have to admire Peter Mobbs, a surgeon at the Whiston Hospital on Merseyside, for finding a pragmatic solution to a tricky problem.He was mid-operation on a man who had had a metal plate inserted in his arm while abroad that needed to be removed.Once he’d opened up, he found the plate had been secured with a kind of screw that none of his tools could undo. Rather than quit mid-procedure, wake up the patient and reschedule the operation – at considerable cost, one imagines – he asked an assistant to drive to the B&Q d-i-y store in nearby St Helens and buy a screwdriver. After he returned with the necessary equipment, price £2.50, the screwdriver was sterilised and the operation completed to the patient’s satisfaction.The incident was reported to the
St Helens and Knowsley NHS Trust’s medical director, who wisely decided that the Trust did not need to take any action against Mobbs. B&Q is more generous, joking: “We should send him a set of Allen keys.”Meanwhile, the episode suggests a new line of business for B&Q. Perhaps it could stock a range of scalpels, rib-stretchers and forceps that could be useful for home improvers as well as doctors, while NHS procurement seems a good business, judging by the DHL move. At least it offers B&Q a splendid opportunity for an advertising campaign, along the lines of when you need that special tool, in a hurry, come to B&Q.Perils of spellingWe’ve all been there, and spellcheck has a lot to answer for. Andrew Sentance, one of the two new appointees to the monetary policy committee, was up before the Treasury select committee on Thursday. He sent in his CV to the committee first, and naturally when it was printed, his name appeared as Sentence. The blame apparently lies with the committee’s spellcheck that decided to amend his – to a computer – obviously incorrectly spelt name.Just occasionally though, spellcheck throws up some delightful alternatives when it cannot recognise a word. Try inserting “obituarists” and if your spellcheck is like the Financial Times’ you will be offered “bittersweets”, a somehow apposite word given the nature of an obituary writer’s work. Any other examples of spellcheck producing a variant with a particular poignancy about it?Lush placesWhat price a one-bedroom, riverside home in Surrey? A mere £350 when it’s for an otter, provided by the Surrey Wildlife Trust and funded by Thames Water.The two are collaborating on a project to provide resting places for otters on rivers, including the Thames, which are now full of fish but where riverbanks no longer offer scope for the animals to find safe homes.Chris Matcham, the Otters and Rivers Project Officer for the trust, who says that Surrey currently has at most three otters, has designed a holt made from recycled plastic that offers advantages over more traditional man-made otter homes. After trying it out at the British Wildlife Centre, where an otter called Minnie quickly took up residence, Matcham is hoping to install several up and down riverbanks. A dog otter, he says informatively, can have a territory extending to 25 miles of bank and likes to have a couple of dozen safe houses to take a nap in."

939;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Panera cooks up strong sales but short-sellers leave a bad taste;;Panera Bread, one of the leading “fast casual” restaurant chains in the US, and Starbucks, the world’s largest specialty coffee chain, last week both reported surprisingly strong September same-store sales, offering encouraging signs of the health of the US consumer sector.In recent months, pressures on consumer spending, largely due to higher energy costs, have hurt sales growth at many retailers and restaurants. Yet, Panera reported that September same-store sales – from restaurants open for at least 18 months – rose 5.9 per cent. The solid growth followed paltry gains of 1.8 per cent and 1.3 per cent in July and August, respectively. The news sent its shares up 11 per cent in one day.By trading close last Friday, Panera’s shares were about 33 times estimated 2006 earnings. While the company has performed well over the past five years, some investors are worried about future growth and the fact that newer stores are doing less business, on average, than those opened before 2005.Short-sellers are betting the once high-flying stock, which has lost about 15 per cent of its value since April, is heading lower.“Anybody who has shorted this stock because it’s at a high P/E - other than people who are trading intra-day or intra-month - anybody who has bet this company isn’t going to make it has obviously been proven wrong,” Ron Shaich, chief executive, told the FT.“The stock is up 20-fold since 1999. I don’t run this company to beat the shorts or deal with the bulls, that’s what the market does. I care about the concept and the execution,” he added.This year the specialty sandwich chain, which serves antibiotic-free chicken and whole-grain breads, eliminated trans fat from its menu.“We look for the deeper trends and one of the trends is that there is a fundamental distrust in the food production system in this country,” Mr Shaich said. “We began to recognise the most important thing going on in nutrition is that there are good carbs and bad carbs and good fats and bad fats and you’ve got to exercise. We come from being on the side of the good carbs and the good fats.”The average sales per Panera restaurant is about $2m - higher than its industry peers. But at newly opened restaurants, slower sales are a potential worry. “New unit sales are now 9 per cent below the chain average and steadily deteriorating as the year has progressed,” John Glass, analyst at CIBC World Markets, said in a report.“We’re increasingly concerned that the company’s accelerated unit growth is taking its toll on the quality of sales at new units.”Mr Shaich said questions about the productivity of new stores versus older one is like ”comparing apples to oranges”.“Our stores open. The first year they settle down a little bit, the second year they go up about 10 per cent, the third year they go up about 10 per cent,” he said.“If you compare a store open this year to a store open three years ago, by its very nature it will be lower. But that has been exactly the pattern now for many, many years.”Panera has 976 bakery-cafes, of which 353 are company-operated and 623 are owned by franchisees. Next month it plans to open its 1,000th location. “This is the early innings of our growth. We’re only in 60 per cent of the US,” Mr Shaich said. “My responsibility as a CEO is discipline. Many growth companies basically choke on the opportunities in front of them.”
940;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-10-05T22:52:27Z;Starbucks investors find sales are to their taste;;Shares of Starbucks, the world’s largest specialty coffee chain, rose sharply on Thursday as investors cheered stronger-than-expected September same-store sales.Starbucks said late on Wednesday that sales at stores open at least 13 months had increased 6 per cent from last time, helped by the return of its popular Pumpkin Spice Latte. The gain beat Wall Street’s estimate of 3.4 per cent growth.Steven Kron, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said September sales were “phenomenal”. He told clients the results reflected “some economic relief” on the part of consumers who had been under pressure over the summer as oil prices rose. The recent cooler weather also eased demand for cold, blended drinks.“Not uncharacteristically, espresso-based beverages, as well as bakery and lunch, were among top contributors to September results,” he said.In July, Starbucks’ same-stores sales rose just 4 per cent, the smallest sales increase since 2001. The slowdown in sales growth sent its stock tumbling.The company blamed the sluggish sales on brisk demand for cold, blended drinks, such as Frappuccinos, which slowed service during the busy morning hours, created bottlenecks and long queues, and drove away some customers.But some analysts suggested the weak sales indicated Starbucks customers might be cutting back on discretionary spending amid the surge in energy prices.In August the company reported a 5 per cent increase in same-store sales.Separately, Starbucks on Thursday said it wanted to have 40,000 stores around the world, 10,000 more than its previous target. The stores are expected to be evenly split between the US and overseas.“We’ve seen the Starbucks experience become universally accepted around the world,” Jim Donald, chief executive, told investors at its biennial meeting.Starbucks’ shares closed up 7.6 per cent at $38.69.

943;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-09-18T21:01:08Z;The Wal-Mart Effect;;"More than half of all Americans live within five miles of a Wal-Mart store, less than a ten-minute drive away. Ninety percent of Americans live within fifteen miles of a Wal-Mart. On the nation’s interstates, it is rare to go a quarter hour without seeing a Wal-Mart truck.Wal-Mart now has 3,811 stores in the United States (including 10 in Alaska and 9 in Hawaii); that is more than one Wal-Mart store for every single county in the country. The stores are so large that they do not fade into the landscape the way that Starbucks and McDonald’s do. The stores sit on vast aprons of asphalt parking, usually .at a slightly different grade from the nearby roads, so they look dug into the ground or popped out of it. Wal-Mart stores aren’t just big inside; they present big, flat planes of concrete - sides and roofs - which catch the eye because they are out of scale. You do not pass a Wal-Mart without noticing it. The stores have a gravitational force, bending the land, the circulation, the rhythms of the communities where they are planted.In most of America, Wal-Mart is not just unavoidable, it has become a kind of national commons. Every seven days more than one hundred million Americans shop at Wal-Mart - one third of the country. Each year 93 percent of American households shop at least once at Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart’s sales in the United States are equal to $2,060.36 spent there by every US. household in the last year. (Wal-Mart’s profit on that $2,060.36 was just $75.00.) If your family didn’t spend $2,000.00 at Wal-Mart last year, well, someone else’s spent $3,000.00.And it’s not just the United States. Wal-Mart is the largest retailer in both Mexico and Canada, and the second largest grocer in Britain. Worldwide, so many people shop at Wal-Mart that this year 7.2 billion people will go to a Wal-Mart store. Earth’s population is only 6.5 billion, so this year the equivalent of every person on the planet will visit a Wal-Mart, with more than half a billion visits left over.Wal-Mart’s scale can be hard to absorb. The company isn’t just the largest retailer in the nation and in the world. For most of this decade, Wal-Mart has been both the largest company in the world, and the largest company in the history of the world. In 2006, Wal-Mart will be bumped from the number-one spot on the Fortune 500 list of the largest companies by ExxonMobil, whose sales will surge past Wal-Mart’s, but only because the world price of oil has risen 50 percent in the last year. Wal-Mart’s dominance really remains unrivaled, as is revealed by a single statistic. ExxonMobil employs about 90,000 people worldwide; Wal-Mart employs 1.6 million. ExxonMobil is growing by raising prices; Wal-Mart is growing despite lowering prices. As a store, Wal-Mart isn’t just the largest; it no longer has any near rivals. WalMart is as big as Home Depot, Kroger, Target, Costco, Sears, and Kmart combined. Target, which is considered Wal-Mart’s nearest direct rival and its most astute competitor, is small by comparison. Each year Wal-Mart sells more by Saint Patrick’s Day, March 17, than Target sells all year.On top of that, Wal-Mart is the nation’s, and the world’s, largest private employer, with 1.6 million “associates,” as the company refers to its employees. In the United States, another 3 million people have jobs directly dependent on purchases from Wal-Mart, according to Wal-Mart’s figures. Most of us shop at Wal-Mart, but many of us are also dependent on the company for our income, or know someone who is, even if that person doesn’t actually work at Wal-Mart.It’s not just Wal-Mart’s presence as a merchant and employer that is so pervasive. In a single typical day of media coverage, Wal-Mart is mentioned significantly in more than one hundred stories around the country. Each month Wal-Mart’s announcement of its sales is good for a full twenty﷓four﷓hour cycle of news coverage, more if Wal-Mart surges or stumbles, because Wal-Mart’s performance is considered a vital indicator of trends in the US economy overall - are we spending confidently or not? It is a rare day that the Wall Street Journal does not have a story that mentions Wal-Mart; most days the company is cited multiple times.In the last five years, a national debate about Wal-Mart’s impact - about the wide spectrum of the Wal-Mart effect - has escalated into a series of skirmishes being fought not only in print and at zoning hearings but also in the courtroom. Wal-Mart’s practices, the way it treats its employees, the way it treats its suppliers, the way it treats communities, and its motivation - its very soul - are all subjects of such bitter contention that it is hard to imagine that partisans are actually describing the same institution. Wal-Mart is either one of the boldest, most democratic creations in human history, a validation of free markets, harnessing its enormous power on behalf of the needs of ordinary people, or it is an insatiable, insidious beast, exploiting the people it pretends to defend.Excerpt from The Wal-Mart Effect: How the World’s Most Powerful Company Really Works – and How It’s Transforming the American Economy, by Charles Fishman (Penguin Press/Houghton Mifflin) © Charles Fishman 2006"

The HBOS investment is undisclosed but is thought to be about £2m. Carlton consists of two businesses – Carlton Corporate Finance, a corporate finance and advisory firm and Carlton Capital Partners, which provides investment management advisory services to clients.Mr Taee and his family own about 30 per cent of Carlton and Mr Magan owns about 10 per cent.Mr Magan is a legendary dealmaker and joined Rupert Hambro in 1988 in setting up JO Hambro Magan, one of London’s first and leading corporate finance boutiques. It was sold in 1996 to National Westminster bank.Mr Taee is best known for helping finance the Seattle Coffee company, sold to Starbucks for £58m in 1998. He has also been involved in healthcare groups such as European Healthcare.Since the merger of Halifax and Bank of Scotland in 2002, BoS has expanded corporate banking under Peter Cummings, board director.Andrew Taee, chief executive of Carlton has had a relationship with Bank of Scotland for 20 years and believes Carlton will be able to expand much further with HBOS as an equity investor.Carlton has been involved in several recent deals and acted for Rentokil Initial, the support services group, in its £80m acquisition of JC Ehrlich, a US pest control group. Sir Francis MacKay, former Kingfisher and Compass chairman joined Carlton as non-executive vice-chairman this year.

Industry insiders have also told the FT of non-certified coffee being marked and exported as Fairtrade, and of certified coffee being illegally planted in protected rainforest.This casts doubt on the certification process used by Fairtrade and similar marks that require producers to pay the minimum wage.It also raises questions about the assurances certifiers give consumers about how premium-priced fair trade coffee is produced.As the board member of one Peruvian Fairtrade-certified coffee producer told the FT: “No certifier can guarantee they will purchase 100 per cent of a co-operative’s production, so how can they guarantee that every bag will be produced according to their standards?”Though certified coffee makes up less than 2 per cent of the global coffee trade it has become increasingly mainstream as large retailers such as Starbucks and McDonald’s adopt it.The FT visited five Peruvian smallholdings, all of which have Fairtrade certification.Each farm hires 12-20 casual coffee pickers during the harvest season. All house and feed their workers, which allows them to deduct 30 per cent from their wages.After that reduction from the legal daily minimum wage for casual agricultural workers of 16 soles ($5), farm owners are still obliged to pay at least 11.20 soles a day. In four of the five farms visited by the FT, pickers received 10 soles a day, while the other farm paid workers 12 soles a day.Luuk Zonneveld, managing director of Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International, the Bonn-based body that sets fair trade standards, told the FT that the certification system “is not fool- and leak-proof” but said the problem should be put in context.“Poor farmers often struggle to pay their workers fairly,” he said. “Why are casual labourers there at all? There are wider issues here. We need to ask why this goes on and what we can do to help.”A number of industry insiders told the FT they had also witnessed fraud within the certification system which resulted in coffee from uncertified sources being exported as Fairtrade.The FT has also been told of Fairtrade coffee being planted in protected national forest land in the northern Peruvian jungle. Using global satellite mapping, a Canadian NGO found that about one-fifth of all coffee production in one Fairtrade-certified association was illegally planted in protected virgin rainforest.
946;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-09-01T17:32:05Z;On Wall Street: Not such a bad dream;;You know about the American Dream. How about this for the American Nightmare?Prodigal US shoppers, worried about high gasoline prices and a declining housing market, keep their credit cards in their wallets.The slump in the propensity of consumers to swipe their Amex cards causes sharp falls in company earnings, putting the brakes on the economy.The stock market falls victim to the same malaise, as groups’ stuttering earnings fail to keep up with their rich valuations.Scared? You should be. This week’s sharp deterioration in the mood of consumers brought the nightmare scenario a step closer to reality.The Conference Board consumer confidence index recorded its lowest reading since the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina last year.Consumers’ predictions for the next six months were similarly gloomy and consistent with another widely watched survey released by the University of Michigan.On Wall Street, companies have done their best to confirm forecasts of a consumer-led slowdown.On Wednesday, Costco – the warehouse retailer that had been one of the sector’s star performers – stoked fears that higher-income shoppers are feeling the pinch with a surprise profit warning.It is in good company. Household names such as Home Depot, Starbucks, Wal-Mart and organic grocery chain Whole Foods have been wounded by reluctant consumers.With evidence like this, it is hard to disagree with predictions of an impending stock market correction.But I am going to try.For a start, the leading indicators of consumer confidence – Michigan’s and the Conference Board’s – often contradict one another and have diverged spectacularly as recently as April.But even when they agree, they are lousy indicators of future stock market performance. A study by Thomson Financial reveals that when consumers are bearish about the economy, stocks rally.On the four previous occasions when the University of Michigan’s index showed consumers in roughly the same pessimistic groove, the S&P 500 embarked on prolonged bull markets.It is true that consumer sentiment surveys are correlated with the business cycle and have correctly predicted the last two recessions in the US.But there is no guarantee that they will be third-time lucky, especially if the drivers for the current pessimism do not have a meaningful, lasting impact on the economy and the stock market.The first worry of the average Joe and Jane is higher petrol prices. With the precious liquid hovering around $3 a gallon for the past few months, those trips to Costco and Wal-Mart have somehow looked much less attractive.But the oil price now appears to be on the retreat. It fell below $70 a barrel for the first time in two months this week, adding a new, more romantic meaning to the term “sweet crude”.With Hurricane Ernesto demoted to tropical storm and harmlessly moving away from the Gulf of Mexico, pump prices should soon come down, leaving petrol-addicted Americans feeling better.The other consumer woe – the declining housing market – is more worrying, as unsold housing stocks are rising fast and price rises are moderating.But while economists are right to be concerned about the nasty wealth effects of a housing slowdown, investors can rest a little easier.The bursting of previous housing bubbles claimed just one, obvious stock market victim: the housebuilding sector. This time has been no different. Housebuilding stocks are down some 40 per cent from their peak, but other sectors have largely been left alone.But if the consensus is right and the economy slows down, why should companies and stocks remain immune?It is a question of degree and valuations. If the economy takes a gentle path towards slower growth, corporate profits will not suddenly collapse.With the S&P 500 still cheaper than its 10 and 20-year average, the resilience of earnings should prompt value-based and index-tracking investors to keep buying.For all the current doom and gloom, the American Nightmare may prove just as elusive as the American Dream.

As part of the management shuffle, Don Thompson was named president of McDonald’s USA.McDonald’s has seen a number of changes in its executive suite in recent years. In 2004, Jim Skinner replaced Charlie Bell as chief executive after he stepped down to focus on fighting cancer. Mr Bell had succeeded Jim Cantalupo, who died earlier that year.The company has won praise for swiftly naming replacements and thus reducing uncertainty in the financial markets. Mr Roberts, a 29-year veteran of the company, was instrumental in helping lead the turnround started four years ago, but analysts said with Mr Skinner at the helm, a shift in strategy was unlikely.Mr Roberts had been seen as a candidate to succeed Mr Skinner in the top job.“This change in management does not indicate a change in direction for the business or strategy, nor do we believe this represents a warning signal that there are issues with the progress of the US business, or the turnaround in the international European markets,” said Andrew Barish, analyst at Banc of Americas Securities, in a report.“The only inference that we could make, is that Matt Paull, CFO is likely the top candidate [down the road] for the CEO position. We do not believe Jim Skinner will retire any time soon; however the long-term succession plan appears to be taking shape.”Mr Alvarez takes on his new role at a time when sales at casual dining chains are under pressure. The rise in petrol prices and interest rates has forced many low- and middle-income consumers to cut back discretionary spending, including eating out.In a recent report, John Glass, analyst at CIBC World Markets, said this is a time of “unprecedented slowing sales in restaurants” and that “many executives liken this period to 1991 - the last great consumer recession”.In recent weeks, Starbucks, the world’s largest specialty coffee chain, and Burger King, the number two hamburger chain, have reported disappointing sales that sent their share prices lower. McDonald’s also said its July US same-store sales grew at the smallest rate in more than three years."
948;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-08-22T18:44:31Z;Toll adds to fears of US housing slowdown;;Americans have sharply cut back on purchases of upmarket houses, according to Toll Brothers, the largest luxury homebuilder in the US, adding to signs of a crisis of confidence among buyers and fears of a consumer-led economic slowdown.Toll’s poor third-quarter results – its first quarterly profit fall in four years – and its warning on the outlook for the rest of the year, mirrors problems at other companies reliant on discretionary consumer spending such as Starbucks, a coffee chain, Home Depot, a DIY chain, and Whole Foods, an organic food retailer.“The bottom line is that no matter how you slice it or dice it, the consumer, on average, is feeling pretty bummed out and tapped out at the same time,” said David Rosenberg, North America economist at Merrill Lynch.The behaviour of consumers, whose debt-fuelled spending has underpinned US growth over the past few years, will be a key determinant of whether the slowing domestic economy achieves a “soft landing” or slumps into a recession.A significant reduction in US consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of domestic economic activity, would also affect export-dependent economies such as China and other developing countries in Latin America and eastern Europe.Robert Toll, chairman and chief executive of Toll, blamed the 19 per cent fall in third-quarter profits to $174.6m on an excess of housing stock and a lack of appetite by buyers who purchase homes as an investment.“The continuing malaise in the housing market . . . is the result of oversupply of inventory and a decline in confidence. The speculative buyers of 2004 and 2005 are now sellers,” he said.Economists say that buy-to-let investors and other marginal buyers have been deterred by rising mortgage payments and the small appreciation in the value of houses they own.The woes of the housing market was one of the reasons the Federal Reserve halted their streak of 17 consecutive rate rises this month.Fears that the housing slowdown is spreading to other sectors were compounded last week when a widely-watched survey by the University of Michigan found overall consumer confidence at its lowest level since the aftermath of hurricane Katrina last year.Toll shares were up 4 per cent to $25.84 in midday trade in New York on Tuesday because the results still exceeded analysts’ expectations.
949;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-08-22T17:33:19Z;Katrina rhetoric fails to calm storm;;"Visitors to the New Orleans Gift and Jewelry Show this week could have been forgiven for thinking that life in the Big Easy is back to normal.Hundreds of people descended on the city’s Ernest N. Morial convention centre to hunt for bargains among stalls selling everything from loose diamonds and Rolex watches
to crystal glassware and designer perfume, with a Starbucks coffee kiosk on hand to stave off thirst.Nowhere in the sprawling venue was there any sign of the horror and suffering that occurred under the same roof a year ago next week, when more than 20,000 people sought refuge in the building following Hurricane Katrina.For three days, the overwhelmingly poor and black refugees were left to fester in sweltering, airless conditions without food or liquid as the relief effort stalled.The harrowing scenes, reminiscent of a third world camp, exposed an urban, black underclass that appeared to have been abandoned – literally and metaphorically – by the wealthiest nation on earth. For a brief period, the US was shamed into a national debate about its racial and economic divisions.President George W. Bush acknowledged the “deep, persistent poverty” experienced by many blacks and blamed it on “a history of racial discrimination that cut off generations from the opportunity of America”.“We have a duty to confront this poverty with bold action,” he said.But 12 months later, the business-as-usual atmosphere at the refurbished convention centre demonstrates how quickly the issue of social justice has fallen off the national agenda.According to the Washington Post, Mr Bush has mentioned the word “poverty” in public only six times since his post-Katrina speeches and the debate over racial inequality proved no more durable.“Katrina created an opening for America to deal seriously with these issues,” says David Dante Troutt, editor of After the Storm, a collection of essays by black intellectuals about the disaster. “But the opportunity was missed.”Despite growth in the economy, the proportion of African-Americans living below the poverty line has increased during the Bush presidency to nearly a quarter – double the national average.Nowhere are African-Americans more disadvantaged than in New Orleans, where four out of 10 black families lived in poverty before Katrina and 60 per cent of poor blacks had no access to a car, leaving them stranded as the storm approached. A year later, most of the city’s black population is still dispersed across the country, many without the resources to return and rebuild.Standing outside her mother’s damaged home in the Gentilly district, Joanne Johnson makes no attempt to hide her bitterness. “We had their attention for five minutes, then they moved on,” she says. “They can afford to pay for a war in Iraq but they can’t afford to look after their own people.”To Ms Johnson, 45, a supermarket worker, “they” seems to refer to the Bush administration and white America, as if the two are interchangeable.Like many African-Americans, she believes the authorities intentionally broke the levees near black neighbourhoods to spare wealthier, white districts. “People heard the explosion,” she says.The allegation is a rehashed version of an urban myth dating back to Hurricane Betsy in 1965. But the widespread belief in the theory underlines the extent of mistrust among blacks towards the white-dominated state and federal governments. “Katrina has exacerbated racial divisions rather than healed them,” says Douglas Brinkley, a New Orleans historian and author of The Great Deluge.For many whites, the lasting impression of Katrina’s aftermath was not images of poverty, but instead the pictures of black people looting stores and reports of rape and murder in the convention centre and Superdome. “Many whites saw the looting as a violation of a social contract,” says Lance Hill, executive director of the Southern Institute for Education and Research at Tulane University in New Orleans. “It strengthened the association in their minds between poor blacks and criminality and made them feel less guilty about the poverty.”Subsequent investigations showed that the reports were wildly exaggerated. But the perception that New Orleans was descending into anarchy delayed the relief effort as officials shifted focus from aid to security.Some in New Orleans resent the focus on black poverty, arguing that many middle-class people, white and black, also lost homes to Katrina. But, as the anniversary nears, even the briefest drive through the city reveals an obvious truth: wealthier neighbourhoods are recovering much quicker than poor black ones.The only part of life that has returned to normal for poor black communities is gang-related crime. The city recorded 21 murders in July, most of them involving young black men.This apparent return to the bad old days raises doubts about whether the billions of dollars of federal aid committed to New Orleans can solve the city’s social ills. June Cross, a filmmaker researching a documentary on Katrina, doubts there is the will to even try. “America views urban poverty in the same bracket as famine in Africa,” she says. “People think it’s sad but there’s nothing that can be done about it.”"
950;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-08-11T13:52:26Z;Passing trade;;"The coffee-chain cappuccino is an excellent barometer of pricing, since it is, unlike a salad or a plate of spaghetti, a uniform product. The Economist magazine has taken advantage of this fact by constructing a “Starbucks tall-latte index” to check currency valuations, but budget constraints for the humble Undercover Economist meant that my own investigations took me no further than Watford Gap.Watford Gap is the oldest motorway service area (MSA) in the country. After a long wait in the queue there, I purchased a Costa Coffee cappuccino - which, apart from being 10 per cent more expensive, was identical to the high-street product in all respects - and something called a “ham and three cheese tostato”, which was quite disgusting and carried nearly the same premium. Most travellers will recognise the distinctive motorway experience of high prices and low quality, but they may not know who is to blame. Underneath the elevator music and sad Formica tables for the single traveller lies a remarkable government campaign, as old as Watford Gap itself, to make MSAs as grim as possible.Naturally, the companies that provide motorway services could do a better job and charge less. But anyone who expects that result from the benevolence of the butcher and the baker will be disappointed. Companies give us what we want only when their competitors are doing likewise. MSAs do not pit Starbucks against Costa because they know that that sort of intense competition, while good for customers, will drive down prices and lower profits.Competition between MSAs could fix all that, and this is where the government campaign against the motorist comes in. First, it is almost impossible to build a new MSA. Entrepreneurs must first persuade the local planning authority that there is a need - as if anyone would be tempted to offer roadside snacks when nobody was buying. They must distance themselves from competitors. (One government agency, the Office of Fair Trading, tries to stop such attempts to limit competition, but the Department for Transport makes them mandatory.) Then they must secure permission from the local authority, whose constituents are the last to benefit from a vast car park in their back yards. Finally, they must build slip roads and maintain free car parks and toilets all year round. Small wonder that despite the sky-high prices, there are few new entrants.Even stranger is the desperate attempt to deny motorists information on the quality of the product. No information about the MSA can be signposted on the motorway until half a mile before the junction; even then, only the company name can be listed, which means the big players have been forced to resort to changing their names to incorporate their strongest offerings. Instead of Moto and RoadChef we have “Moto M&S” and “RoadChef Costa Coffee”.None of this matters much. You could always pack your own sandwiches. But it is a lesson. Advertising is often denounced as garish commercialism or, worse, insidious mind-control, but move to the MSA world where advertising is illegal and you will find yourself wishing for the sight of a familiar logo. When advertising is impossible, why provide anything worth advertising?Regulations on business are often supposed to protect the rights of consumers. Sometimes they do. But consumers are the first to suffer from incompetent regulations - if they ever get to the front of the queue.Tim Harford’s BBC2 series “Trust Me, I’m an Economist” begins on August 18."

The consumer products group reported a 36 per cent jump in fiscal fourth-quarter profit, beating analyst estimates, and was further boosted by news of lower margins at its main rival Unilever.Medical device makers sold off during the week, after Medtronic warned that revenue for the fiscal fourth-quarter would fall short of its own forecasts. Its shares fell 13.6 per cent on the week to $43.62. St Jude Medical sank 10.1 per cent to $33.63, and Boston Scientificlost 8.9 per cent to $15.95.Sprint Nextel tumbled 14.5 per cent to $17.54, its worst week since July 2002. The telecommunications group reported a 38 per cent fall in second-quarter profits amid poor retention of its customers and weak subscriber growth in its wireless business.Qwest Communications cheered investors and rose 10.7 per cent to $8.72 when it reported that it had swung into profit in the second quarter, having lost $164m in the same period last year.Investors were disappointed when Starbucks reported earnings. The coffee retailer reported a 16 per cent rise in third-quarter profits, but its shares fell
10 per cent for the week to $30.61 as sales growth in July dipped below the level of a year ago. The company blamed staffing problems as consumers ordered more labour-intensive iced drinks to combat hot weather.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent for the week at 1,279.36, a loss for the day of 0.1 per cent, or 0.91 points. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.4 per cent, or 7.29 points, on the day, a weekly loss of 0.4 per cent at 2,085.05. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 per cent for the week, down 2.24 points on the day at 11,240.35.Stocks bounced early on Friday on weaker-than-expected jobs data that investors interpreted as reducing the chance that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates next week.However, the optimism faded later in the afternoon, dragging indices lower as concerns over weaker economic growth took hold.A little more than 80 per cent of the companies in the S&P 500 have now reported. According to Thomson Financial, the blended growth rate for second-quarter earnings now stands at 16.1 per cent, up from 14.8 per cent at the end of last week.Seventy per cent of companies that have reported so far have beaten earnings estimates.“That’s definitely a high number compared with what we’ve seen historically,” said John Butters, senior research analyst at Thomson.Health insurers made strong advances on different earnings reports. Humana climbed 12.7 per cent over the week to an all-time high of $58.10 after it reported a 10 per cent growth in quarterly earnings, ahead of Wall Street forecasts. Cigna reported a 62 per cent fall in quarterly profit but the performance was not as bad as analysts had feared. Its shares rose 14.6 per cent to $105.04.Adobe Systems leapt 14.8 per cent to $31.72 during the week after it said that it would meet its earnings forecasts for the third quarter, leading analysts to reiterate their mostly positive ratings on the software maker. However, the stock is still down 14.2 per cent this year.Cosmetics and beauty products group Avon Productsslid 16.2 per cent to $27.51 after it reported a
54 per cent drop in second-quarter profits, weighed down by restructuring costs.It was heartbreak for hotel group Wyndham Worldwide, which made its stock market debut during the week after being spun off from parent Cendant. Its shares finished the week down 14.4 per cent at $28.24.Investors snapped up shares in office supplies retailer Office Depot, which gained 10.8 per cent to $38.06. The stock sold off heavily the previous week on disappointing earnings, but rebounded as analysts maintained positive ratings on the stock.Apple Computer came under scrutiny after it said it might have to restate earnings reports as far back as 2002 due to its stock options practices.

Las Vegas Sands posted solid profit growth thanks to a strong performance at its Macau casino, but revenue fell below analysts’ expectations, pushing shares down 6.9 per cent to $60.81.MGM Mirage also sold off, losing 7.1 per cent to $35.31, after second-quarter earnings fell shy of Wall Street forecasts.
953;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Starbucks;;Blaming the weather gods for disappointing performance is a proud tradition at many a business. Leave it to Starbucks, however, to come up with a novel twist. With record temperatures hitting much of the US, the coffee chain argues that many cold drinks have proved too popular for its own good. Apparently, Frappuccinos are trickier to prepare, leading to even longer waiting times and customers heading elsewhere during peak periods.Starbucks hopes to address the problem swiftly by improving equipment and using its staff more effectively. But there are several other potential culprits for July’s slowdown in same-store sales to just 4 per cent. While Starbucks’ sales have been fairly resilient during recent slowdowns, its expansion in the American heartland could leave it more exposed this time around if consumers cut back on their discretionary spending.Moreover, other chains, such as McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts, have lately been chasing the breakfast market more aggressively. Starbucks itself is expanding its food offerings just as other restaurateurs are starting to see signs of weakness, even in pricier segments. And, in spite of a recent fall in US profitability, Starbucks’ main money-spinner still has a 16.5 per cent operating margin to defend.The main problem is that Starbucks is still valued as a growth stock. Worries about a potential slowdown drove its shares down almost 14 per cent yesterday, though it recovered some of its losses. That left them still trading at 43 times 2006 earnings. But its growth is hardly coming cheap, as it continues to spend the bulk of its cash flow on opening new stores, even at the risk of cannibalising existing ones. It will take more than a few Frappuccinos to prevent a share price meltdown in the longer term.

955;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-07-31T17:52:46Z;Observer;;Dark days almost over in Hong KongAt last, the final countdown for the first-phase reopening of Hong Kong’s Mandarin Oriental, jewel in the crown of Jardine Matheson’s hotel empire, has begun.Ever since it closed for renovations on December 28, the territory’s power brokers and idle rich have been at a loss for a place to do deals, to see and to be seen. Instead of morning coffees and high teas at the much-loved Clipper Lounge, executives have had to settle for the boring old Starbucks at nearby Alexandra House or some such similarly uninspiring substitute.However, most of the construction netting – cleverly festooned with revenue-generating luxury brand advertisements – is now gone in anticipation of the hotel’s late-September reopening with 200 rooms and most of its treasured restaurants and bars. Such is the anticipation that details of the US$140m renovation and its impact on first-half results were top of many journalists’ question lists when Jardine companies reported last week.Alas, John Witt, the Mandarin group’s finance director, tells Observer that the Mandarin Grill – the famously dark, cavernous restaurant where many an entertainment budget was busted – will re-open with natural daylight.No doubt many old-fashioned patrons will request that the Grill’s new windows be fitted with heavy curtains and drawn tight. Let there not be light.Luxury’s costDavid Rosenberg, US economist at Merrill Lynch, is not too worried about inflation. But he is kept awake by a nagging question: why are bond fund managers so negative on US Treasury bonds? Rosenberg, a long-time economic bear, is a bond bull.But recently he hit on a possible explanation for why his peers are so worried about skyrocketing prices: the personal experiences of fund managers, generally a well-heeled lot, may be clouding their collective judgment. To test his hypothesis, he constructed a basket of expenses Wall Streeters would come up against every day: watches and jewellery, services for their pets, air fares and so on.He has discovered that the cost of items such as gardening and lawn care services are galloping upwards at an annual 7.7 per cent clip. His Wall Street core consumer price index is rising at 4 per cent a year – a much more worrisome figure than the official core CPI inflation rate of 2.6 per cent.Small wonder that they are worried about inflation. “There is no doubt that the cost of being pampered has gone up,” Rosenberg notes.All in the familyChen Shui-bian, Taiwan’s president, is continuing to entertain his nation with ever more outrageous episodes in his administration and family.Yesterday it was revealed that the housekeeper of his son-in-law, Chao Chien-min, has been paid by the presidential palace since Chen assumed office in 2000.Many of the earlier scandals – which have engulfed Chen’s wife, his son-in-law, three of his cabinet members and a senior aide – are so complicated that it is hard even to establish the facts. With the housekeeper, there’s no room for doubt.Since Chao was released from prison on bail in an insider trading investigation last month, the feisty housekeeper has become the main interface between the media camping outside the residence and Chao, who stays inside. The sweeping, scrubbing and plant-watering of “Auntie A-ching” has been well documented by television cameras, so there can be no doubt over the nature of her job.Chen’s spokesman argues that since he owns the flat in which his daughter and her family live and his wife visits frequently, it should still be seen as part of the presidential residence. Thus, expensing the cleaning lady to his office was legal.Short stayThais were astonished – and many were quietly gleeful – last week, when three once-powerful election commissioners were hauled off to jail after being convicted of abuse of power during controversial parliamentary elections in April.The commissioners had refused repeated calls for their resignation, insisting they had done no wrong, even after the election was annulled. But a single night in a Bangkok prison was enough to do the trick. The morning after, the three chastened men signed resignation letters, which were provided to the court along with bail applications.After four applications, bail was finally granted late on Friday citing concerns about their deteriorating health. All pleaded that they were suffering from acute stress from being in jail, along with sundry ailments.Given their apparently fragile health, one wonders how they had coped with the immense pressures of organising elections. We will not know, however. As a condition of their bail, they have been barred from any contact with the election commission, and from uttering a word to the press.Blessing in disguiseEvery cloud has a silver lining. The collapse of the Doha trade talks has left the foot soldiers of globalisation with an unexpected summer holiday. As Observer noted on Friday, Pascal Lamy, World Trade Organisation boss, was off to Lourdes to pray for a miracle. Peter Mandelson, the European trade commissioner, tells Observer he has just rebooked his annual trip to Italy. “I am going to three different places,” he says, not wanting to give any more details and tip off the paparazzi.Last summer’s Italian sojourn was overshadowed by the notorious bra wars, as his decision to impose quotas on Chinese textiles led to piles of clothing at Europe’s docks. Sensibly, his latest anti-dumping decision, on Chinese and Vietnamese shoes, has been delayed until September.
956;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-07-28T15:03:28Z;Arne Alsin: Owners can claim an advantage in the long run;;Data show that stocks generate higher returns than any other asset category over the long term. But data aren’t necessary to make the case. A powerful argument can be made through a proper understanding of stocks.Asset classes can be put into two broad categories. There are “do nothing” assets and “do something” assets. The do nothing category includes a variety of assets, such as precious metals and raw land. When left untouched, these make no product, render no service, and generate no income. It should come as no surprise that the long-term return from them approximates the rate of inflation.The list of do something assets includes investments such as certificates of deposit, stocks, bonds, and T-bills. The do something category includes sub-categories commonly known as debt and equity.I prefer to distinguish between debt and equity investors as “loaners” and “owners”. If you invest in debt, you are a loaner. You lend your capital to the government in exchange for a T-bill, to a bank in exchange for a CD, to an insurance company in exchange for an annuity, or to a corporation in exchange for a bond.If you invest in equity, you are an owner. Buy an interest in the local car wash and you are an owner. Buy shares in Starbucks, Coca-Cola and Nike and you are a part-owner of these companies (I am not).In general, it is better to be an owner than a loaner. The upside is unlimited for owners, while the upside for loaners is fixed. When you lend your capital to the government, you will get back the capital you lent plus interest and not a penny more.Alignment of interests puts owners in a much more enviable position than a loaner. Ask your bank how much interest it will pay on a CD. You and the bank have competing objectives. You want to make as much as possible and the bank wants to pay you as little as possible.Instead of lending capital to your bank through a CD, consider the alignment of interests if you bought stock in the bank instead. All big decisions at the bank, such as how much interest to pay on savings accounts and how much to charge for loans, are made with the owners’ interest in mind.Control is an important advantage owners have. For example, when a loaner lends capital to a business, control of that capital is ceded to the business.Adaptability is a significant advantage that owners have over loaners. When they make a loan, lenders are implicitly betting their capital will not be impaired by future change. A jump in inflation is one example of a change that can harm a loaner. A long-term bondholder is stuck when inflation jumps because adaptation to a higher inflation environment is not possible.The ability to adapt to change mitigates capital risk for owners. The owner of shares in Coca-Cola does not have to make a bet on how consumer beverage preferences will evolve. Whether demand surges or not is not an issue. That owner only has to bet that Coca-Cola management will adapt accordingly.The fact that casinos take a significant percentage of the total bets placed means that, as a group, bettors lose money. The odds are stacked against you if you bet in casinos consistently over the long term.In the stock market, the opposite is true. There is a high probability of success with consistent investment over the long term. I call it the “inevitability of reward”. Businesses exist to make profit. As profits accumulate, value accumulates. Since 1920 the combined companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average have been profitable every year, with the single exception being a small loss in 1932.It’s likely that over the next 10 years the total cumulative profit of Starbucks, Coca-Cola and Nike will be impressive.With that in mind, is it a good bet that these companies will be more valuable in 10 years? That is for you to decide.Arne Alsin is a portfolio manager for Alsin Capital and for the Turnaround fundarne@alsincapital.com

And before rejecting the very idea that a COO should ever be necessary in a well-run business, readers ought first to engage with the impressive range of witnesses – current and former COOs – brought together in this new book.Authors Stephen Miles – he is the headhunter, a partner at Heidrick and Struggles – and Nathan Bennett, professor at Georgia Tech’s college of management, have conjured up a remarkable cast list. It includes Ed Zander, chief executive of Motorola and former COO at Sun Microsystems, Jim Donald, chief executive of Starbucks and formerly its effective COO, and Mort Topfer, now managing director of his own Castletop Capital investment firm, but formerly COO at Dell. Al­together, 22 senior executives with COO experience are featured. Their first-hand accounts are supported by the authors’ useful analysis.What is the case for bringing in a COO between the chief executive and his or her existing senior staff? Miles and Bennett offer seven reasons.First, to provide daily leadership in an “operationally intensive” business. Second, to lead a specific strategic move – a turnround or rapid expansion in a dynamic environment. Third, to bring in a COO as a mentor to a young or inexperienced chief executive, often an entre­preneurial founder (as was the case with Topfer at Dell). Fourth, to balance the skills of the chief executive. Fifth, to build a “two-in-a-box” leadership model (think of Microsoft’s Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer). Sixth, to blood an heir apparent to the current chief executive. And, last, to retain a talented executive who might otherwise leave.So much for the strategy. How does the CEO/COO partnership work in practice? This is where the evidence of interviewees is instructive. Several themes emerge. All former and current COOs declare that the job requires the suppression, as far as possible, of ego. The COO is not there to hog the limelight. It is to a great extent an internally focused role. Leave to the CEO the time-consuming external world: analysts, customers, regulators, media.Ed Zander was COO to Scott McNealy as CEO at Sun Microsystems. “To me, it was very simple,” he says. “I had to make the quarters, get the products out the door, hire the right people and organise according to the business plan.” For Zander the COO role is all about operations. The clue is in the job title.Trust, needless to say, is vital, and mentioned by almost every COO interviewed here. The CEO should not undermine the COO by disowning the latter’s actions. Overlapping of the two roles may be un­avoidable, but there should be no futile second-guessing of each other’s motives and deeds. The organisation should feel there is a healthy partnership at work at the head of the company.Who gets this COO business right, and who has got it wrong? IBM and Intel are both held up as masters of the succession plan route, with Lou Gerstner bringing Sam Palmisano on as COO several years ahead of his eventual promotion to chief executive. Intel, too, has a tradition of growing its own leaders in a transparent and well-understood way.However, the same high-tech sector also provides the recent classic example of where a COO could have avoided a lot of grief. Carly Fiorina’s refusal to appoint a COO, in the face of all the advice she was getting from the board, only added to her difficulties at Hewlett-Packard in
the wake of the Compaq acquisition.There is room for scepticism here. As the authors concede, academic research on businesses that appoint COOs tends to suggest that they underperform com­panies that do not. Gamely, the authors argue that poor execution, rather than strategy, may explain this.A 2002 survey in the US found that only 17 per cent of companies replaced their COO when he or she moved up to become chief executive. And several former COOs, now CEOs, say that their priority on being promoted was to get stuck into the business, without having a COO in the way – a situation Jack Welch described as wearing too many sweaters and thus failing to register the true temperature.Still, the book makes a persuasive case for the COO role, especially in large, dynamic organisations. The most human and down-to-earth analysis is provided by Mort Topfer, who sums it up this way:“There are some visible recent examples of CEO failure that result from one person trying to do the whole thing. When you travel 70 per cent of the time, that has to lead to periods of indecision and people waiting for a decision. I just think those jobs are too big and complex and challenging for any normal human being to do it.”"

She was greeted with disbelief. “You put ice in coffee, miss? We ain’t heard of that here.”When we drove from Denver to Washington two weeks ago, en route to her next life in Paris, things had changed. In the long flatlands of western Kansas, Colby – population 5,450 and home to the biggest barn in the state, containing antique agricultural implements – boasts a Starbucks. Yes, Toto, there is Seattle in Kansas.As I may have said before, I love long-distance driving and a cross-country ride of passage with my daughter was unmissable. But everything cannot be left to chance and that means more than merely ensuring that the six-year-old VW Golf was up to the trip.A prime ingredient is road music. We got off to a sad start with the news that the great mezzo soprano Lorraine Hunt Lieberson had died, but Bach cantatas, even her immortal renditions, aren’t right for the road, because weeping and driving don’t mix.But Caroline had programmed her iPod for every state en route, from the obvious – John Denver leaving the “Rocky Mountain High” of Colorado and arriving on the “Country Roads” of West Virginia – to the truly obscure, at least to me, such as Shawn Colvin’s “Wichita Skyline” for Kansas and Vonda Shepard’s “Maryland”.She had not included Indiana because we weren’t going there until we decided to head for Louisville rather than Nashville. A tough call, admittedly, but the Slugger baseball bat factory, mint juleps and “Run For The Roses” by Jane Olivor enticed more than country music (anyway the Dixie Chicks have gone almost mainstream).Indiana is actually disturbing, mostly because it has so many time zones that my new mobile phone became quite agitated trying to keep up. One divide, illogically, runs east-west alongside Highway 64, presumably meaning the farm roosters to the north crow an hour earlier than those across the road to the south. Perhaps this explains Dan Quayle.Decent road food matters, too, and we were helped immeasurably in finding it by my friend Johnny Apple’s America, the best city guide I know. Even my vegetarian daughter was so moved by his description to tolerate Arthur Bryant’s barbecue in Kansas City, with its immortal burnt ends, even though her baked beans concealed a fist-sized ham hock and her fries knew only lard.We tried to avoid the ubiquitous chains, which actually is not difficult. Stefanina’s Pizzeria in O’Fallon, Missouri, not to be confused with O’Fallon, Illinois, on the other side of St Louis, surely knocks Pizza Hut etc into a cocked hat.But, wherever you eat in middle America, the sheer quantity of food heaped on the plate is astounding. After a while, you get a craving for sushi (but we survived on crabs in Louisville).Driving an economical little car, the price of gas did not seem that onerous. I did observe, though, that the gas-guzzling SUVs, or Chelsea Tractors, as the class-conscious Mayor of London calls them, were proceeding in a statelier manner than was their wont.This cannot have been because the cops were everywhere. We hardly saw one for 1,650 miles until Virginia, where they lurked behind every culvert. Fortunately, nice people at the Rockbridge vineyard near Lexington warned us to be alert because the July 4 road carnage had been shocking even by Virginia standards.One overriding impression, not new but reinforced, is the sheer emptiness of the plains states. If only, I thought, all the immigrants were farmers, there would be no angst over their influx but then I remembered that agribusiness owns so much of the land there is probably little available.Nor is there any land left in our main detour, to the coal country of Appalachia, which I once knew well 30 years ago and where the broad form deed, allowing mineral owners to mine without limitation, has left resources in mega-corporate hands.Because coal is experiencing one of its mini-booms, I might have guessed that modest Pikeville, Kentucky, would have spruced up a bit, which it had, with a fascinating new Sandy Valley museum in the old train station and an influx, the curator told us, of bankers and lawyers.But change can be skin deep. For all the new Home Depots, you could not help but notice that the most prevalent stores in Pike County were the various dollar chains, some steps below even Wal-Mart in price. The roadside flea markets were still offering used goods as basic as those I saw in Warsaw in the Polish dark ages.And just over the border, in narrow Grundy, Virginia, we came across the quintessential Mr Peabody’s coal train, fully laden and a good mile long, ready to snake through the valleys to some distant steel mill or power plant, just as it did 100 years ago.But I swear I caught fleeting sight of a Starbucks in Grundy. And I bet it had frappucino, with skimmed milk on request. And probably the miners, or their daughters, were drinking it.onohana@aol.com
959;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;‘We want to be to lettings what Starbucks is to coffee’;;"Lettings specialists have long been seen as the lower tier of the real estate industry, trailing behind sales-focused companies that made their fortunes on the back of soaring house prices, particularly in recent years. But, thanks to an increasingly global and mobile workforce and a rise in buy-to-let investment, agencies who target renters seem to be coming into their own.“It used to be that lettings were the poor relations of the property industry, with estate agents dabbling in a bit of lettings on the side, but that’s not the case now,” says Ian Wilson, managing director of Martin & Co, the UK’s largest and fastest-growing residential lettings and property management network.He points to several reasons for the change. First is the flood of investment money moving from the volatile stock market into the comparative safety of property. This was prompted by the dotcom crash but continues today. Second, sky-high property prices in many cities around the world have made it harder for people to buy – even older, middle-class professionals. (The average age of first-time purchasers in the UK is now 34.) Third, there has been an increase in single-person, single-income households, which are as likely to rent as own. And, fourth, globalisation has translated into many more workers living abroad and moving more frequently, a lifestyle that lends itself to renting in year-long blocks.“For lifestyle reasons people want the flexibility of renting and investors want an asset,” says Malcolm Harrison, a spokesman at Association of Residential Lettings Agents.And, around the world, lettings specialists have been building businesses to capitalise on the growing market. Martin & Co, which was founded in 1986 and began opening franchised offices in the late 1990s, now has 112 in the UK and plans to expand to 200 by the end of this decade. It wants to be “to the lettings industry what Starbucks is to coffee”, Wilson says. “It’s our intention to introduce the highest professional standards to residential lettings that might be expected from any area of the industry.”Citi Habitats in New York was set up in 1994 with the same mission; it now has 900 staff and manages 10,000 flats. “New York has never had that poor-man-in-rental concept because it’s a huge economic centre and a very big destination for people starting out in their careers,” says chief operating officer Gary Malin. “If you are a kid fresh out of law school or college you want to live in Manhattan and rental is the viable option. [Still] people looking to rent were not being given the same service or treated with the kind of respect that was afforded to those looking to buy property.”In Hong Kong, most agents who specialise in property sales handle rentals as well, particularly since many people own homes but also hold other flats available to let as investments. “In the absence of a traditional retirement scheme, property has always been seen as the best store of wealth,” explains Simon Smith, head of research at Savills’ Hong Kong office.Renters tend to be expatriates, many of whom work in financial services. “The high-end lettings market is largely driven by banks and bankers. When staff are sent here from overseas the bank rents them a high-quality home for the duration of their attachment,” Smith says.Such postings dwindled in 2003 during the Sars scare, but the expats are back now, demanding high-quality properties in return for generous rents, which has helped boost the commissions and status of agents working in the sector. Smith estimates that luxury rental rates are up 20 per cent this year.Holiday markets are another area in which lettings specialists have prospered. Ann-Marie Doyle founded her company, Venetian Apartments, in the late 1980s after helping a family rent out their 16th-century palazzo in Venice. Today it handles long- and short-term rentals of some of the city’s best homes.“In the last 20 years a lot of Venetians have inherited apartments and recognise that renting them out at high prices can help them to maintain these properties,” says Doyle. She has recently expanded into sales but lettings still account for 80 per cent of her business.Tim Hyatt, head of lettings at estate agent Knight Frank, which has a dominant sales department, argues that hybrid agencies have advantages over those focused exclusively on lettings. “It’s difficult to make big enough money on margins out of lettings. On the sales side all of your costs are subbed out to the client but with lettings you have to service your own property management service and that can be very costly,” he explainsBut Jamie Paterson, a buy-to-let investor who recently purchased the Martin & Co franchise territory of London’s Maida Vale, disagrees.“In the last couple of years I’ve put together a small portfolio of properties that I let out through other agents. I’d had good and bad experiences but on the whole my properties were not managed to my satisfaction so I wanted to make sure that others didn’t fall into the same trap,” he says. “With lettings you are managing the property on behalf of a landlord and you have that continued communication with both tenant and landlord. It’s a long-term interaction. At a large estate agency the lettings department is always shoved to the back of the shop and only done as an addition to the sales side,” he says. “It doesn’t have that focus landlords want now.”"

Shares in the company, which had already risen about 53 per cent since the start of the year, were up 9 per cent to 216½p in morning trading.Manitowoc, a conglomerate best known for making construction cranes, had its original 210p-a-share approach for Enodis rejected last month on the grounds that it undervalued the company and its prospects.In May, Enodis also rejected a 195p-a-share approach from Middleby, a smaller rival. Both of the US companies’ approaches were informal.Earlier this month, following speculation that Middleby could return with a higher offer, the Takeover Panel gave the two US companies a July 17 deadline to make a formal bid.The order came in response to a request from Credit Suisse, Enodis’ advisers, and required the suitors to give a firm indication of their intentions either way. They would not be able to make another approach for six months after the deadline.Dave McCulloch, Enodis’ chief executive, told the Financial Times last month: “From my perspective we, the management team, would prefer to continue on our path and deliver shareholder value through the implementation of our strategy…But, clearly, if the right offer comes along, the board will have to consider it.”Enodis manufactures commercial food equipment and food retail equipment, and its products range from ovens to refrigeration display cases.Its customers range from fast-food restaurant chains and hotels to supermarket groups, and include McDonalds and Starbucks.
961;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-07-12T20:51:18Z;Wall St sells off on earnings and oil worries;;Wall Street turned sharply lower yesterday, depressed by continued nervousness over earnings reports, and higher oil prices.The fall was led by the Nasdaq, which sank after a regulatory fine for Microsoft triggered a sell-off across the technology sector.Losses deepened over the course of the afternoon, at one point pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average below 11,000.Microsoft was a millstone for the Nasdaq, after it received a fine of $280m from European regulators for not complying with a 2004 antitrust ruling. Its shares dropped 2 per cent to $22.64, extending its losses this year to 12.7 per cent.Most other technology stocks were dragged lower. Dell Computer lost 4.4 per cent to $22.38 after UBS cut its price target on the stock. Apple lost 4.8 per cent to $53.96, after an analyst said he expected Apple would warn that its earnings might be lower than forecast.Network Appliance, maker of data storage systems, continued to slide, losing 6.9 per cent to $28.60. It has shed 16 per cent in less than two weeks, in a fall aggravated by rival EMC’s warning earlier this week that profits would fall short of estimates.Semiconductors suffered worst. Having sparked Tuesday’s afternoon rally, the sector slipped again, and was the worst performer in the S&P 500 in the morning. Intel shed 4.2 per cent to $17.88, its worst day since January and Nvidia lost 4.8 per cent to $18.23. Sun Microsystems, however, bucked the technology trend, adding 2.6 per cent to $4.00.At the close, the S&P 500 was down 1.1 per cent, or 13.92 points, at 1,258.60 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.8 per cent, or 38.62 points, at 2,090.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.1 per cent, or 121.59 points, lower at 11,013.18.Philip Dow, director of equity strategy at RBC Dain Rauscher, said markets were still slightly nervous going into the second quarter earnings season.“You can see that people are looking at the first blush of earnings and worrying about what the quarter will bring,” he said. “The preliminary companies that have reported have disappointed.Consumer stocks came under pressure. Wal-Mart lost 2.1 per cent to $45.15, and Starbucks fell 4.3 per cent $34.43 its lowest level since February. The stock has lost 9.7 per cent since the beginning of July.Genentech lost 3.7 per cent to $80.98 despite reporting earnings ahead of analysts’ forecasts, as investors grew concerned about sales of its Avastin drug.Genentech’s rival Genzyme, however, proved more popular, beating analysts’ expectations with a 9 per cent rise in quarterly earnings.Shares gained 8.2 per cent to $62.74.Brunswick, maker of recreational boats, dropped 7.2 per cent to $29.55 after it said earnings for the second quarter and for 2006 would be less than forecast.

Initial reaction was that its brief statement left it more leeway to discontinue its campaign of tightening interest rates.Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, said the post-decision rally was an expression of investor relief. “The market is breathing a sigh of relief that it’s over and we can now get on with our lives,” he said.At the close, the S&P 500 was up 2.2 per cent, or 26.87 points, at 1,272.87, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 3 per cent, or 62.54 points, at 2,174.38. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 2 per cent, or 217.24 points, at 11,190.80. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies leapt 3.5 per cent.All the main indices jumped by between one and two percentage points in the aftermath of the Fed announcement.Energy stocks rose steeply, aided by strong crude prices, which reached $73 a barrel. Valero rose 4.3 per cent to a six-week high of $66.13, and Sunoco gained 5.3 per cent to $68.73.Duke Energy leapt 4.6 per cent to $29.69 after announcing on Wednesday that it would spin off its natural gas business to its shareholders. The move prompted Lehman Brothers to raise its rating on the stock from “equal weight” to “over weight”.Stronger copper and gold prices buoyed mining stocks. Freeport McMoran rose
10.2 per cent to $55.26, and Barrick Gold gained 5.3 per cent to $29.28.Healthcare provider Cigna rose 5 per cent to $96.26 after an announcement that the company’s stock buy-back programme would be increased by a further $500m.Open-source software maker Red Hat was a rare loser, plunging 6.4 per cent to $23.40, its lowest level since November. On Wednesday, the company reported earnings that came in below analysts’ forecasts, due to accounting charges and the acquisition of JBoss, another software maker.Micron Technology also disappointed with its fiscal third-quarter earnings, sending shares down 5.3 per cent to $15.12. Revenue came in below analysts' expectations.But there were gains elsewhere in the technology sector, with Jabil up 6.3 per cent to $25.74 after it announced it would buy back $200m worth of shares. Electronic Arts was up 5.1 per cent to $43.47.Consumer stocks performed well. McDonald’s added 5 per cent to $33.56 and Starbucks soared 6.3 per cent to $37.97."
963;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-06-29T04:27:41Z;Google new service to rival Ebay’s PayPal;;Google will take a major step beyond search on Thursday, launching an online payment service that will undercut the charges of established providers such as Ebay’s PayPal in enabling transactions over the web.The internet company is introducing Google Checkout, which it says will speed the purchase process for consumers and make it easier for advertisers to monitor and complete sales.Eric Schmidt, Google chief executive, had earlier insisted that the payment system would not compete directly with Paypal, but the final version has ended up targeting the same market.“Since we needed to build a great checkout experience for Google products [such as Google Earth, Google Video and Web Albums], we thought why not think bigger and let other merchants leverage this checkout process as well,” said Salar Kamangar, vice-president of product management, in a Financial Times interview.A small shopping trolley icon next to Google ads will signal that anyone clicking on them can buy a product or service using Checkout, which will store users’ details securely, including chosen credit card numbers and billing addresses. Users will also be able to go to a page summarising their orders across a range of merchants and enabling them to track packages.Google said it had been working with retailers such as Starbucks, Jockey, Levis, Timberland and Buy.com in testing the service.To help it gain traction, Google is offering discounts to merchants and charges of only 2 per cent on purchases and 20 cents a transaction.“We think it’s very competitive, you will typically pay in the range of 2 to 3 per cent and 30 cents per transaction with other providers,” said Mr Kamangar.The scheme has had a longer gestation period than most Google products and is not being launched like the usual unfinished “beta” products, but as a final version. News of it first surfaced in April last year when Google filed to incorporate Google Payments Corp. The length of time signals Google’s lack of experience in financial services and the need to build out an infrastructure and fraud prevention mechanisms.Online transactions are still dominated by credit and debit card companies, but the PayPal service has won around 10 per cent of the market. In its last quarter, eBay reported that PayPal earned $330m from processing $8.8bn in payments, up from $227m and $6.2bn a year earlier.
964;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-06-22T19:29:06Z;Observer;;Pondering life after public serviceSir Philip Thomas, the UK’s consul-general in New York, was diplomatically discreet about his plans at his retirement party in Manhattan this week.He would only say that he was off to a private sector job in Europe. But it would be no surprise if he were to surface as, say, head of government affairs at Shell.His 34 years in the Foreign Office have included a stint as British high commissioner in Nigeria, where the Anglo-Dutch oil company has a big and controversial investment. And while Shell’s new headquarters in The Hague is hardly a dream posting compared with New York, it probably beats Abuja.Sir Philip’s party was hosted by Sir David Manning – the British ambassador in the US and a close adviser to Tony Blair, prime minister – who managed to spark speculation about his own plans.In a generous tribute to Sir Philip, the ambassador said his escape into the private sector showed there was life after public service and suggested he might soon be “knocking on his door”.In reply, Sir Philip wished Sir David “the success he deserves in making the transition”. Headhunters take note.Caffeine withdrawalOne wag called it “the Starbucks faction”. When Edward Tian was chief executive at China Netcom, one of China’s leading telecommunications companies, the lobby of its Beijing headquarters hosted an outlet of the world’s most famous coffee chain.Some thought it had been custom-installed for the internationally minded Tian and his mates, who could schmooze the foreign press in English and pioneered some of the company’s highest profile overseas investments.These included a $1bn deal in January last year that saw China Netcom take a 20 per cent stake in PCCW, the Hong Kong telecoms incumbent.Tian resigned his post earlier this month, just weeks before PCCW’s telecoms and media assets became the target of a takeover battle between Macquarie Group and TPG Newbridge.Caught in the middle is a grumpy China Netcom, which is now firmly in the grip of chairman Zhang Chunjiang and other career Chinese telecoms bureaucrats who don’t like the idea of PCCW’s core telecoms assets being sold out from under them.As Li, Macquarie and TPG Newbridge all attempt to win over China Netcom, they must secretly be hoping for Tian’s return. Alas, there is little prospect of that. Observer’s spy in Beijing tells us China Netcom’s Starbucks shop has been closed.Running the showWhen Laurent Burelle picked up a PwC award for best shareholder performance at his family-controlled company, French car parts maker Plastic Omnium, he was less than grateful.His entire acceptance speech: “Shareholder value is very important for shareholders. But it should be the consequence of strategy, it shouldn’t be the strategy.”He was rapidly put in his place by the heads of two of Europe’s big carmakers, though. Bernd Pischetsrieder, chief executive of Volkswagen, took note of the fat profits that drove Omnium’s shares up and ominously told Burelle that VW’s purchasing chief would “talk to you later”.Sergio Marchionne, the scruffy but successful chief executive of Italy’s Fiat – also picking up a PwC award for share performance at an Automotive News conference – backed Burelle’s views.But Burelle is unlikely to be racing to sell parts to Fiat. “I wholeheartedly agree with the first speaker,” Marchionne said. “I don’t remember his name, Plastic, umm.” He was saved from further embarrassment by a reminder from a heckler.Population drainGermans have been up in arms for years about companies shifting jobs to low-pay countries. Wait until they hear that Germany, as a country, is now offshoring too.According to the Federal Statistical Office, there have never been as many people leaving Germany as in the past two years. With another 160,000 émigrés last year, the number of Germans or foreign residents joining the diaspora was up 8 per cent from 2004 and up nearly 60 per cent on the level of the early 1990s.And that is the best-case scenario. Since the figure only encompasses those leavers who duly notify their local authorities, the actual number, experts reckon, could be as high as 250,000.Given that Germans have stopped making babies too – births are no longer compensating for deaths – this is clearly bad demographic news. One upside, though, is that at this rate, the country should have solved its unemployment problem soon.Political investingThere is a mutual fund for everyone these days – even, or rather especially, for US Democrats.Just in time for the next election, the Blue Fund has filed a prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission and is awaiting a launch date. The fund, run by Blue Investment Management, will invest only in companies that make most of their political contributions to the Democrat party. It also requires that companies “act blue” by supporting human rights and environmental protection.“The Democrat investor with a political conscience has until now had no opportunity to put the investment dollars to work in a politically focused way,” explains its prospectus. Apparently most of the companies in the S&P 500 index are eliminated by its criteria but there are still quite a few – including Ebay, Apple and Starwood Hotels – that it can buy.All those Democratic voters who didn’t move to Canada after the last election can jump right in.observer@ft.com
965;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-06-20T07:59:56Z;Whitbread adds froth with China move;;Whitbread on Tuesday said it was launching its Costa Coffee chain in China as it reported a rise in like-for-like sales of 1.6 per cent and a mixed performance across the group.The company, which will join the likes of Starbucks in this market, is hoping to build on the strong growth of the chain which over the 13 week period to June 1 saw like-for-like sales rise by 6.5 per cent and by 23.7 per cent overall.Alan Parker, chief executive, said: “ We are planning to open 300 Costas in China in the next five years. This is something we have been wanting to do for several months, indeed years.”Whitbread will initially focus its efforts on Shanghai and eastern China with a £2m investment. It will form a joint venture with Yueda, which itself has partnerships with Triumph the clothing company and Kia, the Korean autos brand.Starbucks, which operates 400 coffee shops in greater China, including Hong Kong and Taiwan, recently announced an expansion drive into second-tier markets in China, while attempting to shore up ownership control over its stores in place of partnership deals.The news came as the company which also owns Premier Travel Inn hotels and David Lloyd gyms said it was confident on the outlook despite a slow start to the second quarter.Premier Travel Inn saw the steepest rise in like-for-like sales, up by 6.7 per cent, while sales were up by 13.7 per cent overall, boosted by aggressive new room openings.In the pub restaurant division, like-for-like sales were sluggish, down 2 per cent and flat overall at 0.2 per cent.In April, the company took the first step towards streamlining its UK leisure brand portfolio by announcing plans to sell as many as 260 pubs from its pub restaurant estate. At the time, analysts said the sale could generate as much as £500m for the company which had previously resisted calls to dispose of pubs.On Tuesday, Whitbread said it was disposing of 235 pub restaurants, adding there had been strong demand from both trade and financial buyers. Mitchells & Butlers, the pub operator, in April confirmed its interest.In its retained 400-strong pub restaurant estate, new management was taking action to reduce overheads and was reviewing operating plans for sites where the restaurants are tied to a Travel Inn.David Lloyd Leisure the health club chain, saw like-for-like sales grew by 2.1 per cent and by 6.1 per cent overall.In high street restaurants, which include Costa Coffee as well as the TGI Fridays and Pizza Hut franchises, sales were up 14.1 per cent and by 1.9 per cent on a like-for-like basis. The TGI and Pizza Hut chains are under review and Whitbread said it would update on these brands in three months.Earlier this month, Costa Coffee took over sponsorship of the Whitbread book awards, one of the most prestigious literary prizes. The parent company pulled out of its 34-year-sponsorship last year because it felt consumers did not associate the prize with any of it products.Shares were flat, up 3p at £11.00 in early trade.

Carmakers have been increasingly challenged to design holders that secure a Starbucks venti or one of the ever-bigger soft drink bottles through sharp turns and abrupt stops.The four finalists for the award, organised by Ward’s AutoWorld magazine, suggest that even European and Asian carmakers have learnt the importance of the cup holder.The Mercedes M-Class sport-utility has been nominated for a handsome contraption featuring a stainless-steel frame and a spring-loaded device that can hold down even the tallest containers. Likewise, the cup holders in Hyundai’s Tucson SUV have four springs that can secure anything from a slim Red Bull can to the widest Thermos.Among Detroit-made models, Ford’s Lincoln Zephyr gets the nod because, according to a Ward’s editor, the cup holders “didn’t scream cheap” and would look equally at home in a BMW or Mercedes. Perhaps the niftiest of the four is Chrysler’s new Dodge Caliber hatchback, whose cup holder emits a blue-green glow. From now on, there will be no
excuse for spilling your coffee when you slide into a Caliber on a dark, moonless night.World leaders, take note: if you want to speak with Angela Merkel over the next month, make sure you call before 5pm in Germany.Adidas, the German sportswear company, has built a temporary stadium next to the chancellery where 10,000 noisy fans can watch soccer matches live on huge video screens.The German chancellor is not particularly impressed – “I’m not sure it had to be located here” she said this week – but ultimately she takes a relaxed view. “I’m not sure we are going to be able to work after 5pm” when the fans arrive, she said.Serious-minded Merkel has never been known as a soccer fan, but now, only days before the World Cup’s opening match, she seems to be getting into the spirit. On Wednesday she is due to be chatting with soccer officials at an international congress in Munich of Fifa, the world soccer body. On Friday she will be cheering on Germany against Costa Rica in the tournament’s opening match.She is also scheduled to watch at least five matches – more if the national team wins a few games. That is quite a commitment. But then again, she really has no alternative, given that the World Cup will be (literally) right on her doorstep for the next month.Hong Kong chief executive Donald Tsang, a devout Catholic who attends mass daily, waded into a bitter Sino-Vatican dispute on Monday.On a visit to Yunnan province in south-west China, Tsang attended a mass presided over by Ma Yinglin, who was made a bishop by the Chinese authorities last month in spite of Rome’s strenuous objections.The Vatican insists that it alone has the right to appoint bishops. The dispute over Ma’s elevation sparked the worst crisis between Rome and Beijing in more than six years, and has threatened to derail delicate talks between the two sides over the possible re-establishment of diplomatic relations.In this instance, Tsang appeared torn between two masters – his political bosses in Beijing and the Pope, to whom Hong Kong’s church remains faithful.According to Catholic canon law, bishops who take part in a consecration not sanctioned by the Holy See are automatically excommunicated and lay faithful are instructed to shun them.Church officials in Hong Kong were clearly exasperated by Tsang’s action, but the chief executive at least appears safe from serious sanction. “Mr Tsang will just have to go to confession,” a Vatican source said.Sam Palmisano seems to have buried the ghost of IBM’s past in India.IBM was unceremoniously kicked out of India in the 1970s, but all seemed forgiven on Tuesday when Big Blue announced a stunning $6bn investment in the country. It would appear that IBM has ensured a safe future for itself there.In fact, so splendid was IBM’s proposed investment that the chief guest at the elaborate ceremony, Abdul Kalam, India’s president, was minded to speak for even longer than his allotted 15 minutes, earning rapturous applause.Kalam is known for waxing on about “visions” and he did not disappoint on Tuesday. Still, it seemed an appropriate moment for such talk, with Palmisano predicting an “incredible” future for India.It was all done in a singularly apposite place: a magnificent tent erected on grounds owned by an out-of-work maharajah. Palmisano seems to have chosen a fine way to break with the past.Andrew Cosslett’s appointment as chief executive of Intercontinental Hotels Group last February caused plenty of tut-tutting in the tightly knit hospitality industry.Cosslett, a marketing executive from Cadbury Schweppes, was a novice to the hotel game and, by his own admission, did not even know Intercontinental hailed from the UK, not the US.The rugby-loving executive has since tackled most of the criticism, revamping the company’s brands and delivering earnings growth.Apparently he achieved that without reneging his past: Cosslett greeted Observer’s man with Schweppes ginger ale and a tray of Cadbury-looking chocolates."

While Hank Paulson, the Goldman Sachs chief, was happy to accept George W. Bush’s offer of the job as the next US Treasury secretary, history does not relate what his wife Wendy said over the breakfast table the next morning.For while Hank has been a reliable – and generous – donor to Republican politicians, Wendy’s contributions have tended to end up in Democratic party coffers, including in Hillary Clinton’s Senate campaign.It is June and World Cup fever can no longer be avoided. Will it boost the economy? Will England win? What do our leading economic policymakers have to say on the issue? Gordon Brown, chancellor, next prime minister, Scot and Raith Rovers fan, cannot repeat often enough that he is supporting England. His eyes are firmly on the next election.But Aston Villa-supporting Mervyn King has more latitude in these matters. The World Cup will not have a lasting impact on the economy, he told journalists. With uncharacteristic concern that he might sound belittling, he quickly added: “I would be the last to claim that who wins the World Cup is a trivial matter.”And what probability did the Bank’s 200 or so economists put on an England victory? The governor revealed a shocking lack of respect for the national team: “Since most of the Aston Villa players are playing for teams of other nationalities than the English team . . . I’m afraid our probabilities relate more to those countries than to England,” he said.Every red-blooded red-top tabloid is full of the World Cup these days, and so is the Christian tabloid, The Son (geddit?). The latest issue includes that all-important cut-out-and-keep World Cup wall chart so readers can track England’s progress in Germany.It is full of heart-warming football related pieces, including the editor’s happy memories of his friend Bobby Moore, and how Robbie Savage, the Blackburn Rovers’ tough guy midfielder, is really a softie and gives to a charity for Guatemalan street children (nice one, Robbie). Then there’s the welcome news that churches are now opening faster than Starbucks – tempered by the revelation that some of these “churches” meet in Starbucks.But the real Page 3 scoop is an interview with Phina Oruche (pictured in mini-skirt and plunging neckline), the actress who plays Liberty Baker in Footballers’ Wives (I believe it’s a popular TV show). She says that in real life she is nothing like the person she portrays. “I’m celibate, so I think it’s God’s cosmic joke that I get off at work but not at home.” Ah, and I thought that was called acting.“Kent, sir – everybody knows Kent. Apples, cherries, hops and women,” said Mr Jingle in Charles Dickens’ Pickwick Papers. But now we hear Kent is no longer “the garden of England”, and North Yorkshire is Britain’s “most beautiful county”.News to the Kent Tourism Alliance – motto, Kent: the Garden of England – and Kent County Council. Rising above mudslinging, Graham Gibbens of Kent council extols his county’s virtues, adding tactfully that North Yorkshire is “different”.Meanwhile, John Weighell, leader of North Yorkshire County Council, says it confirms what he always knew. “There are few other places in England that can compete with the serenity of our rolling dales and heather-clad moors, the gentle bustle of our market towns and our miles of unspoilt coast,” he lyricises. And the bracing east winds, too. Let’s just say both are beautiful, in their own way.It is the first of flaming June on Thursday. Make the most of it: in three weeks’ time – awful thought – the nights will be drawing in again.
968;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-05-22T17:11:38Z;Stefan Stern: Managers search for ‘the next coffee’;;"“Consider the simple act of drinking a cup of coffee,” suggests Professor Anthony Giddens, in a passage from his weighty textbook Sociology. This apparently banal, everyday activity is, in fact, filled with meaning.Drinking coffee is a personal ritual with symbolic value, Prof Giddens says. It is not just a question of taking refreshment; a statement, of a kind, is being made. Coffee is also a social lubricant. “Two people who arrange to meet for coffee are probably more interested in getting together and chatting than in what they actually drink,” he writes.The coffee in your cup has reached you through a series of historical, economic and social developments, Prof Giddens adds. It is a global phenomenon par excellence. But not every country feels the same way about the product. And unlike cocaine or heroin, but like alcohol, coffee remains by and large a socially acceptable stimulant.This is not merely interesting social science. It is an intriguing insight into one of the more startling business developments of recent years: the amazing growth in the market for premium priced coffee, sold in an ever-expanding array of outlets.Companies beat themselves up – rightly – over their failure to innovate successfully. Perhaps sometimes they are simply not paying enough attention to the world around them, to what potential customers might snap up if only a business made it available. What choices are busy office workers making at lunchtime about what to eat and drink? Why do shoppers – especially women – behave in the way they do?Whoever spots “the next coffee” will certainly be on to something big. The International Coffee Organisation estimates that retail sales around the world now approach $70bn. Starbucks, the market leader in coffee shops, has more than 11,000 stores in 37 countries, serving more than 40m customers each week. So no more scoffing, please, at sociology lecturers. They may have more to tell you about consumers and the potential growth of certain industries than the world’s burgeoning army of market researchers.The premium coffee providers have pulled off that incredibly rare trick that seems to remain beyond the capability of most other businesses. They have invented the need for something.Where once, not very long ago, the broad mass of consumers were happy with the occasional cup of something called “coffee” – an undistinguished, modestly priced serving of hot brown liquid – now millions of customers have built at least one trip a day to the temples of frothy, steaming satisfaction into their work schedule. No focus group or opinion poll would have uncovered a frustrated desire among consumers to spend five times as much as they did on a cup of coffee.Instead, a few clever people backed a hunch. In the same way, Sony did not wait until a critical mass of customers had banged on their doors demanding to be able to listen to their cassette tapes as they waited for the train. They just gave us the Walkman, and then counted their winnings. The greatest innovations stem from such bold and original thinking.Whether Bill Johnson, Heinz chief executive, is about to enter the innovation hall of fame is not quite so clear. At least he is trying. As he told this paper last week, he believes his company needs to give people “new ways to use beans”. Heinz has developed a ready-made version of beans on toast, along the lines of Kellogg’s jam-filled Pop Tarts. “If people take the time to cook beans and put it on toast, why shouldn’t we cut the process for them and give them beans on toast?” Mr Johnson asks. The market should give him an answer soon enough.The other great insight of the premium coffee industry has been to tap into a significant global trend in the developed world: the desire to go upmarket and enjoy higher levels of luxury. As Michael Silverstein and Neil Fiske argued in their 2003 book Trading Up, the winners in this new marketplace do not underestimate their customers, they strive to raise quality in terms of both the product itself and the customer’s overall experience.And if you also are lucky enough to depend on a raw material, such as coffee, whose price has remained historically low for an extended period, the profit margins you can achieve are all the more appetising. Customers will keep forking out according to Warren Buffett’s “Price is what you pay, value is what you get” principle.Starbucks has flourished not just by providing customers with a bewildering range of drinks to choose from. It has worked hard at creating a familiar and pleasing (to its devotees) environment, in a way that Prof Giddens would understand. The company is almost as much about experience as it is about coffee.In the UK next month, the Royal Society of Arts is co-hosting (with Starbucks) a series of so-called “coffee house challenges” or debates, a conscious attempt to recreate one of the original purposes of the 18th century coffee house, which was a place for argument, gossip and literary and political intrigue.The “simple act” of drinking a cup of coffee is not so simple after all. But some of us have known this for years. My grandfather, Immanuel Stern, was a coffee addict. Friends and colleagues were astounded at his prodigious intake of the stuff, a habit he doubtless acquired in the coffee houses of turn-of-the-century Vienna, where he studied law.“But Dr Stern,” concerned house guests would ask, late into the evening as he downed yet another cup, “don’t you ever have trouble getting to sleep, drinking all this coffee?” “Only when it is not strong enough,” he would reply, “and then I get so cross that I just can’t get to sleep.”"
969;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-05-05T14:21:55Z;Panera rises to the challenge;;Panera Bread, one of the leading “fast casual” restaurant chains in the US, will on Friday unveil plans for 25 per cent long-term earnings growth, marking the first time it has committed to such a target since going public in 1991.The company’s ambitious forecast is consistent with a stellar earnings and sales performance over the past five years. Compound annual earnings per share growth has been 49 per cent over the period. Last week the company unveiled a 25 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings to $15m, exceeding Wall Street expectations.Panera will use its first analysts’ day on Friday to explain how it aimed to deliver continued growth over the next decade, including new menu items and store redesigns. It will also expand into Canada next year.The company said it was aiming for growth of 30-32 per cent in earnings per share this year compared with a rise of 32 per cent to $1.52 last year. It defines “long term” as three to five years.Its business model is based on growing demand for “speciality” or “artisan” breads, for which it can charge a premium price as consumers increasingly trade up from cheaper chains.Panera bakes all of its bread at each of its almost 900 stores, which the company claims have more average sales per unit than Starbucks or dining chains such as Outback Steakhouse.It serves sandwiches, salads and soups, using organic ingredients and claims to be the only such chain using antibiotic-free chicken.William Blair, a Chicago investment house, says Panera should generate almost $2bn in system-wide sales this year. It puts Panera’s return on fully capitalised investment at more than 25 per cent.Panera traces its origins to Au Bon Pain, a “bakery-café” founded in 1981 by Louis Kane and Ron Shaich, a former treasurer of the Massachusetts Democratic party.In 1993, publicly listed Au Bon Pain bought St Louis Bread, a small, Missouri-based speciality bread chain. Au Bon Pain was sold in 1999 but Mr Shaich retained the St Louis assets, creating a stand-alone company that remained listed as Panera Bread.Mr Shaich said the 25 per cent earnings per share target would consist of 17 per cent growth in outlets, translating into the opening of 150-160 bakery-cafés a year. That marks a slight acceleration of the rate of store openings from last year’s 139.Same-store sales were seen growing at 2-5 per cent.Mr Shaich said that while Panera was in 36 states, the company had not yet entered 20 per cent of the country.The business was scarcely affected by the “low carb” Atkins diet craze, which damaged sales of bread and pasta in the US throughout 2003. Same-store sales growth slipped to 0.2 per cent but recovered the next year. On Thursday, Panera reported a 2.8 per cent rise in monthly sales for April.Panera’s reliance on relatively affluent customers has also shielded it from macro-economic shocks such as a sharp decline in consumer spending after the US terrorist attacks in 2001.“We have almost never missed a target. We’ve been at this a long time and we’re very conscious of what credibility means,” Mr Shaich told the FT.Panera will this year start re-imaging its stores and rolling out a flat-bread pizzato to capture more evening customers. Mr Shaich said: “If Panera is anything it is not flavour of the month. The first thing I worry about is keeping the concept special and differentiating it [from the competition].”
970;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Wrong numbers;;For nearly two months, a glossy magazine from my mobile phone company has been lying around the place. I took it with the intention of choosing a decent calling plan, but so far I’ve made little progress. Occasionally, I pick it up and thumb it listlessly but cannot get my mind around the different pricing options.The permutations include on-peak, off-peak, in-network, out-of-network, joint accounts, “bundles” of this and that, and a variety of additional offers conditional on my signing some form of longer term contract. The choice is bewildering.Usually, I have little sympathy with those who complain about the agony of choice. If the choice is important, such as when you buy a house, then it’s good to have the choice even between fine details. If the choice is not important, such as that between the 55,000 drinks alleged to be available at Starbucks, then few of us acquire grey hairs making it.But the range of phone tariffs isn’t that kind of choice. All we’re being offered is a number of different prices. Unlike the choice between the Venti caramel latte and the small black coffee, the choice between “Any network anytime 200” and “Any network off-peak 1000” is not a matter of taste. There’s a correct answer and dozens of incorrect ones, and a computer armed with your bill and your company’s tariffs could work out, with hindsight, what you should have done.With neither the computer nor the hindsight you can end up paying far more than you should. You will also struggle to discern who offers the best deals. So it’s tempting to conclude that the confusion is deliberate.Economists had little to say about confusion pricing until recently. We find it hard to talk about the subject because the Vulcans who live in our economic models don’t get confused. However, Eugenio Miravete, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania, has been studying how humans, not Vulcans, choose between confusing calling plans. His conclusion is that customers leave little on the table. They are good at judging which calling plan will cost least, and good at switching if they guess wrong.I wasn’t sure what to make of Miravete’s research. It is limited by the availability of detailed data, so Miravete only studied the early days of confusion pricing, when the choice was between just two calling plans. My company offers 10, plus innumerable combinations of frills and top-ups. I face much more demanding calculations than the ones Miravete studied - hence my well-thumbed magazine and no decision.But something strange happened after I read about Professor Miravete’s intelligent, motivated subjects. I felt ashamed and was galvanised into calling my phone company. I spoke to a nice Scottish lady called Katie, who was very quickly able to tell me how much I was paying, and for what, before suggesting a couple of different tariffs that look likely to save me £10 or £15 a month. Not bad for a five-minute phone call.The experience suggests that confusion pricing is not really about trying to entangle every customer in an impenetrable web of complex offers. Instead, it’s a very simple screening device to spot customers with money to burn. If you don’t care enough about your phone bill to ask for advice, then you can obviously afford to pay a little more.I wondered whether my life might be made even easier, though. Couldn’t the phone company just use its computer to offer me the best deal, with hindsight, each month? “I’m afraid we can’t do that,” said Katie, rather sweetly. “I don’t know why. That is the way things have been organised for some time.”
971;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-04-13T16:40:49Z;McDonald’s sales beat estimates;;McDonald’s Corp. on Thursday said March sales at established hamburger restaurants rose more than expected but forecast a quarterly profit in line with Wall Street targets with a stronger U.S. dollar and several one-time charges weighing on earnings.Same-store sales, a key retail measure that tracks revenue at restaurants open at least 13 months, rose 5.3 percent in March, spurred by demand for a new coffee blend and other breakfast items in the United States and improved performance in France and Russia.Three Wall Street analysts had expected a rise of 2.3 percent to 4 percent, according to research notes.The world’s biggest restaurant company said it expects to report first-quarter earnings of about 49 cents a share, matching Wall Street’s average expectation, according to Reuters Estimates.Analysts said a stronger dollar and charges for closing 25 restaurants in the United Kingdom and acquiring some outlets from Brazilian franchisees trimmed first-quarter earnings by about 2 cents a share. When the U.S. currency is strong, earnings in foreign markets are worth less in dollar terms.Higher commodity-related costs may also have crimped profits, according to one McDonald’s investor.“There may continue to have been some pressure both from fuel and on paper costs,” said Janna Sampson, director of portfolio management at Oakbrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, which owns about 900,000 McDonald’s shares.In the United States, same-store sales rose 6.6 percent, while Europe posted a rise of 1.6 percent, the company said.Analysts had forecast a rise of 3.4 percent to 4 percent in the United States and a drop of 1 percent to a rise of 5.4 percent in Europe.One analyst said McDonald’s new Premium Roast Coffee has been a “big hit,” even with consumers used to drinking Starbucks Corp.’s premium coffee.“It drives people to the stores,” said Carl Sibilski, managing director of Oyster Capital Management, in Chicago. “A lot of coffee drinkers that I typically saw with Dunkin’ Donuts or Starbucks cups, I started seeing them with McDonald’s coffee cups.”Sibilski said late-night sales had also helped boost U.S. same-store sales, though those transactions are less profitable because a restaurant needs to keep running during hours when sales are less frequent.In Europe, McDonald’s No. 2 market, the increase came despite bad weather and the shift of Easter and school-related holidays to April from March, McDonald’s said in a news release.In Asia, the Middle East and Africa, comparable sales for March were up 5 percent, the company said.McDonald’s shares were down 31 cents at $34.88 in morning trade Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.Additional reporting by Reuters in Chicago
972;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-03-31T14:46:48Z;Ground down;;"The nearest J.S. Bach came to writing an opera was his Coffee Cantata, in which the heroine, Leischen, develops such a mania for coffee - “more delicious than a thousand kisses!” - that she won’t marry unless her husband swears to indulge her passion thrice daily. Written in 1732 to be performed in Zimmerman’s coffee house in Leipzig, it marked continental acceptance of this pleasant, if disturbingly liberating, drink. Yet, nearly three centuries on, the coffee bar culture has only recently returned to Britain: 2005 was the first year in which coffee, albeit instant, outsold tea in the UK.The contemporary craze for coffee began in mid-1950s London, where the drink carried some of the same connotations as it did in Bach’s time. Proper coffee was found in Soho, an area of strip clubs, prostitutes, and Italian, Greek and Algerian cafes and restaurants. So in the minds of the young, for whom tea was fatally linked to their parents, and to the adjective “nice” - as in “let’s have a nice cup of tea” - coffee became associated with sex and the Continent, each a stimulus to the heart and a danger to Olde Englande.Coffee bar culture was democratic, too, in an upwardly mobile way. The pop singer Adam Faith wrote in his memoir that “every other doorway (in Soho) seemed to be a coffee bar. And into Soho every day drifted the young hopefuls with their guitars, all hoping to get a night’s work or week’s work from the owners of these coffee bars.” Thus began the decline of the English tearoom, which had been a place where ladies and gentlemen took tea, and where those who were not ladies or gentlemen didn’t have the time or the money to go.Hampstead village, one of the more expensive parts of the world, is a microcosm of how far coffee culture has advanced since then. In the past few years, almost every business that has closed or moved - most recently a restaurant, a mobile phone shop and a newsagent - has been replaced by a cafe. Now, on or just off Hampstead High Street, there are 10 places where you can get a cup of coffee and sit at a table, quite often outside. The coffee will never be Nescafe, and the person serving it will almost never have a British accent.The doyen of these establishments, The Coffee Cup, is also the most faded. The outside features a few tables under an ageing awning; inside has the smell of decades of fat frying. On the other hand, it is not a chain, and it’s cosy: the dark wood panelling and shaded sconces suggest a cross between fin de siecle Vienna and 1950s Cricklewood High Street; there’s no piped music, and the often ageing clientele read or chat quietly.The proprietor, Steven Popovic, came here from Serbia in the late sixties and bought the place from Mrs Brenda Black in 1970: Black had opened it, with her husband, sometime in the mid-1950s - coffee bar time. “It’s been good. Not so good now,” said Popovic, a square, strong man in his sixties who seemed weary and a bit impatient. “The competition? It doesn’t help, what do you think? I’ll do this a few more years.”When The Coffee Cup was threatened with closure in the mid-1990s, the Hampstead residents’ association mounted a campaign to save it. But what actually prevented his eviction, Popovic said, was that developers couldn’t get the necessary permission. He also explained that his was not, in fact, the oldest coffee place in Hampstead: that would be Louis’ around the corner.I phoned and asked Louis (”don’t worry about the second name”) if I could visit his cafe. “It’s not a cafe, it’s a tearoom,” he said, his Hungarian accent still thick. “Anyway, come.”When I went, I met a man in his seventies, wearing a startlingly obvious grey wig and a white coat over a vest. After the 1956 uprising in Hungary, Louis escaped over the border, and was recruited by the National Coal Board to be a miner. “But when we got there, the British miners went on strike, because they wanted the jobs for their sons, so we left.”The son of a general, trained as a pastry cook, Louis got a job in a restaurant for three years. But he wanted his own place. He looked round Hampstead, saw something called Sherry’s Bakery for sale, and borrowed bits and pieces of money from everyone he knew to buy it. After two slow years, business at Louis’ Patisserie picked up, then boomed: he had a line of creamy Austro-Hungarian pastries that people loved. At the height of his powers, Louis had four shops, including one that still bears his name on nearby Finchley Road.Although he serves coffee, Louis wanted his place to be a tearoom because he thought the English liked tea. So his clientele tended to be ladies and gentlemen, who sat at little round tables with etched glass insets and ate pastries off china with silver cutlery. And even though things are not what they were, yet his customers still speak with a hushed, old-fashioned civility, watched over by tired-looking waitresses in aprons.Louis has sold the other shops and does pastries only for Hampstead, though “they don’t buy them as much now. Tastes change. I try to change too, a bit, sometimes introduce a new line, but it’s not easy.”The competition that has demoralised Popovic and given Louis’ pastries a pasting is a new generation of coffee bars: Caffe Nero, a little down the hill from Hampstead High Street; Cafe Rouge, higher up, and, on the other side of the street from Hampstead underground station, Maison Blanc, Starbucks, and Gail’s.At the chain cafes, you don’t talk to the staff, nor, of course, the owner: you are referred, instantly and nervously, to PR departments. Maison Blanc let me talk on the telephone to the managing director Russell Maddock (who has since left the company). He told me the firm’s history. It’s French in the sense that a Frenchman started it: Raymond Blanc, of Le Manoir aux Quat’ Saisons in Oxford, opened a Maison Blanc there 21 years ago. (The name of the founder explains why the masculine adjective, blanc, doesn’t agree with a feminine noun, maison.) Now there are 16 such shops, in pretty and pretty expensive parts of London, including Holland Park and Chelsea.In the dozen years it’s been in Hampstead, Maison Blanc has established itself as the place to go for exquisitely tooled pastries. It recently widened the seating area to accommodate small tables served by young French men and women who, contrary to stereotype, respond with polite delight when anyone attempts to address them in French. Maddock, who isn’t at all French, had the cheer of one leading a growing business. Maison Blanc - which is now owned by Lyndale Foods, in turn owned by Montagu Private Equity - is opening new cafes and plans to launch a chain of gourmet fast-food shops.In competition with the Starbucks next door, however, Maison Blanc is somewhat shamed, as European enterprises often are, by the American can-do spirit. Maison Blanc opens from 8am to 7pm. Starbucks opens at 7am and closes at 8pm. Where Maison Blanc was until recently almost comically cramped, Starbucks is spacious and looks like the set of Friends, with little booths, high tables and comfy sofas. The coffee isn’t the best, but there’s a big choice; if you want to avoid the Maison’s colossal calorie numbers, there’s the skinny blueberry muffin to go with the skinny latte grande. When I was there, some Friends-type people lounged on the sofas, while two old men were having a “no-one cares any more” conversation near by, oblivious to the fact that they were getting vastly better service (from the multinational staff) in much greater comfort than they had in their youth or middle age. Women with babies go there, because it has room for the prams or fashionable McClarens pushchairs. There was piped music, to be sure, which was irritating but not too loud.Starbucks’ PR people e-mailed me a list of special events organised by the Hampstead branch. One was a debate on “risk and failure in a society hooked on success”, something Louis knows plenty about but wouldn’t stage a debate on. Starbucks works very hard on its public image; it uses fair trade coffee and advertises the good work it does with coffee growers. It needs to, because a lot of people don’t like it. In nearby Primrose Hill, a group of distinguished local residents and habitues - including the writer Alan Bennett, the actor Jude Law, the director of the National Theatre, Nicholas Hytner, the broadcaster Joan Bakewell, the author Jeanette Winterson and the artist Patrick Caulfield - led a successful campaign to keep Starbucks off the area’s pretty little shopping street, to protect the locals from its coffee and the independent cafes from the competition.Their worries may have been misplaced. Despite its bright, roomy Starbucks (and a McDonald’s exactly opposite, where the kids and poor people go), Hampstead continues to sprout coffee shops. Across the street from Maison Blanc is a Paul boulangerie and patisserie (”Maison fondee en 1889” - in France, so the adjective agrees with the noun), a Holder Company subsidiary that is expanding fast in Britain, offering coffee along with its speciality breads. The old mobile phone shop has been reborn as Gail’s, which opens even later than Starbucks, has delicious breads and pastries and soups and now has the buzz of being the best. In this enclave, few consider which might give the best value: Mr Popovic and Louis are losing business to places that charge more, not less, for a cup of caffeine.But the new cafes do a better job of projecting the aura of sophisticated self-indulgence that cafes have always had, and which needs to be updated at least every generation. That is what made coffee the toast (and the roast) of Leipzig, of Soho, and now of any neighbourhood with social aspirations."

But I have this friend – well, more of an acquaintance, really – who tells me the shop makes a particular point of selling so-called ethical products: you know, spanking paddles made from naturally-felled wood, non-toxic sex toys endorsed by the World Wildlife Fund, Fairtrade leather bondage gear and so on.We should not be surprised. After all, Coco de Mer’s founder, Sam Roddick, is the daughter of Anita Roddick, who pioneered modern-day ethical retailing by founding The Body Shop 30 years ago.Yet it is not just sex that is getting sustainable. These days, all kinds of businesses are jumping aboard the ethical trading bandwagon. Last week, Topshop, a trendy British clothing retailer, said it was introducing three ethical clothing concessions – People Tree, Hug and Gossypium – to its flagship London store. A few days earlier I was reading about Ethos Water, now owned by Starbucks, which promises to donate 5 cents towards water projects in underdeveloped countries for every bottle sold. A few weeks before that, American Express said it was joining with Bono, the rock star, to market the American Express Red card (initially in the UK), which will dedicate some of its revenues to fighting HIV/Aids in Africa.What are ethical products? Well, to give you an idea, the official Fairtrade logo on a product denotes that the developing country growers who supply it are being guaranteed a good price, while a seal of approval from the Rainforest Alliance indicates that a product has been grown or made sustainably.Marvellous. But where does that leave all the other products of the world? Must we assume they are made only by ripping off poor farmers, exploiting child labour, plundering the planet’s resources and despoiling the environment?Perhaps we should not care. There is a theory – though frankly, most of us would rather be spotted coming out of a sex shop than caught subscribing to it – that globalisation, trade liberalisation and Adam Smith’s invisible hand will take care of world poverty if only they are given free rein. And since the richer people get, the more they care about sustainability, that will take care of the environment, too. Anyway, we can always go and strip-mine some other planet if all the stuff on earth runs out.But getting back to ethical products: based on past experience and market research, conventional wisdom used to have it that sweatshop-free and eco-friendly goods would rarely command anything other than market niches because the overwhelming majority of shoppers were more interested in price and brand attributes than a product’s ethical credentials.Now, however, I think what is happening is that those ethical credentials are becoming brand attributes themselves.To elaborate: previously, the big problem ethical products faced in an era of cynicism and ironic detachment was the fact that they were seldom thought of as cool. They were associated with middle-aged, middle-class baby-boomers who, a generation ago, had adopted love, peace and the worship of nature as part of their romantic revolution against the bourgeois culture of their parents. The baby-boomers’ children tended to regard those boomer attitudes in much the same way as they did Levi’s jeans: as something your father wore.What changed? A couple of things. First, celebrities discovered the advantages of supporting a good cause. Under increasing media scrutiny, they realised it was no longer acceptable just to wallow in the wealth and fame that society bestowed on them; it was a lot better for their images if they could claim to be using that wealth and fame to give something back to the world. Also, to the extent that it increased their exposure, it was cash in the bank. And, like beauty pageant contestants pledging to end world hunger, many found it added an illusion of depth to their otherwise vacuous characters.So celebrities helped make good causes fashionable. But something else happened, too. Perhaps reflecting more cynical times, the idea of charitable giving changed. Once, it meant just that: giving, in a private act of self-denial, to a cause. Now, it is less often a donation and more often a transaction – a two-way process in which the charity benefits but you get something out of it too, such as the thrill of attending a fund-raising rock concert or the fascination of undertaking a sponsored trek in some exotic, distant land.Ethical products are the most obvious example. Each time you make a purchase, you get something back as well as feeling you are doing some good. But the real bonus is that, in most cases, these products are on display as evidence of your goodness. Like those self-congratulatory wrist bands that scream “I just gave $1 to charity!”, a bottle of Ethos water or an American Express Red card proclaim to all who see them what a praiseworthy person you are.At least the people coming out of Coco de Mer have an excuse. After all, who, apart from their partners, are ever going to see their purchases? Perhaps the person with the spanking paddle is the only true altruist left.richard.tomkins@ft.com"
974;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-03-03T21:04:15Z;Arne Alsin: Dull ideas can go a long way;;Investors are quick to bid up the prices of companies with exciting, breakthrough products or services. Any new invention or paradigm-altering technology generates a wave of enthusiasm from investors – and usually a rich valuation that reflects the potential good news.Until the Nasdaq peaked above 5,000 in March 2000, investors were wildly aggressive in bidding up the prices of technology and internet companies. A similar level of enthusiasm exists today in the rich market valuations given to stocks such as XM Satellite (XMSR) and Sirius Satellite (SIRI), whose technology is changing the way radio entertainment is distributedWhile the crowd is attracted to breakthrough companies with extraordinary products, companies with simple, unexciting products can get overlooked. For example, if you bought shares of Starbucks (is there a simpler product than coffee?) at the peak of tech enthusiasm in March 2000, your shares would be up more than four-fold today, against a Nasdaq decline of more than 50 per cent for the same period.If you bought shares of Whole Foods Market (WFMI), a natural foods grocer, at the Nasdaq peak in March 2000, you would be up more than six-fold. I recommended companies such as Office Depot (ODP) and JC Penney (JCP) in published writing in December 2000. They are each up more than five-fold.Here are three companies that offer simple products (I hold shares in all of them) that are currently overlooked.CarMax (KMX) Growing at 18-20 per cent per year, this business is the top US retailer of a very simple product: used cars. The CarMax customer experience is a dramatic departure from the customer experience at traditional used car dealers. CarMax sells late-model used cars at no-haggle prices, with no-haggle cash offers for trade-ins. The CarMax sales process is transparent, using none of the sales tricks and upsells that are notorious at traditional used-car dealers.Buying CarMax stock is similar to buying Home Depot stock in the early 1980s. The addressable used-car market in the US is the same size as the home improvement market (about $300bn) and it is highly fragmented, again like the home improvement retail space in the 1980s. Sales at CarMax will exceed $6bn in the fiscal year ending this month, an increase of more than 50 per cent in the last three years. By my calculations sales will grow to in excess of $13bn by 2010 and CarMax stock, currently quoted at $31, will be worth $86 by 2010.Commerce Bank (CBH) While this company has a simple product, everything else about the company is flat-out impressive. The long-term track record of Commerce cannot be matched by any other US bank. It has increased deposits at a 30 per cent annualised rate over the last 10 years through unparalleled service and attention to the customer. For example, it is open seven days a week for extended hours, and has no-fee credit cards.While the flat yield curve has depressed the bank’s earnings for the last few quarters, investors should regard this as an aberration. A return to a more typical yield curve will result in huge earnings gains for Commerce because of its large asset base.Using conservative assumptions regarding interest rates, my calculations indicate a value for Commerce stock of $97 in 2010, up from the current quote of $34. This assumes deposits grow by 25 per cent a year, a reasonable expectation given their plan for branch expansion.Overstock.com (OSTK) This is an online retailer with a very simple product. It is the online equivalent of an outlet store. It sells excess inventory for many of the world’s premier name brands. Overstock is currently overlooked because it is aggressively grabbing market share at the expense of earnings – a smart strategy. Revenue grew 60 per cent last year and will exceed $1bn annually by next year.It could grow less quickly but the first-mover advantage in this space is critical. This is a winner-take-all category. As with Ebay in the online auction market, once a company dominates the excess inventory space (as Overstock is doing), the contest is effectively over. Both buyers and sellers of excess inventory naturally migrate to the company with the most girth. That company will have the largest and broadest selection of products (making buyers happy), and will be able to move the most products at the quickest rate (making manufacturers happy).While its operating metrics are similar to Amazon’s, Overstock’s market position and earnings power are not reflected in the stock quote. My calculations indicate that this $23 stock will reach $92 by 2010.
975;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-02-23T08:46:25Z;HP ready to enter retail market for photographs;;"Hewlett-Packard will on Thursday announce a big push into the retail photo printing market, a move that will put the computer maker in direct competition with photography stalwarts such as Kodak and Fuji.The company, which already has a presence in the in-home and online photo markets, is set to announce two new products: a digital photo-finishing unit for use behind the counter in commercial photo processing labs; and a smaller stand-alone in-store kiosk.Vyomesh Joshi, head of HP’s imaging and printing group, said HP would combine elements of its printing and computer technology portfolio to make photo-
finishing more attractive to retailers and to expand the array of services available to customers.“Our goal is to do for photo-finishing what Starbucks did for coffee,” said Mr Joshi.The move comes as companies such as Kodak and Fuji seek to adjust to the changes that have swept the photo-finishing industry following the widespread adoption of digital cameras. Many digital camera owners have chosen to store their photos on their computers or online instead of printing them.Kodak and Fuji dominate the market for digital photo-finishing, and convincing retailers to abandon their relationships with the industry leaders could be a difficult proposition.Mr Joshi said HP would try to address that challenge by making “two bold moves” to change the way retailers and customers think about photo-finishing.The first move would be to utilise HP’s printing and computer technology to make retail photo-finishing more economically efficient.He said the second would be to offer consumers products that move beyond the commoditised 4x6 photograph that currently accounts for about 90 per cent of retail photo printing. HP’s in-store units will offer higher-margin products such as poster-sized prints and hard-bound photo albums, printed on demand.HP already sells a line of in-home photo printers and supplies, and last year it bought Snapfish, an online photo processing company that mails prints to customers who upload them to its web site.The company’s move to embrace retail photo printing partly reflects a shift in momentum away from in-home printing, which formed the core of HP’s early digital strategy. Mr Joshi said the company had begun to realise that customers were demanding photo printing wherever it was most convenient, whether at home, in a retail store or online.“Where are consumers going to print in the future? The answer is all three,” said Mr Joshi.HP’s high-end commercial photo-finishing unit, for use behind the counter at film processors and other stores, will retail for about $50,000.A smaller stand-alone kiosk will retail for about $15,000."
976;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Bonds can help government quit oppressive habit;;Never too eager to lead from the front, this week British parliamentarians followed Ireland, Spain, Italy, New York and California as they voted to introduce a ban on smoking in bars, restaurants and offices – so-called “public spaces”. (Those people who really believe offices and restaurants are public spaces might try organising a Boy Scout jamboree in one.)The decision, of course, owes much to the fact that defending the right to smoke is politically as appealing as defending the right to pick your nose. Whether the new law is sensible is another matter.It is easy to conjure up justifications for a smoking ban but harder to make them stand up to scrutiny. The most popular argument recently has been that smoking must be banned in public spaces because passive smoking can be dangerous. Bar staff or customers exposed to smoke from other people’s cigarettes are running a health risk.That is true, but customers are well aware of the risks of passive smoking, as well as the stench, and can always take their money to a less smoky environment. Staff are also free to work where they please, at least since Britain outlawed slavery back in 1833. If customers really are clamouring for smoke-free places to relax and chat with friends, we should see an ample supply of them provided by some entrepreneurial company. We do, and the company is called Starbucks.Many pubs cater profitably to smokers because there are plenty of smokers keen to pay, many non-smokers not concerned enough to look elsewhere, and bar staff who are happy to be paid to take the risks of the job. The government has no more business interfering with the pleasures of these consenting adults than it has imposing a dress code in nightclubs – not even if such a dress code might improve the typical club-goer’s experience. Nightclub owners can be the judge of that, and their customers will let them know quickly whether they have made the right call.An alternative argument is that smokers are a drain on publicly funded or subsidised health systems, and this justifies measures to discourage smoking. Unfortunately, the sums do not add up. Life is, it turns out, 100 per cent fatal and Alzheimer’s disease is a lot more expensive than a quick coronary arrest. Anyone misguided enough to believe that individual welfare should be subordinated to the bottom line of the National Health Service should be arguing for a cigarette subsidy.The final justification for the smoking ban is that it will help smokers to quit. Well, that is also true, but not all smokers wish to quit. Pile on enough humiliation and inconvenience and we can persuade most smokers to give up in disgust, but not all of them will thank us. The next stage in the process will be to make every smoker wear a collar and a cow bell, so that non-smokers can avoid them in the street.No one can deny that smoking is a dangerous habit and that many smokers are tormented by their addiction and dearly wish to stop. The nannying impulse of the government is therefore understandable. But there is a better way for the government to help those smokers who want to quit, without oppressing those who do not.It is time for a bit of policy entrepreneurship. Why not try something that has not been attempted elsewhere instead of aping the Californians or the Irish?Here are the pieces of the puzzle: a government desperate to flex its muscles to restrain wayward nicotine-addled citizens, millions of smokers desperate for someone to be firm with them and a huge public-sector borrowing requirement.My proposal is simplicity itself. Any smoker who wants to quit can call a government hotline or log on to a website and buy “Quitter’s Bonds”. They will be available in denominations to suit any budget.Quitter’s Bonds will be financial assets like Treasury bills or premium bonds, but they will have an unusual feature. They will pay no interest and will not be redeemable except by the original purchaser. In order to cash in her Quitter’s Bonds she will have to pass a year of random blood tests to demonstrate that she has stubbed out the habit. Until then, the money is an interest-free loan to a hard-hearted government with unlimited reserves of moral superiority.Quitter’s Bonds have an honourable pedigree, in the Christmas Clubs popular with American families in the 1970s. Customers would give their money, interest free, to banks. In exchange, banks would refuse to allow them to take it out until the beginning of December. Coercive, yes – but the coercion is voluntary. Anyone who preferred to save for Christmas in his own way could open a conventional bank account.In spite of the sometime popularity of Christmas Clubs, I am not convinced that Quitter’s Bonds will have many takers, but that is perhaps the point: it is up to each smoker to decide if he would like the government to help force him to quit.There is an added bonus. Since smokers tend to die young, there is a good chance that many Quitter’s Bonds will never be redeemed for cash. In troubled times, what could be better for the public finances?The writer is the FT’s ‘Dear Economist’ and author of the new book The Undercover Economist
977;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-02-13T18:12:05Z;Google has Wall Street searching for stability;;Google shares suffered another blow on Monday, dropping to their lowest level in four months after the influential business weekly Barron’s warned that the stock could fall by as much as 50 per cent over the next year because of the threat of click fraud and increased competition.Barron’s said that “there could be a lot more tumbling ahead” as the internet search leader grappled with growing competition from Microsoft and Yahoo and pricing pressure on its online advertisement sales.Sentiment towards Google has turned sharply negative since its fourth-quarter results fell short of the most optimistic market expectations. Its shares have shed 26 per cent of their market value over the past four weeks and yesterday fell 4.7 per cent to $345.70.Google’s pull-back weighed on other internet stocks, with Yahoo down 1.5 per cent at $32.04 and online book retailer Amazon falling 1.7 per cent to $37.86.Apple Computer, another stock that had seen its market value soar in recent months, dropped 3.9 per cent to $64.71.The losses left the Nasdaq Composite down 1 per cent at 2,239.81 for the session while the S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent lower at 1,262.86 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.2 per cent to 10,892.32.Christopher Johnson, director of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer’s investment research, said the market was weighed down by a number of factors, including fear of a hawkish Federal Reserve. He added that the market had dropped below an important technical support level, potentially prompting investors to lose confidence.“The 50-day trendline of the S&P 500 serves as a short to intermediate term barometer for the market’s strength,” he said. “The fact that we are trading below this trendline indicates that stock prices have been deteriorating and are likely to continue until we move back above the line.”Among other movers, coffee chain Starbucks retreated after UBS cut its rating on the stock from “buy” to “neutral”. The broker cited valuation concerns, saying that there was potential for slower same-store sales growth. Starbucks shares fell 2.6 per cent to $34.57.Merrill Lynch shares were active after reports that the investment bank was in advanced talks to acquire a large stake in money manager BlackRock for $8bn. Merrill was up 1.4 per cent at $73.83. BlackRock surged 8 per cent to $141.99.The quarterly earnings season ends this week. Scientific testing equipment maker Agilent Technologies fell 4 per cent to $34.45 despite announcing a bigger than expected increase in first-quarter profit.Computer makers Hewlett-Packard and Dell, due to report this week, put in mixed shows. HP gained 0.7 per cent to $31.74 and Dell fell 0.7 per cent to $31.57.
978;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-02-03T22:46:45Z;Wall Street throws the book at Amazon;;Amazon, the online retailer, became the latest internet company to disappoint investors after poorly-received figures from search engine Google earlier this week.Amazon shares plunged more than 10 per cent to $38.33 yesterday as its fourth-quarter earnings fell short of Wall Street expectations. Sales missed the target, earnings were sharply lower as aggressive discounts over the holiday period cut into margins, while its earnings forecast for the full year was lower than hoped.Anthony Noto, analyst at Goldman Sachs, cut his price target on the stock by up to $9 to $34-$38 and said the news “reinforced long-term concerns regarding structural issues with Amazon’s business model that are limiting growth in some categories and resulting in rising costs of growth”.Gateway further added to the technology sector’s woes after it also failed to meet analysts’ earnings expectations. Its shares slumped 13 per cent to $2.42 as Bear Stearns slashed its rating to “underperform”.Overall, the Nasdaq Composite index closed down 0.8 per cent at 2,262.58 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 each fell 0.5 per cent to 10,793.62 and 1,264.03, respectively.For the week, the Dow fell 1 per cent, the S&P dropped 1.5 per cent and the Nasdaq lost 1.8 per cent.The pullback capped a difficult week on Wall Street, which had to content with, among other things, mixed earnings results and the prospect of further rises in US interest rates following Tuesday’s Federal Reserve meeting.“This week’s trading, particularly the latter part of the week, has largely been driven by broadening fears of inflation,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.Concerns that the Federal Reserve would further raise interest rates in March, and possibly again in May or June, were heightened by yesterday’s non-farm payroll numbers showing a higher-than-expected increase in hourly wages.The data suggested the labour market was tightening, which could lead to higher inflation.Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co, said while higher wage growth could be good for the economy in the long run, in the short term, wage-induced inflation would have adverse effects on US equities since the Fed would be forced to continue its cycle of monetary tightening.“Not only would the cost of borrowing go up for corporate America but an interest rate increase would also make the fixed income market more attractive, drawing money out of stocks,” he said.Along with the Fed statement, the market was also pondering renewed worries about decelerating earnings growth after several sector bellwethers delivered mixed results.On the Dow, record quarterly earnings at ExxonMobil drove shares in the oil giant up 0.2 per cent higher for the week at $61.39, while aerospace group Boeing rose 4.2 per cent to $71.17 after it more than doubled its quarterly profit and raised earnings guidance.However, the strong performances were offset by sharp losses in Altria, down 5.2 per cent at $70.87, and Citigroup, down 3.9 per cent at $45.06.On Nasdaq, Google learned the perils of high expectations this week after an earnings increase that fell shy of investors’ hopes sent shares plummeting more than 16 per cent, or over $20bn, in after-hours trading on Tuesday.Although the numbers largely met analysts’ forecasts, investors have become accustomed to the company trumping such predictions. The stock managed to recover part of its losses however ending the week 12 per cent lower at $381.55.Elsewhere, January retail sales gave a lift to coffee chain Starbucks and clothing retailer Gap. The former jumped 6 per cent to $33.88, while the latter gained 7.2 per cent to $18.63 for the week.By contrast, the auto parts sector was under pressure following weaker-than-expected quarterly figures from Goodyear Tire & Rubber. The stock skidded 19.4 per cent to $15.21 over the five sessions, making it the worst performer on the S&P.Industrial group Honeywell was the best performer on the Dow, up 3.8 per cent after Citigroup upgraded the stock from “hold” to “buy”..
979;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-02-02T21:59:49Z;US stocks end down in spite of resilient retailers;;Strong January retail sales failed to prevent a sharp fall in US stocks on Thursday.Federal Department Stores, owner of Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s, Gap and Wal-Mart all reported higher monthly sales as shoppers were tempted out by warmer weather.Federated Department Stores gained 4 per cent to $69.73 after it lifted earnings guidance, Gap rose 3.2 per cent to $18.55 as it delivered higher sales when the market expected a fall, while the popularity of youth clothing label Abercrombie & Fitch sent its shares 4.1 per cent higher to $69.27. Wal-Mart rose 0.3 per cent to $46.28 after its figures came in ahead of expectations.While the wider market ended sharply lower, the S&P 500 retail index managed a gain of 0.2 per cent.“The warm weather helped to bring people out and the use of gift cards” also boosted sales, said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. “The retailers posted good numbers, their guidance was good, and that’s why they are bucking the market.”However, he said that concern remained about a consumer spending slowdown should the wealth effect from the strong housing market end.In the wider market, stocks fell sharply as investors worried about an unexpected drop in productivity in the fourth-quarter and the effect on interest rates.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.9 per cent at 10,851.98, the broader S&P 500 fell 0.9 per cent to 1,270.84 and the Nasdaq Composite slumped 1.2 per cent at 2,281.57.Disappointing earnings from Tyco International, the troubled conglomerate, and cable group Comcast also weighed on sentiment. Those stocks fell 5 per cent to $24.80 and 3.5 per cent to $27.02 respectively.General Motors, off 3.7 per cent to $23.60, was the worst performer on the Dow after a downgrade from UBS, while carparts group Dana lost 8.4 per cent to $4.68 as the Securities and Exchange Commission began a formal inquiry into company’s accounting practices.Dana is the worst performing S&P 500 stock this year, off 35 per cent.United Airlines slumped 10.3 per cent to $35.89 on its first day of trading following its emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.There were some gainers. Starbucks, the coffee chain, jumped 9.7 per cent to $34.40 after it raised guidance on earnings following a record quarter and confirmed plans to open 1,800 new outlets this year.Ashley Reed Woodruff, at Bear Stearns, raised her price target on the stock by $2 to $39-$40. “Starbucks is off to a strong start in 2006. We expect strong US sales growth and profit improvement internationally to continue to drive the shares going forward,” she said.A sharp jump in quarterly profit boosted washing machine maker Whirlpool. Its shares rose 7.3 per cent to $86.37.

Zoellick visited the Chengdu research base of giant panda breeding yesterday in the capital of Sichuan province, western China.At the invitation of the park, he happily donned a protective robe and cuddled the park’s latest addition, JingJing, born last August, for photographers.Zoellick, a longtime visitor to China, joked later that he had carefully weighed up advice before agreeing to the photographs.But, in the end, he had listened to his wife, who had urged him to take the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to cuddle the cute bears. At this stage

They are an accomplished lot: Orin Smith, former Starbucks chief, and John Pepper, former Procter & Gamble chief, joined the board this year, while Fred Langhammer, former Estée Lauder chief, joined last year.Jobs showed no interest this week in becoming chairman of the board; a role occupied by George Mitchell, the former US senator, since 2004.But Mitchell, at 72, will presumably want to step down to enjoy a quiet retirement at some point. Jobs might be persuaded to succeed him, or not. The good news for Disney is there are now plenty of people on the board who could ably fill the role.Bob Ney isn’t letting a little lobbying scandal slow him down. He hits the road today to launch his re-election campaign.Attorneys for the Republican congressman from Ohio have acknowledged that he is “Representative #1” mentioned in court papers in the case of Jack Abramoff, the powerful Washington lobbyist who pleaded guilty to bribery, tax evasion and fraud.Ney says Abramoff set him up. But federal prosecutors say Abramoff gave him “a stream of things of value” and, in exchange, he performed “a series of official acts”, and there is widespread speculation that he will be indicted in connection with the affair.Ney’s campaign slogan is: “Working hard to make lives better.” He doesn’t say whose.Still more news from Democrats about how they plan to respond to President George W.

A Democratic spokesman says the two men will talk about “similar themes”, but won’t give exactly the same speech.Ottawa is one of the world’s more sleepy capitals, which may help to explain the advice given by Canada’s biggest civil service union to its members in advance of Monday’s general election.The Public Service Alliance urged members living in suburbs across the Ottawa River in Quebec to vote for the Bloc Québécois, whose raison d’être is to turn the French-speaking province into an independent country.Sure enough, residents of Gatineau elected a Bloc member of parliament on Monday, ousting the Liberals who have represented the area for most of the past century.“What were the people of Gatineau thinking?” thundered the Ottawa Citizen in an editorial on Wednesday. “The Bloc says the new Quebec republic would need, for example, foreign-affairs staff just like the federal government does. But wouldn’t a new Quebec government want to locate those people in Quebec City
or Montreal?”The alliance would probably be wise not to expect great things from the next round of pay negotiations with the new Conservative government.Is the Telegraph group doomed? Gordon Paris, chairman of Hollinger International, the US publishing company and former owner of the Telegraph, was distinctly downbeat about the prospects for the UK newspapers at his company’s annual meeting in New York on Tuesday.Paris has been sorting out the turmoil at Hollinger since Conrad Black, its former chairman, was accused of looting the company. Paris told shareholders at Hollinger’s annual meeting that the company’s sale of the Telegraph group for
$1.2bn in July 2004 represented
a “premium price” and was impeccably timed.“We considered the current and future challenges of tabloidisation, ageing demographics and inadequate printing capacity to be real risks for the Telegraph’s future performance and value,” said Paris. Observer presumes that the Barclays brothers, the secretive twins who bought the Telegraph from Hollinger, would disagree."
981;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-01-22T21:17:42Z;Supervalu set to venture into costlier aisles;;"Supervalu has taken a low-cost route to becoming the seventh largest grocery business in the US.Save-A-Lot, its largest brand with more than 1,200 stores, is a no-frills, hard discounter similar to Europe’s Aldi, that prides itself on having “no lobster tanks, cappuccino kiosks or floral departments”.Supervalu’s 230 larger format “price superstores” include Shop ‘n’ Save and Cub Foods – whose name stands for “Consumers United for Buying”. Almost half of Supervalu’s annual sales of about $19bn come from the unglamourous business of wholesale supplies.But the retailer is on the brink of venturing into far more costly shopping aisles, with its participation in a $17.4bn deal for Albertson’s, the second largest US grocer.Albertson’s has more than 1,700 supermarkets, most of them at least twice as large as the average Save-A-Lot store, and most including well stocked seafood counters, floral departments and Starbucks coffee kiosks. Its annual sales, at just under $40bn, are double Supervalu’s.The other members of the bidding consortium – Cerberus Capital and Kimco Realty – are expected to sell-off over 600 under-performing stores, while Albertson’s 700 free-standing drug stores will be sold to CVS.Left with the remaining stores - over 1,100 - Supervalu would join Kroger and Safeway among the largest supermarket operators in the US.“The sheer size of Albertson’s and the prospects of integrating its food retailing operations represents a massive shift in scale and price positioning for Supervalu,” wrote Ajay Jain, analyst at UBS Securities.Supervalu moved into retailing in 1980, when it acquired five Cub Foods stores in Minnesota. Under Mike Wright, its previous chief executive, it expanded, acquiring the innovative Save-A-Lot chain in 1991.The chain, now the largest extreme discounter in the US, has more than 800 stores operated under franchise agreements. It has a reputation for opening stores in tough urban areas and remote communities where other retailers fear to tread.Previously, Supervalu’s largest acquisition was a $1.2bn deal in 1999 for Richfield Holdings, a regional store operator. But Jeff Noddle, a 30-year veteran of the company who took over as chief executive in 2001, has shown interest in expanding its retail business through acquisitions.In 2003, a $400m takeover of Dominick’s, a Chicago-based chain, from Safeway was called off, and in 2002 it bought a St Louis-based chain of “dollar-stores” for an undisclosed sum.Mr Noddle told analysts this month that Supervalu viewed “the sale of Albertson’s and specifically the availability of its premier properties, as an extraordinary opportunity for the company to consider”.Karen Ghaffari, supermarket analyst at Fitch Ratings, the credit rating agency, also notes that Supervalu wants to expand the retail side of its business, over its lower-margin wholesale business. “This would move them very significantly into the
segment that they have been looking to grow in,” she said.But the acquisition will also represent a significant challenge. Currently, Supervalu’s store network includes only 60 traditional supermarkets, raising questions about the depth of expertise in a company that has been closely focused on discount retailing.The company’s Save-A-Lot unit, for instance, is still run by its founder, Bill Moran, while five of the company’s top seven corporate officers have been with Supervalu for more than 20 years.The sale of Albertson’s freestanding drug stores to CVS is also likely to increase the costs of operating the remaining in-store pharmacy network, although Supervalu does operate its own in-store pharmacy chain.But the biggest challenge will be moving into the heart of traditional supermarket retailing, at a time when the sector has been relentlessly battered by intense competition from Wal-Mart and Target among others, and by other low-cost discounters – including Supervalu itself."
982;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2006-01-04T20:31:31Z;Lex: Chinese copyright;;"Consumer goods companies received their own Christmas present this year: a brace of successful suits against Chinese copycats. The awards are tiny – in the case mounted by Prada and fellow luxury purveyors, barely sufficient to buy a dozen frocks – but the principle established is potentially far more valuable.Piracy has long been one of the biggest headaches for makers of luxury goods, software and films. Despite years of lobbying by Washington, the software industry estimates it loses an annual $11bn-$12bn to piracy, much of which comes from Asia. Seizures of Chinese fake goods by US Customs are rising at about 50 per cent a year and most films are available on pirated DVDs.Recent cases, therefore, offer hope. Starbucks, the US coffee chain, won damages from its Chinese copycat. Prada and four peers succeeded by suing the landlord providing space to vendors of pirated goods. Landlord liability is harder to make stick, but has been used elsewhere, most notably in the clean-up of New York’s Chinatown. Scoring a success on Beijing’s notorious “Silk Street” shopping mall gives the pirate-hunters more clout in other parts of China, especially Shenzhen.More creative approaches are likely – with companies using tax or labour laws, say, to squeeze out offenders. But while the principle demonstrated and publicity generated are useful, it pays to keep a sense of perspective. Without Beijing’s full support, any victories will barely dent China’s thriving rip-off industry – and legal costs will probably outweigh awards.- Click here to add your comments

983;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:01+0000;Starbucks wins case against Chinese copycat;;Starbucks, the US coffee shop chain, has won a landmark lawsuit in a Shanghai court against a local rival that had adopted its Chinese name and a similar logo.Chinese media said the court had ordered Shanghai Xingbake to stop using its name, to pay Rmb500,000 ($62,000) in compensation to Starbucks and to issue an apology in a local newspaper.The court decision should help Starbucks to protect its brand in China, where it already has about 140 stores and a high-profile presence at such iconic locations as the Great Wall and Forbidden City.It will also hearten the many other foreign companies in China that face competition from local companies imitating their brands, trademarks, logos or packaging.Local rival Shanghai Xingbake had claimed that it had the right to use its name - the standard Chinese translation used for Starbucks - because it had registered as a company in the city in 1999, before the international group.Xingbake’s general manager told the China Daily newspaper in 2003 that it was “just a coincidence” that its name and green-and-white circular logo so closely matched that of the Seattle-based chain.“I hadn’t heard of Starbucks at that time, so how could I imitate its brand or logo?” the manager, identified only as Mr Mao, was quoted as saying then.However, Shanghai’s Number Two Intermediate Court ruled that Starbucks had precedence in part because it had registered its Chinese name in 1998. It said Xingbake’s use of the name and similar logo was “clearly malicious” and constituted improper competition, the China News Service reported.Staff at Xingbake declined to comment on Monday on whether the company planned to abide by the ruling or would seek to appeal.Starbucks has complained in the past about a different coffee shop in the eastern city of Qingdao that also uses the same Chinese name - as well as the English moniker “Starsbuck” for its signage and “Starbuck” for its menus.Lawyers say that many international companies are often too slow to register their brands in China, giving faster-moving local rivals a chance to establish a legal claim first.
984;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:03:28+0000;Sathnam Sanghera: Why Starbucks is a blessing;;"I recently spent a week with my dear parents, which was a breeze in all but two respects: (a) Wolverhampton, the city they reside in, is the armpit of the universe; and (b) no matter how much you love your mum and dad, as an adult, the maximum time you can spend in their company before you start feeling unhinged is 36 hours.Indeed, the latter became such a problem that on the second day I decided to risk a walk around the city which one commentator recently described as “great if you’re a suede-headed moron [who enjoys] heading down to the pub to pull a 40-year-old mother-of-five and punch someone in the face for having a different skin tone”.It was during this walk, as I padded past the branch of Burger King where a sadistic supervisor once made me clean a single toilet five times in half an hour, near the entrance to the Mander Shopping Centre where two boys once set a Doberman on me for amusement, that, to my amazement, I discovered a branch of Starbucks.I say “amazement” because in recent years, when anyone has asked what my home town is like, I have said: “Well, it’s the only city I know of in the western world that doesn’t have a Starbucks.” The fact seemed to encapsulate the city’s cultural isolation perfectly: the globe-gobbling coffee giant, which has more than 10,000 outlets worldwide, which launches three new stores a day, which is so willing to open up almost anywhere that online satirical magazine The Onion recently ran a spoof story with the headline “New Starbucks opens in the restroom of existing Starbucks”, had evidently drawn a line at Wolverhampton. Until now, that is. I went in.The first thing I came across was a display of articles reporting on the opening of the store. With headlines such as “Starbucks lifts city’s café culture dreams” and references to a “trendy café chain”, they articulated just how late a subscriber the West Midlands city is to the coffee-bar craze. “Starbucks is the latest big food and drink name to open in the city,” said one piece. “Since May three new snack bars – BB’s Coffee and Muffins, Millies Cookies and Spudulike – have opened in the Mander Centre.”Spudulike? Big food name? Anyway, I ordered a tall cappuccino and took a seat near the counter. The conversations floating over the shwiss-shwoossshing of the coffee machine took me back to the late 1990s, when Starbucks arrived in London. “Why is ‘tall’ your smallest size?” “Can’t I just have a regular coffee?” Many of the people entering the store either gave up after glancing at the menu, or tried to order a cup of tea – “kipper tie ploise”. They looked positively homicidal when the assistants responded: “Would that be a Tazo tea latte, or Tazo hot tea?”I sat there sneering for hours, variously hating myself for sneering and delighting in it, following my cappuccino with three lattes. Slowly, I came to a number of realisations: (1) if you drink enough coffee, you actually stop blinking; (2) while the maximum time you can spend with your parents is 36 hours, the maximum time you can spend in any branch of Starbucks, before the latte jazz drives you bonkers, is three hours; (3) Starbucks is brilliant.Now, I understand the third point is a little contentious. The ubiquitous chain, which plans to open another 1,800 stores globally over the next year, has been accused of everything from serving weak coffee, to driving students into debt, forcing local businesses into bankruptcy and misleading the public about its fair-trade credentials. And I concede that Starbucks is irritating in many respects: the colour scheme is supposed to symbolise the land on which coffee is grown but in fact just makes you feel like you are trapped in the 1970s; and the way the company clusterbombs areas with outlets is outrageous (throw a stone out of any office window in London and you’ll hit at least three stores).Nevertheless, the world is a better place for Starbucks. For a start, it is soothing to arrive somewhere new and still have somewhere to go that feels familiar. Also, the stores set a certain level of customer service and product quality that local companies have to match. Furthermore, as annoying as it is to listen to Starbucks’ new-age talk about how its stores provide a “Third Place” for its customers – not work, not home, but containing elements of both and a refuge at times from both – it is true. If I hadn’t had a Starbucks to escape to during my week with my dear parents – if I hadn’t had a daily break from my mother’s lectures on the importance of getting married/eating well/praying etc – I may well have lost the plot.And sitting there, I couldn’t help wondering how different my youth might have been if there had been a Starbucks in town all those years ago. Instead of spending Saturday afternoons on the bench outside Lloyd’s Bank – the closest thing we had to entertainment then – my best mate and I could have chatted over a Frappuccino. Instead of treating my first ever date to a kebab on the platform of Wolverhampton train station – there was nowhere else to go – we could have exchanged sweet nothings over a muffin and an iced white-chocolate mocha.But better late than never. My only hope now is that Starbucks doesn’t go the way of Gap – that other great symbol of globalisation – which recently opened an outlet in Wolverhampton city centre, only to close it down two years later, having failed to coax the locals out of their tracksuits and baseball caps."

The UK is the world’s second-biggest market, with 7.2m cases sold last year.Blavod’s total sales rose by 50 per cent to £2.2m in the six months ended September 30.Blavod plans to grow through expanding sales of its existing brands and developing or acquiring new ones. The company’s Players Extreme vodka brand is sold only in the US but it aims to sell the brand in other markets, including the UK.It recently entered into a joint venture with Japanese beverage producer Suntory, which makes Midori liqueur.The venture, named Diamante Spirits, will create new spirits brands. It is trialling a tequila, El Diamante del Cielo, in Miami and Chicago.Jeffrey Hopmayer, chief executive of Blavod, previously ran a bakery business that supplied Starbucks. He created the Players Extreme brand, with the aim of becoming a niche participant in the vodka market. Flavoured vodkas are one of the fastest-growing categories of spirits.Mr Hopmayer said that while Blavod was not actively looking for a buyer, it expected to attract offers for its brands in the future if it developed them successfully.
986;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2005-11-28T18:34:38Z;Richard Tomkins: Brands on a wild goose chase;;"It is that turkey time of year again in many countries, what with Thanksgiving just gone and Christmas on the way. But surely, you would have to be extraordinarily lacking in imagination to settle for such a boring old bird. (I have just ordered mine.) These days, anyone with half an eye to fashion or good taste is feasting on a turducken on special occasions if they live in the US or a gooducken if they live in the UK.A turducken? This is, of course, a chicken stuffed inside a duck stuffed inside a turkey. In Britain, goose tends to be more popular as the outer layer, hence the gooducken. But the British trend this Christmas is towards the goose stuffed with a duck stuffed with a pheasant, which by rights should be called a gooduckant yet disappointingly is not; it is just called a three-bird roast.I suppose you could argue that three birds are better than one. But really, inside each other? Is that not just a little grotesque? And, oddly, the places I most often see these monstrosities is the local farmers’ markets, where people ostensibly go to buy natural food. What mystifies me is, if the gooduckant is all right, why is there no matching side dish – for example, the caulispinaleek, a cauliflower stuffed with spinach stuffed with a leek? Or an appropriate dessert such as the papamanganana, a papaya stuffed with a mango stuffed with a banana?But it is not just the food industry that is trying to whet appetites by creating odd combinations. You can hardly have failed to notice that co-branding, the idea of two previously unrelated companies combining their brands to create a new product or service, has turned into a bit of a mania.Just a few days ago Rezidor, the Radisson hotel operator, announced it was getting together with Missoni, the Italian fashion house, to create a new international chain of “lifestyle” hotels under the name Hotel Missoni. A few days before that we saw the results of a collaboration between clothing retailer Hennes and Mauritz and fashion designer Stella McCartney as shoppers around the world cleared H&M’s shelves of Stella’s limited edition cheap chic collection.Sports goods companies seem especially keen on pairing with the fashion industry. Adidas has collections by Ms McCartney and Yohji Yamamoto while Puma, already boasting an array of celebrity designers, is launching a range by Alexander McQueen next spring.There are plenty of examples of brand pairings in other industries, too. Philips, the Dutch electronics company, co-brands its Senseo coffee machine with the Douwe Egberts coffee company. Siemens and Porsche Design have collaborated on a range of kettles, toasters and coffee machines. United Airlines and Starbucks have an alliance whereby United is the only airline to serve Starbucks coffee. And in a rare deal involving neither coffee nor coffee machines, John Deere, the tractor maker, recently signed up with house builder St Lawrence Homes to create the high-end John Deere Signature Community in North Carolina, providing each home with not only a choice of John Deere-designed landscape but a John Deere riding lawn tractor with which to tend the grounds.Years ago, few companies ever went in for brand alliances. This was not, as one might suppose, because they worried that the value of their brand to the other party would be greater than the value of the other party’s brand to them. Rather, like those of us still not dining on a turducken, they had just never thought of it.After all, until very recently, companies were almost entirely focused on supplying distinctive goods or services. It had not occurred to anyone that brands might have a value that was separable from that of the products to which they were attached, still less that some of that value could be extracted by putting it on someone else’s product.Once that realisation set in, then came the moment at which worries about uneven rewards would have emerged. It is indeed a difficult issue, because if you assume that the contributions of any two brands to a joint product will never be precisely equal, you somehow have to come up with a formula for dividing the spoils.I wonder, for example, how the profits from the H&M/Stella McCartney collaboration will be split? Ms McCartney has certainly benefited from the arrangement, getting free publicity in the 22 countries where her clothes were sold and having many thousands of new customers introduced to her brand. But H&M has surely benefited more, getting not just the publicity and the new customers but the cachet of being associated with a top designer.Dividing the spoils, however, is not the only problem. I predict that, in spite of the present spate of enthusiasm, brand alliances will remain relatively rare and almost always short-lived. It is just too risky linking the fortunes of your brand with those of someone else’s over which you have no control. Besides, it defies logic. If it takes you into a product area you know, why not do it alone? And if it takes you into a product area you do not know, then what are you doing there?No, keep things simple is my advice. The precedent for these branding alliances is those 1970s rock star supergroups, most of which looked a lot better on paper than they sounded in the auditorium and collapsed acrimoniously after just one album. As in the gooduckant, so in life: less is sometimes more."
987;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Simon London: Responsibility in a market economy;;"Corporate social responsibility is one of those topics – like Manchester United and the New York Yankees – that raises passions both for and against. To CSR’s proponents, encouraging companies to do more than the law demands to create a better workplace and society is a powerful force for good. To its opponents, this is dangerous thinking because it distracts companies from their true role in a market economy – maximising profits while staying within the law.Personally, I think both sides are nuts. There is no harm in companies spending a little time and money on CSR projects. Corporate chiefs have always splashed shareholders’ cash on things that had nothing to do with maximising profits, such as building marble-clad headquarters and buying abstract impressionist art. Shareholders are happy as long as the amounts involved are moderate and earnings per share keep on rising. On balance, I would rather see this marginal investment devoted to CSR.But neither do I buy the argument that socially responsible companies can have a real impact on the world’s big social and environmental problems. Yes, Ikea is to be applauded for discouraging Indian rug makers from using child workers. BP deserves credit for taking action to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Starbucks is right to support Fair Trade, a scheme guaranteeing coffee farmers a fair price for their produce. These are sincere efforts to do the right thing. Just do not expect them to address the underlying causes of child labour, global warming or agrarian poverty.Defeatism? No, just realism. Companies are constrained by shareholders, customers and employees alike. Market forces prevent chief executives from doing anything that might noticeably dent earnings, push up prices at the checkout or constrain their ability to pay market rates to attract qualified workers. Corporations can be virtuous in a market economy – but only within some firm constraints.To be sure, some companies have gone further and made CSR central to their corporate identity. Examples include Seventh Generation, purveyor of chlorine-free toilet tissue, and Ben & Jerry’s, the eco-friendly ice-cream maker. But it seems that only a minority of customers is willing to pay premium prices for responsible products. Unless or until this changes, most companies will be forced to limit their commitment to CSR activities.It would be different if good behaviour always made good business sense. Sadly, however, there is scant evidence to support the claim. For every CSR-conscious company that is thriving (BP, Starbucks, Ikea) another is down on its luck (Levi Strauss, Marks and Spencer, Hewlett-Packard). Studies purporting to find a causal relationship between exemplary behaviour and exemplary financial returns have not, in general, stood up to academic scrutiny.Similarly, the performance of socially responsible investment funds – which invest only in “responsible” companies – has been mixed. When such funds do outperform the wider stockmarket, the explanation is usually to be found in their relatively high exposure to “clean” industry sectors such as software. Within sectors, ethical criteria do not appear to help fund managers pick winners.For a level-headed survey of the evidence, I recommend The Market for Virtue* by David Vogel, a political- scientist-turned-professor of business ethics at the University of California Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. In a world filled with hot air on the subject, it is refreshing to find such a clear – and, at less than 200 pages, concise – assessment of CSR’s pros and cons. Prof Vogel’s view is that we should think of CSR not as a precondition for business success (plainly, it is not) but as a dimension of corporate strategy: “Just as firms that spend more on marketing are not necessarily more profitable than those that spend less, there is no reason to expect more responsible firms to outperform less responsible ones. In other words, the risks associated with CSR are not different from those associated with any other business strategy; sometimes investments in CSR make business sense and sometimes they do not.”This seemingly prosaic conclusion has profound implications. First, while there is a place in the market economy for responsible companies, there is also a place for their less responsible competitors. Do not expect market forces to make all companies more ethical through a process of Darwinian selection.Second, even companies that do place CSR high on their list of strategic priorities are limited in what they can do. Someone (shareholders, customers, employees) must be willing to foot the bill. As Prof Vogel says: “The supply of virtue is both made possible and constrained by the market.” This being so, the role of government remains vital. CSR initiatives by individual companies or industry codes of conduct cannot be relied upon because there will always be laggards and backsliders. If society really wants to change things for the better it should legislate.This is where even the most CSR-aware CEO gets twitchy. No business leader likes to be seen to be encouraging government rules and regulations. This, however, is the acid test of how much they really care about the workplace and society. Ask of your CEO not “what are we doing to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions?” but “what are we doing to promote legislation to curb greenhouse gas emissions in general?” Then stand back and watch them squirm.*The Market for Virtue: The Potential and Limits of Corporate Social Responsibility, by David Vogel, Brookings Institution Presssimon.london@ft.com"
988;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2005-11-11T22:00:28Z;It’s easy as you go for EasyJet’s entrepreneur;;"On a drizzly morning this week, Stelios Haji-Ioannou stood at a London bus stop, waiting for an EasyBus to take him to Luton airport.At £3 the cost of the bus was less than the Starbucks coffee and pain au chocolat that a passenger was clutching.Exactly 10 years before, when it was also “pissing with rain”, Stelios recalls waiting in a seedy terminal at Luton airport to take the maiden EasyJet flight to Glasgow.At the time, he advertised the flight as costing as little as “a pair of jeans”. The two women who checked in the passengers that day are still employed by EasyJet with share options that could mean they never have to work again.At the time, Stelios says his ambition was short term – “survival”. But in the years since, EasyJet – along with rival Ryanair and other low-cost carriers – has transformed air travel in Europe and the lifestyles of many of the Continent’s citizens.Like 38-year-old Stelios, who flies EasyJet to Nice each Friday on his way home to Monaco, North Europeans who work in the rain can now weekend in the Mediterranean sun.Passengers can buy tickets online, no longer needing travel agents. Cheap travel has improved familiarity among Europeans, Stelios believes, forging friendships and even marriages.Yet this son of a Greek- Cypriot shipping tycoon appears to have changed little since, as a preppy 28-year-old, he spent a year in Luton to ensure EasyJet’s successful launch.On Thursday, he boarded the cramped EasyBus minibus for the 45-minute journey to Luton, fighting with the seatbelt that squeezed against his robust frame.There were only half a dozen passengers paying £3 each, which would barely have paid for the petrol. But he talked enthusiastically of his plans to franchise the EasyBus brand to coach operators around Europe.The next day he was due to fly to the Caribbean to launch his EasyCruise, building the Easy brand in the Americas.His mind was also working overtime on how to make the transatlantic crossing profitable for the orange-
liveried cruise ship. Perhaps he would offer poker on crossings, he said – though he openly wondered whether association with gambling could tarnish his brand.With a youthful sense of principle, he was even choosy about who would fly him across the Atlantic.He still prefers not to fly British Airways, with whom he has publicly battled for years – partly, he admits, as an attention-grabbing exercise. Instead, he flew Virgin Atlantic, owned by his role model and friend, Sir Richard Branson.Stelios, who describes himself on his business card as a “serial entrepreneur”, has an articulate, if restless, way of talking. His business affairs are similarly fast-paced.In EasyJet’s early years, he paid such close attention to the airline that, when snow grounded its flights at Luton, he would travel there to cheer up passengers. But once it had moved out of survival mode with its flotation in 2000, he focused on bringing brand building and “yield management” – his two specialisations – to the rest of his Easy empire.With his eye on the potential of the internet, he acquired several thousand internet domain names, even wayward ones such as EasyAtlantic. These, he believes, could be businesses of the future – though he remains dubious about no-frills transatlantic travel.His career, which began with his father in shipping, has been anything but plain- sailing. Several of his EasyGroup businesses, such as EasyInternetcafé and EasyCar, the car rental company, had teething problems – he admits he rolled out internet cafés far too quickly and has had to bail some ventures out with his own money.Some are still tiny despite much nurturing, including Milton Keynes-based Easy-Pizza (favourite pizza, “El Stel”) and EasyBus, which he once expected to rival national companies.But while he says EasyGroup has recently become cash flow positive thanks to licenses and franchises, including EasyJet’s license payment for the use of the brand, he appears to thrive on adversity.“I get bored when things go well and move on,” Stelios says.Now is no time for Stelios to be bored. In 2002, he stepped back from EasyJet to focus on EasyCinemas and to bring the internet cafés back from the brink, appointing Sir Colin Chandler as replacement chairman of EasyJet. In 2004, he sold 4m shares in EasyJet at 370p to 380p to fund the cruise ship, a budget hotel and the buses.But he remained an insider to the airline’s affairs, with a board representative, and was horrified to see the impact on EasyJet shares from two profit warnings in rapid succession.His insider status frustrated his efforts to buy the ailing shares last year.Then, in October 2004, he was shocked to find an Icelandic airline company, FL Group, climbing up the EasyJet share register, having bought shares as cheap as 120p.Led by Hannes Smarason, who has also bought Copenhagen-based Sterling Airways, Europe’s fourth- largest low-cost airline, FL Group’s interest in EasyJet has triggered bid speculation.Last month, its stake increased to 16.2 per cent, just shy of Stelios’ own 16.6 per cent (though his brother and sister own 12 per cent each). The shares are back above 300p.For once, Stelios appears to have found in Mr Smarason a businessman as impetuous as he is. It leaves him sounding a bit flat-footed, even if he has already retaken a seat on the board to keep a close eye on affairs. “I have to congratulate them on their timing,” he says of the Icelanders. “But I have not studied the FL Group enough to form a view on whether they would be good custodians of the [EasyJet] name.”He insists there is no reason to sell out of EasyJet – except that he mentions that the last time he sold shares was at 370p to 380p, which indicates he may have a price. What particularly troubles him is who he would sell the business to, lest the brand becomes debased.He will not speculate on where he expects to be in 10 years, saying the time horizon is too long.But over the next five years, he says making a success out of ownership of the Easy brand will be his “main job”. Eventually, this will mean floating it.There is no hurry, he says. As he clambers down from the EasyBus, he notes that he is still a young man and the only succession planning he would need to do was if he “fell under a bus”.So at the bus terminal, he looks carefully to right and left, and then greets some of his EasyBus passengers as television cameras roll.He wishes them a good flight on EasyJet and then finds, to his embarrassment, they are flying Ryanair.Ever the showman, he laughs uproariously."
989;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2005-10-18T16:55:19Z;China on the net: they do things differently here;;"So here I am, drinking my Starbucks vanilla latte surrounded by people tapping away on their laptops courtesy of T-mobile WiFi, soundtracked by the beeps of SMS messages being received on the latest Nokia handsets.No surprise there, you might think – apart from the fact that I’m in Starbucks in Shanghai. Nine months ago I hadn’t even explored Chinatown in London’s Soho, much less given any thought to the explosion taking place out in The People’s Republic of China.But all that changed after a spontaneous decision to get a ticket and visa from Hong Kong on my “midlife-crisis-10-years-too-early” round the world tour, which landed me in Shanghai’s Pudong airport on my 31st Birthday.Fast forward to today, and here I am living in Shanghai having decided to make the move and be part of what seems like dotcom Part II, turbo-charged.With more than 100m people online, China is the 2nd largest nation in the world in terms of internet users and that’s still less than 10 per cent of the population. Combine that with being world leaders in mobile usage, with 363m owning phones and still growing by millions every month, and you can start to see why I, along with many other westerners, are arriving in plane-loads every week.The internet scene here is quite different from that in Europe and the US.Firstly, the 100m plus users are not using the internet to do their grocery shopping, banking or book holidays.Instead they’re busy chatting on QQ or one of four other local instant messaging applications; surfing Chinese community sites; or looking at the websites of global brands such as Louis Vuitton and BMW. Aspiration is big, and the web is the shop window.That’s not to say that e-commerce does not exist – it does – just in a different format and dealing in very different goods. Auction sites eBay and Taobao are huge, with everything from French cosmetics to fake-brand cigarettes sold in their thousands every day.It’s amazing how swiftly the Chinese have adapted to the technology. Unlike the west, they never had to put up with clunky modems or mobile phones the size of bricks.What the future holds for the 1.3bn population is what’s being watched closely from Boston to Beijing.Will this be the market where it all happens on the web in the next 10 years? Will Google and Amazon be household names in rural China, or will it be home-grown and state supported talent such as Baidu and AliBaba that continue to run the show?Whatever happens in the long run, the one thing that is obvious is that the strategies used back home will not necessarily work here. China has too much pride, character and history to follow any path that the west tries to impose.For me as an individual and entrepreneur, it’s fascinating living in Shanghai and stuck in the middle of what’s being described as the next California Gold Rush, the second coming of the 1990s dotcom boom.As I finish off my latte, I glance outside and see old Mr Li, a rag-and-bone man whose bicycle and ringing bell go round Shanghai every day collecting unwanted items. Part of me wonders whether Mr Li will live long enough to be connected on the web, and part of me wonders whether he is already online and selling his goods via his Taobao store and his QQ account.I wouldn’t bet against the latter.Shakil Khan is based in Shanghai and is the author of www.chinawhite.net"
990;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2005-09-28T15:04:47Z;Links to performance: We have ways of motivating our staff;;Sharing the financial benefits of improved corporate performance with staff may not be crucial to business success, but successful businesses frequently operate such schemes.A study of factors common to 14 of the world’s most successful service companies, published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in June, found that employee participation schemes were one of the factors common to several of the companies.In particular, Southwest Airlines of the US and UK retailer Tesco had profit- sharing schemes, while four – on-line auctioneer eBay, airlines Jetblue and Southwest, as well as coffee chain Starbucks – used employee stock option schemes.Yet the causal link between giving staff a share of the profits, and staff pushing those profits up by working harder is weak. For years, academics have striven to nail down the link but with mixed success.There are two reasons. Companies that seek to incentivise employees by linking their wages to corporate performance typically have many other employee-involvement practices that are also designed to produce a similar outcome, from benefits packages to flexible working hours.But it is also because performance related pay has become a motherhood and apple pie issue, to which company stakeholders commonly subscribe. Nowhere is that truer than in France, where every company with more than 50 employees is required by law to have a profit sharing scheme.A 2001 study for the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, an EU body, of employee share ownership and profit sharing in member states found that such schemes are commonplace.The researchers, led by Andrew Pendleton of the University of York, found that 31 per cent of business units with more than 200 employees had a share ownership scheme, while 45 per cent had profit sharing schemes.France led the table for broadly-based profit-sharing, with schemes at 84 per cent of business units, though they were also widely used in the Netherlands (60 per cent) Britain (48 per cent), Germany (25 per cent) and Austria (28 per cent).In general, the bigger the company, the more likely it is to have a financial participation scheme, not least because it is much easier for quoted companies to offer share incentive schemes.The basis of profit-sharing schemes, first developed more than a century ago, is that the company contributes a proportion of its pre-tax profits to a pool to be distributed among eligible employees.The amount each member of staff gets is weighted to base salary, so higher-paid employees receive more. Payouts are usually annual.At Texas Instruments, a US electronics group, employees share 4 per cent of the company’s operating profit when it reaches 10 per cent of sales. The percentage payout rises with profit, so that at 20 per cent operating profit, employees share 26 per cent of the total.The main advantage of such schemes, for a company, is that they help focus employees on the importance of profits while linking salary costs to the company’s ability to pay them.For employees, the merits are less clear. Although a bonus can be welcome, total pay can vary considerably according to the collective efforts of colleagues, and an individual’s efforts often make little difference.Moreover, operating or pre-tax profit can be affected by external factors such as the price of energy, competition, restructuring, investments, or advertising spend.The same factors influence share incentive schemes, which are additionally vulnerable to stock market sentiment.Some companies have sought to surmount shortcomings through the use of gain-sharing schemes, which are more closely tied to employee performance. They have been in use in the US since the 1930s.Bonuses are given based on the ratio of pay costs to the value of gross output, or when the number of work-hours to achieve a given level of output falls below the norm. Sometimes pay is linked to value added.The advantage for the company is that such plans give strong incentives to enhance productivity and can be targeted at a particular group of workers or process.For workers, they provide a close link between their efforts and pay.In a restructuring situation, this can be particularly advantageous, protecting total pay from profit falls, while encouraging staff to focus on productivity gains where they are needed.
991;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2005-09-25T19:00:16Z;Analysts fear fragile confidence;;Shares in most of the largest US consumer goods, beverage and retail companies have been hit with downgrades from Banc of America Securities as its analysts believe “increased macro-economic risk” is likely to hit earnings.The move, on Friday, was unusual in that it involved concerted action by 16 analysts. They believed that in spite of low interest rates and a still-strong housing market, “the consumer's resiliency is becoming less certain”.They said consumers might have reached the limit of their ability to absorb the price increases that many consumer goods companies have implemented to help offset rising energy and raw materials prices.April Scee, the company's household and personal care products analyst, covering companies such as Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and Newell Rubbermaid, said: “We have argued that the consumer will not notice the price increases on the shelf, but will notice them when we reach a critical mass of price increases. We think we're approaching that point.” Official figures show prices for gasoline rose 8.2 per cent in August and were 31.3 per cent higher than a year ago. Energy prices for home use rose at a more moderate 1.4 per cent.In the restaurant sector, which includes McDonald's, Yum Brands, Wendy's and Starbucks, analyst Andrew Barish said consumers seemed to be “narrowing their dining-out choices to those executing with great new products/promotions”.“We suspect that most restaurant companies will be very cautious in taking new price increases given the delicate state of the consumer today,” he wrote. Mr Barish said McDonald's was the only large company in the sector where there was “confidence in near-term sales and earnings visibility”.All analysts expressed concern that earnings were at risk given their view that raw material, packaging and transport costs “have risen more than expected and are likely to be sustained longer than we thought”.Bryan Spillane, beverage analyst, said bottlers and beer companies, such as Anheuser Busch, Molson Coors, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, faced the greatest risk to earnings.Last week Cott Corporation, which makes soft drinks for Wal-Mart, issued a profit warning, blaming weak soft drink volumes and rising raw materials costs.
992;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2005-09-13T17:54:12Z;Toy success story launched after missed opportunity;;"Richard Tait and Whit Alexander like to joke about how they stumbled across their big marketing idea. Back In the spring of 1997, they were sitting in a Starbucks coffee shop in Seattle, lamenting having the fact that they had just missed the deadline for opportunity to taking their new adult board game to the annual Toy Fair show in New York.“We looked around and we saw all these potential customers standing around,” says Mr Tait, chief executive or, according to his business card, “Grand Poo Bah” of the private company.“We said, let’s take the game to where the customers are – dating yupsters, we called them. Although if we were honest, it was because we’d just missed Toy Fair.”Mr Tait and Mr Alexander – who had both just given
up jobs as business unit managers at Microsoft, the software giant – decided to abandon the toy industry’s traditional distributors. Instead, they secured an initially exclusive deal with Starbucks to sell their game – called Cranium – later expanding to Amazon, the online retailer, and Barnes & Noble, the bookseller.Initially promoted by word of mouth and funded by $100,000 of their personal savings, Cranium became a runaway success, and went on to win the Toy Industry Association’s toy of the year award for 2001.“The mass marketers were clamouring for the product,” says Reyne Rice, trend specialist at the Toy Industry Association, of the unusual launch strategy.Cranium has now sold more than 11m games, winning two more TIA annual awards for two of its children’s games, Cadoo in 2002 and Hullabaloo in 2003. The company will not release total sales figures, but says they have increased by about 30 per cent annually in the past two years, while the toy industry as a whole remains virtually flat.“They’re really the only true innovators in the classic board game right now,” says Christopher Byrne, author of The Toy Report.Mr Tait and Mr Alexander say that their rangecollection of games, all under the Cranium brand, has remained true to the principles established by the original game, which asks players to deploy a range of skills, including mime, drawing and sculpting in clay. The idea evolved from a rainy holiday weekend spent by Mr Tait and his now wife playing board games with another couple. They The Taits triumphed at Pictionary; their friends other couple reigned supreme in Scrabble.“We asked ourselves how could we focus on everyone’s talents . . . and the idea of making the most of everyone’s talents has been a beacon that everyone at Cranium shares,” says Mr Tait.Cranium, says Mr Byrne, has benefited from maintaining its focus on board games. Mr Tait says that in 2001 the company flirted with the idea of moving into corporate training, after discovering that a number of majorlarge corporationsbusinesses were using Cranium to in training sessions aimed at promoting co-operative behaviour. But after producing one customised version of the game for Starbucks – focused on introducing baristas to new products, and to company culture – they pulled back.“We realised that we were really focused on consumers rather than pursuing corporate training,” says Mr Tait.Cranium’s one unsuccessful product dates from the same period. Cosmo, aimed at office workers, used a plastic globe to dispense paper cards ofdescribing one-off challenges, such as typing with your nose. When it failed to did not sell well, the company recycled the Cosmo material into a licensed office calendar.Mr Byrne also attributes much of Cranium’s success to its thorough testing of new products, and willingness to listen to the feedback – which the founders say they adapted from Microsoft’s “iterative” approach to software development. But changing a board game after testing, says Mr Alexander, “is a lot easier than changing software code; you just go down to Kinko’s [the office and print centre] and use the copier”.This month Cranium is also moving into publishing, with the launch its first activity game book for children, The Cranium Big Book of Outrageous Fun, in a joint venture with TimeWarner’s Little, Brown Books. Eight more books will follow by the end of next year.In July, it raised another $15m in funding from investors led by Maveron – the venture fund run by Starbucks’ founder Howard Schultz and Dan Levitan – and TPG Ventures, on top of an initial $21m raised by the same investors in 2003.The money will be used to fund the book project, as well as further game development and international expansion. Cranium’s founders also rule out any idea of selling the company to a larger player, or of taking Cranium it public.“They have a very young dynamic team, they have a lot of international growth, they have room to develop their range of games, and an idealistic philosophy,” says Ms Rice. “They’ve really carved out a great niche, and there’s no need for them to sell.”The company is also continuing to release games through Starbucks, which Mr Tait says gives itsit “edginess”, before release into mass marketing channels that now include Wal-Mart and Target.It is also continuing to look for new ways of marketing itself. Recent promotions have included an hour-long show on American West Airlines, and a Cranium question on paper napkins used by Song, Delta’s low-cost airline – with cabin staff sometimes conducting an in-flight competition.Meanwhile, Cranium’s original focus on the dating yupster (or sociable, trend-setting young person) has maturedswitched to a new target; a 25- to 40-year-old woman with children aged between three and nine. But the founders Mr Tait argues with messianic zeal that all their his products remain true to an original focus onwhat people’s positive capabilities can do, rather than what they can't.“In a world were there’s so much negativity in entertainment – ‘You’re fired’, ‘You’re the weakest link’, ‘Who can we vote off the island?’ and so on – we’re branding an alternative.” If you look at board games, even Monopoly is a struggle for power,” says Mr Tait."
993;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;European public anxious over Ankara EU entry;;Scepticism about Turkey’s push to join the European Union was easy to find on Berlin’s streets on Tuesday.“I am against Turkish membership,” said Harald Martens, a 58-year-old Berliner. “I know that there are many arguments in favour of it, but it is a gut instinct. Their way of life and religion simply doesn’t fit.”Even among ethnic Turks living in Germany, the question of Turkish entry – a development no one expects before 2015 – is already causing a certain foreboding.“I think it will take time both for the Turks in Anatolia to become more modern and also for the Turks in Germany to integrate,” said Takan Özen, a 22-year-old working in a Starbucks coffee shop. “Maybe it will be possible sometime in the distant future.”Such responses, echoed in European capitals such as Paris and even London, are among the main revelations of an authoritative survey of 11,000 Europeans, Turks and US citizens issued today.The poll shows that support for Turkish entry, already weak across the EU, has declined since the French and Dutch No votes on the European constitution, referendums that threw the EU into crisis.The German Marshall Fund Transatlantic Trends survey also highlights enduring European suspicions of the US administration and differences on the use of force, even though many of the values and concerns of the US and Europeans remain the same.But it is the results on Turkey that are among the most striking of the poll’s findings.Interviewees in the nine EU countries surveyed – France, Germany, the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Poland, Spain and Slovakia – are hesitant on many of the specific arguments against Turkish entry.In all, 59 per cent reject the argument that Turkey does not belong in the EU because it is a mainly Muslim country, 62 per cent disagree with the argument that it is too populous, 62 per cent that it is too poor.All the same, only 22 per cent qualify Turkish membership as a good thing, with 29 per cent opposed and 42 per cent unsure.Significantly, 53 per cent say that Turkish entry would not be good for the EU’s economy, with only 34 per cent in favour.Such results increase the pressure on the British presidency of the EU, which is working feverishly behind the scenes to smooth the way for the scheduled start of membership talks on October 3.Today, Britain hopes to agree on a common approach among the EU’s 25 governments on the issue of Cyprus, which has no diplomatic relations with Ankara, but which as an EU member state will be one of Turkey’s negotiating partners.But success is not guaranteed. Some EU officials fear insisting too much on Turkish recognition of Cyprus even in the aftermath of the start of talks could both prove unacceptable to the Turks and undermine United Nations attempts to reunite the island.Although most diplomats now expect the membership talks to begin on time, the likely election of Angela Merkel as Germany’s next chancellor could strengthen demands to emphasise the alternative of a “privileged partnership” with Turkey.Already a list of future EU demands, from allowing Cypriot ships to dock at Turkish ports to further, rapid progress on human rights, is coming into view.Significantly, the poll shows that Turkish support for membership is down, from 73 per cent last year to 63 per cent now.“The EU cannot ask any more from Turkey,” said Ayse Sarigul as she left the Atakule shopping centre in Ankara with her groceries yesterday. “It is always like this with Turkey. They always ask many things from us.”Additional reporting by Eric Frey in Vienna
994;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2005-07-28T23:19:05Z;Wall Street inches up as results flood in;;Wall Street continued to climb on Thursday to record a 13th winning session out of the last 16 days of trading.The gains came as another group of US heavyweights reported earnings during the session, including Bristol-Myers Squibb, the drugmaker, Starbucks, the coffee retailer, and Exxon Mobil.Although investors were hoping for a more pronounced lift this earnings season given the many better-than-expected reports, many believe the gradual upward momentum bodes well for the longer term. US gross domestic product figures, due out today, may provide further evidence of the strength of the economy, analysts say.By the close of trade in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 were both up 0.6 per cent, at 10,705.55 and 1,243.72 respectively. The Nasdaq Composite index also gained 0.6 per cent at 2,198.44.Investors believe the trend for the US economy is positive, with the earnings season and GDP expectations verifying their assumptions, said Philip Dow, director of equity strategy at RBC Dain Rauscher.“All this information gives duration to economic expansion and can only end up with the market headed higher over time,” he added.Starbucks announced better than expected earnings, helping the stock jump 4.6 per cent to $52.68. The coffee retailer has been under pressure recently and has dropped 19 per cent in the year to date following its 88 per cent gain in 2004.“It is a great company and they keep meeting or exceeding expectations,” said Donald Hodges, co-manager of the Hodges Mutual Fund. “But it does appear that it is already reflected in the price. I wouldn’t be at all surprised if it moved sideways before making a substantial move up from here.”Another 2004 outperformer, Andrew Corporation, struggled on Thursday. The shares dropped more than 19 per cent after the company announced earnings that were worse than the market had expected.Among pharmaceuticals, Bristol-Myers Squibb reported second-quarter earnings beat expectations. The group raised its 2005 earnings estimates as it expected the sale of its consumer medicines business to go through. Its shares were slightly higher at $25.17.Oil company Exxon reported an increase in net profit for the second quarter on the back of soaring oil prices, beating expectations. The stock was up 0.7 per cent at $50.There were gains in the real estate and gaming sectors, with casino operator Harrah’s rising 2.4 per cent and Hilton Hotels, Marriott International, and Starwood Hotels all rising as well.Dow Chemical announced that second-quarter net profit rose 85 per cent on a 16 per cent rise in sales, thanks to higher prices for plastics and speciality chemicals. It rose 1.7 per cent to $48.43 on the news.
995;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Market Overview: Bourses continue to sail ahead;;World equity markets had a broadly positive session on Thursday as the relentless flow of quarterly earnings reports continued to please investors.Second quarter profits of S&P 500 companies are now expected to show an increase of more than 10 per cent, marking 13 straight quarters of double-digit profit growth, according to consensus forecasts collated by Reuters.“Corporate earnings pretty well everywhere are coming in better than expected,” said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin Securities.Mr Lenhoff added: “Companies are distributing an increasing share of their cash flows in the form of dividends and share buybacks, so there is plenty of money for reinvestment.”“What makes the equity markets appealing is that they are no more expensive than they were in April [when the FTSE All World index hit its low for 2005] or indeed, a year ago.”By midday in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 were each up 0.2 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite index was 0.1 per cent higher.Drugmaker Bristol Myers Squibb and coffee shop chain Starbucks were among the best-performing stocks after strong earnings reports.Europe put in an even better performance. The FTSEurofirst 300 index climbed 0.5 per cent to a fresh three-year high of 1,179.08. Shares in DaimlerChrysler, the car manufacturer, jumped 9 per cent, while UK engineering group Rolls Royce gained more than 10 per cent.In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average closed at a fresh 15-week high, as news of a sharp fall in profits at Sony, the electronics group, came too late to have any impact on the market.Seoul’s composite index broke through 1,100 for the first time in more than 10 years, while Jakarta hit a record high for the fifth session out of six.The currency markets had a relatively quiet session as investors awaited the release today of US gross domestic product data for the second quarter.Weekly jobless claims figures that indicated a strong labour market had little impact on the dollar. Analysts said the weekly data were notoriously volatile.The euro initially fell back towards a 14-month low against the greenback before rallying, while the yen remained close to levels at which it traded just before China revalued the renminbi.Sterling moved up against the dollar despite data showing UK house price inflation at a nine-year low this month.There continued to plenty of comment about the potential ramifications of Beijing’s move last week.Lombard Street Research notes that the analyses of the consequences range from “no effect” to “major upheaval”. It says much will depend on whether China sticks to its pledge not to allow further renminbi appreciation in the months to come.But Lombard does believe that the price of gold will move higher as a result of the revaluation.“Gold should benefit as a dollar hedge, as an alternative currency investment and as safety from political uncertainty,” the consultancy said. “Gold could go back above $450 per ounce.”The metal hit its highest level for two weeks in European trading and was quoted at $427.70 in late business.Oil also edged higher after US data showed a smaller-than-expected rise in natural gas storage.Benchmark US crude futures for September delivery rose 27 cents to $59.38 a barrel by midday in New York.
996;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2005-07-15T09:58:05Z;Laugh? we nearly cried;;"In those heady years between the collapse of the Soviet Union and the collapse of the World Trade Center, it sometimes seemed as if the market was the only game in town. The corporations were the players, the World Trade Organisation and other institutions existed to broaden the playing field. Who needed governments? Even Dr Evil, the movie villain from Austin Powers, found his henchmen arguing that he didn’t have to steal nuclear weapons because he already owned Starbucks.The artistic world caught on to this idea, and the past few years have seen a clutch of documentaries offering critiques of capitalism and corporate power. Although their commercial importance has ranged from modest to trivial, they have all been critically successful: Super Size Me was nominated for an Oscar; The Yes Men won the best documentary award at the US Comedy Arts festival; The Corporation won an audience award from the Sundance film festival; Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room recently opened across the US to applause from critics. But do any of them tell us anything important about the state of capitalism in the 21st century?The Yes Men (tagline: “changing the world one prank at a time”) claims to be more interested in changing capitalism than explaining it. The film documents two performance artists, Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno, as they impersonate WTO officials. In one of the film’s more memorable moments, they perform as spokesmen for McDonald’s and the WTO, lecturing a hall of students about a new fast-food business model: with the support of the WTO, excrement from first world burger-eaters will be piped into developing world McDonald’s and served to the starving, who will have the choice of eating recycled “post-consumer waste”.A hilariously graphic animation sequence shows faeces being curled from a nozzle on to buns. Instead of laughing, the students are outraged. The Yes Men are delighted to reveal how disastrous WTO policies are. But surely they proved something different: that no horror story about the evils of capitalism is too implausible to be swallowed whole.This sad truth has been ruthlessly exploited by law professor Joel Bakan, author of the book and then the documentary The Corporation. His interminable film offers a strange mixture of sophisticated imagery, 1950s advertising and pundits such as Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein and Michael Moore, whose contributions are treated with reverence, and free-market supporters such as Milton Friedman, whose contributions are not. It is stitched together by commentary delivered by a robotic narratrix.The film’s basic idea is intriguing: corporations are legal persons, so what sort of people are they? Bakan runs through a check list of personality traits - “Callous unconcern for others”; “Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviours” - and concludes that if a company were a person, it would be a psychopath. Unfortunately, the filmmakers find this conclusion so obvious that they do not feel obliged to prove it.Strip The Corporation of its spin and it starts to look unhinged. All the trouble started, apparently, with the enclosure movement, which began the process of “wealth usurpation” - the premise being that there is no sense that property rights might help to create prosperity, or even that life is better now than it was in those halcyon days when “the land didn’t belong to the people, the people belonged to the land”.For Chomsky, privatisation means handing a company over to “unaccountable tyranny” (I think he means shareholders); there is no mention that private companies are subject to the law, regulators and competition. Some of this stuff is right up there with the story about the shitburgers.The Corporation gives no space to the real questions about the modern corporation and capitalism. On the subject of marketing, for instance, it spins paranoid fantasies about how anyone - from the doorman at your apartment to the strangers you pass in the street - could be in the pay of the advertisers. It would be more interesting to ask how powerful advertising really is. To what extent can Nike take away my ability to choose footwear? If advertising persuades me to buy a Ralph Lauren shirt, does that mean I will regret the purchase? Bakan is not interested in such questions: the power of advertising is infinite, and his evidence is that advertising executives say it is.What about the role of governments? Monsanto is berated for producing a drug that stimulates milk in cows while governments are paying farmers to throw milk away. None of the talking heads makes the obvious point that the drug is profitable because governments are paying farmers to throw milk away.Chomsky does raise an intriguing point about how corrupting it may be to work for a large corporation. “Every one of us, under some circumstances, could be a gas chamber attendant or a saint.” It’s not clear how much space he leaves for individual responsibility - his comments on advertising suggest he has little confidence in our ability to think and choose for ourselves. I disagree with his view, but it is defensible. It’s a shame that, armed with a documentary running well over two hours, Bakan is too arrogant to bother with that defence.Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room does a much better job, largely because, in unpicking the causes of the most famous corporate scandal in history, it eschews abstract ranting and shows what individuals did, why they did it and what circumstances made it possible.Unlike the other films, Alex Gibney’s documentary is quite explicit about the effect of corporate culture on executives, arguing that junior executives lost the ability to question the ethics of their actions. To support this, the film devotes time to explaining Stanley Milgram’s notorious experiments in the early 1960s, in which unwitting subjects were willing to apply agonising and possibly fatal electric shocks to an innocent person because a scientific authority told them to.Will capitalism inevitably produce despicable characters such as the Enron bosses Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling? Gibney’s film suggests it’s not a question of whether but of how often. At times, however, the narrative is frustratingly vague. Gibney speculates that Enron illustrates a flaw in “American-style capitalism”, but fails to acknowledge that corporate governance is in worse shape in most parts of the world. CFO Andy Fastow’s Byzantine structure of interwoven companies is commonplace almost everywhere except the UK and US.Gibney is also far too hazy about what role “deregulation” played in Enron’s antics. California’s experiment with restructuring its electricity contracts gave Enron opportunities to profit at the expense of the average California grandmother, who - in the words of one Enron trader - had expensive power “jammed up her ass”. Yet the California experiment wasn’t a failure because of deregulation; it was a failure because it was an unworkable political bodge. Still, Enron is fun, educational and sobering all at once.Even more so is Super Size Me, the hilarious and alarming story of Morgan Spurlock’s 30 days in a wilderness of McDonald’s restaurants. Two-thirds of American adults are overweight or obese, and Spurlock’s thoughtful probing of the causes is given shape when he sets himself the challenge of spending a month eating only what he can get over the counter at McDonald’s. This diet contains a pound of sugar a day - and a pound a day is roughly Spurlock’s weight gain over the first fortnight.Super Size Me is not only funny but fair. Spurlock scrutinises everything from school meals to corporate advertising, but never denies that what we eat is, ultimately, up to us. He obliterates his health so quickly only by following absurd rules - does anyone really eat at McDonald’s three times a day, and choose “super size” whenever it is offered? Many of us eat too much fat and sugar without ever going near a fast-food restaurant, simply because it tastes good. His compelling final message is about healthy living, not McDonald’s, and is much the better for it.Perhaps because Super Size Me and Enron focus on narrower issues, they avoid the superficialities of The Corporation and The Yes Men. None of the films married a broad perspective with a willingness to ask the real questions about how capitalism is developing. Free markets work only when competition limits the power of companies to exploit employees, shareholders and customers. Is competition working better than it used to? Yes. Is that enough? No, but it’s a great start. But none of these documentaries talks about competition - The Corporation acts as though each industry was controlled by a single, all-powerful organisation. Competition doesn’t always work, but without some sense that it might be beneficial it’s hard to talk sensibly about capitalism and corporate power.We also learn little from these films about globalisation. Falling trade barriers weaken companies because they subject them to more intense competition from abroad. But globalisation also allows companies more leeway to bargain with governments. None of the documentaries cares to weigh up these effects.Most importantly, governments escape from these films almost blameless. Bakan’s attempt to persuade us that corporations are responsible for all our problems is pernicious not just because it is mistaken, but because it makes those problems harder to solve. As long as corporations are expected to provide charity to workers making unsellable products, or are blamed for our love of fatty food, governments escape their responsibilities.Leaving lobbying activities aside, the most profitable company in the world, ExxonMobil, could abandon oil for solar energy but still do nothing to stop climate change because the solar panels would still be too expensive, the oil fields would be bought by competitors, and we would still use the internal combustion engine, because it’s the cheapest way to move a car. We the consumers, not corporations, are the ones driving the cars, buying the junk and drinking the milkshakes. We, and the governments we elect, would achieve more if we weren’t so happy to make the corporations our scapegoats.Tim Harford writes the Dear Economist column and is author of “The Undercover Economist”, to be published in the autumn."
997;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2005-06-20T17:53:22Z;Storm in a coffee shop;;"Alanis Morissette may be one of Canada’s most prized cultural exports, but that did not stop HMV from pulling all of the artist’s music from shelves in its Canadian stores last week.The retailer sent the CDs back to the artist’s record label in protest at preferential treatment being given to another distribution channel. over traditional music retailers. But it was not internet or mobile phone downloading services that irked HMV Canada. While the threats to traditional music retailers by the next wave of delivery platforms are widely assumed to come from new media technology, last week’sthis spat involved whiffs of potential competition from CD sales in Starbucks’ coffee shops.With the industry now adjusted to the concept of paid-for downloads, high street chains are steeling themselves against new claims on their market share. That may mean consumers “sideloading” from their digital provider to their mobile phone (witness Napster’s new partnership with Ericsson, and iTunes’ association with Motorola) or the mouthwatering prospect for commercial radio groups from GCap to Emap, of listeners being able to click and buy music direct from internet or digital radio.Starbucks’ emergence as Hence the increasingly controversial presence of Starbucks as a player in the retail arena is getting got its older rivals into a grande cappuccino-sized froth.In March, the chain had announced a deal with Maverick Records, part of Warner Music, marketed by Warner Brothers, for Alanis Morissette’s Jagged Little Pill, an a freshly-brewed acoustic version of her 1995 breakthrough album. The pact was for a six-week window of exclusivity from release date for Starbucks to sell the album in its 4,400 stores in the US and 400 more in Canada.But it was only on June 13, when that the release date, arrived, on June 13, that the controversy really took off. latte really hit the fan. That day, HMV Canada announced in high dudgeon that it was pulling all of the artist’s music from its shelves and sending it back to Maverick the label in protest at such preferential treatment for Starbucks, “consistent with the views of the majority of our customers,” according to Humphrey Kadaner, president of the 102-strong Canadian chain.The same day, Ms Morissette appeared to add fuel to the fire by performing for a mere 120 company employees and contest winners at a Starbucks store in New York. In an interview with Billboard, the US trade publication, she pointed to the longstanding links between acoustic troubadours and such venues: “The acoustic songs have a coffee-house feel, so I think it fits.” she said.Ms Morissette also shrugged off the complaints of discontented retailers who will be unable to sell have been effectively barred from selling her new record until August. “I’ve always been open to alternative ways of sharing my music,” she said. “Any time there is a paradigm shift like this, I understand that some people are going to be resistant. It happened with the internet too.”Ed Christman, retail editor of Billboard, can understand the collective retail sulking. “In [North America] there are many retailers who felt they helped break Alanis Morissette the first time around,” he says, “and now they feel they are being shafted the second time around.”In 2003, traditional music retailers in North America blacklisted the Rolling Stones’ catalogue after the band made an exclusive ­initial deal with Best Buy, the consumer electronics retailer, for its Four Flicks DVD. Elton John, meanwhile, also found himself removed from some retail racks last year when he did the same thing with Dream Ticket, a new DVD.In the UK, retailers were irked by EMI’s exploitation of a loophole when digital sales were integrated into the singles chart for the first time in April. The company initially sold Gorillaz’ Feel Good Inc online, releasing a token 300 copies to stores to allow qualification for the chart, giving retailers more ammunition to complain about an uneven playing field.Despite such incidents, Mr Christman believes news of the the renewed rush to sound the death knell death of the old-fashioned music store is contrived. “I don’t see any threat, as yet, coming from new technology to traditional retailers, apart from CD burning,” he says. “I think a lot of that originates in the press – they are the ones saying retail is over and done with. The retailers believe they are going to be here forever.”The future, says Mr Christman, is not about the obliteration of the old by the
new, but about co-existence. “Retailers are downsizing their music selection and replacing it with other entertainment products. In future, music will be consumed in many different forms, some people will be buying it through cellphones, some as digital downloads, some will still be buying it as a ­physical entity.”Steve Gallant, product director for HMV in the UK, says he can understand the reaction of the chain’s Canadian division over the Alanis Morissette issue. But he does not believe such a situation could arise in the British industry, where “we are all very competitive but we all understand that we are part of the same business, and those new players, while they have a presence in the UK, don’t have the same influence as music retail”.Starbucks’ Hear Music bars, where US consumers can burn their own compilations from a database of some 150,000 songs, is projected by American analysts to realise as much as $120m (£66m) a year, which would represent only 3 per cent of the company’s annual US sales of $4.5bn. But at the other end of the scale from its controversial courtship of a superstar such as Ms Morissette, the chain’s championing of one new US band has been an undeniable success.Atlantic Records agreed signed a three-month window of exclusivity with Starbucks for Antigone Rising, the New York-based folk-rock girl group, for its debut album From The Ground Up. The result, according to Brian Corona, Atlantic director of adult promotion, is sales of 52,000 copies in five weeks – beyond the dreams of an unheard-of act. “This has been phenomenal for us – it is a fantastic opportunity,” he says. “If people are actually buying music, however they are doing it, that is a positive thing.”"
998;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2005-06-12T19:48:47Z;Seattle WiFi users wake up and smell the coffee;;"The Victrola neighbourhood coffeehouse in Seattle, Washington, no longer serves wireless internet access on weekends with its lattes and espressos. Gradually, over two years, the sprawl of notebook computers had spread across nearly all of its tables, choking conversation and forcing the owners to turn off the radio signal to preserve their café culture on Saturdays and Sundays.The Joe Bar café nearby has taken similar steps to limit its WiFi hours for Seattle, the capital of coffee and home of Starbucks, has become the number-one city in the US for business people and consumers to connect wirelessly to the internet.In the Unwired Cities rankings issued last week, Seattle pushed San Francisco into second place, with Austin, Texas, third and Portland, Oregon, fourth. Rainy days, the popularity of coffee-based computing and the proximity of Microsoft in Redmond were all cited as reasons.But further statistical evidence suggests that America as a whole is adopting the new technology. T-Mobile USA, the biggest provider of WiFi hotspots with 5,700 in the US, will today announce a big surge in usage over the past six months as consumers follow the business community in embracing wireless internet connectivity.While there have been more than 15m connections to its service since the launch in 2002, 8m of these took place last year and 3m in the last three months. The average online session now lasts 64 minutes, up from 45 minutes in 2004; a typical session costs about $5 (€4.12). The amount of data moved over T-Mobile's networks has grown from 11 terabytes in January to 17.5 terabytes in May or the equivalent of nearly 5bn pages of text.“WiFi has experienced an inflection point,” says Joe Sims, general manager of T-Mobile HotSpot. “A lot of people were wondering when it was going to hit mainstream adoption and some kind of ubiquity and that's what we have been noticing over the last 90 to 180 days.”One reason for WiFi taking off is that people are suddenly buying more portable notebook computers than desktop machines. The Current Analysis research firm reported last week that notebook sales were 53 per cent of the computer market in the US in May, up from 46 per cent a year ago. Prices have dropped 17 per cent in the last year, while the number of wireless-enabled notebooks has risen from 80 per cent to 95 per cent.“We are reaching some sort of tipping point; with all these WiFi-enabled laptops, there's this pent-up demand of people walking around with them looking for a place to hook up,” says Bert Sperling of Sperling's Best Places, which carried out the Unwired Cities survey.Intel, the world's biggest semiconductor company which commissioned the study, said last week that its wireless notebook chips, known as Centrino, were driving better than expected revenues in the current quarter. Centrino has been a big success for Intel, although it had to spend $400m on a marketing campaign after its launch in 2003 to raise consumer awareness of WiFi from near zero to more than 80 per cent.“Centrino was the right product at the right time and we spent an ungodly amount on advertising,” says Sean Maloney, head of Intel's Mobility group.WiFi still appears to have some way to go before hotspot owners enjoy the same kind of financial success as Intel. T-Mobile will reveal user numbers for the first time today about 500,000 people have used its service within the past 90 days but will not say whether it is making a profit yet.The mobile operator's move into WiFi was greeted with scepticism by the industry. But Mr Sims says there have been significant benefits for its main business, with a 40 per cent probability that users of its WiFi hotspots would go on to sign up for phone accounts.Voice-over-IP, or internet phone calls using notebooks and hotspots, could eventually eat into the mobile operator's main source of revenues, but the large amounts of data moving across its WiFi network are thought to be mainly users sending photos with their e-mail or listening to music and watching videos online.More multimedia uses are also being supported by a wider range of WiFi-enabled devices. Kodak is introducing a WiFi camera in October that will detect hotspots and ask users if they want their pictures uploaded to the internet. Sony is enjoying booming sales of its WiFi-enabled PSP handheld game console.The WiFi landscape of seas of laptops in coffee shops is changing as devices and locations become more diverse. Cameras can upload pictures from baseball parks, gamers can play opponents while waiting for the final rinse at the laundrette. “Wireless is becoming a fundamental part of how we live,” says Mr Sperling."
999;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2005-05-30T21:00:33Z;Wake up and smell the coffee, wi-fi users;;"Coffee shops across the US are finding that offering free wireless internet access to customers is leaving a bitter taste.“There are times when 90 per cent of the people in here are surfing the internet,” says Jen Strongin, co-owner of the Victrola Coffee & Art cafe in Seattle. “It has really changed the atmosphere.”Students of coffee-house culture call it the “zombie effect” people staring silently into their computers, oblivious to those around them.Zombies are not only anti-social but also bad business. A single laptop user can take up a whole table. It is not unusual for web surfers to eke out a single cup of coffee for hours.“We have people in here for six, even eight, hours without buying a thing,” says Ms Strongin.Her solution is simple: from now on the wi-fi network will be turned off at weekends, the Victrola's busiest days.The Canvas Cafe in San Francisco has taken the same step, restricting wi-fi access to weekdays.The upmarket Samovar Tea Lounge, also in San Francisco, turns its service off at 5pm each day to prevent “zombies” from crowding out early-evening diners.An alternative is to charge customers for wi-fi. But small cafes recognise that free internet access is an important weapon in the battle against Starbucks, which offers pay-as-you-go wi-fi in 3,500 of its coffee houses.Activists at the Boston Wireless Advocacy Group hope to head off a wi-fi backlash by encouraging coffee house owners to display wi-fi etiquette posters. Top tips include: “Make purchases and tip”; “If it's busy don't overstay your welcome”; and “Share a table.”Besides, some customers are more attached than others to ubiquitous internet access. At Buck’s Diner in Woodside, California, a favourite haunt of Silicon Valley venture capitalists, the free wi-fi service is on all day, every day. The high-tech clientele expect nothing less.In nearby Portola Valley, the Konditorei cafe - immortalised five years ago by tech industry entrepreneur Randy Komisar in his book The Monk and The Riddle - follows the same zombie-friendly policy.Armando, manger of the Konditorei café in Portola Valley, advises: “Wi-fi etiquette? Keep using it until we kick you out.”"

The Nasdaq Composite added 0.9 per cent to 1,921.56.The Dow gained 0.3 per cent while the S&P 500 advanced 0.4 per cent for the week and the Nasdaq gave up 0.5 per cent.The earnings season continued, with a stream of economic data adding to a mixed backdrop. News of declining consumer confidence was countered by tumbling oil prices as increased consumer incomes and spending failed to spur optimism amid inconclusive earnings reports.The week started with yet more mergers, when several deals were announced Monday. Valero Energy saw shares add 1.1 per cent for the session when the company announced it would take over Premcor, another refiner, for about $8bn. Shares in Premcor gained 18.1 per cent. For the week, Valero was down 8.7 per cent, while Premcor added 12.1 per cent.Not all deals generated trading, as MCI’s indication over the weekend that it preferred a bid from Qwest Communications, rather than one from Verizon, barely moved any of the three stocks for the session. Verizon’s quarterly earnings, however, did push its stock 3.6 per cent higher two days later. MCI eased 0.6 per cent this week. Qwest lost 3.7 per cent, and Verizon put on 5.1 per cent.The buyout of DoubleClick, the internet advertising company, by a private equity group, was another deal announced on Monday. Shares in DoubleClick gave up 5.3 per cent after the transaction was announced and were down 6.2 per cent for the week.Concerns about the availability of finance for some leveraged buyouts weighed on the stocks of target companies later in the week, with SunGard Data Systems losing 1.7 per cent to $33.38 on Thursday and finishing the week 1.8 per cent off. SunGard, DoubleClick and Toys R Us all traded below the price at which the offers had been made.In a similar theme, worries about the takeover of Archipelago Holdings by the New York Stock Exchange sent shares in the electronic market operator down 8.4 per cent on Monday. However, the stock rebounded later in the week as those fears abated and was up 9.2 per cent on the week by Friday’s close.During a week that was supposed to be about the maiden flight of the Airbus superjumbo airliner, Boeing captured much of the attention with two multi-billion dollar orders for its Dreamliner jet and orther planes, in addition to its earnings report. Having jumped 2.9 per cent on Monday and 1.1 per cent two sessions later, Boeing shares finished the week 2.8 per cent higher.Worries about consumers’ appetite for new technology and other products were fanned by a below-estimate earnings report from Lexmark and a worrying guidance from Amazon. The printer maker saw shares tumble 14 per cent on Tuesday, dragging rival Hewlett-Packard’s shares 3 per cent lower, while Amazon stock gave up 3 per cent. On the week, Amazon eased 2.1 per cent as Lexmark fell 8.5 per cent.KLA-Tencor, the semiconductor equipment maker, fanned worries about the outlook for technology as it warned that its clients’ slowing expansion plans would impact its earnings. Shares fell 2.7 per cent on Friday and lost 5.1 per cent for the five-session stretch.However, Microsoft saw shares put on 3.5 per cent on Friday as its upbeat guidance cancelled out news that it failed to meet earnings expectations for the previous quarter. For the week, the stock was 1.3 per cent up.Elsewhere, shares in Starbucks, the coffee-house chain operator, rose 4.6 per cent on Thursday and were 8.7 per cent higher for the week by Friday’s close.
1001;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2005-04-28T20:17:49Z;Wall Street slides after GDP disappoints;;Wall Street indices fell sharply on Thursday after a government report showed slowing US GDP gross domestic product growth, fuelling concerns that rising interest rates and high energy prices may be taking a toll on the world’s biggest economy.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3 per cent to 10,070.37. The broader S&P 500 index dropped 1.1 per cent to 1,143.22. The Nasdaq Composite index gave up 1.4 per cent to fall to 1,904.18, its lowest level since October last year.Economic growth in the US slowed to an annualised rate of 3.1 per cent last quarter, the lowest growth rate in two years, according to an official report that disappointed economists’ forecasts of 3.5 per cent GDP growth.Steve Wieting, US economist at Citigroup, said the data “offer both hope and fear for the second quarter” because some weakness in March figures could be overstated, while large inventories increases could be a drag in the second quarter.The US government’s weekly report on jobless claims showed that the number of people filing for initial jobless benefits rose slightly, in line with expectations.Starbucks, the coffee shop chain, rose 4.6 per cent to $48.56 after it raised forecasts. The company said new store openings and strong sales of a new chocolate drink helped lift profits in the first quarter.Procter & Gamble shares rose 0.9 per cent to $53.99 after the company beat estimates and raised its targets for 2005. The consumer products group, which earlier this year announced it was buying rival Gillette in a $57bn acquisition, reported quarterly profits of $1.7bn, up from $1.5bn a year ago.Wendy’s rose 3.5 per cent to $42.70 in spite of lower earnings for the quarter. The fast food chain, which was thrust into the spotlight after a now-discredited customer claimed to have found a human finger in a bowl of chilli at a California restaurant last month, said higher beef costs and sagging sales had led to the decline.Shares in Aetna, the leading health insurer, fell 1.6 per cent to $71.32 after it reported a 16 per cent increase in quarterly profits. Dow Chemical slipped 0.2 per cent to $44.70 after the largest US chemicals group almost trebled its profits in the first quarter thanks to farm chemicals and plastic sales.Among pharmaceuticals, Chiron shares fell 1.7 per cent to $33.83 after the drugmaker reported a loss for the quarter due to the effects of a shutdown of a plant producing flu vaccines in the UK, which prevented Chiron from selling the shots for most of the flu season.Among technology stocks, Kronos shares fell more than 21 per cent to $38.81 after the software group gave an earnings forecast that missed Wall Street estimates.On a more upbeat note, Microchip Technology added 9.4 per cent to $27.92 after it reported record earnings for the current fiscal year.
1002;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2005-03-28T17:24:45Z;Book review: How Starbucks conquered the world;;"BUILT FOR GROWTH
Expanding your business around the corner or across the globe
By Arthur Rubinfeld and Collins Hemmingway
Wharton School Publishing $25.95Ever wondered what happened to the glass and metal storage bins full of coffee beans that used to stand around in Starbucks' coffee shops? The design team, apparently, thought they would give customers a subliminal connection to old-world in-store coffee roasters, but without that old-world fire risk.But the company's operations people never liked the idea. The staff didn't use them. The storage bins became just a store decoration. And then they were slowly phased out.The hand-made pendant lampshades over the curved wooden platform used to present drinks to the customer, on the other hand, are still around - spotlighting each beverage as if it were something more than, well, just a coffee.After 10 years leading Starbucks' store development programme, during which time the company expanded from 150 stores to more than 4,000, Arthur Rubinfeld has an eye for that kind of detail.Trained as an architect, his early career included working as construction manager on a hotel building in Manhattan; he moved on to directing workers on the building site of one of the most successful retail brands in recent business history.So, appropriately for a man whose made his name in bricks and mortar, or at least in terracotta tile and modular countertops, he has written a very hands-on manual for the would-be entrepreneurial retail brand builder. Strangely, for a book that celebrates original thinking, Wharton Publishing (an imprint of Pearson, owner of the Financial Times) opted for a title that echoes Jim Collins' best selling Built to Last. But this is a far more wildly discursive production, ranging from tips on signing a good lease, to the importance of a unified concept of design, to plain old-fashioned business street smarts.Trying to get a grip on the economic demographics of a potential location for a new store or restaurant? Check out the clothes hanging in a local dry cleaners (too many shirts is bad news). Or assess the range of ethnic foods available in a local supermarket - greater variety in an up-market supermarket means more adventurous shoppers.But it is the anecdotes from Starbucks' evolution, and from Rubinfeld's subsequent career as a brand development consultant, that drive the book forward. From store design and location to ""high touch"" customer service, the brand's expansion provides the paradigm for the value of combining imaginative planning with hard-nosed execution.The author describes, for instance, how a design team came up with the concept of using design ""touchstones"" of earth, fire, water and air that were supposed to evoke the development of the coffee bean (growth, roasting, brewing and aroma). Sounds zany, perhaps, but it inspired the palette of colours used and the organic feel of the stores, and in turn shaped other decisions, such as the choice of round, rather than square tables, aimed at creating a less formal mood that made customers more relaxed.Taken all together, the design concept worked in a way that the company's rivals found impossible to emulate with attempts to mimic any individual element such as the wallpaper, or the lighting.The process also resulted in a kit-of-parts approach, where 80 per cent of every new store could be fitted with a selection of mass produced standard components, with local designers then given leeway to customise the remaining 20 per cent to meet the conceptual requirement of individuality. The stores in turn were being directed to areas selected by both economic and educational demographics, with the exact location of each initial bridgehead outlet individually chosen for its high-profile impact.Sometimes the authors' principles seem self-evident, such as seeking staff who are prepared to make eye contact with the customers. But there are also enough failures around the world's shopping zones to suggest there's a pretty big market for instruction, and he tells his stories with the enthusiasm of a man who clearly loves the detail of retail.You can feel his pain over the foolishness of a cashier at the head of a long check-out line asking customers whether they had found everything they wanted. Or his discomfort over dirty tables in an ice-cream parlour, or chefs cooking out front in an Italian restaurant wearing tatty sneakers and scruffy beards.This is the nitty-gritty of the competitive retail war being waged across the US, and elsewhere too, in the battle to persuade customers to differentiate. At its heart, he argues, is the struggle between two visions of the retail future - ""the death spiral of commoditisation and price wars or the life spiral of creativity, quality and differentiation"".The big brands are increasingly seeking to personalise the impersonal - Wal-Mart already has its greeters at the door whose job is to make customers feel wanted.For Rubinfeld, the smaller retailer will only survive in what he calls the ""New Age of Retail"" by defining a defensible lifestyle or speciality niche. And once there, they need to secure a position with ""high touch and human engagement"". After all, that's how Starbucks persuaded people to spend all that money on what is, well, just a cup of coffee."
1003;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2005-03-07T21:06:45Z;Notebook;;"Top cop says nail these fanaticsLord Stevens, the former Metropolitan Police chief,this weekend used a News of the World column to back the government's anti-terror legislation and attack on the civil liberties lobby. Below are edited extracts.Even as you read this there are at least 100 trained fanatics walking Britain's streets. Of course when I say walking the streets don't take that literally; some will just have popped into Starbucks for a latte.I refer of course to the ranks of civil libertarians and human rights lawyers stalking our country. Intelligence sources show there are at least 100 trained human rights lawyers at large, threatening to invoke habeas corpus, questioning the reliability of police evidence and patronising the home secretary in the House of Lords.In ordinary times their activities could be monitored without undue alarm. But these are not ordinary times. The terror threat to our nation is greater than it has ever been. There are quite literally a gazillion al-Qaeda trained terrorists at large in Britain today. It is truly terrifying. I'd leave the country, but I'm afraid to fly.They are being aided by the hordes of lawyers, many of them schooled in training camps in Lincoln's Inn under fanatical liberal masterminds such as Cherie Blair or Michael bin Mansfield.Now, I know there are those who think that there must be a middle ground between the extreme civil rights lobby, which behaves as if there were no threat, and those who say we should take any steps necessary to safeguard our citizens. But there isn't.Let me tell you, the intelligence I have seen shows that you cannot negotiate with these people. It is madness to let these lawyers roam free. We have seen the damage they can do. Only last week they forced Charles Clarke to let a judge decide who gets put under house arrest.Now, it is all very well to say a judge should determine whether people can be detained without trial or subject to swingeing control orders. But that way madness lies. Today it may be judicial sanction; tomorrow these lawyers will be demanding the accused be told the evidence against them.Let's not get in a twist about judicial oversight or a sunset clause on the legislation. I have seen the intelligence against these terrorists and let me tell you they are villains of the worst order. That's all you need to know. The problem is we do not have the evidence to bring them to trial and secure convictions. That is why it is vital to remove the need for evidence or trial. Sometimes we do have evidence but don't feel minded to present it. And why should we? Time was when the word of a policeman was enough. Next we'll be scrapping the presumption of guilt. Wake up Britain. These liberals are standing between us and safety with their demands for ""conventional evidence"", whatever that might be. Would you really feel safer if that dripping liberal Michael Howard got his way?These days ""human rights"" are being too skewed towards the individual. We need to get back to the days when human rights were too skewed towards the state. Before it is too late.Green governmentMinisters have been told that every flight made by them or their civil servants on official business will in future require a donation to an environmental fund designed to limit the damage caused by C0 emissions.It is sheer gesture politics but nonetheless it surely sets a welcome precedent which could be extended across Whitehall. Many ministers have been chastised for allowing their departments to leave lights on all night. Now when that happens the Secretary of State could be sent down to the gym to pedalup a few watts on a life-cycle linked to a local generator.Similarly, every time a department publishes a new bill or consultative document it would have to plant some new trees in the street outside. Then again, there are dangers to this. Given their recent output both the Treasury and Home Office would now be lost behind several hectares of forest.Lord SheppardThe sad death of Lord Sheppard, who as David Sheppard found fame first as an England cricketer and then as Anglican Bishop of Liverpool,robs the country of another of those characters who represent everything that seemed good about a bygone age and who one feels will never come again.The notion of a cricketing bishop seems now almost as absurd as the idea that any sports star might abandon the riches and trappings of their game for a higher calling. Had he stuck with cricket he would now be remembered as one of the greats. Had he been a tad less left-wing he might well have been Archbishop of Canterbury, but his views on inner city poverty brought him into conflict with Margaret Thatcher. He once likened facing her to facing the feared fast bowlers, Lindwall and Miller.One did not have to share all his views to recognise a model of gentle conviction and determined compassion, be it in his faith, on the evils of apartheid or the plight of the urban poor. Or to know that the country is just that little bit poorer for his death.robert.shrimsley@ft.com"
1004;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2005-02-17T19:31:34Z;Observer - US;;"New pay grade for UN's BrownAs Mark Malloch Brown, the United Nations' new chief of staff, embarks on a wide-ranging series of management reforms, one of the first questions facing the organisation comes rather close to his own interests: how much he should be paid.As head of the United Nations Development Programme, one of the UN's top three jobs, Malloch Brown earned (and still does, for the time being) a net salary, awarded by the UN General Assembly, of $253,905.But that position is now up for grabs, and the chief of staff position is institutionally a junior job. As such, it attracts a lower package. According to UN officials, undersecretary-generals such as the chief of staff are paid a net $205,809, a considerable drop.Taking the cut, his supporters say, would be a little unfair, considering Malloch Brown is believed to have been brought in after considerable persuasion. His marching orders include helping to save the organisation from attacks in the US and steering its response to the oil-for-food programme scandal. Under normal circumstances, he probably would have stayed on as UNDP head.""The chief of staff job is less senior but we can't expect him to take a pay cut,"" said one official, who described the situation as ""rather tricky"".Snow jobTreasury secretary John Snow is on a two-day trip to Wall Street which will end on Friday with a tour of the Lehman Brothers trading floor.It is Snow's second formal trip to the Street this year to talk about Social Security reform and the third senior-level Washington visit following Joshua Bolten's discussion about deficits with bond market types last week.All this would appear to mark a renewed desire on the part of the Bush administration to mend their relations with Wall Street. Until now, Snow's appearances were infrequent and did little to mend the damage done by his predecessor Paul O'Neill, who told The Wall Street Journal in 2001 that trading was something he ""probably could learn in about a couple of weeks"" and that traders ""are not the sort of people you would want to help you think about complex questions"".Seems like Social Security reform is one issue the administration could do with some help on.Riches to ragsHow do you accumulate a small fortune? Start off with a large one.JPMorgan Private Bank has come up with research, based on the Forbes rich list, showing that 85 per cent of wealthy people go from rich to (comparatively) poor in their lifetimes.The research is based on the 400 names on the original rich list published in 1982. Today, just 50 of the same names are still on the list. Some of them have simply died. Others, including a couple of Rockefellers, had their wealth ""realigned"" - which, presumably, is cute bankers' speak for divorce.But most - for example, Ivan Boesky, the arbitrageur, members of the DuPont family, Estée Lauder, quite a few Rockefellers and a couple of publishing Hearsts - dropped off the list because their wealth didn't grow fast enough.JPMorgan cites eight reasons why about 200 names fell off the rich list, including (ahem) spending too much, keeping too many eggs in one basket, poor tax planning and litigation.Apparently, the adage still applies: from shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations.Straight up?Waking you up is evidently not enough for Starbucks. The coffee seller now wants to put you to sleep in a way that may make you need to order a triple espresso the next day.On Thursday, Starbucks announced that it is teaming up with Jim Beam, the bourbon maker, to create Starbucks Coffee Liqueur. (The union of grunge and blue grass yields . . . Kahlúa?) The $23 bottle of caffinated booze is suitable, the Starbucks folks say, for such oddly named (and stomach-churning) cocktails as the ""vodka americano"" mixed with vanilla-flavoured vodka and the ""Seattle Manhattan"", where the liqueur elbows in on sweet vermouth.Lest anyone worry that their local barrista is getting sauced on the job, the liqueur will not be sold in Starbucks stores. Too bad: a ""venti half-caf-decaf vodka americano with soy"" rolls off the tongue.Soul-searchingPresident George W. Bush still hasn't responded to the European parliament's invitation to speak. Days before Bush arrives in Brussels, the lack of response is being taken as a no.The rejection has prompted some soul-searching. ""Look at the reception we gave Ronald Reagan and Jacques Chirac,"" said one parliamentarian.Both statesmen were met with loud protests over their policies. ""If we do not respect our own institution how can we expect outsiders to respect it?"" the parliamentarian asked.So the parliament's authorities are proposing a code of conduct to punish rowdiness. Deputies waving national flags and those raising surprise questions have been singled out for criticism.But there are limits. ""We will not go as far as the Swedes: one member was told to go home and put on a jacket,"" says Observer's man with the rule book.Ted's answersDon't call Edward Kennedy on a Sunday night.The liberal icon calls himself a ""religious watcher"" of Prime Minister's Questions.While C-Span airs the British House of Commons session live as it happens on Wednesday mornings, Kennedy says he catches the replay on Sundays.But, even on the weekend, the Massachusetts Democrat is working.

1005;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2005-02-10T16:42:18Z;Market Insight: Clouded outlook overshadows equities;;The US stock market has remained mired in a rudderless pattern in spite of a flurry of good news this earnings season, frustrating bullish investors eager to extend the market's late-2004 winning streak into the new year.Burt seasoned investors say that to focus on companies' past peformance misses the point. It is the outlook for 2005, not the companies' fourth-quarter numbers, that has Wall Street worried.The vast majority of S&P 500 companies that have reported their fourth-quarter results so far have met or beaten expecations, some by a wide margin.With 79 per cent of companies reporting, 65 per cent have beaten expecations. Sixteen per cent have matched forecasts, and just 19 per cent have fallen short, according to Thomson Financial.Yet investors have remained fickle. Norfolk Southern, the fifth biggest US rail group, saw its shares tumble more than 3 per cent last week in spite of a five-fold increase in quarterly profit.Other big names that have lost out in spite of improved results include Starbucks, the coffee shop chain. Its shares fell 4.6 per cent the same day it topped expectations with profits up 31 per cent.Some analysts say the market is still suffering from a hangover after the rally in late October and early November last year, which left leading US indices hovering near 3½-year highs.Although profit-taking dragged shares lower in the first trading sessions of 2005, some valuations may still be a little on the plump side for some investors' tastes.Freight companies like Norfolk Southern saw their coffers swell last year, thanks to soaring demand for raw materials to feed the Chinese boom. Shares in the company climbed from a low of $20.54 in March 2004 to a high of $36.50 in December, a gain of more than 75 per cent.Others say this quarter's earnings are only half the picture. “Clearly the earnings season has been good,” says Jack Caffrey, equity strategist at JP Morgan Private Bank. “But at the same time you report earnings you also issue expectations for the next year.”For the most part, he says, companies have been trimming their earnings outlook for the first quarter of 2005.Much of the pessimism stems from lingering uncertainty about the prospects for the US economy in today's climate of rising interest rates. Most market watchers expect higher rates to lead to a gradual slowdown in the US economy, which could translate into slower corporate earnings growth this year.Those expectations were reinforced by hawkish comments on inflation last month by the US Federal Reserve, which led some analysts to suggest the US central bank might consider raising rates at a faster pace.“The issue is not whether the Fed is going to raise rates by 50 basis points or 25 basis points” says Richard Bernstein, chief US quantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch. “The key is that they are going to rise. As long as [the Fed] is in tightening mode, people should expect it to have an impact on the economy and the markets.”Some market-watchers hold out hope that, in spite of its lacklustre performance so far, the stock market will carve out healthy gains this year.“I think the decibel level on the earnings deceleration idea got [a little] loud. I think we're decelerating to a level that will be well above what most of the pessimists expect,” says Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab.Diane Swonk, managing director and chief economist at Mesirow Financial, says that easing uncertainty in the wake of the successful Iraqi elections late last month could bring back some upward momentum. “I'm not overwhelmingly excited but I think we have a window here,” she says. “We've been surprising on the upside for a while now.

Gone are the days when planners would operate within full-service agencies allocating funds to different media with the brief not to overload the audience or bust the budget.It is also no longer true that having split from their creative colleagues a few years ago media agencies are simply using their specialist product knowledge to navigate an increasingly fragmented media market.The media sector now realises it has a role to play in helping clients create excitement around brands. Advertisers expect their media agency to drive strategy by providing them with consumer insight, and to measure the most cost-effective and appropriate way to talk to their customers. This could be through traditional advertising, direct mail, public relations or point-of-sale activity. OMD, the IPA Best of the Best media agency of the year, has certainly moved into media neutral territory. Its work impressed the judges, who said the company displayed exceptional vigour and a true understanding of the media agency’s role.The debate about OMD’s position on the shortlist was whether the work being assessed had come from one agency or two. During 2004 Nick Manning (pictured), OMD UK’s group chief executive, implemented his “velvet merger” of OMD and Manning Gottlieb, the group’s two operations. Some judges did suggest a technical foul might have been committed because both agencies operate as stand-alone brands but share the umbrella group’s resources.Nevertheless, the OMD work was described by the judges as head and shoulders above its rivals’. The company has won awards for its brand-building activity across all media from digital to mainstream television on behalf of clients as diverse as Virgin Trains, Starbucks Coffee, Hasbro UK and Rimmel.“OMD’s fresh ideas certainly stood out and its success shows how the agencies that still have a close relationship with creative agencies, but understand how different media is being used by different groups, are the ones doing well at the moment,” says judge Mark Cridge, managing director of advertising agency Glue London.OMD’s business model is simple, but effective. It offers three central services to clients – customer insight, creative ideas and results – and the success of each illustrates how the function of the traditional media agency has evolved.“The advertising recession forced media agencies to change. Clients wanted help to understand their customers, while today – with so much advertising clutter – there is pressure on agencies to be more creative in how they use the media they buy,” says Mr Manning. He adds: “The advertising agencies have not developed to such a degree in the last 10 years and they are getting worried about how media agencies have improved their credibility in the eyes of clients.”The company won Campaign, Marketing and Media Week awards for its insightful UFO (Understanding Fifties and Over) research, which provided clients with evidence of how views and actions of the grey market are changing. The study, called Getting Older Thinking Younger, confirmed the over-50s have more spending power than before and the brand choices they make have more to do with attitude than with age.The company’s ideas for clients such as Nissan, Starbucks, Eurostar, Apple, Virgin Money and Hasbro’s Action Man won numerous awards.For the Learning to Fly campaign for Eurostar, MG OMD identified three key audiences using the group’s customer research tools: 21st century travellers, principled individuals and premium travellers. The agency decided outdoor media should lead the campaign, with buses, taxis and the London Underground used as primary contact points. These were supported with 96 sheets at 65 flagship sites showing images of the Eurostar trains taking off from a runway. A party was held at Waterloo station and a promotional runway printed on the floor along the entire length of the station.The highly-regarded OMD Matrix results system helps clients evaluate the return on investment from their advertising, and it took four honours at the IPA Effectiveness Awards. It is worth noting that a few years ago, the media’s contribution to these awards was minimal.Virgin Trains buys Matrix as a bolt-on agency service and it used the facility to measure the effectiveness of its £7m advertising campaign to launch new trains on the west coast main line. The results were integrated into the train company’s business planning to help finalise marketing budgets for 2005.“Virgin is a strong brand but the rail industry suffers from negative public relations, so this is a tricky product to market. MG OMD understood that and tailored the planning and the creative elements for what was a complex campaign across the regional and national media. I did have concerns about the OMD merger because I like the creative thinking we enjoy from MG OMD and I did not want to lose that. Thankfully we haven’t,” says Craig Inglis, Virgin Trains’ sales and marketing director.Back to IPA BOB Awards - special report
1007;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:00+0000;Dollar gains against euro as ECB opts to hold interest rates steady;;"World stock markets retreated into their shells on Thursday, content with Wednesday's quarter-point rise in US interest rates and yesterday's decision to leave European rates unchanged.The dollar rose after the European Central Bank left interest rates on hold at a record low for a 20th consecutive month. The decision turned the spotlight on the transatlantic interest-rate differential, which favours dollar- over euro-denominated assets.In commodity markets, gold prices sank to their lowest level since mid-October in London, hit by fund sales and the buoyant dollar.US crude oil retreated below $46 a barrel - its lowest level for three weeks - in response to ample supplies of crude and gasoline.Wall Street dipped in morning trade, bruised by data showing productivity growth slowed in the fourth quarter. Starbucks took a tumble after Smith Barney cut its rating on the coffee shop group, while Amazon suffered its biggest one-day fall for more than three years after the on-line retailer's results disappointed the market. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average eased less than 0.1 per cent to 10,593.10, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.8 per cent.Tobias Levkovich at Citigroup Smith Barney said the investment community continued to be affected by equity market trading trends, with recent stock price weakness dragging down various measures of investor sentiment.""In this context, investors have shown little real courage in making investment decisions and thus appear to favour going with the flow rather than demonstrating any underlying conviction in the market. Perversely, it almost seems as if it is politically incorrect to be bullish when markets trade down and similarly inappropriate to be bearish when things are going well.""One would think that contrarian strategies would have been unrewarding generally, when actually the opposite has been true.""And Haydn Davies at Barclays Global Investors said even in the face of rising US interest rates and concern over the outlook for corporate profits, the US economic climate remained in much better shape than elsewhere.""US investment analysts remain more positive on the outlook for earnings growth than their counterparts in other markets, even if US firms have been seeking to guide forecasts down in recent weeks.""Consequently, US equities should fare better than markets in Europe or the Pacific Rim.""European equities edged back from the 2½-year highs hit on each of the previous three sessions on a day dominated by corporate earnings and news that Royal Dutch/Shell had cut its oil reserves for a fifth time in just over a year. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index dipped 0.1 per cent to 1,072.38.Roger Hirst at Bear Stearns said although recent newsflow had been generally positive, European markets remained nervous about the current reporting season.However, the latest earnings data revealed that earnings were revised up by 3 per cent for the DJ Stoxx 50 index of top European companies and 1 per cent for the eurozone in January alone.""Following stabilisation of the general macroeconomic backdrop in the latter part of 2004, the market has moved on from an interest rate and oil price focus to look more closely at company profitability,"" he said. ""Earnings are once again seen as one of the key drivers of equity performance and should also be reflected in sector relative performance.""Rallying steel stocks kept Asian markets outside Japan at a seven-year high, but Tokyo edged lower as banks fell on renewed worries over bad loans."
1008;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2005-02-01T17:31:23Z;Beijing steps up the fight;;"Gilheney razors. N-Mart Super Center. Future Cola. Starsbuck. If these Chinese brands sound familiar, it is because their names echo some of the best-known US brands: Gillette, Wal-Mart, Coca-Cola and Starbucks.Just as China has become a leading producer of everything from shirts to semiconductors, it has also become the world's most adept imitator of foreign brands and business concepts.Local brands such as Future Cola, Gilheney razors and Starsbuck are operating in a grey area, where the distinction between legitimate me-too products and illegal copying remains unclear - although some companies such as General Motors of the US have moved to seek clarification in Chinese courts.America, the European Union and Japan have all criticised China's approach to intellectual property rights and Beijing has promised harsher penalties for counterfeiters.But just as legitimate businesses adapt to changing markets and regulations, China's copycats are becoming increasingly adept at eluding the authorities. And it is a lucrative enterprise for them: counterfeit products worth between $19bn and $24bn are produced a year, according to an estimate by the State Council's Development Research Centre, a government research body.As a result, foreign direct investors are increasingly wary of sharing their expertise with local partners. “They can copy anything,” says Horace Lam, a Beijing-based attorney at Lovells, the US law firm. “It takes them some time, but they are getting smarter and smarter.”China's copycats use a combination of strategies to outwit the authorities, including employing several layers of middle-men, producing parts in separate factories, churning out products at night and shipping fakes in limited batches. Furthermore, says Mr Lam, counterfeiters often benefit from the protection of local officials. They can add an extra level of security by establishing themselves offshore, like organised crime networks.Joseph Simone at US law firm Baker & McKenzie adds that enforcement measures such as fines, raids and seizures have not been much of a deterrent.Boston Consulting Group, a management consultancy, says the ""complex web"" of government departments charged with enforcing anti-piracy laws has helped to undermine the drive against counterfeiting. While some departments have a relatively clear remit, others have potential conflicts of interest. Industry experts point to the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, whose regional offices provide business licences and also police trademark violations. Some bureaux are both understaffed and notoriously leaky.Beijing insists it is seeking ways of tackling the problem. Last year, only a tiny fraction of the 10,000 or so intellectual property cases were brought under criminal law, said Li Mingde, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. But counterfeiters now face tougher criminal sanctions, including prison sentences. ""The fact that the government has made such progress is remarkable,"" says Mr Li.The lack of adequate legal training among many Chinese judges is a weakness. Nor are there sufficiently strong laws on trade secrets, making it harder to prevent the theft of patents, trademarks and copyrights, according to BCG.Mr Li believes the problem partly reflects the evolving nature of China's economy and development policy. At this stage of its development - which he compares to that of the US in the 1950s and 1960s - China relies on labour rather than innovation, which creates a climate in which copycats can thrive.Yet while they can see the threats to their business, many foreign companies have been slow to protect their technology against counterfeiting. ""If you don't defend yourself, people will hijack your rights,"" says Mr Lam. ""When we look at the product portfolio of some foreign [businesses], we see the gaps. If you don't spend money now, you will spend it later.""US industry and trade officials have been among the most vocal critics of China's policy on intellectual property, with complaints focusing on luxury goods, software, entertainment and industrial products.US officials have made two demands: step up the raids on local manufacturers and put more offenders behind bars. Yet some industry experts believe US officials are getting little help from the companies they represent. ""US and EU companies have been doing a pathetic job in providing quantifiable information to their respective governments,"" says one Hong Kong-based lawyer. ""Companies should not be complaining if they are not providing data.""Counterfeiting is a problem all over the world, not just in China. But in the US and Europe, customs departments estimate that China accounts for the bulk of counterfeit goods seized at their borders. Last year, US customs saw a 47 per cent rise in the total value of seized counterfeit goods from China.Wu Yi, China's leading official dealing with intellectual property rights, has repeatedly told her US counterparts that results will take time.However, there are signs of increasing international co-operation. The dismantling last year of a DVD-exporting ring based in China would not have been possible without the Chinese police and the US Department of Homeland Security working together. This led to the seizure of some 210,000 DVDs and the destruction of several warehouses.It will take years, though, for the central government to find ways of enforcing its attempts to crack the problem at local level. One answer would be for foreign companies to take legal action in China. The outcome would be uncertain, but it would give them some control over the process. If Starbucks wants to end any confusion with Starsbuck, it may have to act itself.China’s copycats dig their claws inWhen it comes to Chinese copycats, it is always best to expect the unexpected.While the counterfeiting problem is particularly acute in southern provinces such as Guangdong, it can pop up just about anywhere. Moreover, counterfeiters have built de-centralised production and distribution networks, creating headaches for foreign executives.“The concern about piracy increases as western companies ramp up their commitment to China,” says David Michael, vice-president of the Boston Consulting Group in Beijing.The number of companies that have fallen victim to China’s copycats continues to grow. For example, local companies in the inland province of Hunan have become adept at duplicating industrial pumps by Ohio-based Gorman-Rupp and adhesive materials by ABRO Industries, an Indiana-based gluemaker. Meanwhile, Zippo Manufacturing, the American lighter company, has seen its trademark violated by counterfeiters in the coastal province of Zhejiang, a hotbed of copycats.Imitations of other iconic US brands such as Duracell batteries and Viagra are readily available, as are the pirated versions of Hollywood films and Microsoft software.Yet Chinese brands are not immune, either, to counterfeiting. Recently Quanjude, a restaurant famous for its Peking duck, noticed that a Shandong-based company was selling pre-packaged cooked chickens under the name of Tongjude just outside one of its main restaurants in Beijing."
1009;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2005-01-28T22:25:42Z;Wall St notches first week of gains in 2005;;Wall Street succumbed to late losses on Friday, but momentum from a mid-week rally was enough to push stocks to their first week of gains in 2005.Procter&Gamble’s proposed $57bn takeover of Gillette, a rival consumer goods group, failed to breathe life into the broader market on Friday. But the leading US indices all closed higher for the week amid a raft of earnings reports and a flurry of merger and acquisition activity.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent on Friday to 10,427.20. The S&P500 slipped 0.3 per cent to 1,171.36, and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.6 per cent to 2,035/83.For the week, the Dow closed 0.3 per cent higher. The S&P500 rose 0.3 per cent and the Nasdaq edged up 0.1 per cent. The stronger performance partly reflected anticipation of easing uncertainty after Iraqi elections on Sunday.The stock market rallied sharply in October and November following the US presidential elections. But market watchers yesterday offered differing opinions as to whether Wall Street can expect a similar outcome next week after the elections in Iraq.Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said that sabotage or other attacks against oil assets could affect the markets in the short run. “There is an uncertainty that a big event could happen there, and that alone is probably worth $5 in crude prices,” he said. Stock market performance has been tied closely to the oil price in recent weeks.Richard Bernstein, chief US quantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch, said that although oil prices were likely to drive trading in the short term, the election’s outcome could also shed light on other long-term concerns. “There is an issue of oil, but there is also an issue of how long we are going to be in Iraq,” he said.P&G’s monster merger was the focus of attention yesterday after Thursday’s flat performance, which brought Wall Street’s brief two-day rally to a halt. News of the deal sent Gillette shares up nearly 13 per cent to $51.60 yesterday for a weekly gain of 17 per cent. P&G shares ended the week down 2.7 per cent at $54.15.Other deals this week included SBC Communicationss planned takeover of AT&T, the long-distance carrier. AT&T shares rose 9 per cent for the week after gaining more than 6 per cent after the deal was first reported on Thursday. Shares in SBC, the second-biggest US telecoms group, were down 7.7 per cent for the week at $23.62.Magnum Hunter Resources, the oil and gas group, was up more than 11.5 per cent for the week at $14.69 after rival Cimarex Energy revealed takeover plans. Cimarex fell more than 9 per cent.With earnings season in full swing, investors welcomed a series of upbeat reports from prominent companies. Most S&P500 companies that have reported so far have exceeded expectations.Sme analysts said that, after the market’s bull run to round out 2004, an expectation of outperformance had been priced in. But a rally on Tuesday and Wednesday indicated that investors were willing to reward companies for their fourth-quarter performance.Texas Instruments, the computer chip company, surged more than 7 per cent on Tuesday after its earnings brought upgrades from two prominent investment banks. Shares in the company rose nearly 10 per cent for the week to $23.11.Other stocks met with investor ire in spite of improved profits. Norfolk Southern, the biggest US railroad, was on track to end the week down 3.5 per cent after falling more than 5 per cent on Tuesday. The fall came in spite of a five-fold increase in quarterly profit.Starbucks, the coffee shop chain, fell 3.6 per cent this week to $53.70 in spite of higher quarterly earnings. Earnings disappointments stopped the rally in its tracks on Thursday. Caterpillar, the construction equipment group, led laggards on the Dow. Its shares fell 2 per cent on the week to $87.46.Merck, the drugs group, fell 10.1 per cent on Friday as US regulators stepped-up an investigation into the company’s handling of the Vioxx painkiller crisis and a court made an adverse ruling on a key patent. The shares fell 7.7 per cent for the week.

1011;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
1012;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2005-01-26T07:17:20Z;Pros and cons of 3G and WiFi;;Forget the Ethernet cable in the hotel closet. The way to make flexible working a reality is to give users hassle-free access to their corporate network any time and from any location. And the best way to do that is with wireless.The two high-speed wireless data technologies in general use today, 3G cellular and WiFi, are often presented as competitors, but the official line is that the two technologies are complementary.“For the nomadic worker, WiFi and 3G are just different ways to accessing corporate data,” says Chris Solbe, spokesman for the UMTS forum, which represents 3G operators. He says mobile workers will use 3G and WiFi for different reasons at different times.While they have similar speeds – a few hundred kilobits a second – the two technologies offer very different coverage. Cellular data can be accessed almost anywhere, although in countries still building their 3G networks, speeds drop considerably outside populated areas.In contrast, WiFi is a short-range technology so you have to find a WiFi hotspot and be within range – 100m or less. Nevertheless, hotspots can often be found in the places mobile workers frequent, including hotels, train stations and airport lounges.If you have no luck in these places, there is always McDonald’s or Starbucks. A growing number of retail businesses offer free or cheap WiFi access to lure customers into their stores. Then there are community WiFi initiatives. For example, the US city of Philadelphia, last year announced it would offer low-cost WiFi in neighbourhoods without broadband internet access.The initiative created an outcry from telecoms companies who argued that municipal WiFi projects, when subsidised with taxpayers’ money, create unfair competition. Their arguments worked: a state law was hastily drafted to prohibit municipal bodies offering WiFi in Pennsylvania. In Spain, Barcelona's city council has also had to scrap a free WiFi service.Despite these setbacks, the rise of subsidised hotspots has undermined the business model for commercial WiFi operators and prices have tumbled. Many WiFi start-ups are now struggling to survive and several have been snapped up by the telephone companies that are now muscling in on this market.“WiFi is not a stand-alone business but it does work as an integral part of a broader communications portfolio,” says Chris Clark, CEO of BT Wireless Broadband, the wireless arm of the UK's incumbent wireline operator.BT last year cut the prices of its WiFi service to just £5 a month for customers who also take BT's fixed-line broadband service. SBC Communications, the US regional operator, has an even cheaper WiFi deal, again for its broadband customers, which costs just $2 a month.As well as pitching cheap WiFi to consumers, the telephone operators hope to conquer the suspicion that many enterprises still have about WiFi.In the early days of WiFi, many businesses discovered their mobile workers where spending huge sums on WiFi services in hotels and the like. To discourage this “promiscuous” use of hotspots, some companies stopped their employees claiming the cost of WiFi scratch-cards on expenses.To address this problem, BT recently introduced a corporate tariff plan that aims to control WiFi spending and ensure that a company's mobile workers use BT hotspots rather than those of its rivals.The hotspot market was traditionally highly fragmented but is consolidating fast as the big operators swallow the smaller fry. BT now has 7,000 hotspots in hotels, airport lounges and railway stations spread across the UK. It also has an international roaming deal covering 20,000 hotspots.While most telecoms operators now offer WiFi services, many remain wary of a technology that, as the Philadelphia example shows, can be used against them. That is particularly the case with mobile operators.“They were caught off guard by the rise of WiFi and have since struggled to understand it,” says Niel Ransom, chief technology officer of Alcatel.In the heyday of the WiFi boom, mobile operators that had spent billions of euros acquiring 3G licences looked with dismay at the rise of the WiFi startups, which seemed to have all the cards in their favour.Unlike 3G, WiFi spectrum is unlicensed and therefore free. WiFi equipment costs are also much lower, while WiFi operators can cherry-pick the best locations for their hotspots – there are no universal coverage obligations.But WiFi has its drawbacks when it comes to offering a “business-class” service. WiFi’s use of unlicensed spectrum means interference can be a big problem, for example.Security is another weakness, although a new secure version of the WiFi standard, called 802.1x, aims to address IT managers' concerns about letting mobile workers access corporate networks via public WiFi hotspots. T-Mobile, the big mobile operator, recently announced its 4,700 US hotspots would support the 802.1x standard.Leading mobile operators like T-Mobile, Verizon and Vodafone all offer WiFi services but analysts say they face a difficult balancing act, because if they promote WiFi wrongly they risk cannibalising their cellular data business.In the past this was not such an issue, because the low speeds and high cost of 2.5G services like GPRS limited take-up of cellular data. With the arrival of 3G, however, the mobile operators have a technology that can compete on speed and cost with WiFi.To kick-start this fledgling market, some 3G operators are offering “all you can eat” data packages while others are attempting to replicate the pricing models of public WiFi hotspots.Alastair Brydon, analyst at UK consultancy Analysys, warns that such strategies may damage the economic prospects for 3G at an early stage of its development. “Head-to-head competition with WiFi could kill profitability,” he says. The operators risk filling their 3G networks with low-margin internet traffic, leaving no space for more profitable 3G services, such as voice and video.Mobile operators are thus working on how to integrate their WiFi and 3G services to achieve the best of both worlds.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent to 10,268.61, and the S&P 500 dipped 0.4 per cent to 1,163.75.The Nasdaq has lost more than 6 per cent of its value since January 3. The Dow and the broader S&P 500 are both down about 3 per cent.Stock market performance in January has proven a reliable barometer for the year as a whole in four of every five years since 1939, according to Jeff Hirsch, editor of the Stock Trader's Almanac.But some strategists cautioned against putting too much faith in the historical trend.Todd Leone, head of listed trading at SG Cowen, said: ""They say as January goes so goes the year. I don't know if that's going to hold this year."" Mr Leone said that investors had over-extended themselves following the rally in October and November. ""Now we're working some of that off. We need money coming into the market; that's the key.""Cashflows into the equity market have slowed dramatically in January, traditionally among the most cash-rich months of the trading year. ""People are leery,"" said Owen Fitzpatrick, managing director at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management, explaining the dearth of fresh cash. ""You are walking into a period where earnings growth is slowing, and people are concerned that the market could be in line for a correction.""Semiconductors bore the brunt of investor ire after a German chipmaker warned on earnings. LSI Logic led US chipmakers lower. Its shares fell 4.4 per cent to $5.21 ahead of an earnings report on Wednesday.Intel, the industry leader and bellwether, slipped 1.9 per cent to $21.99.Other stocks making news yesterday included Legg Mason, the investment bank, which rose 6.1 per cent to $75 after it revealed record quarterly revenues.Corinthian Colleges, the adult education group, jumped more than 10 per cent to $18.86 after the Securities and Exchange Commission ended an informal inquiry into the company's financial forecasts and analyst dealings without taking action.Starbucks fell to a three-month low ahead of its quarterly earnings report, due out tomorrow. Shares in the coffee shop chain dipped 3.2 per cent to $53.91.Energy stocks led gainers as oil prices broke briefly back through the $49 mark following a weekend blizzard across the north-east. ChevronTexaco, the oil group, rose 1.1 per cent to $52.57. Rival Exxon Mobil jumped 1.4 per cent to $51.13.Kimberly Clark, the maker of Huggies diapers and Kimwipes laboratory tissues, rose 1 per cent to $64.40.Federated Investors, the fund manager, rose 0.8 per cent to $28.75 after it revealed it was in talks with the SEC and state regulators to resolve issues related to alleged market timing."
1014;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2005-01-24T19:08:18Z;Starbucks must wake up and smell the coffee;;"""After a few months' acquaintance with European 'coffee', one's mind weakens,"" wrote Mark Twain back in 1880, ""and begins to wonder if the rich beverage of home, with its clotted layer of yellow cream on top of it, is not a mere dream after all, and a thing which never existed.""There is American coffee, and then there is European coffee. Can the twain ever meet? That question, among others, looms over Starbucks ahead of its earnings tomorrow. Shares of the coffee-shop chain - up more than 350 per cent so far this decade - have eased 14 per cent in 2005 to just below $54. Concerns were raised on Wall Street after the group reported same-store sales growth of 8 per cent for December, which was below expectations.Investors worry that Starbucks will soon have no more American soil to conquer, forcing it to cannibalise its stores. Abroad, especially in Europe, some fear that Starbucks will not be able to leverage its brand with the same success it has had at home.These fears, while not unfounded, have been with Starbucks for a long while. Back in 1998, satirical website The Onion jokingly reported that Starbucks ""continued its rapid expansion Tuesday, opening its newest location in the men's room of an existing Starbucks"". Meanwhile, betting against Starbucks in Europe poses risks, given the success of its management.The stock's valuation, a price/earnings ratio of about 59, leaves little room for error on the goal of top-line growth of 20 per cent a year. However, Starbucks has been opening new stores at about the same rate and has consistently posted same-store sales growth above 7 per cent.The bigger issue facing Starbucks is not bound by region, and that is inflation. Coffee futures soared 60 per cent last year, and are expected to average about $1 a pound this year, up 30 per cent from 2004.These prices are up from 30-year lows of 42.70 cents a pound in 2001, which came after three years of steady declines. Starbucks raised prices 11 per cent last October; it may not be able to pass on any more.Perhaps, however, the real miracle at Starbucks is that the company created a market for the $3.50 cup of coffee. Is there a market for a $5 cup?"

Now, if you look at the documents I circulated . . .Howard: Ah, you won't have them. The cabinet office staff have been laid off and the photocopier's out of toner. I've written some out in long hand, but it's one between two, I'm afraid.Letwin: Before we start, Tim Yeo's agreed to nip down to Benjy's for some tea.

Now, foreign secretary, brief us on the next EU summit.Ancram: Yes. We're catching the 5am Ryanair from Liverpool John Lennon to Charleroi. Our ambassador has borrowed a van to drive us to Brussels. I don't have any official papers but we can wing it. If in doubt, vote no. Oh, and bring your sleeping bags in case there's an overnight stay.Howard: Have we finished axing the New Deal?David Willetts: Hard to say. I'm having trouble reaching my officials since we outsourced the department to Bangalore. I can only call in the morning and it's always engaged.Howard: Ah. Well, there are bound to be teething problems. Incidentally, I've looked at the issue of when we get paid but there's a bit of a backlog at payroll now Brendan's on his own.

Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac, Gerhard Schröder and José Luis Zapatero all travelled to Toulouse for what turned out to be as much a visit to the Cirque du Soleil as a commercial launch.A giant messianic figure, half wizard, half alien, is projected on a large screen, talking of peace, dreams and Icarus; people float across the sky as Aled Jones sings ""nous promenons en l'air"". Children pull a large rope, lifting a curtain to reveal . . . an Airbus 380. The leaders, led by the French president, take the stage.Chirac: Today is the crowning achievement of industrial adventure. Not since the Wright brothers launched the European Coal and Steel Community have the spirit of innovation and the goal of EU integration been so closely intertwined. Even the British joined in and, believe me, that takes some doing.Let us pursue the success of Airbus in other fields, in energy, transport and medicines, the ratification of the EU constitution, my third presidential term and Nicolas Sarkozy's continued success as our envoy to Mosul. Today Airbus; tomorrow, the world.Blair: Today, I really do feel the flight attendant of history at my shoulder. For this big aircraft is an astonishing technological innovation. Greener than a Ford Galaxy and as recyclable as a pledge card, it is also the biggest, nicest and most economical aircraft ever.

1016;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2004-12-29T21:24:37Z;New-economy lifestyle boosts US tech stocks;;Some of the biggest brands of the technology bubble were among the best performing US stocks this year as the new-economy lifestyle continued to spread.It was as if everyone was sitting in Starbucks, listening to Apple iPods, while checking their Yahoo e-mail to see how they had fared in an eBay auction.All four stocks were in the top 20 performers in the Standard & Poor's 500 index with Apple Computer, maker of the leading portable music player, at No 2, with a gain of more than 200 per cent. Starbucks shares almost doubled, as they did in 2003, while eBay was up almost 80 per cent and Yahoo nearly 70 per cent.Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies, the investment bank, said the stock performances reflected ?the market's reward for companies that are an integral part of everyday life?.Brands such as Apple and Starbucks define the daily routine of the new economy generation in the way Coca-Cola, General Electric and Sears, Roebuck did in the past. None of those companies made it into the top 100 performers of the S&P in 2004.Not that it was all about the new economy last year. Two old economy brands, Goodyear Tire & Rubber and Black & Decker, made the top 20. Goodyear, which is recovering after two years of losses, was helped by higher prices and buoyant demand for truck tyres in the US. Strong sales of heavy duty trucks in the US drove up Cummins, the diesel engine maker, whose shares rose more than 70 per cent.Two other big trends of the year, the surge in the oil price and the impact of China's growing appetite for raw materials, propelled some of the other stock winners. Four of the top 20 stocks in the S&P were energy companies, including TXU and Valero, while Nucor, the biggest maker of steel in the US, had a bumper year thanks to the doubling of the steel price.It was a bad year for large pharmaceuticals companies Merck was 481st in the index thanks to a 30 per cent fall in its share price but much better for the biotechnology sector.The winner, with a gain of 213.8 per cent, was Autodesk, the world's leading supplier of computer-aided design software for personal computers.The loser, with a decline of almost 50 per cent, was Ciena, the loss-making optical telecommunications equipment maker whose customers are still extremely cautious.
1017;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T04:00:28+0000;Old foes share common ground;;"Have pressure groups gone soft on business? Activists who once resorted to open confrontation to make their point now talk to companies behind the scenes or take their money to set up joint projects to tackle social and environmental problems.Even Greenpeace - the environmental campaign group that won instant recognition because of its assault on Royal Dutch Shell over the planned sinking of the Brent Spar oil platform nearly a decade ago - speaks a more conciliatory language about business today. The old view of companies as uniformly bad was ""a big missed opportunity"", says Stephen Tindale, executive director of Greenpeace UK.The group has entered several alliances in the past few years with companies such as Unilever, the consumer goods multinational, and NPower, one of the UK's biggest electricity suppliers.""We think [alliances] are essential to unlocking progress,"" says Mr Tindale. ""The more unusual the alliance, the more effective it is likely to be. Greenpeace is interested in who has the power to make change, rather than simply being an outside group and protesting.""Greenpeace is in good company. Oxfam's UK arm recently joined forces with Starbucks, the global coffee retail chain, on a project to encourage sustainable coffee production in Ethiopia. Chiquita, the US banana giant once criticised for poor environmental and labour practices, has changed the way it does business with help from conservationists at Rainforest Alliance.""It's amazing how rapidly these partnerships have become accepted on all sides,"" says John Elkington, who chairs SustainAbility, an international consultancy, and has worked in this area for 30 years.Meanwhile, a host of other alliances have been formed by charities and development agencies that have traditionally been less averse to working with the private sector. Save the Children, for example, has developed global partnerships with American Express, Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser and Ikea.Behind the rapprochement between business and campaigners lie both realism and necessity. The rationale for companies is clear. Under pressure to restore public trust, they see partnerships as a way to gain credibility and demonstrate transparency. Harnessing the local expertise of development agencies is also useful to them in understanding new market opportunities in developing countries.From the agencies' perspective, companies offer money, technology and influence on a scale that many feel they could not achieve on their own or with govern ments. ""The intergovernmental system is not delivering through regulatory approaches. NGOs are now turning to market forces as a catalyst for change,"" writes Claude Martin, executive director of WWF, in ""A Business Guide to Development Actors"", a report by the International Business Leaders Forum and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.Another factor oiling the wheels of partnerships is the movement of people with campaign or research backgrounds into the private sector. Francis Sullivan, director of conservation at WWF-UK division, joined HSBC this year on secondment as an adviser, with a brief that includes furthering links with ""environmentally interested parties"".Scott Keillor, head of corporate social responsibility and communications at Starbucks UK, started out as a research ecologist. Charlotte Grezo, director of corporate responsibility at Vodafone, is an environmental biologist who formed links with campaign groups while working on climate change and biodiversity at BP.Is the growth in partnerships unequivocally positive? Deborah Doane, who chairs the Core coalition of campaigners pressing for mandatory corporate reporting on environmental and social performance, thinks not. She says there is a danger that alliances can give a misleading impression of progress. International partnerships to tackle supply chain standards, for example, do not address the underlying problem of low prices. She argues that companies always have the upper hand. ""NGOs have felt that over the last few years, in some of the broader partnerships, their names have been used for PR purposes.""Mr Elkington says there are other risks for campaign groups entering alliances. They may find that, once their expertise has been used, they are gradually squeezed out by others, including companies themselves and social entrepreneurs, who can operate without the constraints of having a large number of donors or members to please. ""Others will learn to do the NGO thing, not necessarily in the NGO format,"" he says.But companies also run risks in working with non-profit groups that can gain an insight into their weak points and use this to sharpen their campaigns.To prove durable, alliances need to produce their intended benefits. ""We need some dramatically successful partnerships,"" says Mr Elkington. He cites as positive examples Anglo American's work with loveLife, the South African HIV/Aids prevention programme for young people, and the UK government's Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, backed by some big investors, campaigners and companies, that encourages producer countries to disclose how they use revenues from oil, gas and mining.Without successes, partnerships will create cynicism on both sides. There are usually other campaigners willing to use more radical and aggressive tactics. A case was the hoaxer who pretended in a live interview on BBC World this month to be a spokesman for Dow Chemical announcing a $12bn (£6.3bn) compensation fund for the victims of the Bhopal disaster in India.Mr Elkington believes that partnerships are not suitable for every campaign organisation. ""I'd be horrified if we got to the point where every NGO was in bed with one or more companies. There's no question that it dilutes their capacity really to drive change through the media or the public mind. They become civilised and domesticated to some degree.""Christian Aid, a church-backed agency, avoids alliances with big international companies, although it has a partnership with the UK's Co-operative Bank, which has carved a niche as an ethical financial institution.Partnerships with multinationals are too risky, says Andrew Pendleton, head of trade policy at the charity, which published a scathing report about corporate social responsibility this year. ""We don't want to do anything which is going to limit our ability to be critical."" he says. ""There's nothing wrong with the adversarial approach when it's necessary, and it sometimes is - some of the corporate responsibility agenda is disingenuous.""Mr Pendleton says many of Christian Aid's supporters distrust big business. Greenpeace, on the other hand, says a survey of its supporters showed that they generally wanted more co-operation with business, even though some have opposed its corporate alliances. Mr Tindale of Greenpeace believes non-profit groups will in future be divided between those that take corporate donations and those that co-operate with companies but eschew any financial relationship.He says Greenpeace's key to retaining independence lies in refusing corporate funding, receiving no profits from joint ventures such as its renewable energy initiative with NPower and working with companies on single projects rather than endorsing all they do.""The big players have access to capital and can do things quicker and on a bigger scale,"" he says, explaining the choice of Unilever and NPower as partners. ""We use the judo-throw analogy: you use the weight of your opponent to achieve your objective.""GUIDELINES TO MAKE COMPANY-CAMPAIGN GROUP TIE-UPS WORKIf companies and pressure groups are to co-operate successfully, they must first be sure there is an overlap in what they do, says Andrew Wilson, director of the Centre for Business and Society at the UK-based Ashridge business school, which works with companies on building partnerships.They should set out clear goals from the start, recognise the different strengths each partner brings, and prepare an exit strategy. Other recommendations from companies and NGOs involved in partnerships include:• Draw up a memo of understanding specifying the objectives and making clear that each side remains free to speak out about the other.• Ensure that the partnership has complete backing from the top of the organisation.• Start with a trial period if the alliance is ground-breaking or particularly risky.• Once established, be prepared to stick with the partnership for some years to achieve the desired objectives.• Be as rigorous and professional as in any business alliance.• Work hard to build trust and transparency.Read other articles in this series here"
1018;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2004-12-07T20:11:39Z;Why ethical conduct is stuck in a corporate ghetto;;"Corporate social responsibility has never been more prominent on the corporate agenda. It is the subject of hundreds of articles in the business press and a favourite topic at meetings of the World Economic Forum. Yet the broad view from civil society is that business's performance on CSR - which is fundamentally about the obligations of a company to society, and the many ways in which it can affect society and the environment for good or ill - has never been worse.Businesses that have expressed a strong commitment to CSR have become the target of more attacks, not fewer. Christian Aid, in a report published this year (Behind the Mask: The Real Face of Corporate Social Responsibility), says Shell is at the ""forefront of CSR"" and yet its case studies on Shell and others lead it to conclude that ""the corporate world's commitments to responsible behaviour are not borne out by the experience of many who are supposed to benefit from them"".For all the attention to CSR, with few exceptions the only group that has seen any substantial benefit appears to be the ""CSR alchemists"", the industry of consultants who promise CSR to all comers. Even tobacco companies, whose products are a leading cause of preventable death, make prominent references to CSR in corporate literature.CSR in most companies is in a ghetto: it is a marginalised and marginal activity, often left to a dedicated department with the task of getting the message out about a company's good works. The amount spent on CSR initiatives generally pales in comparison with marketing budgets; in some cases, more is spent on touting the good works than on doing them. One of the main aims is to build goodwill as a sort of insurance policy to be redeemed in case something goes badly wrong in the main part of the business. But the social effects of these core business operations are left largely unexamined.One reason for ineffectual responses to the pressures for CSR is that companies misunderstand society's expectations and how they change relative to the scale of companies and to that of business as a whole. Consider the challenges faced by Wal-Mart, not least in opening new stores, as it has grown to become America's leading retailer and largest employer. While attention to the basics - providing products and services that people need and creating employment - has remained a necessary condition for public approbation, it is no longer sufficient.The scope of demands is ever-increasing, reflecting the diminished role - and declining expectations - of government, as well the increased power of business. Take the pharmaceutical industry. The donation of drugs to the needy is no longer enough. Pharmaceutical companies are under pressure to slash prices on drugs for developing countries, which poses a severe challenge to the industry's business model.How are companies to respond? If they are not to be overwhelmed by the rising tide of expectations, they will have to move CSR out of the ghetto and make it mainstream. No company has got it right yet, but some are coming close. In October, Oxfam UK announced a collaboration with a multinational company, with Starbucks contributing £100,000 and advice to Oxfam's rural development programme in an extremely poor region of Ethiopia that produces high-quality coffee. There is risk for both parties, but also significant potential benefits for Ethiopia's long-suffering coffee farmers, as well as Oxfam and Starbucks. If the initiative can be scaled up, it could have real impact.Other examples include Hindustan Lever's efforts to reach rural populations in India, Toyota's hybrid car project and Rio Tinto's adoption of the precautionary principle in environmental risk management. Root-and-branch change has yet to come, but what is different is that these businesses see identifying and fulfilling societal expectations as crucial to their business model. They are not pursuing business as usual, with some CSR initiative clumsily bolted on. In many cases, this means rediscovering the sense of purpose that the founders of these companies had. Indeed, companies such as Coca-Cola and McDonald's might have a very different social impact today if their founders were still at the helm.There is no easy way for companies to meet society's expectations. But they will get nowhere as long as they think of CSR as something separate from their core business activities. In that sense, closing down the CSR department would be a good first step towards true social responsibility.Craig Smith is associate dean of the full-time MBA programme at London Business School.

The Nasdaq Composite inched up 0.2 per cent to 2,143.07.Traders had one eye on Friday's key jobs report and were also hoping for upbeat news from Intel after the close.Just under two stocks declined for every stock that gained at the New York Stock Exchange, where 1.7bn shares traded by the closing bell. At the Nasdaq, the gaining issues and the losing stocks were just about evenly split.Data showing that the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week appeared to weigh on sentiment. However, traders and investors were expected to focus on Friday's monthly job creation figures for a clearer insight into the US labour market, whose erratic trends have vexed market watchers this year.In other economic news, factory orders rose more than economists had expected in October, helped by defence expenditures.Stocks continued to receive support from a steadily declining oil price. Nymex WTI futures lost more than $2 on Friday morning after a drop of more than 7 per cent on Wednesday that eased concerns about economic growth and bolstered bulls' hopes for a year-end rally.Airline stocks were broadly higher on Thursday as the falling price of oil eased cost concerns. The Amex airline index climbed 3.6 per cent.AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, led gainers, rising 9.1 per cent to $10.70. Northwest Airlines rose 3.1 per cent to $11.32 and Delta Air Lines was 8.2 per cent higher at $7.90.Chris Watling, managing director at Longview Economics, said he expected the current rally in the S&P 500 to last through the first quarter. ""Beyond that, we expect equities to struggle next year as the corporate profit outlook worsens relative to current expectations, and as valuation pressure increases from a rising real interest rate, a worsening equity volatility trend and a diminishing profit growth outlook,"" he said.An improving economic picture could also lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again when it meets later this month.Intel fell 1.7 per cent to $22.71 ahead of its mid-quarter trading update, due after the close. The world's largest chipmaker was widely expected to raise earnings guidance.Shares in Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's chief rival, closed flat at $22.62. Semiconductors led Wednesday's rally and Mr Pado said this increased the pressure on the sector, especially on Intel.Some technology investors have warned that the sector has not adjusted to sluggish demand. Others have said the market was unprepared for higher interest rates and a possible dollar crisis. Stocks have largely ignored the greenback's latest decline.A host of retailers reported monthly same-store sales that painted a gloomy picture for the sector ahead of its vital Christmas shopping season.Albertsons, the grocer, slipped 6.1 per cent to $24.20 in spite of the retailer revealing higher quarterly profits boosted by stronger sales.Wet Seal, the clothing chain, said sales at stores open at least one year fell nearly 20 per cent in November. The company's shares rose 2.4 per cent to $1.68.Pier 1 Imports, the home goods retailer, fell 2.2 per cent to $18.30 after the company's earnings guidance disappointed investors. Same-store sales also fell as stagnant demand forced the imported furniture store to cut prices.Cendant, the travel and real estate group, slipped 1.2 per cent to $23.14 after it announced that it was set to buy Ebookers, the UK online travel group, in a deal worth at least $415m.Starbucks jumped 1.9 per cent to $58.65 as the world's biggest coffee chain unveiled same-store sales growth of 13 per cent in November.Away from the retail sector, Juniper Networks, the telecommunications equipment maker, edged higher after Scott Kriens, chief executive, said the company was considering using its $1.5bn cash pile to make acquisitions. Shares in Juniper rose 1.5 per cent to $28.70."
1020;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2004-11-26T18:35:59Z;A political operation;;"The presidential Boeing takes off from Lima’s military airport, rising, after a slight delay, from among the Russian helicopters. In her cabin, panelled in dark wood, Eliane Toledo, Peru’s First Lady, sprays herself with a repellent against the violent mosquitoes of the Amazon. Behind us is the capital, which for most of the year is enveloped in a fog that rolls in from the ocean and settles on its 7 million inhabitants, on its wide boulevards, on its Starbucks cafes above its McDonald’s eateries, on its shops barred like small jails against burglars. Ahead of us are the provinces, about one and a quarter million square kilometres of jungle, mountains and rivers. Soon the peaks of the Andes will fill the windows of the aeroplane.The First Lady, who was born in Belgium, has lived in the US, in Paris, on a kibbutz in Israel, and also among the indigenous people of Peru. She speaks Hebrew with two Israeli doctors who are with her on the aeroplane, and with one of her husband’s advisers. The wild Peruvian press, which under Alejandro Toledo is enjoying renewed freedom, sometimes calls the adviser “the mystery man”. He is Avi Dan On, formerly of Mossad. About 50 years old, he is a bit younger than the president, at whose side he has been since 2000, when Toledo began his rise towards the presidency on a wave of popular support. That year two and a half million Peruvians took to the streets in huge demonstrations, addressed by Toledo. A poor, indigenous Peruvian like themselves - who had pulled himself up by his sandal straps from a family of 16 children to become a professor in the US - had returned to save them using a World Bank plan. And his beautiful wife, from the same fairytale as Eva Peron, also spoke to them in their language. It seemed at the time as if a miracle had occurred. But now the people are disgruntled again because their hopes for rapid change have been disappointed. There are also allegations of corruption, which the government denies.Now Eliane Toledo hopes to find a way to assuage the popular bitterness, to show the people how concerned her husband is for their welfare. She is bringing the two foreign doctors to the jungle, in a “Campaign to Bring Back the Smile” in the small town of Pucallpa. The doctors, Eyal Winkler and Yigal Shochat, have been friends since their days in the Israeli Air Force. Six years ago they started flying, at their own expense, to operating rooms in remote places in Nepal, Vietnam and Peru, to perform mainly cleft-palate surgery on children. In the rich world, it is done early and effectively. In the poor world, where ignorance and stigma get in the way, it often falls to volunteer doctors such as Winkler and Shochat with their scalpels, forceps and nylon thread. Even in places of little means, a swift but life-changing medical procedure can correct fate.Winkler calls his trip “charging the spiritual batteries”. A man of 43, of average height and like a spring in constant motion, he is a specialist in the repair of severe injuries to victims of fires and terror attacks, but he is also much in demand for beautifying women. He makes breasts larger and smaller and makes flabby skin taut. Shochat, a tall, handsome man of about 60, is as lean as a Giacometti figure. He is a fighter pilot who lost a leg when his Phantom aircraft was shot down over the Suez Canal in 1970. While Winkler also prospers in his private clinic, Shochat makes the rounds of besieged Palestinian villages as a volunteer. He has been shunned by the Air Force ever since he wrote in protest against the use of fighter planes for bombings in the Palestinian territories.Waiting on the ground, 890km from Lima, at the small Pucallpa airport, are a band, a mustachioed provincial governor and six village dancers who begin to caper when they see the First Lady emerging from the aircraft with her mane of honey-coloured hair. Her bodyguards, unsmiling young women more loyal than any man, form a circle around her for fear of assassins. But the president’s wife runs forward in the pilot’s jacket that bears her name, Eliane, smiling.It is very hot and Pucallpa is a town of tin roofs, mud and statues of dead dictators. In the morning, a storm washes over the hot city. Night and day in the torrid air there is the metallic clatter of hundreds of bicycle-drawn rickshaws. The river is close. The rain forest encircles the city. Lonely Planet describes Pucallpa as “a jungle town lacking in charm”. In the central plaza a dwarf sells lottery tickets. A blind man plays a flute for his living and typists produce requests to the authorities and love letters on their old typewriters. A man, whose two legs and one arm are amputated, dances on his stumps. No one begs a handout.The First Lady’s motorcade speeds to a hospital where 60 mothers have been waiting for hours. Each of them is clutching a child. They are silent, as though they know that in this play they do not have a speaking part, apart from the plea: “Cure my child of the defect that makes him different from all the rest and determines his fate.” When I look at the rows of children I feel like someone in a story by Gabriel Garcia Marquez who has come to a cursed town. All of the children are leporinos, suffering from harelips. Their lips and palates are slightly or completely cleft, as though someone had cruelly slashed their sweet faces with a stroke of a machete, joining the mouth to the nose so that both of them peek out from behind the cut.”Children with cleft palates don’t have a life here,” says Dr Margarita Cordova. She has come with plastic surgeon Guillermo Wiegering, whose team is working alongside the foreign doctors. “When these children grow up, they don’t have work, they don’t have love and no one marries them. No one wants to see them. If no special delegation like this one comes, no one operates on them. And no one has even checked whether there are more of them here than anywhere else.”In the long corridor outside Room 4 there is already a queue of mothers waiting to sign up for surgery. A young woman stands holding a baby. Her name is Selia Kruz. She is 21 years old and very pretty. Alongside her clear face is the face of her tiny son Rohes, like a nasty joke that nature has played at her expense. “When he came out of my belly, I looked at the baby and I saw something that I didn’t know there was,” she tells me. The local doctor translates. He says in the villages the men believe a cleft palate is a punishment for the mother’s sin, as though she had tried to kill the foetus in her womb. Now little Rohes rests close to his mother’s full breasts and cries ceaselessly because she must not nurse him. If he undergoes surgery today, he must fast for hours so as not to choke under the anaesthetic.I stay there and wait with her. In the torrid corridor the hungry babies are crying. I leave after about an hour and Selia remains to wait. When I return a day later, the doctor tells me he sent her home. “We couldn’t find a fine enough breathing catheter for that age... I told her: maybe in October an American delegation will come.” They said Selia left with her baby without saying a word.Among old steel cabinets, in a green dressing room, I put on clean operating-room clothes and don shoe-covers. I enter the operating room where the ceiling is peeling and the floor is stained with rust from the legs of the operating table. A little boy is already kicking the table with his legs. He is crying. His name is Pedro Ampichi, he is three years old and his palate is deeply cleft. This operation will give him back his smile and straighten the cleft in his lips but the palate itself will not close this time.Taken away from his mother who is waiting outside, lying in the midst of eight strangers, he is upset. Dante, the anaesthesiologist, puts a mask on the child’s face. Gradually the crying ceases. A thin moan, a last kick as he sinks into the deep well of torpor. The window air-conditioning unit has stopped working. It is hot. Pedro’s body is now covered with a green sheet. A strong light from the operating lamp illuminates his face. The nurse bathes his skin with a disinfectant solution and surgeon Winkler injects an anaesthetic into his cleft lips that will also reduce the flow of blood. With a blue pen he draws on the boy’s face lines like a map of rivers to indicate the correction he will make. He shows the drawing to his colleague, Shochat, and the nurse hands him a scalpel. With a swift, unhesitating hand Winkler cuts along the lines into the boy’s flesh. Shochat sutures the severed blood vessels. The child’s face is almost peeled off; his mouth looks like a crimson rose of flesh. Now Winkler starts to sew up the tears in the mouth, shaping it into a straight line, closing the cleft and reconstructing the Cupid’s bow.Shochat stands by the operating table, leaning on his left leg. His right leg is a sophisticated, $20,000 high-mobility prosthesis, made of American joints, an Icelandic silicon sock for his stump and German shock-absorbers. When he parachuted from his burning aircraft, an Egyptian soldier shot him in the leg. On the brink of death, he was returned to Israel, where his leg was amputated. A year later he began to study medicine. It is hard for him to stand for a long time. He has phantom pains in his stump.”Let’s fix his nose,” says Winkler to Shochat. He cuts into the angle of the boy’s nose where the cleft distorted his nostril. He goes on to cut the flesh of the cheek and starts to stitch. Then he hands the needle and the nylon thread to Shochat. When Shochat finishes the stitching, the repair of the boy’s face is completed and Dante brings him back to the world.A short while later Winkler is already cutting into the mouth of a delicately featured girl called Abigail. He corrects the white line of the edges of her lips. Years from now Abigail will kiss with corrected lips that are the result of a chance conjunction between two foreign doctors - in a decision to work for the good of their souls - and a humane-political act by a wife of a president who wants to do good for the people and be loved. When some time in, say, 2012 Abigail kisses, everything that produced her surgery will have been forgotten: only her pretty lips will remain as a souvenir.In the course of four days, 35 children pass through the simple operating rooms in Pucallpa. The local newspaper complains that “Bring Back the Smile” has interfered with the activity of the hospital. The line of mothers is renewed every day. In the morning they bring their children and in the afternoon they soothe their children who are screaming with pain because of the stitches. At night the bus comes to take us to a thank-you dinner at the Navy base on the bank of the Ucayali River. The band is playing. A children’s choir sings us a song. After a few days among the leporino children, when I look at the faces of these children who are singing, I see in astonishment that their faces are whole.Igal Sarna is a journalist based in Tel Aviv and the author of “Broken Promises”, a collection of his journalism (Atlantic Books).

The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.3 per cent to 2,061.27.Trading was heavier than expected after bond markets were closed owing to a federal holiday. Even with one less source of guidance, stock investors traded about 1.4bn shares at the New York stocks Exchange, about the daily average volume for the year.Crude oil futures fell 2.9 per cent and erased most of the gains in the prior session as rising crude inventories offset concerns about possible shortages of heating oil this winter. The perception that Yassir Arafat's death overnight would help prospects for peace in the Middle East further undermined crude prices as supply worries eased.This offered support to stocks following their initially muted reaction to the widely expected interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve, which reiterated its upbeat view of the world's largest economy.The indices have been bound in a narrow range in the past few sessions, with intraday patterns hinting at a tense tug-of-war between bulls and bears. Some traders characterised the action as bullish consolidation.The bulls will be keen to tack on consistent gains following warnings from some market watchers that the current rally faces technical resistance and that several factors threaten to stop it in its tracks in a similar way to other failed rallies earlier this year.Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, attributed much of yesterday morning's gains to the decline in oil prices and the upcoming dividend from Microsoft, set to inject about $30bn in the market.""I think we're coming to the end of it [the current rally] and next year's fundamentals continue to look pretty cloudy,"" Mr Boockvar said.On the corporate front, shares of PeopleSoft eased 1.6 per cent to $22.43 after the company rejected a final takeover bid from Oracle, whose shares edged off 1.8 per cent to $13.14.In other merger-and-acquisition news, Blockbuster launched a $70m offer for Hollywood Entertainment, a rival video rental company. Blockbuster shares were 11.1 per cent higher at $8.20 while Hollywood Entertainment added 11.5 per cent to $10.93.Another deal came in the retail sector, where Jones Apparel Group said it would buy Barney's New York for about $294m. Jones shares lost 3 per cent to $34.91.In the same sector Target edged back 0.2 per cent to $50.78 after the discount retailer reported a 78 per cent rise in quarterly earnings but missed analyst estimates.Among blue-chips, Coca-Cola lost 0.5 per cent to $40.96 after it lowered its long-term earnings and volume forecasts.Shares in rival PepsiCo were up 0.4 per cent at $51.54.Also lower were shares in Starbucks, the coffee house chain, whose 47 per cent rise in quarterly earnings failed to impress the markets. Shares inched up 0.3 per cent to $55.44.Meanwhile, Whole Foods Market saw shares add 9.8 per cent to $94.57 after it reported a 27 per cent increase in quarterly earnings.Among technology stocks, Dell Computer inched up 1.1 per cent to $37.25 ahead of its quarterly results after the close. Agilent Technologies was also due to report results after the bell, and shares gained 2.5 per cent to $25.68.Semiconductor shares saw buying as RF Micro Devices rose 7.6 per cent to $6.69 following an upgrade to ""neutral"" from ""underperform"" by analysts at Credit Suisse First Boston.Meanwhile, Advanced Micro Devices rose 7.5 per cent to $18.59 after Merrill Lynch analysts raised their rating for the stock to ""buy"" from ""neutral"".National Semiconductor shares, up 2.5 per cent to $16.26, defied a downgrade from ""buy"" to ""neutral"" by analysts at UBS.Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, gained 1.4 per cent to $23.17 after it named a new chief executive officer replacing Craig Barrett.A less positive note came from Nortel Networks, whose shares fell 5.9 per cent to $3.37 after the telecommunications equipment group delayed the filing of its quarterly results."
1022;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2004-11-10T21:49:44Z;Wall Street unmoved by Fed’s rate rise;;"US stocks greeted with a yawn the decision on Wednesday by the Federal Reserve to raise benchmark interest rates by a quarter point.As it became apparent that the Fed's assessment of the economy was similar to the previous time, the indices moved into this week's comfort zone on Wall Street: the flat line.By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was barely changed at at 10,385.48, while the broader S&P 500 index was 0.1 per cent lower at 1,162.91. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index edged off 0.4 per cent at 2,034.56, under pressure from a disappointing quarterly earnings report from Cisco Systems.The Fed reiterated its view that even after Wednesday's rate increase ""the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative"". Its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee also reaffirmed its commitment to tightening monetary policy at a ""measured"" pace, barring any changes in the economy that could jeopardise price stability. However, it described inflationary risks as ""well contained"" in both the long and the short term.While Wednesday's rate increase was expected, economists are now debating whether the Fed will repeat it in December, or pause its current cycle of titghtening.Rory Robertson, interest rates strategist at Macquarie, said last week's blockbuster job creation data ""have made the need for the pause in December less obvious"".François Trahan, chief investment strategist at Bear Stearns, agreed that ""a tighter labour market only increases the likelihood of more Fed tightenings"" and pushed the thesis further, noting that ""future hikes can only compound the problem for stocks in 2005"".Mr Trahan sees the monetary policy outlook as one of several challenges faced by the US equity market. Another is technical resistance for the S&P 500 index at the 1,160 level. The mix of factors causes him to conclude: ""We expect the equity market rally of the past few weeks to go the way of previous ones and run out of steam shortly.""Meanwhile William Livesey, the chief technical analyst at CyberTrader, cautioned that recent intraday trading moves point to the end of a trend for stocks. ""If the market doesn't show some life soon the recent rally may be in trouble,"" he said.Crude oil futures rose after weekly data on petroleum inventories showed a rise in crude oil inventories but a decline in distillate products such as heating oil. The data raised the possibility of another run-up in oil prices amid fears of a shortage of heating oil as winter approaches.The US government reported that the US trade deficit narrowed more than expected last month.Shares in Cisco Systems lost 6.6 per cent to $18.44 after the networking company reported in-line quarterly earnings and its forecasts disappointed some analysts.Shares in Advanced Medical Optics fell 8.6 per cent to $38.80 after the medical device maker agreed to buy Visx,whose shares soared 34.5 per cent to $24.36. Both companies specialise in eye care devices such as vision-correction lasers.The fall-out from the global withdrawal of Vioxx by Merck continued, with reports that a similar drug made by Pfizer caused similar negative side-effects. Shares in Pfizer eased 1.9 per cent to $27.47. However, Merck added 1.5 per cent to $26.41 and was among the leading gainers on the Dow.Among internet-related stocks, Yahoo was off 1 per cent at $36.66 while Google edged off 0.5 per cent to $167.86 amid news that a competing search service from Microsoft will be previewed this week. Microsoft shares were off 0.1 per cent to $29.73 by the close.Hewlett-Packard shares lost 3.7 per cent to $18.97 and those of Dell Computer were 1.6 per cent lower at $36.85 after analysts at UBS lowered their rating for the two stocks to ""neutral"".D.R. Horton shares put on 0.1 per cent to $31.80 after the housebuilder reported quarterly results that beat expectations as its profits rose 52 per cent.Federated Department Stores shares put on 0.1 per cent to $53.85 after the owner of the popular Macy's and Bloomingdale's department stores reported quarterly results that exceeded estimates and gave an upbeat view of sales trends.Starbucks shares advanced 0.9 per cent to $55.29 ahead of the coffee house chain's quarterly results due after the close."
1023;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2004-10-18T19:47:11Z;Notebook;;"Starbucks grades with lots of frothNestling among the many varied proposals to reform Britain's examination system set out on Monday by Mike Tomlinson is one to extend the grades at A level to include two extra marks of A+ and A++. This, the former chief inspector of schools explains, will differentiate between the excellent and the merely good.Students will be offered the once in a lifetime chance to answer additional optional questions in their exams to save markers from making hard choices about the merit of each entrant. Perish the thought that a student be denied an A grade simply because he could not actually distinguish the letter A from the rest of the alphabet.It must have been an act of heroic self-restraint not to suggest that A be made the basic pass mark and all higher grades be super-starred variants of the same. He could have opted for raising the standards for each of the existing grades, but this would have gone against the validation culture in Britain today in which no one and nothing can be less than good.Rumour has it that Mr Tomlinson's first thoughts were modelled directly on the Starbucks system, which would have seen traditional grades for A level swept away and replaced with tall, grande and venti.Another proposal that was given early consideration was to keep but embellish the existing five grades. A talented pupil might leave school with a super-double-plus-good A in maths, a fab-triple-groovy A in physics and a B-but-so-close-to-an-A in English.Unfortunately, university admissions chiefs complained that this might have become overcomplicated. “It was very difficult trying to remember if a double-starred-supercharged-twincam A was better than a volcanic-triple-wow-choc-chip A with hundreds and thousands” said one.Hence the drearily mundane A+ and A++. Would it not be simpler to just publish the student's actual mark? There are apparently legalistic reasons not to publish individual percentage scores but no such argument can be made against revealing within which band or decile they fell. A student would get an A grade and a banding of 75 to 80 per cent, or 70 to 80 per cent. That way universities and employers would know the true value of a mark.Examinations serve two purposes. They show that a certain standard of achievement has been met and they offer a comparison between students. If extra questions and grades are needed to meet the second condition then the tests cannot be doing their job.When people go into one of those shops that sizes its portions from huge all the way up to ginormous, do they consider themselves truly blessed to receive such bounteousness or do they merely scoff at the preposterous devaluation of language? Likewise with exam grades; the answer would seem to lie not with ever more hyperbolic grades but in matching, once again, the description to expectation.Boris bows downOn Tuesday Boris Johnson, editor of The Spectator, MP for Henley, Tory spokesman on culture, general good egg and TV star, will head up to Liverpool to apologise for a contentious editorial in his magazine.Jealous souls looking forward to the “humbling of Boris” will probably be disappointed. He will take his Scouse kicking in good spirits and carry it off with his usual blustery aplomb.The article criticised Liverpudlians for wallowing in victim status and blaming everyone else for their misfortunes, before moving on to lament this tendency across society. It was strong stuff, but that is what magazines like The Spectator are for. No one reading the article could have doubted that it would give offence. It clearly set out to stir up debate.Mr Johnson is not heading north because he deeply wants to say sorry in person but because he was ordered to do so by his party leader, Michael Howard. Rather than defend the freedom of his magazine, Mr Johnson has knuckled under in an apparent desire not to lose his shadow ministerial post. Even so, some are still calling for him to be sacked from the front bench.Yet no one seems to be calling for him to resign as editor of The Spectator. Almost all agree he has done a good job in that role. He has raised the magazine's circulation and profile.But the editor of a national magazine is now publicly to grovel over one of its articles simply because the leader of the opposition didn't care for it.Mr Johnson is not the first editor to become a Conservative MP and, for a long time, he has managed brilliantly to juggle his two careers. But in bowing down to Mr Howard's edict he has put his political ambition over his journalistic independence.Whatever the rights and wrongs of the offending article, editors cannot put themselves at the beck and call of politicians. Are future editions of The Spectator to be pre-read by Conservative Central Office?The choice between the two careers was one Mr Johnson was going to have to make sooner or later. However, by taking orders from his political leader on what his magazine may acceptably publish, the fact is that he has now made it.robert.shrimsley@ft.com"
1024;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2004-10-13T20:57:12Z;Starbucks tastes Oxfam's brew;;"Ethiopia is the reputed birthplace of coffee. It is also the land where famine killed nearly 1m people 20 years ago, haunting western consciences as never before. So it is apt that Oxfam's UK arm should choose a coffee-growing region of Ethiopia as the focus of its first collaboration with a multinational company, in the shape of Starbucks, the world's largest coffee retail chain.The pilot venture will see Starbucks UK contribute £100,000 to Oxfam's rural development programme in the East Hararge region, where farmers battle with poverty and drought in their efforts to produce high-quality Arabica coffee.The money will be spent on improving irrigation, providing seeds and tools and running women's literacy programmes. Starbucks experts will also offer advice on improving coffee yields and quality, and on strengthening the growers' marketing co-operative. In the UK, Starbucks and Oxfam will share ideas on tackling the world coffee crisis that is destroying the livelihoods of millions of farmers in developing countries.The agreement, initially for just a year, emerged after months of dialogue. ""There was a mutual realisation that by working together we could achieve more than by working alone,"" says Scott Keiller, Starbucks UK's head of corporate social responsibility and communications.There can be pitfalls as well as benefits in alliances between campaigning organisations and large companies. Campaigners may find their name being used as a form of endorsement and companies can look bad if the alliance falls apart.Is it risky for a high-profile organisation such as Oxfam GB to join forces with the ubiquitous Starbucks brand? Perhaps, but the company sees only opportunities, not risks. Cathy Heseltine, Starbucks UK marketing director, says: ""I think we're a very positive, optimistic company - some might say naive - and I think that drives us to make sure things like this work.""Oxfam has criticised big coffee buyers such as Nestlé, Kraft and Sara Lee for doing too little to tackle the five-year-old crisis over the world coffee price, which has fallen to half its former level. It describes as ""a relatively small step"" the voluntary code agreed last month between producers and leading coffee companies to improve working conditions and environmental standards in the market.Against this background, Phil Bloomer, head of Oxfam's Make Trade Fair campaign and previously responsible for its UK coffee campaign, is aware his organisation could come under attack for ""selling out"". ""There are various risks for us, none of which are anywhere near the size of the opportunity we would see,"" he says. ""In this case, there is a risk of the perception of our independence being compromised.""Central to the Oxfam-Starbucks agreement is that each side will remain free to speak about the other. ""It is clear in the memorandum of understanding that, with justification, we'll criticise Starbucks and its policies in its supply chain,"" says Mr Bloomer. ""We hope Starbucks will continue to improve its own supply chain. If it were to go backwards, we can say: 'This is a retrograde step.' We're very clear that our independence is as intact as before we signed the memorandum of understanding.""Another sensitivity is that the international Oxfam network is a confederation of national affiliates with different priorities. Oxfam America formed a partnership two years ago with Starbucks, the Ford Foundation and a growers' co-operative in Mexico to help small-scale farmers increase supplies of quality Fair Trade coffee. But some affiliates prefer to stick to campaigning.So Oxfam GB has gone to some lengths to ensure that its partners in the confederation, in the Fair Trade movement and in the campaigning global alliance on coffee and commodities understand the nature of its relationship with Starbucks.""We have told all our Oxfam affiliates and they all said, 'We don't have a problem with that',"" says Mr Bloomer. Oxfam will continue to campaign for fair trade in coffee and to fight against ""rigged rules and double standards"" in world trade, he adds.Links with Starbucks began two and a half years ago when Oxfam GB approached leading coffee-buying companies about its planned coffee campaign. ""We had quiet conversations over a year-plus, during which time Oxfam were doing a lot of investigation of us, [talking to] people intimately involved in our coffee sourcing,"" says Ms Heseltine.Mr Bloomer adds: ""We noticed that Starbucks was interested in dialogue, kept that dialogue going and gave us a lot more analysis than most companies. Out of that, we said: 'Let's make it a more substantial collaboration'.""Oxfam decided Starbucks was a suitable collaborator because it had developed long-term contracts for some producers, expanded its Fair Trade purchases - although last year these accounted for just 1 to 2 per cent of all the coffee it buys - and put in place purchasing guidelines that stipulate the quality and social and environmental standards farmers must meet in return for better terms. The company pays an average of $1.20 a pound, about double the market price of commodity coffee, for the high-quality Arabica beans that it uses.""Starbucks has a very strong record in corporate social responsibility in terms of its supply chain,"" says Mr Bloomer. ""We share a sufficient number of common goals for this to become a useful collaboration.""He stresses that it is not the aim of the collaboration to provide an entry for Starbucks into a key coffee-growing region, although its involvement in the development programme ""may provide it with an advantage"". According to Ms Heseltine, the Harrar coffee produced in this part of eastern Ethiopia is ""fantastic"", but supplies are erratic. ""When it's there, we buy it.""How will the success of the venture be measured? Oxfam plans to carry out a baseline socioeconomic survey, including factors such as the level of women's literacy and the amount of irrigated land. As the project progresses, it will measure improvements, for example in women's participation in civil society. More sustained and higher-quality coffee production, providing growers with higher prices, will also indicate progress.Some campaign groups remain wary of business but many are now working with companies. Mr Keiller, an ecology graduate who worked for the Kingfisher retail group before joining Starbucks, believes this is partly down to the individuals involved. ""There's a cohort of people that have come from the same backgrounds, and share the same passions and beliefs, going into NGOs [non-governmental organisations] and into businesses they admire.""Ms Heseltine argues that campaigners are learning the benefits of using carrots as well as sticks in their dealings with business. ""I think there's an element of growing up going on, by both sides, and a greater degree of understanding. It's not just about constantly picking out the bad things.""As for Mr Bloomer, he says: ""We want to maintain a constructive and critical relationship with Starbucks. We hope they'll challenge us and we know we'll continue to challenge them.""WEBSITES FAIL TO LINK FINANCE DATA AND CSRMany large companies still do not have links on their websites between their financial data and their social and environmental programmes, a survey has found.Only 44 of the FTSE 100 companies, and 26 of the FTSE 250, provide direct links from their annual report or investor-relations pages to sections of the website dedicated to corporate social responsibility, says the survey by CTN, a communications company.“Given that investor-relations executives are now acknowledging the business case for CSR, it might be expected that communicating a company’s policies and achievements would figure large in the IR section of websites. This was not the case,” says Richard Coope, head of the CSR practice at CTN.This is despite growing interest from investorsin companies’ social and environmental performance. Mr Coope says: “Producing financial and non-financial info rmation online is likely to be a key requirement from the Operating and Financial Review in the UK.” The OFR is part of proposed changes to company law.The CSR Online survey also looked at Fortune 100 companies and found only two - Coca-Cola and Johnson Johnson - with clear links from their investor pages to CSR information."
1025;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:15:58+0000;Forbidden City opens door to West;;When executives from Richemont, the European luxury goods group, were looking for a way to promote their brands in China, they hit on an unusual solution: to put them on display in Beijing's Forbidden City.The nearly 600-year-old palace complex, which was home to 24 Chinese emperors, has little to do with Swiss watches, one of the group's main product lines. But for Richemont, as for a growing number of international companies, the Forbidden City offered a uniquely Chinese setting to show off its wares. The group's exhibition of 600 watches opened this week.Foreign corporations, keen to ingratiate themselves with China's increasingly wealthy consumers, are stumping up money to be associated with historic Chinese monuments.American Express has been donating money to the Forbidden City since 1987 to pay for trilingual signs and restoration. Its name is now prominently displayed on markers introducing many of the individual palaces inside the walls. Coffee giant Starbucks opened a branch inside the Forbidden City in late 2000.“The number of foreign companies interested in sponsoring events or filming commercials here is increasing,” said Liu Yanmin, an official in the Palace Museum, the other name for the complex.Chinese companies have long sought to link their names to cultural monuments. The Great Wall is used to advertise everything from toothpaste to paint. Every box of Zhonghua cigarettes is adorned with a picture of the Forbidden City.In reality, the Forbidden City is hardly the most economic or convenient place to promote products. Organising an exhibition there can take a long time because it requires permission from so many layers of officialdom. The museum is also understood to charge significantly more than modern facilities.“You might think it's expensive but the price is acceptable to the big, high-quality international organisations that show interest in having events in the Forbidden City,” Ms Liu says.Others argue that the museum is profiting handsomely from foreign companies. “All the brands in the world are talking about cost management, cost controls. And yet when they move to China, they are like kids. They are so excited. Money is not really an issue,” one foreign executive says.Marketing executives are divided about the effectiveness of using Chinese historic monuments as a promotional strategy.“These big glorious monuments can also reinforce an image of stability and reliability,” says Tom Doctoroff, area director for north-east Asia at J Walter Thompson in Shanghai. “It's a cliche but some cliches work.”“Why would you want to borrow from such a cultural icon as the Forbidden City or the Great Wall if you are a foreign brand?” asks Stephen Drummond, regional planning director at Lowe, the marketing group, in Shanghai. “You can get yourself into a lot of trouble overtly borrowing from Chinese heritage.”Some companies have already done so. Toyota Motor had to write a letter of apology to its Chinese customers last December after one of its adverts sparked controversy.The advert depicted a traditional Chinese lion carved out of stone saluting a Toyota sports utility vehicle, with the slogan “you have to pay respect to it”.According to the state-owned media, the lion reminded some internet chat-room users of those along the Marco Polo Bridge in Beijing, the site of a 1937 clash between Japanese and Chinese troops that triggered the Sino-Japanese war.Richemont, at least, is unlikely to cause much controversy with its display of watches. For added measure, the group is offering the services of its watch craftsmen free to the Palace Museum.
1026;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T06:26:00+0000;Richard Tomkins: No beauty under the kitchen sink;;"If you thought Starbucks coffee was over-hyped and over-priced, wait until you hear what is happening in the once-mundane world of dishwashing liquid, laundry detergent and other household cleaners.""Washing the dishes. Doing the laundry. Cleaning your living space. Every day, we're faced with tasks that we must do no matter what,"" a US company called The Thymes tells us on its website. ""But imagine feeling a sense of well-being and satisfaction while taking on these household chores, elevating what was once simply unpleasant to its most pleasurable.""As it happens, I long ago discovered that the Zen art of ironing could be a path to higher planes of consciousness. On the other hand, I have always struggled to get off on washing the dishes. What on earth could turn such a chore into a pleasure?The answer, it turns out, is Mandarin Coriander Dishwashing Liquid for the Sink. ""Satisfying our senses as much as our desire for cleanliness,"" The Thymes says, ""Mandarin Coriander is a squeaky-clean blend of sweet herbs, zesty citrus and skin-conditioning botanicals that lifts your spirits while effectively cleaning and deodorising.""There is more - much more. The Thymes offers laundry detergent, floor cleaner, all-purpose surface cleaner and many other products, not just in mandarin coriander flavour but in cedarwood mint. And it is only one of several US companies now selling lavishly packaged, sweet-smelling, environment-friendly cleaners at fancy prices. (Ounce for ounce, The Thymes's dishwashing liquid, at $9 a bottle, costs about four times as much as Procter & Gamble's Dawn.)Caldrea - ""a new company completely devoted to making your household chores more enjoyable"" - sells Sweet Pea Laundry Detergent, Green Tea Patchouli Automatic Dishwashing Liquid and Citrus Mint Ylang Ylang Toilet Polish. Mrs Meyer's Clean Day sells a range of ""aromatherapeutic"" products whose packaging affects a curious retro look, as if household cleaners always used to be this way. In contrast, Method takes a contemporary approach with its pointedly ungrammatical ""people against dirty"" slogan, slick designer packaging and heavy emphasis on saving the planet.Why would anyone want to pay high prices for luxury versions of such banal, commodity products? According to The Thymes: ""Beauty, not superficial beauty but true beauty, lies in the small details of life."" Caldrea says it started up because it did not see why keeping home had to be dull and unimaginative. ""We were craving an experience, an art form.""Hitherto, of course, household cleaners were products you hid under the sink. With the possible exception of mousetraps, cocktail sticks and coal, there were few goods that commanded a lower level of consumer interest. But now, the big companies are showing tentative signs of following the entrepreneurs' lead in trying to take the category up-market. In Britain, Unilever recently launched an aloe vera version of its Persil laundry detergent and P&G extended its Fairy brand of dishwashing liquid by launching Fairy Naturals in eucalyptus, lime and lemongrass and tea-tree, orange and lemon variants.Like other trends, this one is producing a new vocabulary. Where once cleaners were new and improved, now they are authentic and natural. Where once they contained bleaches and enzymes, now they are botanical and nutrient-rich. Where once they washed whiter, now they are fragrant and satisfying.At this point, I had been about to ask whether I was alone in wanting to throw up. Then, on my way home, I passed a building clad in scaffolding, every piece of which had been carefully enveloped in decorative pink sponge. Even the bolts connecting the pipework had been encased in gaily contrasting yellow plastic caps, presumably to stop them snagging the clothing of careless passers-by.""You know what,"" I told myself. ""You have this all wrong. Every day, and in every way, life really is getting more beautiful.""Then I came to my senses.Admittedly, the Model T Ford, available only in black, was an effective means of transport but that did not stop people desiring more attractive and comfortable cars when they became available. And recently, rising prosperity has produced demand for affordable luxuries across the spectrum - not just in traditionally expensive categories such as cars, watches and jewellery but in coffee, food, clothing, consumer electronics, kitchen equipment and so on.The difference is that, when you pay more for a premium product, you usually get some benefit: either something that works or tastes better or an object so aesthetically pleasing that it is a joy to own and behold. But while Mandarin Coriander Dishwashing Liquid for the Sink sounds much more delicious than P&G's Dawn, it is hard to imagine that it cleans dishes any better; and while Andy Warhol may have succeeded in turning Campbell's Soup cans into pop art, the notion that a bottle of detergent could qualify as a thing of beauty - ""not superficial beauty but true beauty"" - offends every aesthetic bone in my body.People may waste their money on what they will, but my earnest hope for the future of civilisation is that they will buy the cheapest cleaning product that performs its task effectively and use the money saved to buy a book of poetry. Yes, beauty exists in the small details of life but not in the sink or the dishwasher; nor can it be manufactured and put in a bottle. As for Citrus Mint Ylang Ylang Toilet Polish . . . well, I can think of no better place for it.richard.tomkins@ft.com"
1027;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2004-08-27T20:47:12Z;Wall St slows to a crawl as convention looms;;Like a ghost train in a rainy night, Wall Street stocks moved ahead this week but hardly anyone was there to see it happen.Trading volumes were positively torpid and reached new lows for the year at the New York Stock Exchange during the week. “We'll need a cattle prod to reach 1bn shares today,” said one trader yesterday, and his view was vindicated when 847m shares exchanged hands at the Big Board.While a few stocks received some attention, the broader market edged modestly higher.By Friday's close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent higher at 10,195.01, or 0.8 per cent higher for the week. The S&P 500 index added 0.2 per cent to 1,107.77 on Friday and was 0.9 per cent higher for the week. The Nasdaq Composite put on 0.5 per cent to 1,862.08, for a weekly showing of 1.3 per cent to the upside.Many market watchers said the torpor was set to continue and worsen next week, when the Republican party holds its quadrennial national convention in New York's Madison Square Garden arena, above the railway station where trains from Long Island and New Jersey bring many Wall Streeters to work.The combined fears about a more tedious commute than usual and possible terrorist incidents have caused even the most workaholic traders to book time off. There were wide expectations for Wall Street to become a ghost town setting as early as lunchtime Friday.The effects of the market-wide languor were felt in the relatively tepid reaction from the stock market to the retreat in oil prices. Having flirted with a $50 price for a barrel of crude, futures begun a decline last Friday that continued this week. By the close of trade on Friday, they stood at $43.18.Nevertheless, concerns that US shoppers might not be as loose with their wallets in the near future were reiterated by some companies even as lower petrol prices gave some cause for optimism.Wal-Mart saw its shares fall by 1.9 percent for the week after it trimmed its August forecast on Monday for sales at stores open at least a year, saying that back-to-school activity had not lived up to expectations.Krispy Kreme Doughnuts shares ended Thursday 10.4 per cent lower but were only 1.9 per cent lower for the week after the purveyor of sugary treats announced a 56 per cent drop in profits, missing forecasts and withdrawing its quarterly and full-year earnings guidance.Likewise, Starbucks shares fell 6.5 per cent on Thursday and were 5.3 per cent lower for the week after disappointing sales figures from the coffee shop operator.Fred's, the discount retailer, saw shares lose 10.9 per cent the same day and 12.6 per cent for the week as it released lower quarterly earnings.However, Target, another discount retailer, sounded a different note from rival Wal-Mart when it reaffirmed its August same-store sales guidance on Tuesday, sending shares 1.4 per cent higher for the session and 2.5 per cent higher for the week.Williams-Sonoma, a retailer of high-end corkscrews and other housewares, said on Wednesday profits rose 55 per cent in the quarter. Shares gained 9 per cent this week.Even if some US consumers might be loath to consume as much, they appeared to still be buying food. HJ Heinz, the company best known for its tomato ketchup, announced a 7.8 per cent rise in quarterly profits on Tuesday, and the news sent shares 2.8 per cent higher, for a weekly gain of 3 per cent. The company said brisk sales of its low carb frozen foods helped the results.In a sign that not all foods are equal, poultry producers came under pressure this week when Sanderson Farms on Tuesday said profits missed analyst estimates. Shares fell 18 per cent for the week, along with those of Pilgrim's Pride, which gave up 16 per cent that days but were only 2.8 per cent lower for the week, and Tyson Foods, which fell 5.3 per cent and 7.9 per cent for the week.Some deal-making also broke the August lull. Toronto-Dominion Bank shares eased 2.4 per cent on Thursday after it announced the purchase of a controlling state in Banknorth, a Maine bank whose shares added 10 per cent on the news a day earlier.BlackRock shares rose 2.4 per cent on the same day and were 10.4 per cent for the week after it announced the $375m purchase of SSRM Holdings, the holding company of State Street Research & Management, from MetLife. The insurer's shares were flat for the week.
1028;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-24T03:00:00+0000;Karstadt plans revamp as sales slide;;KarstadtQuelle, Europe?s biggest department store, is planning a substantial overhaul of its operations to stem sliding sales.The decision came as the group reported a 6 per cent decline in sales to ?6.87bn ($8.3bn) from ?7.31bn. Underlying losses before interest and tax accelerated to ?388.5m from ?289.3m.Taking into account exceptional items, the losses escalated to ?439.5m against ?97.3m last year. Losses per share widened from ?1.77 to ?2.81.Karstadt blamed the weak German economy and falling over the counter sales at its department stores for the poor performance.The increased losses also caused Karstadt to revise down its full-year forecasts. Full-year sales are now expected to be 4.5-5 per cent lower than predicted, while losses before tax and amortisation of between ?160m and ?200m are expected.Karstadt, which also owns the Thomas Cook holiday group, said it the main thrust of its restructuring efforts would be refocusing on its core retailing operations.The group has previously launched forays into coffee shops, TV home shopping, sports broadcasting and financial services in the hopes of reviving flagging sales and cutting losses.Karstadt said its actions would include transforming the department stores and mail order business, strict cost control, improvements in the gross margin, some disposals and a tweaking of the portfolio.Signalling just how far the shake-up might go, Christoph Achenbach, chief executive, said that there would be ?no taboos? during the restructuring. ?Because of the current situation, a distinct change of direction is needed in many areas and companies of the group,? he added.First for the chop could be Karstadt?s two-year-old joint venture in Germany with Starbucks, the US coffee retailer. Karstadt, which operates 31 Starbucks across Germany, is thought to be unhappy with the terms of its contract, which leaves it footing the bill for start-up costs of the stores.Mr Achenbach took over from Wolfgang Urban, the former chief executive, in May, after shareholders became increasingly impatient with Karstadt?s poor performanceLast month, Mr Achenbach kicked off his review of the business by announcing that 4,000 jobs could be cut over the next two years to trim ?145m from its annual costs. It is also expected that up to three department stores could close by 2006.The group is due to present its new vision of the future to shareholders in September.
1029;SBUX;Starbucks Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
