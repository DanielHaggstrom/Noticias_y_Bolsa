0;LKQ;LKQ Corp;2011-10-04T18:54:20Z;Euro Car Parts sold to LKQ for £225m;;Euro Car Parts, the largest distributor of aftermarket car parts in the UK by revenue, has been sold to Nasdaq-listed LKQ for £225m ($346m).The deal provides a windfall for Sukhpal Singh, the owner who built the company up from a single shop bought in 1978.Mr Singh, who paid £5,000 for a bankrupt car parts shop more than 30 years ago and now runs 89 stores across the UK, said having a large US partner would help the company realise its ambition of expanding into Europe.“This new partnership with LKQ will help the experienced Euro Car Parts management team to continue our rapid expansion in the UK …and to explore additional opportunities throughout Europe,” he said.Mr Singh will stay on as chairman of Euro Car Parts after the buy-out. He still has a financial interest in the group and will receive another £55m from LKQ if he meets growth targets in 2012 and 2013.Euro Car Parts provides generic spare parts to independent garages across the UK, making money by undercutting the car manufacturers’ prices for official parts. The parts are often delivered on the same day by bicycle and the company boasts that it makes more deliveries in north London than Domino’s Pizza.The £225m price tag values the company at 14 times its pre-tax profits for 2010. Euro Car Parts has experienced strong growth in the past few years and reported a 30 per cent rise in revenue to £164.2m in the first half from a year ago.The aftermarket car parts sector has been resilient since the 2008 financial crisis. The economic downturn encouraged people to opt for repairing their cars rather than buying new ones, but there were fewer cars on the road overall, making the total market largely flat, according to Datamonitor.LKQ specialises in refurbishing scrap car parts as well as selling new ones. The deal is its first acquisition outside North America and its second-largest ever.“Euro Car Parts provides an ideal entry point to Europe for LKQ,” said Robert Wagman, president of LKQ.The company also indicated that it was looking to benefit from a gap in the market for refurbished car parts in Europe.“Refurbished parts are an undeveloped business in Europe,” said David Silver, managing director of Robert W. Baird, which advised Euro Car Parts on the deal.LKQ said the acquisition was expected to generate revenue of about $120m-$125m in the fourth quarter and will increase its diluted earnings per share by 15-18 cents in 2012. This would represent a 16 per cent increase in earnings per share from 2010.
1;LKQ;LKQ Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
