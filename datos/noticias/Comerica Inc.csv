0;CMA;Comerica Inc;2018-05-23T04:01:21Z;US has more than 5,600 banks. Consolidation is coming;Regulatory rollback passed by Congress this week is one of several spurs to M&A;The US’s banks have largely sat out the mergers and acquisitions wave of recent years. While deal records have fallen in almost every other sector, big banks have done almost nothing, shrinking rather than expanding. And merger activity among small and mid-sized banks — some 5,607 of them, at last count — has been subdued.But when Fifth Third Bancorp of Cincinnati revealed its $4.7bn swoop for Chicago’s MB Financial on Monday morning, shares in other Chicago-area banks began to move, too. Wintrust, a similar-sized bank based in Rosemont, Illinois, ended the day up almost 4 per cent, while First Midwest of Itasca closed up 3 per cent.The implications were obvious: after years of thin activity in bank M&A, this deal could mark a turn. The conditions for dealmaking look better than at any time since the financial crisis. Higher interest rates and lower taxes have pumped up bank profits, giving management teams stronger platforms from which to contemplate doing something radical. Data released on Tuesday by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation showed that net income across the banking industry rose 27 per cent from a year earlier in the first quarter, to a record $56bn. Shareholder activists have also begun to flex their muscles, calling for fresh ways to boost returns at Ally Financial, Comerica, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Regions Financial, among others. And then — most importantly — there is the shifting regulatory landscape.For much of the post-crisis period, agencies generally frowned on any transaction that might make a bank bigger, more complex and tougher to police. Several proposed combinations were abandoned because regulators took too long to approve them, among them New York Community Bancorp’s bid for Astoria Financial and Investors Bancorp’s move on The Bank of Princeton. A $5.3bn tie-up between M&T Bank of New York and Hudson City Bancorp of New Jersey took more than three years to limp over the finish line.Now, under the administration of Donald Trump, there are clear signs that attitude is changing. Last year, the Federal Reserve made it easier for banks to merge by lifting the combined size threshold that would trigger a much deeper regulatory probe, from $25bn in assets to $100bn.On top of that, the Fed is considering a change to the way it grades banks’ management teams, moving from a five-point to a four-point scale. In practice, said Rodgin Cohen, senior chairman at Sullivan & Cromwell, that may mean many managers will be bumped up from a grade 3 (“less than satisfactory”) to a grade 2 (“satisfactory”). In the past, a three-rating has been an effective bar on doing deals, keeping many would-be acquirers on the sidelines. Another spur to consolidation comes with the new bank-relief bill passed on Tuesday by Congress, which is set to free small and mid-sized lenders from many of the restraints that apply to the trillion-dollar banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. Financial stability regulation: Raises the size threshold at which the strictest supervision kicks in from $50bn in assets to $250bn.Volcker rule and bank capital requirements: Exempts small banks with assets of under $10bn from the Volcker rule ban on proprietary trading.Mortgage lending rules: Makes it easier for small banks to offer mortgages by increasing legal protection and reducing data requirements.The most obvious “winners” are regional banks in the $50bn-in-assets to $100bn bracket, said Quyen Truong, a Washington-based partner at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan.She noted that such banks now find themselves freed from all of the Fed’s “enhanced prudential standards” — tougher capital and liquidity requirements, leverage and lending limits, mandatory risk committees and resolution plans, as well as the annual stress test. Banks between $100bn and $250bn in assets will still face periodic stress tests, but will be exempted from other tougher standards 18 months after the date of the bill’s enactment.All of which suggests that more bank acquisitions are likely. “I think we are at a potential real tipping point,” said Mr Cohen. “You’ve got positive incentives to do deals, and the removal of obstacles to do deals.” The one caveat, for now, is the valuations of bank stocks. Shares in Fifth Third slumped the most in almost two years on Monday, down 8 per cent, after investors turned their nose up at the MB deal. In particular, they criticised the meagre 2 per cent boost to earnings per share next year — even with some very aggressive assumptions on cost-cutting — and the projection it will take seven years to overcome the hit to tangible book value, which is much longer than the three to five years that is normal for bank acquisitions, according to M&A bankers.Chris Marinac, co-founder of FIG Partners, an Atlanta-based research and advisory boutique, said Fifth Third may have been bounced into a deal, following rumours of interest in MB from other potential acquirers last week. Two of the banks linked to MB, US Bancorp and Bank of Montreal, declined to comment.Fifth Third’s share price slide was “clearly a wake-up call” for other potential acquirers, said Mr Marinac. “You’ve got to have your transaction buttoned up and with a quicker payback period.”If dealmaking does begin to pick up, investors may ultimately look more kindly on banks that move early rather than miss out on potential partners. On Tuesday, Fifth Third’s stock recovered some of the lost ground, closing up 3 per cent.
1;CMA;Comerica Inc;2018-03-13T11:31:38Z;US regional banks powered by prospect of sector reforms;Stocks of smaller lenders outpace big rivals on hopes of bill easing regulatory burdens;Shares in some of America’s top regional banks have raced ahead of their Wall Street rivals, ahead of a key Senate vote that promises to lift some of the burdens heaped upon them in the years after the crisis.The rally comes as the Senate moves closer to passing a bipartisan bill on bank regulation, under which a key threshold for tougher oversight would be raised from the current $50bn in assets to $250bn. That should be a boon for mid-sized banks such as Silicon Valley Bank, Fifth Third, KeyCorp and Comerica, which would be released from the public stress test known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR).All four banks are part of the Dow Jones mid-cap banks index, which has risen 14 per cent to a record high since the turn of the year. That is more than double the gain of the equivalent large-cap index — which includes JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, among others — and which is up 6 per cent.The bill led by Mike Crapo, Republican senator from Idaho, may mark the biggest rollback of banking regulation since the financial crisis. Eight years after the Dodd-Frank Act targeted excesses at the “too big to fail” banks, its supporters say, it is high time to grant relief to smaller banks swept up in that maelstrom of post-crisis rulemaking.Richard Hunt, president and chief executive of the Washington-based Consumer Bankers Association, says that many of his members in the $50bn to $250bn bracket were looking forward to re-investing the huge sums of money they are spending on compliance. “I can assure you they’re not a systemic risk to the US economy,” he says. The most obvious winners would be regional banks in the $50bn to $100bn bracket, which would immediately be freed from all of the Federal Reserve’s “enhanced prudential standards” — tougher capital and liquidity requirements, leverage and lending limits, mandatory risk committees and resolution plans, as well as the annual stress test.One such bank is Zions Bancorp of Salt Lake City, which has $66bn in assets. Harris Simmons, its chief executive, keeps a 28-inch stack of papers on the credenza in his office, to impress on visiting senators and congressmen the sheer scale of the effort to comply with the Fed’s stress test. [The current set-up is like] killing an ant with a sledgehammerThe paperwork — 22 volumes in total, running to 12,500 pages — was what the bank submitted to the Fed in 2015, as it tried to demonstrate to the regulator that it had a strong enough grip on its operations to survive a catastrophic shock to the system. “I like to show them what we’re talking about, when we talk about CCAR,” says Mr Simmons.Banks between $100bn and $250bn in assets, meanwhile, will get a slightly inferior deal: exempted from the tougher standards 18 months after the date of the bill’s enactment, but still facing “periodic” stress tests. And the Fed will retain the authority to apply any prudential standard it deems necessary, during this off-ramp period and beyond.Still, that is better than the current set-up, which is like “killing an ant with a sledgehammer”, says Bruce van Saun, chief executive of Citizens Financial Group, a $152bn-in-assets bank based in Providence, Rhode Island. CCAR is “‘busy work’ that doesn’t add a lot of value”, he says. “I’d love to free those resources and have those folks working as data scientists, to understand how we can serve our customers better.”The dozen banks in the Dow Jones mid-cap US banks index are Signature, Comerica, Citizens, Regions, M&T, Silicon Valley Bank, CIT, Fifth Third, Huntington Bancshares, KeyCorp, First Republic and Zions. They all have less than $250bn in assets.The large-cap index includes JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, US Bancorp, PNC, SunTrust and BB&T. All bar the last two have more than $250bn in assets.Additional reporting by Barney Jopson
2;CMA;Comerica Inc;2016-04-25T16:56:12Z;US bank meeting season begins with a bang;Activist-analyst movement targets lumbering large institutions;The annual meeting season for the big US banks should begin with a bang on Tuesday.An activist has corralled a group of investors in Comerica, unhappy with the record of Ralph Babb, chairman and chief executive of the Dallas-based bank for the past 14 years. The group is urging Mr Babb to consider radical measures to boost consistently subpar returns — including merger discussions with the likes of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, the Tokyo-based bank which is keen to do deals in the US.The identity of the ringleader? Mike Mayo of CLSA, the veteran banking analyst, and a long-time thorn in the side of management teams across the country. He’s part of a growing movement on Wall Street — analysts going well beyond simple buy or sell recommendations, urging investors to get behind a particular cause.Earlier this year Josh Stirling, an analyst at Bernstein, fomented a rebellion among shareholders in American International Group. Brian Kleinhanzl at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods made waves last month with a call for Citigroup to break itself up. Last year Richard Ramsden of Goldman Sachs made a similar argument with respect to JPMorgan Chase.This emerging phenomenon — call it the analyst-activist — has several drivers.One is the increasingly concentrated ownership of big listed companies, which enhances the influence of activists. If an agitator can win over the top ten shareholders, he or she could hold sway over an average 46 per cent of an S&P 500 company’s votes, according to Bloomberg data.Another is the growth of exchange traded funds, which is in turn raising pressure on rival active managers to beat the index benchmark to justify their fees.And then there’s the target-rich environment. Many financial institutions — and not just the “too big to fail” organisations singled out by regulators for extra tough treatment — are posting consistently sluggish returns, as they grapple with post-financial crisis restraints and persistently low interest rates.Comerica, for example, a bank with $69bn of assets, and operating in seven of the 10 largest US cities, has not achieved a double-digit return on equity since the first quarter of 2008. It has traded below book value for large stretches since then, meaning that in accounting terms, it is worth more liquidated. Citi has not breached that threshold for more than seven years.“This isn’t Bernie Sanders or Liz Warren type of activism — this is activism born out of select institutions trading below tangible book value for a long period of time,” said Fred Cannon, global head of research at KBW, alluding to attacks on the big banks from left-leaning politicians.The campaigners’ tactics vary. Mr Mayo is attending Comerica’s annual meeting for the first time, and also plans to make a debut at Goldman Sachs’ investor meeting in Jersey City next month.Others are leaving the investors to do the talking. Mr Stirling at Bernstein canvassed hundreds of AIG investors to build a case against the strategy set out by Peter Hancock, chief executive. In February AIG relented and allowed on its board John Paulson, president of Paulson & Co, and Samuel Merksamer, a managing director from Icahn Capital. Both firms had argued that AIG needed to shrink in order to free capital and escape heavy regulatory burdens.KBW’s Mr Kleinhanzl, meanwhile, has argued that Citigroup’s sprawling global operations make it the best candidate for a break-up among the biggest US banks. He accepted that while management may not be actively considering big splits at the moment, “the prospect of having trapped capital and below-potential returns for an extended period of time will bring this issue to the forefront with Citi’s board, management, and investors.”That looks like a nod to a shareholder proposal to be voted on at Citi’s annual meeting in Coral Gables, Florida, on Tuesday.Proposal number eight — which the board has recommended shareholders reject — requires that Citi appoint an independent committee to examine the sale of every business outside the core retail banking unit.Last week Comerica’s Mr Babb noted that the bank had appointed Boston Consulting Group to carry out a review of its revenues and its costs. Responding to the findings could take “a year or two,” he said, on a call with analysts.Not good enough, said one investor in Comerica, who likened the measure to “bringing out a water pistol.”Faced with the prospect of a top 10 shareholder protest at the meeting, a Comerica spokesperson said that the board and management was committed “to examining all possibilities to maximise shareholder value, and expect to deliver on our commitment.”Nonetheless, Mr Mayo describes the shareholder base as “the most flammable I’ve seen.”“I’ve not found one large investor who disagrees with the conclusion that this company needs substantive change.”More investors in underperforming banks need to start flexing their muscles, he added.“If the face of active investing is Carl Icahn, and the face of passive investing is Jack Bogle, there is a huge middle ground called active asset management.”
3;CMA;Comerica Inc;2016-04-10T15:55:00Z;US banks braced for hit on energy losses;Damage from oil price fall expected to weigh on earnings;Investors in big US banks are braced for a fresh round of disclosures on energy portfolios as regulators turn up the heat on lenders to take a more critical look at likely losses.Despite a recent recovery in the price of oil, which has climbed more than 50 per cent from its February low, the biggest four banks by assets in the US are set to reveal more trouble among borrowers as they report first-quarter earnings this week.Analysts at Barclays note that results for January to March are likely to reflect tougher guidance from a trio of bank regulators.The Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have insisted that banks take a more comprehensive look at borrowers’ indebtedness — including junior liens and unsecured debt — when assessing their own positions.JPMorgan Chase opens the reporting season on Wednesday, followed by Bank of America and Wells Fargo on Thursday and Citigroup on Friday.“The recent rally in oil prices could reduce the severity of the pressure but credit migration and reserve builds will continue,” said Ken Usdin, analyst at Jefferies in New York.The banks’ share prices have been under pressure since the turn of the year, weighed down by a combination of fears over slowing global growth and the effects of gyrating capital markets. Analysts expect banks’ trading and investment banking businesses to record their worst first quarter since 2009, in terms of revenues.Meanwhile, the trouble in the oil patch has already inflicted particular damage on banks exposed to energy with lenders including JPMorgan, Comerica and BB&T pre-announcing hits to earnings in recent months.Such concerns are likely to remain in focus this week, as banks disclose bigger buffers against losses and discuss the effects of cuts to customers' lines of credit, which are typically based on the value of reserves in the ground.As borrowers stop spending on exploration to conserve cash to service debts, the value of their oil reserves falls too — and hence the size of their credit lines from the banks, which are usually reassessed every six months.One senior executive at a big Wall Street bank, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that he expected cuts to reserve-based loans of about 15 to 20 per cent during the current redetermination season.That is the third big round of reductions since oil first dipped below $70 a barrel in November 2014 and is likely to intensify a funding squeeze for the most cash-strapped borrowers.Haynes and Boone, a Dallas-based law firm, has tracked 59 bankruptcies among North American oil and gas producers since the beginning of last year, involving about $19bn in cumulative secured and unsecured debt. “All indications suggest many more filings will occur this year,” said Buddy Clark, a partner at the firm.Fears over asset quality will continue to drag on banks’ share prices, said Fred Cannon, global director of equity research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.“I always say, you want to own the banks when they’re making bad loans — not when they’re collecting them.”
4;CMA;Comerica Inc;2016-03-27T16:13:18Z;US banks face $5bn hit from Fed’s more dovish stance;With only two rises on the cards this year, pain spreads among the more rate-sensitive lenders;Executives at US retail banks had been looking forward to 2016.This was meant to be the year they would finally gain some relief from rock bottom interest rates, which have hurt the industry’s profit margins.Richard Davis, chief executive of US Bancorp — the country’s fifth-largest listed lender by assets — gave a sense of banks’ anguish about monetary policy a year ago when he said waiting for rates to rise was akin to “torture”.But the Federal Reserve this month confirmed what investors had assumed for several weeks: rates are to be kept lower for longer.Officials expect to follow up the modest rate rise they brought in before Christmas with only two increases this year, not four as previously envisioned.The more dovish stance will cost the US banking industry about $5bn, estimates Mike Mayo, analyst at CLSA.Investors believe the Fed will prove to be even less obliging to banks than they have stated publicly. Futures markets point to just one increase this year. “At this point, if banks could sign up for two rate hikes, they’d take it,” Mr Mayo says.As Nancy Bush of Georgia-based NAB Research puts it: “It’s a struggle, and the longer it goes on the bigger a struggle it becomes.”The industry’s net interest margin — a measure of the difference between the rates at which banks borrow and lend — touched its lowest level last year since records began in 1984, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis. Even after ticking up in the final quarter they ended 2015 at only 3.02 per cent, about a fifth lower than six years ago.Their peers across the Atlantic have it even worse. The European Central Bank has gone sub-zero, charging banks 0.4 per cent on much of the €700bn worth of excess deposits they have parked with it.Although the ECB’s expanded asset-purchase programme will ease the funding difficulties of weaker banks in Europe’s periphery, negative rates are forecast to cut earnings per share by 5-10 per cent overall for eurozone banks this year, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.Some lenders are affected by central banks’ monetary experiments more than others. A report by Barclays’ US banking analysts published this week highlights the divergence.While a one percentage point rate rise would boost earnings per share this year at Bank of America by 13 per cent, they estimate, it would lift Wells Fargo’s only 1 per cent.In the jargon, a bank is more sensitive to rising rates if its assets reprice by more — or at a faster pace — than its liabilities. In practice, this depends in part on the nature of its customers. When rates rise, lenders try to keep deposit rates as low as possible while increasing rates for borrowers.About half the loans on the books of BofA offer variable terms, such as credit cards. In contrast a significantly higher proportion of Wells Fargo’s are fixed, such as car loans. That helps make Wells Fargo less rate sensitive than BofA.Banks are also more rate sensitive if they can keep a lid on deposit rates. When monetary policy tightens, the more cash depositors have in low-rate current accounts the better for banks.I don’t know any banks that are loving lower for longer, but it’s different degrees of painAccording to Barclays, more than half the deposits at Comerica — the Texas-based lender the analysts regard as the most interest rate sensitive of the 22 banks they track — are in “non-interest bearing” accounts. Conversely, less than a third of deposits at BB&T are in such accounts — helping to make it among the third least rate sensitive.“I don’t know any banks that are loving lower for longer, but it’s different degrees of pain,” says Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at the comparison site Bankrate.com.While their fates are shaped by decisions in Washington, banks can help themselves. The most obvious way is to cut costs. Staff are being let go and branches closed across the industry.Lenders can also rejig their securities portfolios. After taking a view last year that rates were likely to be lower for longer, Wells Fargo has been reducing the amount of cash and short-term investments it holds and buying longer-term bonds.13%Increase of earnings per share this year at BofA if rates rose by one percentage point, Barclays’ analysts estimate.Other business lines can also help. BB&T unveiled a deal last month to buy the insurance broker Swett & Crawford for $500m.For some investors the sector’s battered valuations — the KBW index of 24 US banks trades at a 10 per cent discount to book value — present a big buying opportunity.Bill Smead, founder of Smead Capital Management, says he has allocated 14 per cent of his $2.3bn of assets under management to three banks: JPMorgan, BofA and Wells Fargo.The stocks “scream” good value, he argues, adding they are well positioned for the long term.And relief could, finally, be on the way. Some policymakers are again making hawkish noises. Last week Patrick Harker, president of the Philadelphia Fed, called for the central bank to “get on with” rate increases.Additional reporting by Martin Arnold
5;CMA;Comerica Inc;2016-02-09T22:44:14Z;S&P cuts ratings on 4 US banks with oil exposure;;S&P has lowered its credit ratings on 4 US regional banks with large exposure to energy, on expectations that the spiraling oil price will drive more loan losses.The move comes hours after S&P downgraded Chesapeake Energy deeper into junk territory and took ratings actions on 45 energy exploration companies, writes Anna Nicolau in New York.As energy prices have declined in the past year, “asset quality among US regional banks with large energy portfolios has deteriorated,” S&P said.S&P lowered ratings on BOK Financial, Comerica, Cullen/Frost Bankers, and Texas Capital Bancshares — and holds a negative outlook on the banks to “reflect our concern that the downturn in oil and natural gas could be long-lasting, and therefore ultimate loan losses within the banks’ energy loan portfolios could meaningfully worsen”.The price of oil has dropped by more than a third since S&P had last revised its outlook on these banks a year ago.S&P warned that given the steeper drops in the oil price in recent months, debt restructurings in the energy sector “will increase, possibly sharply, in coming quarters”.
6;CMA;Comerica Inc;2015-12-29T16:00:15Z;Activists take aim at muddling midsized banks;US lenders generating subpar returns face pressure to merge;Midsized banks be warned: muddling along with subpar returns will no longer cut it.Dozens of regional lenders in the US, from People’s United of Bridgeport, Connecticut to Umpqua Holdings of Portland, Oregon, are at present making less than a 10 per cent return on equity. All should listen out for a knock on the door from PL Capital Advisors, a New Jersey-based activist determined to shake up a flabby and fragmented part of the banking sector.PL, which made its name forcing change at small, community-focused banks, is about to launch a new fund to go after bigger targets, seeking to exploit disenchantment with feeble profits among institutional investors and a friendlier regulatory attitude toward mergers.Other activists are preparing for battle, from Basswood Capital Management and Stillwell Value, both New York hedge funds, to Seidman & Associates of New Jersey.Now that banks have steadied themselves after the crisis, there is a sense of “back to basics,” says Rich Lashley, one of PL’s two principals. “More and more [merger] discussions are going on behind the scenes. Everyone is trying to figure out if they are a buyer or a seller.”Years of low growth, ultra-easy monetary policy and post-crisis regulations have squeezed profits for hundreds of American banks, forcing them to rely on cutting costs to improve margins. But many of the 1,156 publicly listed lenders are still posting returns well below their cost of capital, despite running down expenses as far as they will go. The obvious solution? Merge — or at least find very good reasons not to.“Banks need to stop kidding themselves that [higher interest] rates are going to save them,” says Nathan Stovall, an analyst at SNL Financial. “Hope is not a strategy.”Observers note that the backdrop for the activists has improved. Seven years on from the depths of the Lehman crisis, regulators still seem opposed to deals involving JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup or Bank of America, which remain under pressure to shrink and become less complex. But the banks beneath them appear to have a green light to get bigger.One Wall Street dealmaker notes that BB&T of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, has done three chunky acquisitions in a little over a year. He concludes that the US Federal Reserve wants to see more “super-regional” lenders challenging US Bancorp, PNC Financial Services and Capital One beneath the top tier.“If I’m [Daniel] Tarullo, I want ten of these guys, not three,” he says, referring to the Fed’s lead banking supervisor.In one successful strike for activism, New York Community Bancorp agreed a $2bn deal in October with New York-based Astoria Financial. Astoria had been targeted by Basswood, which disclosed a 9.22 per cent stake in July and said it had requested a board seat. In its filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Basswood argued that Astoria had “substantial opportunities . . . to take steps to enhance shareholder value.”More deals are beginning to flow. Since the end of September, New York’s M&T Bank was cleared to complete a $3.7bn merger with Hudson City, a regional rival, after a three-year wait, while KeyCorp of Cleveland announced a $4bn tie-up with Buffalo-based First Niagara.First Niagara, a $39bn-in-assets bank which had achieved a double-digit ROE in just one of the past 20 years, is a “classic example” of the kind of subpar performer PL is planning to go after, according to Mr Lashley of PL. He says he aims to raise about $200m from rich individuals, and is ready to team up with other activist funds to increase his negotiating power.If you want to get honey you can’t kick over the beehiveOthers on PL’s potential hit-list — between $5bn and $75bn in assets, and a single-digit ROE — include Comerica, a Dallas-based lender getting to grips with the oil slump, and Zions Bancorp, a Salt Lake City-based bank which the Fed judged to be short of capital last year. All told, that group of 79 lenders accounts for $1.18tn of assets, or about one-tenth of the listed US banking sector.Activism in bank stocks poses particular challenges. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, no investor can accrue a stake of more than 10 per cent in a bank without first becoming a bank itself. That has encouraged fund managers to take small stakes in their targets, often appealing to managers behind closed doors rather than shaking fists in public.“If you want to get honey you can’t kick over the beehive,” says Christopher Marinac, co-founder of FIG Partners, an Atlanta-based research and advisory boutique.That is the modus operandi of Larry Seidman of Seidman & Associates, a Parsippany, New Jersey-based firm which has challenged dozens of bank management teams over the years.Now that regulatory requirements have “dramatically increased,” he says, it is easier to make the case that executives need to consider radical action.At these kind of size levels, in this kind of environment, “you’ve got to be really, really good to earn a decent ROE. And if you can’t, you have an obligation as a director to do something about it.”
7;CMA;Comerica Inc;2015-08-27T15:17:02Z;Oil price fall hits Canada’s big banks;Jump in bad loan provisions drags down company earnings;Canada’s biggest banks have warned of more troubles to come from the fall in the oil price, as they reported surges in bad loans and chilling effects on consumer demand in the world’s 11th-largest economy.So far the big lenders such as Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank have kept a lid on writedowns by assuming a recovery in the price of crude, while borrowers have continued to service loans by cutting spending and tapping bond and equity markets where they can.But signs of strain are emerging. On Thursday morning TD Bank said oil and gas impairments in the third quarter to the end of July rose by about two-thirds from the second quarter to C$35m, while CIBC said they rose by a third to C$34m. Earlier in the week RBC had said that impairments in its energy portfolio roughly quadrupled to C$183m in the third quarter, while Bank of Montreal revealed a similar rise, to C$106m.The banks also warned of a loss of consumer confidence in parts of the country dependent on oil, such as the “prairie provinces” of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. In a call with analysts, RBC chief David McKay said that some of the group’s overall growth had been offset by “low activity” in oil-exposed regions. While some of that slowdown was from a state of “hypergrowth”, he said, “we do recognise these markets remain vulnerable to lower oil prices”.Canadian banks have October year-ends, meaning the figures for the May-July period provide some of the first glimpses into the effects of the latest fall in the price of crude, which has tumbled about 60 per cent in the past 12 months.The results could foreshadow problems for the big US lenders, which report results for the July-September quarter in mid-October. During the first six months of the year, rising non-performing loan ratios were mostly confined to lenders with outsized oil and gas exposures, such as Comerica and Capital One, noted Barclays.Stock market rally and pipeline outages stoke upswing.Continue readingBut twice-yearly reviews are coming up in September, when banks reassess the quality of their loans by projecting likely cash flows from borrowers’ oil reserves. Analysts say banks are unlikely to be as relaxed as they were in April, when many assumed a bounceback in the price of oil. RBC, for example, expected the average annual price to be $53 in 2015 in April, rising to the mid-$60s over time. The average so far this year is $55, but this month it has fallen to $43.“Should oil prices remain below $45, we would expect to see further challenges,” said Mark Hughes, RBC’s chief risk officer.Energy loans account for about 9 per cent of the big five Canadian banks’ aggregate corporate loan book. The last of the big five, Scotiabank, reports on Friday.Reported losses so far are “the tip of the iceberg”, said Meny Grauman, a banks analyst at Cormark Securities in Toronto. Remedial measures such as cost-cutting and mergers between struggling operators can only go so far, he said. “I think there is a lot of scepticism in the market about how much more those kind of actions are available, and whether the banks can delay more significant losses,” he added.
8;CMA;Comerica Inc;2012-10-26T17:00:31Z;Concerns over US ‘fiscal cliff’ widen;;More than 150 publicly listed companies in the US over the past month have warned investors about the possible effects of the looming “fiscal cliff” of tax increases and government spending cuts scheduled for the end of the year.Though both Republican and Democratic policy makers have said they will attempt to soften its effect, if left unresolved the fiscal tightening would be equivalent to roughly 4 per cent of the nation’s gross domestic product. The Congressional Budget Office and economists on Wall Street have said it is likely to lead to recession.High-profile companies such as Procter & Gamble, KKR Financial and CME Group have issued warnings. Others including Webster Financial, Comerica and Verizon have begun telling investors that uncertainty over the fiscal cliff may have already affected demand for goods and services.Lazard said it is affecting corporate confidence and may be impeding mergers and acquisitions. Cemex, the Mexican cement manufacturer and one of the world’s largest, said an unresolved cliff could have a “huge” effect on consumption. KKR Financial said it is among the reasons why it continues to hold on to cash.“There’s plenty of reasons to look right now and say, ‘Geez, I don’t know what’s going on’,” Scott Donnelly, Textron chief executive, said last week.Equity analysts have been asking companies to detail how it has affected quarterly earnings and for guidance on future results. Close to 170 companies have addressed the fiscal cliff in earnings calls over the past 30 days, according to a Financial Times review of transcripts compiled by FactSet, a data provider.The cliff includes the expiration of all the tax cuts passed by former president George W. Bush and a temporary 2 percentage point reduction in social security payroll taxes initiated by President Barack Obama, as well as $1.2tn in other spending cuts over the next decade.Terry Duffy, CME executive chairman, said: “This government of ours could be shut down, if in fact certain things play out. And people don’t know what that means for the marketplace.”Comerica, a bank with $63bn in assets, told analysts that while it saw a “very significant increase” in credit commitments, customers are not taking advantage by borrowing.Jim Rohr, chief executive of PNC, a $301bn lender, said: “We’re really just not seeing people plunking down a lot of dough to expand their business and build plants and hire a lot of people because of the environmental factors that we have.”US Bancorp told analysts to expect slower loan growth this quarter and “until we know what happens after the election and the fiscal cliff”.This week, a group of chief executives pressed for legislation to reduce US government debt. The National Association of Manufacturers, a trade lobby, reckoned that worries over the fiscal cliff this year have already shaved 0.6 percentage points off economic growth.
9;CMA;Comerica Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
10;CMA;Comerica Inc;2012-04-17T16:42:27Z;US Bancorp bolsters quarterly net income;;US Bancorp, the fifth largest bank in the US by deposits, offered a bullish take on the American economy, reporting higher first quarter net income of $1.3bn as consumer and commercial banking performed strongly.The Minneapolis-based bank reported a 29 per cent increase in earnings per share of $0.67 and raised the dividend by more than half, a result of passing the Federal Reserve’s “stress tests” last month.Richard Davis, chief executive, said beyond an increase in lending there was also a significant increase in committed credit lines, which were available to corporate customers but were not being used, storing up revenue for when confidence returns. “We’re going to stand to enjoy a second round of comparative benefits because the commitment growth is so significant and yet to be tapped,” he said.Revenue rose by 9.1 per cent to $4.9bn, with the bank benefiting – as larger peers such as Wells Fargo have done – from an increase in mortgage activity, with homeowners rushing to refinance at lower interest rates.Some larger peers, notably Bank of America and Citigroup, are still trying to achieve new tougher capital levels. However, US Bancorp said its ratio of tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets was 8.4 per cent under the new Basel III standards, “probably a little higher than we would plan to be at”.That gives the bank the luxury of deploying capital, unlike Citi and BofA, which as so-called systemically important banks are subject to additional capital requirements. Andrew Cecere, chief financial officer, said he had “plenty of room for opportunities that presents itself in the marketplace for portfolio purchases or small deals…some dividends, some buybacks and some return for internal investment”.Keith Horowitz, analyst at Citi, said the results were “a nice positive and loan growth trends looked healthy” but cautioned that “the long-term unsustainability of mortgage banking” – with the record low interest rates unlikely to be repeated – meant it would not drive a re-rating of the stock.Separately, Comerica, the Texas-based bank, reported first quarter net income of $130m, up from $103m a year earlier. One of the biggest lenders to car dealers, Comerica enjoyed strong growth in that business as the US car market continued to improve.Shares in US Bancorp rose 0.5 per cent to $31.31. Comerica’s shares rose 3.2 per cent to $31.86.
11;CMA;Comerica Inc;2012-01-20T19:12:33Z;Regional banks raise hopes for middle America;;A clutch of regional US banks reported a jump in new loans and better than expected earnings on Friday, raising hopes that some credit growth may finally be reaching middle America.Comerica, the Dallas-based commercial-mortgage specialist, reported a $1.5bn rise in total loans in the last three months of 2011, a 4 per cent increase from a year earlier.Earnings at the bank, which lends to companies including auto companies, were flat at $96m, owing to a one-off charge related to an acquisition. However, the results beat expectations, leading shares to rise 2.48 per cent to $29.38 in midday trading on Friday.Tight credit, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses, has been pinpointed by some economists and politicians as a key drag on the US economic recovery. Still, banks are having to balance renewed lending with healing wounds suffered during the financial crisis more than three years ago.“About one-third of the banks have reported and so far the theme is better loan growth,” Glenn Schorr, Nomura banking analyst, wrote in a recent note to clients. But “the offsets to the loan growth have been bad costs, slowing credit leverage and slowing capital build,” he added.Comerica’s results, equating to adjusted earnings of 60 cents a share, easily beat analysts’ expectations of 51 cents. Loan growth was driven by an 8 per cent increase in commercial loans, including auto lending. Mortgage finance and corporate banking also contributed to the lending boost.SunTrust, based in Atlanta and with branches spread across the southern states, posted loan growth of 3 per cent in the fourth quarter, helped by new commercial lending and guaranteed student loans. Earnings of $152m, or 28 cents a share, beat consensus estimates by a penny.Shares rose as much as 6.1 per cent in early New York trading, to $1.23 – their highest since August.Fifth Third, based in Cincinnati, was the rare regional bank to disappoint. A 13 per cent rise in fourth-quarter net income, or 33 cents a share, fell short of the 34 cents expected by analysts.New lending coupled with deposit growth, has spurred the largely better than expected fourth-quarter earnings at traditional banks, sharply offsetting the recent fortunes at more trading-focused banks.Wall Street groups including JPMorgan and Citigroup posted lacklustre earnings, after eurozone turmoil and subdued demand from their capital markets clients. New regulations brought in after the crisis, including the Volcker Rule which aims to ban proprietary trading, has also sparked a debate about the future of the industry.While regional banks have fared better in the most recent quarter, they are also still dealing with the aftermath of the crisis.SunTrust set aside $215m for mortgage repurchases, an increase from $117m in the third quarter. Investors can demand that banks buy back soured loans if they did not meet underwriting standards or were not properly documented.
12;CMA;Comerica Inc;2012-01-02T19:44:29Z;Bank security: Thieves down the line;US banks told to protect businesses more from cybertheft;"As a small parts supplier for the troubled US automotive industry, the Michigan-based Experi-Metal was constantly seeking ways to cut costs and improve efficiency. Online banking was no exception: the manufacturer signed up for that service in 2000 at the behest of Comerica, its bank.Experi-Metal regularly received emails from the Dallas-based bank with instructions. So controller Keith Maslowski was not surprised in early 2009 when one arrived that directed him to fill out a “Comerica business connect customer form”. He typed in his user name, password and pin number from a token at 7.35am on January 22, three weeks into his employer’s 50th anniversary year. Less than seven hours later, Experi-Metal’s coffers were empty.By 2.02pm, 93 payment orders had been issued in Mr Maslowski’s name, sending $1.9m to accounts in Russia, Estonia and other places where Experi-Metal had never done business. The company lost all $560,000 in its main accounts, though court records would show it had sent such wire transfers only twice in the previous two years.Four hours into the rout the alarm was finally raised – by another bank that was processing some of the transactions. Still, a further hour and a half passed before Comerica stopped the transfers, US district judge Patrick Duggan found after a trial in Detroit last year.With a few keystrokes, Experi-Metal was caught in a Darwinian abyss that could have led to its demise: the company was a victim of cybercrime and the bank entrusted with its funds had no obvious legal obligation to make restitution. Cyberthieves have cost US companies and their banks more than $15bn in the past five years, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation found in a recent study, and “account takeovers” such as at Experi-Metal are growing more common.Companies are forced to swallow about half the aggregate losses from attacks on their bank accounts, according to previously undisclosed research by a banking trade group and dozens of interviews by the Financial Times. Yet regulators say banks could have prevented most of the crime if available security software had been put in place.New US guidelines directing all banks to increase security came into effect this week, designed especially to help protect commercial accounts. But as 2011 drew to a close they had not yet fully sunk in or convinced banks to raise the bar against criminals as needed, regulators warn.American regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies increasingly see financial institutions as part of the problem in the failure to rein in internet fraud. Though security overall is improving and the banks’ own systems are rarely penetrated, many have opted not to scan for even obvious fraud being perpetrated on their customers, such as is signalled by unusual, rapid-fire transfers to unfamiliar locations.Bank security veterans say one reason for the protection shortfall is that US banks do not have to pay full restitution to commercial enterprises. “They are not going to spend more to stop fraud than it costs them when fraud happens,” says one vendor who has supplied detection systems, mainly to medium-sized banks. She suggests that most banks would have to spend $1m for adequate protection.Individual Americans are protected by Regulation E of the federal banking code and are liable for a maximum $500 if a cyberthief strikes. Companies – even those owned by a single person – have no such guarantees. “A small company may not be able to survive even one significant cyber-attack,” Gordon Snow, FBI assistant director, testified before a congressional financial services committee in September.Other countries vary but often afford greater protection; in the UK, companies are absolved as long as they are not negligent and ensure they report unauthorised transfers within two days.In the US, corporate customer liability is governed by the uniform commercial code, which, despite its name, varies slightly from state to state. Under that code, companies are responsible for stolen funds if they have agreed to a security procedure with the bank, the bank followed it and the procedure was “commercially reasonable”. US courts have usually upheld that reasonableness.All told, US companies and their banks lost more than $2bn in 2010, according to the latest FDIC figures. That is a big drop from the peak of $8bn in 2006. But the banks’ battering by the overall economic crisis means the hit to their earnings is felt all the more acutely – and such losses cannot generally be recouped from insurance or covered by banks’ reserves.Moreover, the number of attacks is rising as scammers go after smaller businesses and smaller banks, where security is often weaker, says William Nelson, chief executive of the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a non-profit group set up to share information on cyberthreats among banks, security companies and government officials.If banks had taken a cursory look, they would have seen that money going out the door was anomalous’…No official statistics show which types of bank are better at protecting customers and most banks contacted declined to discuss security matters on the record. But background interviews with executives and other data point to clear patterns.Big banks generally do a better job of security and often recompense their commercial customers when they slip up, each paying out what insiders and analysts say are as much as hundreds of millions of dollars every year. Those settlements also allow them to avoid court fights that could detail weaknesses in their security systems.The American Bankers Association, the industry’s main trade group, found in a survey last May of 77 financial institutions that companies had to cover half their losses in aggregate. A poll breakdown provided to the Financial Times also suggests that the biggest banks accept a much greater share of losses than did banks such as Comerica, which has $61bn in assets.The small sample, of fewer than 1 per cent of US banks, apparently captured institutions that were luckier than most. The two survey respondents with confirmed “account takeover” fraud and more than $100bn in assets apiece accepted just $240,000 in combined losses over a recent 18-month stretch, leaving their customers out of pocket by only $86,000. But at most smaller banks, the proportions were reversed. Those with $50bn-$100bn in assets, for example, took about $470,000 in losses and left customers to bear $1.4m.The FDIC and the Federal Reserve have told lenders to stop relying on tokens, passwords and cookies, the small data files left on computers to authenticate them on future visits, and instead embrace “layered security” including software that flags unusual behaviour – such as multiple transfers within minutes to new recipients. The guidelines can figure in regulators’ inspections of the banks, but officials say they do not expect every institution to have met the January deadline and are instead looking for a good-faith effort.A survey by Guardian Analytics, a banking technology specialist, that was shared during a closed-door security conference in November in Washington showed not everyone was equipped to make that effort. About 40 per cent of the banks polled did not even know they would soon be required to spot “anomalies” in transactions. “There seems to be some misunderstanding,” the FDIC’s Jeffrey Kopchik told bankers at the conference. “That is concerning to me and I think all of the agencies.”In most past cases of high-frequency transfers to new places, “if banks had taken what we would consider a cursory look at transactions, they would have seen that the money going out the door was completely anomalous”.That was certainly true of Experi-Metal, which sued Comerica in 2009. Experi-Metal had signed up with the country’s 31st-biggest bank when its longtime personal banker took a job there. Neither side would comment for this article, but in court they agreed that they had had good relations until the January day when it all went wrong.…In the end, the case pivoted on whether Comerica’s practices were commercially reasonable, whether any reasonable practice must include forthright behaviour or “fair dealing” and whether Comerica’s general defences and response on the day were so lax as to be objectively unfair.Experi-Metal’s expert witness on bank security testified that most banks could spot anomalies – a point that Comerica disputed. Comerica said it should not have been expected to do as good a job as the biggest institutions. It said it had no obligation to monitor what was happening in customer accounts.“Comerica’s employees did not purposefully allow any fraudulent wires to leave the bank once the fraud was confirmed,” it wrote in a pre-trial filing, adding that the bank was “entitled to rely on its customer Experi-Metal’s assurance that it would keep confidential its login ID, password and secure token number”.The judge disagreed, stating that though the regulatory guidance then in effect did not require better monitoring, Comerica was not acting in good faith if it merely had a “pure heart and empty head”. Citing numerous oddities about the transactions and the slow reaction when JPMorgan Chase – a way station for a half-dozen transfers en route to customer accounts of Alfa-Bank in Moscow – called with suspicions, the judge concluded that he was “inclined to find that a bank dealing fairly with its customer, under these circumstances, would have detected and/or stopped the fraudulent wire activity earlier”. He ordered Comerica to reimburse Experi-Metal the full amount, which it did in August.Most businesses are unaware that they do not have the same protection as consumers. Just 18 per cent of 1,000 small companies knew the truth in one recent survey by Actimize, a banking security company. Analysts say that those unaware of the risks are less likely to insist on precautions, such as mandatory phone calls to confirm every wire.Often, companies find out that they are liable only when they have been robbed. When cyberthieves hit, banks make their own position clear, leading to “some pretty tense discussions”, says Kevin Gibson at Synovus Bank of Columbus, Georgia, which has about $30bn in assets. “It is a hard pill to swallow to our customers.”Mr Gibson says his bank’s accounts were pilfered once or twice a week for a period in 2010. But since asking business customers to download new security software and adding internal monitoring a year ago, the bank has had no intrusions.Executives at the largest US banks say they operate case by case but tend to cover losses most extensively for their biggest, most valuable customers, even though those companies could often take the hit better than small firms. It is almost as if they are extending a version of the “too big to fail” doctrine, which Washington applied in bailing out the banks three years ago.“Put it this way,” says a security executive at one big bank. “If you are a large, long-term customer, you are going to get the benefit of the doubt.”"
13;CMA;Comerica Inc;2011-10-21T20:32:51Z;Gains for BofA and Citi as financials advance;;The S&P 500 was set to close the week above 1,230 for the first time since the start of August, as investors grew hopeful that European policymakers would deliver a comprehensive plan for resolving the continent’s sovereign debt crisis.A mixed set of earnings figures during the week coincided with less volatile trading on Wall Street. Daily correlation among stocks in the S&P 500 moderated as individual company performance shifted share prices.Financials were the main beneficiaries, up 3.7 per cent for the week, as the remaining big banks announced results.Performance was far from stellar. Goldman Sachs reported its second ever loss as a public company, while Bank of America’s return to profit was aided by asset sales. Several banks’ reports were flattered by an accounting ruse, which lowered the value of their own debt.But as Randy Warren, principal of Warren Financial Service, who initiated a position in Citigroup in August, put it: “It’s a relief just to get through most of the major bank announcements and not hear anything too terrible.”Bank of America rose 6.1 per cent to $6.57 and Citigroup was up 6.1 per cent to $30.12. Among investment banks Goldman was up 6.2 per cent to $102.25, while Morgan Stanley’s return to profit pushed its shares up 11.3 per cent to $16.94.Loan growth at regional banks was sluggish, even as the retreat of the big US banks from commercial and consumer lending left an opportunity for expansion. But investors punished those banks which did not push lending.Dallas-based lender Comerica was off 6.1 per cent to $24.10, as it shrunk lending to small business and commercial real estate and saw a 50 per cent increase to $4.8bn of “excess liquidity” on deposit at the Fed.“Investors are impatient for loan growth at Comerica,” said John Pancari, regional banks analyst at Evercore Partners.Over the week, analyst expectations of 2012 S&P 500 earnings per share fell 50 cents to $108.92, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ, but that did not discourage investors.“To the extent that companies and analysts are being more realistic about future earnings, it’s given investors some confidence to buy into stocks,” said Adam Parker, chief US equity strategist at Morgan Stanley.The S&P 500 was set to close the week up 1 per cent to 1,236.37. Although the weekly move was small, it appeared highly significant. Three previous rallies in the index over the summer stalled at 1,220 as fund managers booked profits.The latest rally appeared to be heading the same way on Tuesday as investors pulled $3.26bn out of the SPDR S&P 500 exchange traded fund, which tracks the performance of the benchmark index, after the it had hit a 75-day intraday peak of 1,233.1.But while news of twists and turns in negotiations over the eurozone crisis continued to move markets, the shifts were markedly less dramatic than in recent weeks. The biggest single day move in the S&P 500 was 2 per cent on Tuesday, only the second week since July in which there was not at least one daily move of more than 2.5 per cent.The closely watched Vix index of volatility in the S&P 500 also dipped below 30 for the first time since the start of August last Friday, and it stayed below 35 the entire week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.1 per cent for the week and into positive territory for the year at 11,768.83 but the Nasdaq Composite was off 1.1 per cent for the week to 2,637.49, as Apple’s first earnings miss in years knocked the index.Apple fell 6 per cent for the week to $396.79, yielding its status as the largest company by market capitalisation in the S&P 500 to back to ExxonMobil.Apple’s losses meant tech shares faltered, down 2 per cent for the week, more than any other sector.The biggest maker of hard disk drives, Western Digital Corporation, was down 7.4 per cent for the week to $26.24, as it was forced to close all its manufacturing facilities in Thailand, because of flooding.Fears of disruption to the supply of hard drives hit Dell, off 7.5 per cent for the week to $15.38.Hospira Inc fell 23.2 per cent to $29.26 after the maker of drugs for injection, said an FDA probe into its largest manufacturing plant had hit output.El Paso Corporation was up 27 per cent for the week to $24.88 after Kinder Morgan announced it would buy the gas transportation company for $38bn.Newfield Exploration was off 12.8 per cent to $36.36, after it was forced to delay completion of 13 oil wells in the Bakken shale field.

But analysts said they expected the Hitachi acquisition to be approved by the end of the year.“The hard drive market is mature and PC sales growth is under pressure, so consolidation makes sense,” said Jason Nyoland, a technology analyst at Robert W Baird.Western Digital fell 9.3 per cent to $24.44 and is down almost 14 per cent for the week after saying on Monday it had closed manufacturing facilities in Thailand due to flooding.Seagate shares were off 0.4 per cent to $12.05.The S&P 500 fell 1.3 per cent to 1,209.88 as Apple fell 5.6 per cent to $398.62.The group missed earnings and revenue targets for the first time in several years on Tuesday evening. Despite Wednesday’s losses, Apple remains one of the few S&P 500 stocks to have made gains since the sell-off began in July.The S&P 500’s retreat marked the third time this summer a rally has peaked narrowly above the 1,220 mark.In a sign of profit-taking on Tuesday, investors pulled $3.26bn out of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF after the index had hit a 75-day intraday peak of 1,233.1.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.6 per cent to 11,504.62 and Apple weighed on the Nasdaq Composite, which was down 2 per cent to 2,604.04.Morgan Stanley, the second-largest US investment bank by market capitalisation, returned to profit, posting $2.2bn in earnings for the quarter ended September.A “debt valuation adjustment” – an accounting measure used by many US banks this quarter to bolster the value of their debt – accounted for $1.12 of the $1.15 in earnings per share.But many analysts had been expecting an underlying loss.Morgan Stanley surged as much as 6 per cent in the first minutes of the session, trading above $17.50, a value not seen since August. But the stock was only up fractionally to $16.64 at the close.Regional bank stocks had mixed performance on quarterly results.PNC, up 0.2 per cent to $51.33 and US Bancorp, down 1.4 per cent to $24.13, took advantage of the big banks’ retreat from consumer lending to expand high margin loan books.But Dallas-based Comerica fell 10.5 per cent to $23.13, as its net interest margin shrunk to 318 basis points, much lower than the bank had forecast, as the Fed’s Operation Twist drove down the yield of its mortgage-backed securities.Intel rose 3.6 per cent to $24.24 after posting record quarterly revenue and earnings per share of 65 cents, despite a 32 per cent decline in sales of its low-power Atom microprocessors, as Apple’s iPad reduced the market for netbooks.Freeport-McMoRan, the miner, reported net income of $1.05bn despite a shortfall in output due to strikes at an Indonesia mine.Earnings per share of $1.10 were 14 cents lower than the same period last year but beat analyst expectations. But shares fell 2.8 per cent to $34.38.The materials sector of the S&P 500 lost 3 per cent.BlackRock, the largest money manager, was down 4.7 per cent to $148.92 after reporting a near-10 per cent fall in assets under management to $3,345bn during September.Abbott Laboratories was up 1.5 per cent to $53.25 after saying it would split into two entities, one focused on research and the other selling drugs and medical devices.Apollo Group closed up 7.9 per cent to 46.74 as quarterly earnings per share more than quadrupled from the same period last year to $1.37. The college said it had improved retention.Defence group United Technologies Corporation was off 1.2 per cent to $73.26, though it reported an 11 per cent rise in profits compared with the same quarter last year and raised full-year earnings guidance.Bank of New York Mellon was off 1.2 per cent to $19.54 after it reported a 4.7 per cent rise in profit to $651m.Analysts were cheered that trust assets had risen 6 per cent from the same period last year to $25,900bn, suggesting the largest US trust bank is managing to attract customers despite facing a federal lawsuit for regularly overcharging for foreign exchange transactions.
15;CMA;Comerica Inc;2011-09-13T21:15:23Z;Return to fundamentals helps S&P 500;;No big news from Europe was good news for Wall Street on Tuesday, as the S&P 500 rose 0.9 per cent to 1,172.87, its second-best day of September.Although an Italian bond auction attracted record yields, public comments by Angela Merkel confirming Germany’s commitment to help Greece were enough to quash rumours of a Greek default for now.That allowed US investors to focus on fundamentals for a change, and some of the biggest stock price moves were driven by earnings or forecasts.Best Buy, the consumer electronics retailer, missed analyst expectations on second-quarter profit figures and cut its full-year earnings forecast. Falling sales of televisions and mobile phones were to blame. Best Buy shares fell 6.5 per cent to $23.35.Cummins, an engine manufacturer, was up 5.9 per cent at $92.20, after company executives used an analyst meeting to forecast sales growth of 14 per cent to $30bn by 2015.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.4 per cent at 11,105.85 and the Nasdaq Composite index rose 1.5 per cent to 2,532.15.Although fundamentals played some part in trading, it was yet another day when every sector of the S&P 500 moved in the same direction.S&P 500 sectors are currently 97.2 per cent correlated, according to analysis from ConvergEx Group.This is in addition to correlation among the 250 largest individual stocks in excess of 80 per cent, the highest level since the 1987 stock market crash.“The correlations we note among industry sectors are profoundly and dysfunctionally high. They come, in my opinion, from the underlying concern over a second financial crisis,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx.Energy stocks were among the laggards of the S&P 500, rising only 0.3 per cent, as oil-linked stocks were hit hard.“In the last few days refiners have seen a substantial narrowing in their product margin, as the spot price of finished petroleum and diesel products has fallen,” said Paul Cheng at Barclays Capital.Mr Cheng also said the narrowing premium in the price of Brent over WTI oil is hurting US refiners. A few Midwestern refiners buy WTI oil, which has been trading at a discount to Brent crude for the past year. As the discount narrows, those refiners face higher input costs.Tesoro Corporation, a big refiner, was down 1.3 per cent at $23.47. Marathon Petroleum was also off 3.6 per cent at $35.34. Other analysts said the sell-off in energy stocks was a reaction to fears about global growth, stemming from Europe. Oil explorers and producers were down too, even though the oil price rose Tuesday, with Denbury Resources falling 1.8 per cent to $13.96.Industrials outperformed on Tuesday, up 1.9 per cent as a sector in the S&P 500.Logistics and distribution groups Fastenal, up 4.7 per cent at $34.35, and WW Grainger, up 3.7 per cent at 157.27, had strong days. WW Grainger had announced 10 per cent rise in quarterly sales on Monday.Southwest Airlines, the budget airline, rose 4.4 per cent to $8.31.That left the S&P 500 higher on two days running for the first time this month. But investors were cautious. “Expect the index to keep trading in bands with 1,250 an absolute maximum, unless the situation in Europe is resolved,” said Channing Smith of Tulsa-based Capital Advisors.Coca Cola Enterprises, the European arm of the soft drinks giant, was up 3.7 per cent at $26.46, as investors reacted favourably to an analyst day in Paris on Tuesday. UBS analyst Kaumil Gajrawala upgraded the stock to buy, but acknowledged the company faced challenges, in particular from falling demand in Europe and rising input costs due to surging commodity prices.Coke’s “valuation [is] now interesting”, Nomura analyst Ian Shackleton told clients. But he maintained a “hold” rating, telling clients: “We see the stock still being held back by macro issues for now.” Credit Suisse said the company is set to benefit from a “step-change” in UK sales due to advertising for the London Olympics next year.Micron Technology, up 2.6 per cent at $6.86, registered its sixth successive day of gains. Tristan Gerra, semiconductor analyst at RW Baird, said the semiconductor group’s strong performance was due to signs that the spot price for DRam computer memory, Micron’s main product, may have bottomed.

Marathon Oil was up 3.4 per cent to $34.06 while Peabody Energy added 2.2 per cent to $60.69.But this failed to prevent the S&P 500 edging lower, losing 0.1 per cent to 1,337.88 as investors worried about which direction the markets would now turn after the 5.6 per cent jump in the S&P last week – the best week of gains in the index for two years.The index is now just 1.9 per cent away from a three- year high and is well above its 100-day moving average.Financial stocks were some of the worst hit by these nerves, also hurt by news that Portugal’s credit rating had been cut to “junk” and that Citigroup had cut its price target on a number of regional banks.Morgan Stanley was down 2.6 per cent to $23.15 while Comerica, a regional lender, lost 3 per cent to $34.32. The S&P financial index was down 0.8 per cent, paring some of the 5.9 per cent gains seen last week. The KBW banking index fell 1.2 per cent.The industrial sector was the next worst performing in the session, not helped by news that factory orders had risen by less than expected in May.Textron, the maker of Cessna aircraft and Bell helicopters, led the losses, falling 5 per cent to $22.74 while Cummins declined 1.6 per cent to $105.69.The S&P industrial index was down 0.6 per cent, paring some of the 6.4 per cent gains last week.But most of the remaining sectors on the S&P saw little movement and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 12,569.34. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4 per cent to 2,825.77.This pause follows the best weekly gains in two years on both these indices last week.The upswing came as the indices bounced up off their 200-day moving average and investors cheered a perceived improvement in the Greece situation.The markets were also looking ahead to the earnings season, which starts next week and is expected to be relatively strong.Analysts are expecting a healthy 11.9 per cent rise in earnings from the previous year for S&P 500 companies, according to data complied by Bloomberg. This would mark the seventh straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth for the index.But despite an assumption that second-quarter earnings would be healthy, there is some concern that guidances for the full year will be lowered due to the “soft patch” in the US economy over the past two months.Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners, argued that the S&P 500 will reach a ceiling at 1,350 before running back down to 1,250 again in the coming months, thanks partly to lower guidances.But he goes on to argue that there will be a late rally towards the end of the year, which will see the S&P finish between 1,370 and 1,400. “In the end, the market wants to go up,” he reassured.In other company news Ameron surged 28.3 per cent to $85.05 after National Oilwell Varco said it would buy the fibreglass pipe manufacturer in a deal valued at $772m. National Oilwell Varco was up 2.2 per cent to $80.02.Netflix led the gains on the S&P 500, jumping 8.1 per cent to $289.63 after saying that it was expanding its video streaming service to 43 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.Immucor, the biotechnology company, added 30.2 per cent to $26.99 after agreeing to be bought by private equity group TPG Capital for a fully diluted equity value of $1.97bn.Baidu, the US-listed Chinese search engine, was up 1.8 per cent to $145.87 on news that it will team up with Microsoft to create an English-language search.
17;CMA;Comerica Inc;2011-04-25T23:17:56Z;Loan figures raise doubt over bank earnings;;Sluggish loan growth and ultra-low interest rates are depressing US banks’ revenues, compounding investors’ fears that future earnings will remain under pressure in spite of the domestic economic recovery.Bankers and analysts said that recently released first quarter results underlined the low-growth environment plaguing the US financial sector, with profits beating Wall Street’s expectations only thanks to large releases of bad loan reserves.The make-up of the results failed to please investors, with shares in large and small banks underperforming the broader market and remaining at historically low valuations over the past few weeks.“Earnings driven by the release of reserves or lower charge-offs are not cutting it right now,” said Scott Siefers of Sandler O’Neill. “Investors are focused on the lack of top-line growth.”With most banks back on a solid footing after the financial turmoil and with the recovery well under way, investors had expected them to show stronger revenue gains, mainly through more loans.Lending growth – a crucial driver of revenues for retail and commercial banks – resumed in important areas such as loans to industrial companies at the end of last year after nearly two years of contraction.But it failed to build on that momentum in the first quarter. Average loans at the 28 US banks that have reported results fell 2 per cent from a year before, according to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. At large banks, the annual drop in loans was 6 per cent.Near-zero interest rates – the result of the monetary authorities’ desire to stimulate the economy – have made it difficult for them to earn large profits on the loans they make.The net interest margin – the difference between what banks receive from borrowers and what they pay out to savers – was lower than a year ago for large banks and only slightly higher for smaller rivals, KBW said.As a result, earnings remained disproportionately dependent on the release of loan-loss reserves and lower charge-offs.Some executives said the pause in lending could be because of unforeseen events such as the Japanese earthquake and the unrest in the Middle East, which put a dampener on companies’ investment plans. But others voiced concerns.“Things are actually not quite as positive as we thought they would be at the middle of the quarter,” Richard Davis, chief executive of US Bancorp, told investors. Mr Davis said that while US Bancorp’s lending commitments to businesses are up 2 per cent compared with the fourth quarter, actual usage is down about 1 per cent.“Even when they have the availability of credit, they are not using it,” Mr Davis said.Overall lending declined at some smaller regional banks, including KeyCorp and Comerica. Larger banks, including Wells Fargo and Bank of America, saw flat to slightly positive lending to commercial customers and loan growth to consumers remained depressed.The shares of Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase have traded lower since the banks reported results last week.The main banks continue to trade within historic multiples of about 11 times forward earnings. But that could change if investors decide banks are more like slow-growth utilities than the earnings powerhouses they became over the past decade.“Investors are questioning whether banks can earn a competitive return,” Mr Siefers said. “If they determine they can’t, their multiples will likely contract.”
18;CMA;Comerica Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;National Bank of Canada increases dividend;;National Bank of Canada raised its quarterly dividend 6 per cent on Tuesday, becoming the first large Canadian bank, and one of only a handful worldwide, to lift its pay-out since the onset of the financial crisis.The move by Quebec-based National is expected to presage similar rises from its five bigger rivals – Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce – in coming months.The Canadian banks have come through the financial crisis in far healthier condition than many of their US and European counterparts thanks to a more conservative lending culture, a more resilient housing market and robust regulation.All have maintained their dividends, although none has raised its pay-out in the past two years. By contrast, almost every significant US bank – with the notable exception of Goldman Sachs – has slashed its dividend.Dallas-based Comerica last month became the first big US retail bank to lift its dividend, doubling the pay-out to 10 cents a share. Elsewhere, National Bank of Australia has announced a dividend rise.Peter Routledge, analyst at National Bank Financial, forecast that each of the six Canadian banks would raise its dividend at least once in the fiscal year to October 31 2011.Ed Clark, TD’s chief executive, said last week that his bank would “address the issue” in early 2011.All the Canadian banks are expected to be within their target dividend pay-out range during the coming fiscal year and to have little trouble meeting the new capital ratios prescribed in the recent Basel III agreement.The Superintendent of Financial Institutions, Canada’s bank regulator, had asked the banks to delay dividend increases until the new global capital rules had been clarified.Mr Routledge said bank earnings had recently been buoyed by stronger domestic loan growth than expected, but that trading revenues could be a third lower than a year ago. Three Canadian banks – Royal, TD and Bank of Montreal – have sizeable US retail networks whose performance could make the difference between winners and losers in the last quarter.National reported net earnings of C$1.3bn (US$1.26bn) in the year to October 31, up 21 per cent from the previous year. It ascribed the advance to robust growth in loan volumes and to improved wealth management and capital markets income.Louis Vachon, chief executive, said that “such solid results, combined with our strong capital position and the quality of our credit portfolio, have allowed us to raise shareholder dividends”. The dividend has climbed from 62 cents to 66 cents a share.

21;CMA;Comerica Inc;2010-02-10T21:07:10Z;US regional banks to step up lending;;Some US regional banks, including commercial lending specialist Comerica, expect to increase loans to small-and medium-sized businesses later this year, sooner than analysts had expected.Fears that banks will not make enough loans to keep the recovery going have led the Obama administration to unveil plans to spur lending to smaller businesses.In recent conference calls with analysts, Comerica, which has operations in Texas, California and Michigan, and Tennessee-based First Horizon said they expected to increase commercial and industrial loans, a type of lending backed by inventory and cash flow as opposed to real estate. Columbus, Ohio-based Huntington Bancshares is also expected to increase certain types of loans beginning this year, according to Erik Oja, a Standard & Poor’s analyst.“We are seeing more loans in the pipeline,” said Ralph Babb, Comerica’s chief executive.“Commercial and industrial lending is looking a lot stronger than we anticipated,” said Craig Siegenthaler, an analyst at Credit Suisse. His initial projections anticipated double-digit loan decreases at Comerica for the balance of this year, estimates that he has since revised upward.Until recently, the main concern for banks had been deteriorating credit quality. As the banks work through the worst of their credit problems, they are starting to lend again, but not quickly enough for government officials.The Obama administration last week unveiled a plan to invest $30bn from the Troubled Asset Relief Programme in community banks to spur small business loans.The plan has drawn criticism from the American Bankers Association, which says banks are loath to touch Tarp-tainted money because of the restrictions and stigma associated with the bail-out funds.However, not all banks are talking about increasing loans. BB&T Corp and SunTrust Banks have warned that lending will remain sluggish for the foreseeable future.Comerica, First Horizon and Huntington are in a position to start lending faster than some of their peers, because they did not finance as many bad loans during the bubble.“They were more careful in their underwriting,” S&P’s Mr Oja said.Comerica also has the advantage of a strong presence in Texas, which has withstood the economic downturn better than many other states.Elizabeth Acton, Comerica’s chief financial officer, cautioned in a conference call that the bank did not expect a significant pick-up in lending until the second half of the year. She added that while loans continued to decline in the fourth quarter, the drop had begun to level off. “That is at least some progress,” she said.
22;CMA;Comerica Inc;2010-01-21T23:30:49Z;Investors punish big institutions;;"US stocks led by large Wall Street banks with big proprietary trading operations fell sharply on Thursday while smaller regional banks surged after the plans were unveiled.“The most successful financials have been priced for a perfect scenario and that outlook has been altered,” said Anthony Conroy, head of trading at BNYConvergEx. “They have no place but to go lower at the moment.”The S&P 500 closed 1.9 per cent lower in New York, its worst one-day fall since October.The S&P financials index lost 3 per cent, after falling as much as 3.3 per cent in early trade. The weakness in equities also put
pressure on the corporate bond prices of big financials.The 10-year bonds of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were quoted 15 basis points wider over Treasuries.Among the shares of big banks, Goldman Sachs dropped 4.1 per cent, Morgan Stanley fell 4.2 per cent, JPMorgan was lower by 6.6 per cent and Bank of America closed down 6.2 per cent.Shares in PNC Financial fell 5.3 per cent, while Northern Trust slipped 3.5 per cent.In contrast, regional banks, which do not rely on proprietary trading, held up and the S&P regional bank index rose 0.8 per cent.Shares in Fifth Third Bank gained 6.3 per cent, while KeyCorp rose 5.5 per cent, Suntrust Bank was 4.7 per cent higher, BB&T rallied 2 per cent and Comerica was up 6.7 per cent.“Most of the regionals don’t do prop trading and are being bought,” said Mr Conroy.The selling in financials follows a surge since last March, and after Thursday’s losses the S&P financials sector remains 140 per cent above last year’s nadir.The weakness in stocks boosted US government bonds, with yields falling, while the dollar surrendered early gains and was mixed in late New York trade."
23;CMA;Comerica Inc;2009-04-21T23:05:04Z;US Bancorp bucks gloomy trend among regional banks;;US regional banks on Tuesday provided investors with a mixed picture of the state of the financial sector as stronger-than-expected earnings from US Bancorp helped counter the gloom resulting from big losses at Zions Bancorp.US Bancorp, based in Minnesota, reported net income of $529m, a 60 per cent increase over its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2008, demonstrating that major regional players could benefit from the forces that helped generate last week’s profit announcements from the biggest US banks. But other regional banks, particularly smaller ones, did not fare as well.“I think there is some clear delineation between big healthy institutions and the plain-vanilla small-cap regional banks,” said analyst Andrew Marquardt of Fox-Pitt Kelton.“They’re having much worse results in terms of charge-offs and reserve builds.”Alabama-based Regions Financial, which cut its dividend to 1 cent per share last week, eked out a profit of 4 cents per share on earnings of $77m.Utah-based Zions surprised investors late Monday by announcing a loss of $832m, reflecting its exposure to commercial real estate.Analysts said they were impressed by US Bancorp’s increase in market share and its ability to build up reserves against future charge-offs. The bank’s stock was up 17 per cent to $18.65 in late trading.Mr Marquardt said US Bancorp’s credit reserves of $1.3bn, almost triple the amount reserved a year ago, is a healthy sign, compared with other regional banks, such as Comerica, which so far have not reserved against a similar percentage of loans.Zions was down 18 per cent in late trading.Sandler O’Neill slapped a sell rating on the stock, while Moody’s downgraded the bank’s debt ratings because of Zions’ large exposure to commercial real estate loans, as well as its portfolio of collateralised debt obligations.Mr Marquardt described KeyCorp’s results for the quarter as disappointing and questioned whether the Ohio bank would have to cut its dividend again.As for Regions, its earnings and outlook would be negatively affected in the near term by the recession, which is now hitting the south-eastern part of the US with particular ferocity, the analyst added.

The $330bn market started to falter when liquidity began to dry up and Wall Street banks stepped back from supporting the market.Regulators have accused banks of misrepresenting ARS as liquid, cash-like instruments. In addition to Finra, Andrew Cuomo, the New York attorney-general, the US Securities and Exchange Commission, and a task force of 12 state securities regulators, have been conducting investigations.At least 10 major banks that sold or underwrote ARS have reached previous settlements with various regulators in the past two months. The banks have together agreed to repurchase more than $63bn of ARS from investors and pay more than $535m in fines.Many investigations are still ongoing. Finra said that nearly 50 additional investigations have been opened, and more are expected. It had initially questioned more than 200 firms regarding their holdings of ARS in both proprietary and customer accounts.Finra said the five firms in the settlement announcement yesterday sold ARS using communications with its sales force that were “not fair and balanced” and “did not provide a sound basis for investors to evaluate the benefits and risks of purchasing ARS”.The firms neither admit nor deny wrongdoing. Fines for the brokerages range from $250,000 to $1.65m.

The announcement prompted a 15 per cent drop in the bank’s share price.KeyCorp has also raised $1.5bn in new capital in recent weeks and slashed its quarterly dividend in half, prompting a 25 per cent drop in its share price.Huntington Bancshares said last week that it expected losses from uncollectible loans to be at the top end of its 2008 guidance of 0.65 per cent, and attempted to quell concerns about further credit deterioration, but investors on Monday remained unpersuaded.“Investors have been shooting first and asking questions later,” said Mr Davis.“We are still at least a month away from earnings reports and companies are having little luck assuaging investors’ fears.”
27;CMA;Comerica Inc;2008-05-28T22:57:28Z;KeyCorp plunge sparks fears for smaller lenders;;Shares of US regional banks slumped Wednesday after KeyCorp, the third-largest bank in Ohio, doubled its forecast for loan losses and prompted concerns that small US banks may have underestimated the cost of the housing slump.KeyCorp plunged 10.4 per cent, and was down as much as 12 per cent in intraday trading, after the bank said in a regulatory filing that it might have to write off up to 1.3 per cent of its total loans this year.It said that second-quarter and potentially third-quarter net charge-offs could be even higher than the new estimate, citing exposure to residential homebuilders, education and home improvement loans. KeyCorp’s revision to its loan loss estimates is its second in as many months.The news dragged shares of other regional banks lower amid concerns that similar revisions could be looming elsewhere as US house prices continue to fall, putting pressure on all housing-related loans, many of which have stayed on regional bank balance sheets.“Things are going to get significantly worse before they are going to get better for KeyCorp and the banking industry,” said Gerard Cassidy, analyst at RBC Capital Markets in a note to clients.Shares in Regions Financial, the largest bank in Alabama, fell by more than 5 per cent, Texas-based Comerica fell by 3.8 per cent, and Cincinatti-based Fifth Third fell by 3.58 per cent.The selling pushed the BKX banking index to a five-year low in intraday trading, before it recouped some of its loss to close 1.7 per cent lower.KeyCorp said last year that it would exit troubled lines of business such as lending to homebuilders and dealer-originated home improvement loans outside its regional base in areas such as Southern California, Arizona and Nevada.However, such loans remain on KeyCorp’s books and have been the epicentre of losses for the bank.Rising credit problems have caused many US regional banks substantially to increase their provisions to cover loan losses, as declining home prices have spread credit deterioration beyond subprime mortgages and complex structured mortgage assets to affect prime mortgages, home equity and residential construction exposure. The pace of losses in these asset classes accelerated in the first quarter.David Hendler, banking analyst at CreditSights, a research company, said: “The current credit cycle has been surprising in the pace and severity of deterioration, with banks repeatedly caught off guard by the rapid increases in credit quality deterioration.”
28;CMA;Comerica Inc;2007-10-21T18:21:45Z;US loan default problems widen;;Poor quarterly results from banks across the US over the past two weeks suggest credit problems once confined to high-risk mortgage borrowers are spreading across the consumer landscape, posing new risks to the economy and weighing heavily on the markets.US banks have raised reserves for loan losses by at least $6bn over the second quarter and by even larger amounts from last year, indicating financial executives believe consumers will be increasingly unable to make payments on a variety of loans.Banks are adding to reserves not just for defaults on mortgages, but also on home equity loans, car loans and credit cards.“What started out merely as a subprime problem has expanded more broadly in the mortgage space and problems are getting worse at a faster pace than many had expected,” said Michael Mayo, Deutsche Bank analyst.“On top of this, there is an uptick in auto loan problems, which may or may not be seasonal, and there is more body language from the banks that the state of the consumer was somewhat less strong [than thought].”Dick Bove, analyst at Punk Ziegel, said bank earnings indicated “there are problems with consumer debt that extend beyond the well-known issues in the real estate markets. Auto loans are clearly a new area of concern”. At Wachovia, the fourth largest US bank by assets, credit loss provisions more than doubled from the second quarter to $408m.Troubled loans that could turn into losses also more than doubled. Ken Thompson, chief executive, said the housing market could remain weak through next year. Wachovia’s poor earnings fuelled a stock market rout on Friday.Problems can be seen at banks across the US. At KeyCorp, in Cleveland, non-performing assets rose $241m from last year and loan-loss provisions doubled. In Dallas, Comerica’s loan loss provisions tripled from last year to $45m. Net credit losses jumped from $663m last year to $892 at Wells Fargo, in San Francisco, due to home equity and car loan losses. Loans more than 90 days past due and still accruing increased to $5.53bn from $3.66bn last year.“There has been a fast sea-change in thinking,” said Rick Klingman, interest rate trader at BNP Paribas. “Stocks are showing some real concern about bank earnings and there are worries about credit in general.”Additional reporting by Michael Mackenzie in New York
29;CMA;Comerica Inc;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
