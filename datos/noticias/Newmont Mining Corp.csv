In the quarter ending December 31, Newmont spent $506m buying back shares, it said.Shares in Newmont rose 1.3 per cent to $43.39 in morning trading on the news.
1;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2019-03-25T15:12:31Z;Newmont offers special dividend to shareholders to back Goldcorp transaction;;Newmont Mining has offered a special dividend to its shareholders to win their approval for its coming $10bn takeover of Canadian gold miner Goldcorp, following public opposition by two large investors.Newmont said its large shareholders had made it clear they wanted to receive the benefits of a recent joint venture announcement with Barrick Gold in Nevada rather than Goldcorp shareholders.Last week both New York hedge fund Paulson & Co and fund management group Van Eck said they would not support the Goldcorp transaction unless the agreed 17 per cent premium was eliminated.“We are pleased to make this special dividend payable to Newmont’s current shareholders in recognition of the potential synergy value of the Nevada joint venture agreement,” Gary Goldberg, Newmont’s chief executive, said. “We have continued to engage with, and have listened carefully to, our shareholders, and we are pleased that several of our largest shareholders have expressed their support for the combination with Goldcorp.”The dividend of 88 cents a share will be paid to all Newmont shareholders as of April 17, and is conditional upon them approving the Goldcorp transaction in shareholder votes next month. It will be paid on May 1, Newmont said.A spokesman for Paulson & Co said they are “currently evaluating the announcement.”Newmont fended off a hostile acquisition attempt by Barrick Gold this month by agreeing to form a joint venture with the Canadian miner in Nevada, where they both have big operations, instead.Barrick had attempted to take over Newmont and thwart its planned acquisition of Goldcorp.Once the largest gold producer in the world Vancouver-based Goldcorp has struggled over the past few years with its shares down by over 70 per cent since 2011.
2;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2019-03-22T19:17:22Z;Second major investor opposes Newmont-Goldcorp merger;;VanEck, one of the largest investors in Newmont Mining, has become the second investor to call on the gold miner to reduce the premium it is paying in its $10bn acquisition of rival Goldcorp.New York-based fund manager Joe Foster said Newmont was giving too much value to Goldcorp shareholders following a tie-up with Barrick Gold in Nevada, which was agreed this month.“The Nevada JV [between] Newmont and Barrick did not exist when the Goldcorp deal was announced,” he said. “That is creating a lot of value for shareholders. The Goldcorp shareholders are not entitled to that value, it’s not in the deal price.”Van Eck’s statement comes a day after New York hedge fund Paulson & Co called on Newmont to reduce the 17 per cent premium it agreed to pay to acquire Goldcorp in January.Shareholders for both companies will vote on the deal next month.Newmont fended off a hostile acquisition attempt by Barrick Gold this month by agreeing to form a joint venture with the Canadian miner in Nevada instead.Barrick had attempted to take over Newmont and thwart its planned acquisition of Goldcorp.Once the largest gold producer in the world, Vancouver-based Goldcorp has struggled over the past few years with its shares down by over 70 per cent since 2011. Newmont has argued that it can run Goldcorp’s mines better and find more gold.Mr Foster said he was also opposed to a planned payout for Goldcorp’s chairman Ian Telfer if the deal goes through. Mr Telfer’s retirement allowance is set to increase to $12m from $4.5m after the acquisition.“It just puts a black mark on the industry when you see stuff like that happening,” Mr Foster said.Shares in Goldcorp fell by 3.4 per cent in Toronto to C$14.43.
3;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2019-03-21T21:31:46Z;John Paulson says he opposes Newmont Mining’s merger with Goldcorp;;New York hedge fund Paulson & Co said it opposes Newmont Mining’s planned $10bn acquisition of Canada’s Goldcorp, saying it shouldn’t reward Goldcorp shareholders by paying a premium.John Paulson, one of the largest investors in the gold sector, said it was “unable to support the transaction” unless the premium was eliminated since all the benefits of a recent tie-up with Barrick Gold in Nevada would accrue to Goldcorp shareholders.“We believe that in order for this combination to add value for Newmont shareholders, it must be renegotiated to eliminate the premium paid and the sharing of the Nevada synergies,” Mr Paulson said in a letter to Newmont’s chief executive Gary Goldberg.The letter comes just a week after Newmont fended off a hostile acquisition attempt by rival Barrick Gold by agreeing to form a joint venture with the Canadian miner in Nevada.Barrick had attempted to take over Newmont and thwart its planned acquisition of Goldcorp, which was announced in January.Paulson, which said it owns 14.2m shares of Newmont Mining, said Goldcorp shareholders should receive 0.254 in Newmont shares in the deal rather than the agreed 0.328 of Newmont shares.When it was announced in January the deal represented a premium of 17 per cent over Goldcorp’s 20-day volume weighted average share price.“At this level, the transaction would generate value for Newmont shareholders, while providing Goldcorp shareholders attractive consideration and an opportunity to participate in the shared upside of the combined company,” Mr Paulson said.Mr Paulson has been one of the most active gold investors in recent years, and was one of the leading fund managers behind the formation of a Shareholders’ Gold Council last year designed to boost the performance of gold miners.Mr Paulson rose to fame after the financial crisis, when Paulson & Co made billions of dollars from predicting the US housing crisis.
4;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2019-03-12T05:00:32Z;New York’s Four Seasons plays home to a gold mining deal;Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT’s daily deals briefing;"FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.A DD scoop to start: Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, Germany’s Axel Springer and the world’s largest rating agencies are among the list of companies set to enter a bidding war for Acuris, the owner of Mergermarket, as the auction gets under way this week. A number of companies have thrown their hat into the ring and while it’s too early to tell which group is in pole position, DD will keep you posted. Now back to the show . . .It may be in a new spot. Its longtime maître’d may have been ousted. But New York’s Four Seasons Restaurant still manages to be the destination where power brokers come to broker deals.The latest example came last Tuesday when Barrick Gold’s chief executive Mark Bristow stopped by to break bread with Newmont Mining boss Gary Goldberg.This was no ordinary gathering. The two gold mining executives were locked in a nasty war of words with the future of the industry at stake. Days earlier, Barrick launched a hostile $18bn, nil-premium, all-share bid to buy Newmont. The deal would create the world’s largest gold producer.Newmont rejected the bid. It countered with a proposal to form a joint venture in Nevada where the companies have assets that sit side by side. The prospect of combining their Nevada holdings hold out the possibility of some of the easiest synergies to unlock in the mining business, if they can get beyond two decades of rivalry and flirtation over a deal.The JV offer provided enough cover for Bristow, a tough-talking, big game huntin’ South African, to huddle with Goldberg, an American who graduated from Rio Tinto’s Top Gun mining school — a sort of miner’s miner — over dinner.Newmont said the talks were constructive, but DD was sceptical. Shareholders wanted the two sides to resolve matters, and the tough talk seemed personal and the egos involved massive. Those aren’t the sort of conditions that lead to a healthy, positive outcome. Get smart on the background and the characters by reading last Friday’s DD briefing.Yet on Monday, we learnt just how constructive the talks were. The two companies unveiled a joint venture that allowed both sides to walk away claiming victory.Barrick will take a 61.5 per cent stake in a joint venture company, with Newmont holding the remainder. As a standalone business, it’ll be the world’s biggest producer of gold with 4.1m ounces of production a year.Bristow will have the luxury of running the combined mine, while Goldberg gets to cement his planned $10bn takeover of Goldcorp, which will make Newmont the biggest gold company in the world.Happy ending, right? Now the two sides have to prove that they can actually work together. The titanic egos were on show as Bristow and Goldberg tried to claim credit for the breakthrough and argue that they got the better end of the transaction. Scratch beneath the surface of this deal and a number of thorny issues remain.That made DD think of this valedictory piece by our outgoing business editor Sarah Gordon, which is a drop everything, print out and keep must read, if you haven’t already.Sarah talks about her two decades writing about business for the FT and the egomaniacs that manage to convince themselves they’re value-creating gurus.The good news for Barrick and Newmont shareholders is that no money is changing hands; no stock is being issued for their JV deal.China’s internet and gaming giant Tencent has stakes in more than 700 companies across the world and holds board seats on more than 400 of them. About 30-40 per cent of its investments are outside China. The value of its portfolio is estimated at about $70bn — approaching the size of SoftBank’s far higher-profile Vision Fund.In just three years, Tencent has become one of China’s top overseas investors. Read more at the FT here.“Many people asked us if we are going to reduce our level of investments this year,” said Martin Lau, Tencent’s president, at a recent investor day. “I tell everyone right now. We will not do this.”But some venture capital insiders are starting to question Tencent’s endgame: is it building a massive ecosystem across its investments, or have its investment banker leaders gone too far?Companies in China often welcome the investment as a way to grab rapid market share. Tencent offers them the chance to reach more than a billion users. To achieve scale, they need either the Shenzhen-based company or its eastern Chinese rival Alibaba, especially in areas such as ecommerce. “It’s almost impossible to succeed in China retail without Alibaba or Tencent,” said James Root, a Hong Kong-based partner at Bain & Co.In this way Tencent is stitching together what appears to be a massive ecosystem of companies, services and technologies. By taking in investment from the company you become part of that universe, or so the argument goes.Some observers, though, are questioning how concerted the Tencent ecosystem really is, and have acknowledged that it is beginning to look like the work of investment bankers gone wild. Before joining Tencent, Lau was an M&A banker at Goldman Sachs, and James Mitchell, his chief strategy officer, worked as an equity analyst at the US bank.“When you put a basketball player in the room, you know what they’re going to do,” shrugged one venture capital investor. “If you hire Goldman Sachs bankers, you know what they are going to do.”At this point, some of the same criticisms aimed at the Vision Fund — reckless levels of investment that’ll be hard to gain returns on — can be applied to Tencent.Last week we introduced you to the key players deciding the future of Germany’s embattled Deutsche Bank (in case you need a refresh click here).

5;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2019-03-11T18:19:16Z;Barrick Gold drops $18bn hostile bid for Newmont;Gold producers agree to create joint venture from duo’s Nevada mines;Barrick Gold has dropped an $18bn hostile bid for Newmont Mining after agreeing a deal to combine operations in the US state of Nevada.Under the deal, Barrick will operate a new joint venture company and take a 61.5 per cent stake, with Newmont holding the remainder. As a standalone business, it will be the world’s biggest producer of gold, with 4.1m ounces of production a year.The deal marks the end of a fierce bid battle by Barrick that descended into each side attacking the other’s management. It also caps 20 years of efforts by the two rival companies to work together in Nevada.On Monday, both companies rushed to claim victory for the creation of the partnership, which had originally been proposed by Newmont.Mark Bristow, Barrick’s South African chief executive, said the two sides had come to an agreement after he had dinner with Gary Goldberg, Newmont’s chief executive, at the Four Seasons in New York on Tuesday. That progressed to talks in Toronto on Thursday and an agreement that was signed in Elko, Nevada, on Sunday, he said.“I’ve managed to convince Gary that this was a do-able thing and he got to the same point very quickly,” Mr Bristow told the Financial Times. “It’s a completely deliverable transaction.”Mr Bristow said the deal would create value for Barrick shareholders without “issuing a single share”.Last week Newmont formally rejected Barrick’s all-share bid, with Mr Goldberg calling it “egocentric”. It countered with a proposal for a joint venture with a 55 per cent share for Barrick, which Mr Bristow also quickly dismissed.“Nevada JV is not the right path forward,” Barrick said in a hastily assembled presentation at the time.But the mood changed after some of Newmont and Barrick’s largest shareholders indicated their preference for a joint venture over a takeover of Newmont. Barrick has only just completed its $6bn acquisition of Randgold and some shareholders worried that another deal would be taking on too much, too quickly.Tom Palmer, Newmont’s incoming chief, who will take over from Mr Goldberg this year, said the deal came about due to the encouragement of the company’s shareholders.“I think it was the combination of us putting out a constructive proposal to realise the synergies that everyone knew were there in Nevada, and listening to shareholders,” he said.The two sides agreed on the ownership split based on the valuation ascribed to the assets by analysts, he added. Barrick will have three seats on the board and Newmont two.Mr Bristow won a victory by becoming the operator of the joint venture. Newmont had previously proposed that key management roles be jointly appointed.Barrick and Newmont said the venture would generate an estimated $500m in annual pre-tax synergies in its first five full years.Other terms of the deal, which were criticised by Mr Bristow a week ago, have not materially changed.Barrick’s increased shareholding reflects the fact that Newmont has not included its Cripple Creek & Victor gold mine in Colorado, which was included in its original proposal.Also not included is Barrick’s Fourmile exploration asset in Nevada, which can be placed in the joint venture if it meets certain targets.Mr Bristow refused to say whether this had been Barrick’s plan all along. “At the end of the day, we have reached an agreement,” he said.
6;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2019-03-06T18:32:25Z;Barrick chief faces test of credentials and time;Mark Bristow has an uphill battle to win over Newmont shareholders;Mark Bristow is in a race against time as he tries to create a gold mining colossus worth $40bn through a merger of Barrick Gold, the company he runs, with its arch rival Newmont Mining.In a month’s time Newmont shareholders will vote on a $10bn takeover of Vancouver-based Goldcorp. If they approve the deal, it would in effect make the US miner bid proof and stifle Mr Bristow’s plan to create “the world’s best gold company”.It promises to be a hard fought contest as both sides try to rally support in the next few weeks from a core group of key shareholders who have large stakes in both companies. These include BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, New York-based Van Eck, and Germany’s Flossbach von Storch.To succeed, Mr Bristow will not only have to persuade Newmont shareholders to vote down the Goldcorp deal — which he said was “ill-conceived” and unlikely to deliver significant benefits — but also convince them he can run a merged Barrick-Newmont. It will be no easy task.Newmont has already knocked back Mr Bristow’s $18bn hostile offer and countered with a proposal to combine the two producers’ lucrative Nevada operations in a joint venture. That plan has already received the backing of some investors who are sceptical of megamergers because of a history of wasteful deals in the mining industry, including Barrick’s $7.3bn purchase of copper miner Equinox in 2011.“We know there’s a lot of value to be created in Nevada and there’s an opportunity here to create value by doing a JV so that’s my first choice,” said Joe Foster, a fund manager at New York-based Van Eck, which is the biggest shareholder in Barrick and owns a 5.9 per cent stake in Newmont.Newmont is also prepared to play dirty. This week it released private email correspondence from 2017 in which Mr Bristow praised Goldcorp’s “strong portfolio” of assets in “world-class districts”.At the same time, it has attacked Mr Bristow’s record at Randgold Resources, the Africa-focused gold miner he co-founded and sold to Barrick last year.“There is no doubt that Mark has been successful as an explorer and a geologist,” Gary Goldberg, Newmont chief executive, told analysts this week. “As an operator, he has not created shareholder value, and he has yet to prove that he can successfully manage or integrate a global portfolio.”But Mr Bristow, a straight-talking South African who likes to hunt big game, is not easily intimidated. “We are definitely not going to withdraw our offer,” he said.The battle between Barrick and Newmont comes as the gold industry tries to revive its fortunes after being shunned by investors who have grown tired of the sector’s lacklustre returns, profligate spending and excessive executive pay.The $6bn acquisition of London-listed Randgold by Barrick last year raised the prospect of further consolidation in a sector where there are multiple mid-sized gold producers.Combining Barrick and Newmont would create a company with more than 10m ounces of production from mines on five continents around the world.The two rivals have been circling each other for decades and came close to a deal in 2014, but the talks collapsed because of disagreements over governance roles and where to locate a head office.Those old rivalries have been quick to resurface with Barrick’s nil-premium offer unleashing a bitter war of words between the two companies.Mr Goldberg described Barrick’s all-share bid as “desperate and bizarre”, while Mr Bristow claimed he could run Newmont better than its current executives.Mr Bristow also questioned whether Newmont really wants to do a deal in Nevada, or is playing for time as its attempt to push through the Goldcorp deal.“Newmont’s latest proposal is essentially based on the stale and convoluted process that foundered previously. As usual, it comes with unrealistic preconditions including swapping the chairmanship and the leadership of the JV,” said Mr Bristow. “Experience has shown us that JVs only work well when the majority owner is also the operator.”The state of Nevada, where both companies have neighbouring operations, is the focal point of Barrick’s bid, accounting for more than two-thirds of the projected annual synergies of $750m.Mr Bristow has said a deal for Newmont could unlock another 20 years of profitable gold production in the state.“That’s where most of the value is created in the short term. It’s probably the key to determining where this gets to,” said Alasdair McKinnon, a fund manager at the Scottish Investment Trust and a Newmont shareholder.Tom Palmer, Newmont’s incoming chief executive who previously worked at Rio Tinto, said the Goldcorp takeover and a Nevada JV are not mutually exclusive and its shareholders can benefit from both.He said the proposal for Barrick to have 55 per cent of the JV and Newmont 45 per cent was not set in stone and could be adjusted.“For us it’s a starting point to get people to the table,” Mr Palmer said.Mr Bristow — who believes a 63-37 per cent split is more equitable — discussed the proposal over dinner with Mr Goldberg in New York on Tuesday night.However, key to the bid battle could be BlackRock. The world’s largest asset manager is also the biggest shareholder in Newmont. Some of its 15 per cent stake held by BlackRock is managed by Evy Hambro, one of the most influential mining investors in the world. BlackRock declined to comment.Some analysts and investors have said that if the miners cannot reach terms on a JV, Barrick may need to pay a premium to secure Newmont.“We doubt a zero premium is likely to persuade Newmont shareholders. Although a premium [in cash] might be successful,” said Mathew Hocking, analyst at JPMorgan.While Mr Bristow has ruled that out for now, the hard-driving miner knows the clock is ticking.“Time is of the essence,” he added.
7;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2019-03-06T08:57:48Z;Newmont Mining says initial talks with Barrick ‘constructive’;Chief executives meet to discuss Nevada joint venture over dinner;Newmont Mining said initial talks with rival Barrick Gold on a joint venture in Nevada, which could generate hundreds of millions of dollars in cost savings, had been “constructive”.Tom Palmer, who will take over the US gold miner this year, said a dinner between Newmont’s chief executive Gary Goldberg and Barrick’s Mark Bristow in New York on Tuesday was a starting point to work out a deal.“We’re very genuine about putting on the table a draft JV term sheet,” Mr Palmer told the Financial Times ahead of meetings with leading shareholders in London. “To get a resolution, to exercise value for shareholders.”The comments come after Colorado-based Newmont rejected an $18bn hostile bid by Canada’s Barrick on Monday, offering instead a proposal for a joint venture in Nevada, where both companies have sizeable operations.Newmont is attempting to win support for its $10bn acquisition of Canadian gold miner Goldcorp, which will be voted on next month by shareholders.Mr Palmer said Newmont’s initial proposal for Barrick to have 55 per cent of the joint venture and Newmont 45 per cent was just a starting point for discussions.Mr Bristow rejected Newmont’s proposal this week, saying it did not reflect the value of Barrick’s assets in the US state of Nevada.Mr Palmer claimed Mr Bristow and Barrick had since had time to reflect on the proposal.“For us it’s a starting point to get people to the table,” he said.“By the end of the day I think there’s been a bit of reflection and appropriate consideration of what has been proposed,” he said.If the two sides were not able to reach an agreement on a joint venture in Nevada, Mr Palmer said Newmont would be prepared to publish a detailed study on the potential costs savings.“If necessary, yes,” he said.Van Eck, a top five shareholder in Barrick and Newmont, said on Tuesday that a study would allow investors to decide the best way forward if discussions between Barrick and Newmont reached an impasse.Asked why Newmont and Barrick have not combined operations in Nevada, one of the largest sources of gold in the world, before Mr Palmer said it was because there had not been a party “sitting across the table” willing to talk.Some analysts and investors believe the joint venture proposal is a tactic to divert Barrick’s attention while it tries to push through its takeover of Goldcorp.But Mr Palmer said it was a genuine proposal and the best way forward was the acquisition of Goldcorp and a JV with Barrick.“You can have both,” Mr Palmer said.Mr Palmer said Newmont had filed a draft proxy statement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and expected a vote on the Goldcorp deal to happen in mid to late April.He said that he had put a “compelling argument” on the Goldcorp transaction and JV to shareholders this week, including BlackRock, the largest shareholder of Newmont.
8;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2019-03-05T19:48:58Z;Barrick’s biggest shareholder calls for JV with Newmont;Van Eck says rival goldminers should publish joint study of benefits and let shareholders decide;One of the biggest shareholders in Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining has called on the two companies to agree a joint venture in Nevada that could generate hundreds of millions of dollars in cost savings.New York-based Van Eck said if the two bitter rivals could not reach an agreement they should publish a detailed study of the benefits and let shareholders decide.Joe Foster, fund manager at Van Eck, told the Financial Times, “We know there’s a lot of value to be created in Nevada and there’s an opportunity here to create value by doing a JV so that’s my first choice.”The comments from Van Eck come as the chief executives of Barrick and Newmont meet in New York for discussions on a JV, a day after Newmont rejected Barrick’s audacious $18bn hostile bid for the company.“If these two adversaries cannot come to terms on Nevada, we call on them to prioritise their shareholder’s interests by publishing a joint definitive feasibility study that quantifies the value and articulates plans to unlock it,” Mr Foster said. “Once this is done, the best path forward should become obvious.”While Mr Foster did not say he would oppose Barrick’s bid for Newmont, he did question the logic of megamergers in the gold industry. Barrick completed its $6bn purchase of Randgold, the London-listed gold miner, in January.“In addition to the considerable skills needed to manage so many mines, it may be geologically impossible to sustain a gold company that is as large as these companies are becoming,” he said in an investor letter.Van Eck is one of a small group of shareholders with stakes in both companies that will be pivotal in determining whether Newmont merges with Barrick or instead completes its planned $10bn acquisition of Canadian gold miner Goldcorp.Newmont shareholders are due to vote in April on the Goldcorp deal, leaving Barrick chief executive Mark Bristow only a matter of weeks to convince shareholders of the merits of his bid.Although Mr Bristow has not ruled out a JV in Nevada, he said on Monday he was not sure it was the best way to proceed.“Nevada, with a combined 76m ounces, will be worth a whole lot more if it is run by one operator,” he said on Monday. “Experience has shown us that JVs only work well when the majority owner is also the operator,” he added.Newmont has suggested that a JV would be managed by both companies with ownership split 45 per cent for Newmont and 55 per cent for Barrick.Van Eck owns 5.9 per cent of Newmont and is Barrick’s biggest shareholder with a 6.3 per cent stake.Mr Foster said there could be “significant value to be gained from merging” the two companies’ Nevada operations. But shareholders do not have the data, resources or technical expertise to evaluate such a proposal, he added.
9;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
10;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2019-03-05T15:38:32Z;Barrick and Newmont CEOs to meet in New York after rejected hostile bid;;The chief executives of Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining will meet in New York on Tuesday to discuss a proposal for a joint venture following Newmont’s rejection of Barrick’s hostile $18bn bid for the gold mining company.Gary Goldberg, chief executive of Newmont, and Mark Bristow, chief executive of Barrick, will meet to discuss Mr Goldberg’s plans for a joint venture in Nevada, according to a person close to the companies.The meeting comes a day after Newmont formally rejected Barrick’s hostile all-stock nil-premium offer, with Mr Goldberg calling it “egocentric.”Newmont insisted its planned $10bn takeover of Canada’s Goldcorp was the best deal for shareholders. Newmont shareholders are set to vote on that deal in the second quarter of this year.Mr Goldberg instead proposed a JV in Nevada to capture the benefits that Barrick proposed in its bid. It would be managed by both companies with ownership split 45 per cent for Newmont and 55 per cent for Barrick.But Mr Bristow dismissed that idea on Monday, saying that JVs only work when the majority owner is also the operator and that Newmont’s proposal is “essentially based on the stale and convoluted process that foundered previously.”In an updated investor presentation on Tuesday, Barrick said Newmont’s deal with Goldcorp would dilute the quality of Newmont’s assets.It argued that a merger between Barrick and Newmont would give shareholders over three times the exposure to “Tier One” gold assets.
11;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2019-03-04T21:28:38Z;Barrick chief says willing to talk with Newmont over Nevada;Time of the essence, says Mark Bristow after $18bn bid rejected;Barrick Gold’s chief Mark Bristow said he’s willing to talk to rival Newmont about a deal to work together in Nevada but Barrick had to run the operations.Mr Bristow said he will soon send a formal invitation to Newmont’s chief executive Gary Goldberg for discussions, following Newmont’s rejection of Barrick’s hostile $18bn bid for the company on Monday.“My suggestion is that Gary gets his team up here tomorrow,” Mr Bristow told the Financial Times. “Time is of the essence.”Newmont said on Monday that it had rejected Barrick’s hostile bid for the company and that a joint venture in Nevada, where both companies have substantial operations, makes more sense.Newmont proposed a JV structure for Nevada that would be managed by both companies with ownership split 45 per cent for Newmont and 55 per cent for Barrick.But Mr Bristow said that JV’s only work when the majority owner is also the operator and that Newmont’s proposal is “essentially based on the stale and convoluted process that foundered previously.”“You need to have one person responsible and in control,” Mr Bristow said. “We are not fund managers, we are not allocators of capital. We are drivers of value and deliverables as a business.”Earlier talks in 2014 between Barrick and Newmont to co-operate in Nevada broke down after both sides failed to agree on terms for a JV.Mr Bristow questioned whether Newmont was being “genuine” with its proposal or just trying to buy time while it attempted to push through its $10bn acquisition of Goldcorp.Mr Bristow asked why Newmont had included the 360,000-ounce-a-year Cripple Creek & Victor mine in Colorado in the Nevada JV and if the proposed 55-45 per cent split was fair.“I don’t believe Colorado is part of Nevada,” said Mr Bristow. “If you look at consensus valuation [of the Nevada assets] the split should be more 63 per cent and 37 per cent.”Newmont says it sends gold concentrate from CC&V to a mill in Nevada because it has a high sulphur content, which provides fuel for a processing technique called roasting.
12;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2019-03-04T19:51:26Z;Newmont rejects $18bn hostile approach by rival Barrick;Miner insists $10bn plan to take over Goldcorp is better for shareholders;Newmont Mining has rebuffed an $18bn hostile takeover offer from rival Barrick Gold that would have created the world’s largest gold miner, instead proposing a plan to combine the two producers’ lucrative Nevada operations in a joint venture.Gary Goldberg, Newmont’s chief executive, said a previously agreed $10bn takeover of Canada’s Goldcorp was the best deal for shareholders as he dismissed Barrick’s offer as “egocentric”.“The combination with Goldcorp is significantly more accretive to Newmont’s shareholders on all relevant metrics compared with Barrick’s proposal,” Mr Goldberg said.A merger of Barrick and Newmont would create a gold-mining giant with annual production of more than 10m ounces. However, Barrick has not offered a premium, telling shareholders they would benefit from the value created by merging the two companies.A deal will ultimately be decided by a small group of shareholders who own both companies. Newmont’s Mr Goldberg and Tom Palmer — who will take over from Mr Goldberg later this year — will meet shareholders this week, including BlackRock, the largest shareholder in Newmont.The investors will debate whether the two companies’ operations in Nevada are best combined either via a joint venture or a takeover by Barrick. Barrick has significant reserves in Nevada, while Newmont also has large processing facilities in the US state.Under Newmont’s proposal Barrick would have a 55 per cent economic interest in the Nevada venture and Newmont 45 per cent — a split that would also be reflected in their respective voting rights.“Newmont has consistently expressed to Barrick that we are open to a joint venture for our operations in Nevada,” said Mr Goldberg. “This proposal would enable both companies’ shareholders to realise the available synergies while avoiding the significant risks and complexities associated with Barrick’s unsolicited proposal.”But Mark Bristow, Barrick’s chief executive, said the joint venture proposal reinforced the frustration Barrick had experienced in its efforts to unlock the value in the two companies’ assets in Nevada.“Newmont’s latest proposal is essentially based on the stale and convoluted process that foundered previously. As usual, it comes with unrealistic preconditions including swapping the chairmanship and the leadership of the JV. Experience has shown us that JVs only work well when the majority owner is also the operator,” he said.Mr Goldberg raised doubts over the ability of Mr Bristow to run a global company and realise the promised $750m of annual cost savings and synergies.“Prior to assuming his new role at Barrick, Mark managed only five assets on one continent — he has never managed a global portfolio like Barrick’s,” Mr Goldberg said.A combination of Barrick and Newmont would create a company with operations on five continents in 18 different countries.“The risks are too huge: the integration risks, the ESG [environmental, social and governance] risks of having Barrick running both companies are huge,” Mr Palme told the Financial Times.Mr Bristow was appointed chief executive of Barrick this year following the takeover of Randgold Resources, the London-listed gold producer he co-founded.Mr Goldberg said that John Thornton, Barrick’s executive chairman and a former Goldman Sachs banker, was the “ultimate decision maker” in the company.In a sign of the growing hostilities between the two companies, Newmont released private communications between Mr Bristow and Ian Telfer, Goldcorp chairman, in which Mr Bristow praised Goldcorp’s “strong portfolio” of assets in “world-class districts”.Mr Bristow has criticised Newmont’s plan to buy Goldcorp’s “second-tier assets” as “desperate and bizarre”.
13;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2019-03-01T17:30:32Z;Barrick Gold chief sets sights on conquering mining world;Game hunter Mark Bristow aims to expand empire beyond Africa with Newmont bid;Mark Bristow, the straight-talking chief executive of Barrick Gold, is a life-long adventurer and adrenalin junkie. He has driven motorcycles across Africa for charity, run marathons, hunted big game and enjoys flying. With characteristic bluntness, he has said that any gold miner “needs to have balls”.After the Barrick-Randgold merger was announced last year, pictures soon emerged of Mr Bristow standing proudly behind slain animals with a gun.“I’m a passionate African. I love the wildlife. I’ve spent my whole life involved in conservation,” he said. “I don’t think it’s got anything to do with my ability to run a world-class gold business.”A long-time critic of the gold industry’s wasteful mergers, he has also taken pot shots at investment bankers, accusing them of “mixing ice cream and cow shit” in order to pocket big advisory fees.Over the past five years his quarterly briefings to investors in London have nearly always been accompanied by a critique of the industry, which he said had been better at destroying than creating value for investors.Now, he has to convince investors that his $18bn hostile bid for rival Newmont Mining this week is different and will create value for shareholders rather than end up joining a long list of value-destructive mining mergers.Newmont’s chief executive Gary Goldberg said Mr Bristow was pursuing the same “hostile and value destructive tactics” as John Thornton, the former Goldman Sachs banker who chairs Barrick.But Mr Bristow, who took Barrick’s helm in January following the takeover of Randgold Resources, the London-listed gold miner he founded — insists the deal will deliver real returns.What I do is I get into the weeds. We run our business. We are businessmen. We are not corporate people that have processesHe accuses Newmont of running its business remotely from head-office, ticking corporate boxes rather than letting local managers run the mines.“Newmont is a big Rio Tinto-style business that doesn’t get down into the weeds, it has a process,” Mr Bristow said. “Whereas what I do is I get into the weeds. We run our business. We are businessmen. We are not corporate people that have processes.”If his tilt is successful, it would mark a remarkable ascent to the top of the gold-mining world for Mr Bristow, who was born as one of five children in Estcourt, a small farming town north of Durban in South Africa.Mr Bristow has won respect for operating in difficult countries in Africa and turning Randgold Resources into the best performing stock in London this century, with total returns of more than 7,000 per cent before its takeover.If the bid for Newmont is successful, he will be in charge of a huge company with operations from Latin America to Papua New Guinea.Leaving school at 18, he did active service in the South African army in what is now Namibia and Angola. He then studied geology at the University of Natal, going on to do a Masters and PhD thesis on platinum in the Bushveld Complex.Mr Bristow joined Rand Mines in 1981 and then became head of exploration at Randgold & Exploration, which was spun out of the company to manage its South African gold mines. In 1995 he decided to branch out on his own, raising money to buy a mine in Mali from BHP Billiton and listing Randgold Resources in London two years later.Mr Bristow’s key idea was to leave South Africa and explore for gold in French-speaking west Africa, which had been overlooked by the anglophone mining industry during the cold war.“Mark had the vision to form an African exploration company,” said David Reading, a geologist who followed Mark from Rand Mines to Randgold. “Mark was very passionate about strategy and delivery of strategic objectives. He had that famous saying that ‘if you don’t know where you want to go, any road will take you’. You have to have strategy in a company and a direction.”After an early setback in Mali, Randgold went on to build five mines in west Africa, shunning mergers and acquisitions after a failed bid for AngloGold Ashanti in 2003.“If you mix cow shit and ice cream, you never, never improve the taste of the cow shit,” Mr Bristow told journalists in January.“The principle behind that is stick to ice cream. It’s better. That’s what Randgold did. We tried very hard to be an ice cream company.”A workaholic who maintains a punishing travel schedule from his home in Mauritius, Mr Bristow has already instituted the “Randgold culture” at Barrick, cutting one entire floor of the head office in Toronto.Still, some have doubted that Mr Bristow has what it takes to play in the big league and run a complex global mining company that will employ tens of thousands of people and contractors.Mr Bristow has also experienced health problems. He had open-heart surgery in 2017 after a doctor spotted a problem during a routine medical to renew his pilot’s licence.“I was anxious about the whole thing,” Mr Bristow said last year. “The operation was tough. 11 hours. But I was walking on day two.”With his health restored and having largely conquered Africa, the question for investors is whether he can conquer the rest of the world by creating the most powerful force in the global mining industry. It is a bold move from an adventurer whose risk-taking has paid off in the past.
14;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2019-03-01T13:22:52Z;Barrick chief Bristow rules out higher offer for Newmont;Boss of gold miner looks to convince investors of case for acquisition;Barrick Gold’s boss Mark Bristow has ruled out increasing his offer for arch rival Newmont Mining.Mr Bristow told the Financial Times the $18bn nil-premium, all-stock offer for Newmont was “logical” and would combine multiple world-class gold mines into one company.Asked if Barrick would increase its offer for Newmont, Mr Bristow said “no”.“What’s better than five world class assets? Eight,” Mr Bristow said. “We can demonstrate that it’s so logical . . . [Synergies] are about whether you put two things together is better or worse? And it’s far better.”Mr Bristow has to convince a small group of investors who have shareholdings in both companies that the deal makes more sense than Newmont’s planned $10bn acquisition of Vancouver-based Goldcorp, which was announced in January.BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has a 14.9 per cent stake in Newmont and a 6 per cent stake in Barrick.Earlier this week Mr Bristow spent an hour with Evy Hambro, the head of Blackrock’s influential mining fund, discussing the merits of his offer, according to a person familiar with the meeting.“I am working so hard to get the shareholders to decide. Let the shareholders decide and my proposal gives them a better option than what the new team in Newmont says,” Mr Bristow said. “This proposal will fly or die on the merits, it has to,” he added.Combining Barrick and Newmont would create a company with more than 10m ounces of annual production, far surpassing any of its rivals, with revenues of $15.6bn and underlying earnings of $7bn.On Thursday Barrick gave more details of the benefits of the deal with Newmont.In an updated investor presentation, Barrick provided a detailed breakdown of $500m of annual synergies its said could be unlocked by combining their respective operations in the US state.
15;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2019-02-28T14:40:31Z;Barrick fires further salvo at Newmont;;Barrick Gold has fired a further salvo at arch rival Newmont Mining as it seeks to persuade shareholders to back its $18bn hostile offer.In an updated investor presentation, Barrick rubbished the idea of a joint venture in Nevada and provided a detailed breakdown of $500m of annual synergies its said could be unlocked by combining their respective operations in the US state.It also took aim at Newmont’s performance and criticised its chief executive Gary Goldberg for not prioritising “the realisation of Nevada’s full potential.”“Newmont’s CEO admitted he hasn’t reviewed the opportunity since 2014, and only then a high level review for a couple of days,” the presentation said.It continued: “Nevada JV is not the right path forward. [It] would not enable full realisation of benefits due to duplicate administration, conflicting priorities and cumbersome governance.”Barrick launched its $18bn nil-premium offer for Newmont on Monday, unleashing a bitter war of words between two companies.Mr Goldberg has questioned whether his opposite number at Barrick, Mark Bristow, has the experience to run a global company.Mr Bristow, meanwhile, has slammed Newmont’s plan to buy miner Goldcorp, calling the $10bn acquisition “desperate and bizarre”.In Thursday’s presentation Barrick said it had outperformed Newmont by 20 per cent since its $6bn acquisition of Randgold Resources was announced in September.Mr Bristow was CEO of Randgold, which he helped build into London’s biggest gold before its sale to Barrick.However, some analysts and investors are concerned about his ability to take on another big deal while he is still trying to knit together Barrick and Randgold.Combining Barrick and Newmont would create a company with more than 10m ounces of annual production, far surpassing any of its rivals, with revenues of $15.6bn and underlying earnings of $7bn.“In our view both Newmont and Barrick management team are capable,” said analysts at Credit Suisse in a report. “However, we note that Barrick’s bid for Newmont suggests that, if successful, it would have to simultaneously integrate Randgold and Newmont, which could be a tough task for even experienced senior executives”.Ultimately, the success of Barrick’s hostile bid will boil down to whether shareholders are prepared to accept Barrick’s nil-premium offer and believe Mr Bristow can deliver the promised synergies. So far, Mr Bristow has not been drawn on whether he will increase his offer.Newmont’s biggest shareholder is BlackRock, which owns 14.9 per cent of the company. The asset manager also has a 6.1 per cent stake in Barrick.In an interview with the Financial Times, Flossbach von Storch, the German asset manager that is a top-five investor in both gold miners, said the idea of combining the two companies was attractive if they could be integrated seamlessly.

Barrick’s chief executive Mark Bristow has claimed he could generate annual pre-tax synergies from the deal of $750m.One leading gold investor lobbying against the deal said the promised synergies were “fiction” and questioned Mr Bristow’s ability to deliver them.New York-based Coast Capital has written to shareholders in Newmont Mining urging them to oppose Barrick Gold’s bid, which it attacked as “poorly conceived and extraordinarily aggressive”.Shareholders’ Gold Council has not commented on the deal.“[The] synergies claimed by Bristow are taken as fact by investors and observers — but given the fact that most mergers fail to realise any synergies, we are well advised to have very tempered expectations,” according to a copy of the letter. “Indeed, if Barrick has 100 per cent confidence in these claimed synergies, why not pay 50 per cent of them at least to Newmont to secure the deal?”Coast Capital said Mr Bristow, who was previously chief executive of Africa-focused gold miner Randgold Resources, does not have a record of managing a company of this size with far-flung operations.In addition, photos of Mr Bristow hunting big game in Africa would not go down well with investors in North America, Coast Capital said.“I would rather not spend time in a room with someone who thinks that killing defenceless animals is what one should do with one’s life,” James Rasteh, partner at Coast Capital, said.The success of Barrick’s bid will be determined by a small group of investors who own shares in both companies. These include Flossbach von Storch and BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager.They must decide whether the deal makes more sense than Newmont’s planned $10bn acquisition of Vancouver-based Goldcorp, which was announced last month.In an aggressive move last week Barrick bought 1,000 shares of Newmont and proposed a motion to reduce the percentage required to call a shareholder vote to 15 per cent of shareholders from 25 per cent.Newmont’s biggest shareholder is BlackRock, which owns 14.9 per cent of the company. The asset manager also has a 6.1 per cent stake in Barrick.While most of the shares are owned by BlackRock’s iShares exchange traded funds business, a portion are held by the influential London-based BlackRock World Mining Trust, which is managed by Evy Hambro and Olivia Markham.BlackRock is also a large shareholder in Goldcorp, with a 7.2 per cent stake. If a deal is called off, shares in Goldcorp are likely to fall sharply.New York-based Van Eck Associates is the largest shareholder in Barrick and the third-largest shareholder of Newmont. Joe Foster, a gold fund manager at Van Eck, said he still had not formed a final opinion on the deal.
17;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2019-02-25T19:03:33Z;Barrick Gold launches $18bn hostile offer for Newmont ;All-share deal for US rival would create gold mining behemoth;Barrick Gold has launched a hostile $18bn all-stock offer for its closest rival Newmont Mining, unleashing a bitter war of words between two companies whose combination would create the world’s biggest gold producer. Toronto-listed Barrick said a nil-premium merger would offer greater benefits to shareholders than Newmont’s planned $10bn acquisition of Canadian miner Goldcorp, which it attacked as “desperate and bizarre”.Newmont hit back, defending its Goldcorp deal and saying Barrick had an “ineffective operating mode” and a “poor track record” on delivering shareholder returns. The US company said significant cost savings could be more effectively realised through a joint venture in Nevada, where both companies have significant gold deposits. Barrick’s offer for Newmont is the latest attempt to combine two fierce rivals that have flirted with a merger in the past. A potential tie-up collapsed at the last minute in 2014 because of personality clashes between senior executives. Barrick is led by chief executive Mark Bristow, a South African miner fond of big game hunting, and executive chairman John Thornton, an urbane former Goldman Sachs banker. Paying a 17 premium for Goldcorp with its second-tier assets and no synergies followed by the departure of the Newmont CEO strikes me as both desperate and bizarreThey are pitted against Newmont chief executive Gary Goldberg, a former Rio Tinto executive who is set to retire this year, and chair Noreen Doyle, also a former banker.The offer for Newmont is an extraordinarily bold gambit by Barrick, which is still digesting its $6bn purchase of Randgold Resources, the London-listed gold miner co-founded by Mr Bristow.The deal would create a $40bn company with more than 10m ounces of annual production, far surpassing any of its rivals, with revenues of $15.6bn and underlying earnings of $7bn. Barrick estimates there would be annual pre-tax synergies of $750m from the deal with Newmont in the first five years, primarily by combing their respective gold mines in Nevada. Further costs savings would be generated by closing Newmont’s head office in Denver and cutting staff, Mr Bristow said. Mines would be run by local managers, he said.“In this modern world — you don’t need a huge head office,” said Mr Bristow.In contrast, Newmont’s deal with Goldcorp will generate just $165m of annual synergies.“Paying a 17 premium for Goldcorp with its second-tier assets and no synergies followed by the departure of the Newmont CEO strikes me as both desperate and bizarre,” Mr Bristow said.Newmont shareholders will now have to decide whether to choose Barrick’s nil-premium offer or push ahead and vote in favour of the Goldcorp deal. Newmont has been one of the best-performing gold miners over the past decade and is the only gold miner in the S&P 500. “Where would you put your retirement money? Who would you want to invest in? We have a proven record of running a global mining company,” said Mr Goldberg. “Mark has done a great job of running an African-region business with mines all close to each other. It’s a different business running a global business.”Under the offer, Newmont shareholders would receive 2.5694 Barrick shares, giving them 44.1 per cent of the combined company. Barrick said the deal was conditional on Newmont scrapping its planned all-stock acquisition of Goldcorp, which has received a lukewarm response from investors.That takeover is due to close in the second quarter of 2019 after a shareholder vote and Goldcorp is entitled to a $650m fee if Newmont abandons the takeover.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Goldberg said he was “perplexed” by the offer and the two companies should instead work on a joint venture in Nevada. “You don’t need to go through all this hoopla they’re going through currently to extract that value,” he said.While Barrick has the majority of the high-grade gold reserves and resources in Nevada, Newmont has most of the processing plant capacity and infrastructure.Shares in Barrick fell 1 per cent to C$16.98, while Newmont dropped by 0.3 per cent to $36. Goldcorp was down 0.3 per cent to C$14.56. James Milligan, analyst at Olivetree Financial, said the success of the deal would depend on whether shareholders would back Mr Bristow and believe in his record of creating shareholder value while at Randgold.“We believe the gravitas of Mark Bristow and history of returning capital to shareholders may well enable Barrick to successfully negotiate a hostile acquisition of Newmont,” he said. 
18;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2019-02-25T13:04:12Z;Newmont chief ready to discuss Nevada potential with Barrick Gold;Gary Goldberg speaks after hostile all-share bid from Canadian rival;Gary Goldberg, the chief executive of Newmont Mining, said he is willing to sit down with Barrick Gold’s Mark Bristow to discuss a combination of their extensive gold mines in the US state of Nevada.Speaking minutes after the Canadian gold miner launched an $18bn hostile all-share bid for Newmont, Mr Goldberg said he was “perplexed” by the offer and the two companies should instead work on a joint venture in Nevada.Mr Goldberg said Barrick did not need to go through all the “hoopla” of making another big acquisition just months after it absorbed Randgold Resources, London’s biggest gold company.“A JV in Nevada makes a lot of sense,” Mr Goldberg told the Financial Times. “It’s what I talked to him [Mr Bristow] last about on December 20 and he seemed amenable to it. You don’t need to go through all this hoopla they’re going through currently to extract that value.”In a separate interview Mr Bristow claimed that Barrick had tried to engage Newmont in talks over a joint venture in Nevada several times in the past but had received a lukewarm response. He claimed that Mr Goldberg was unaware of the synergies of combining their extensive gold assets in the state.Barrick claims it could generate more than $1bn of synergies through a combination with Newmont.“We’re just moving dirt past each other,” Mr Bristow said about their operations in Nevada.
19;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2019-02-25T08:04:47Z;Barrick calls for Newmont shareholder proposal after bid consideration;;Newmont Mining said on Monday rival Barrick would propose making it easier for investors to call a shareholder meeting, following its consideration of a hostile bid for the gold miner. The US miner said Barrick, which owns a small stake in Newmont, intended to propose to shareholders that the threshold to requisition a meeting be lowered to 15 per cent from 25 per cent. That comes after Barrick last week reviewed making a nil-premium all-share approach for Newmont, a $19bn deal that would create the world’s largest gold miner. “Newmont does not intend to speculate about Barrick’s motivations or intentions and reserves all rights with respect to the shareholder proposals,” Newmont said.However, analysts said the move could allow Blackrock, which owns 14.9 per cent of Newmont, to emerge as kingmaker in a deal. The fund manager also owns 4.3 per cent of Barrick.Newmont said its proposed merger with gold miner Goldcorp represented the best value for shareholders. The deal, which is set to complete in the second quarter, will create a gold miner with assets on four continents and generate benefits of around $165m a year, it said. But Barrick could scupper that deal if it makes its own approach. Both Barrick and Newmont have large gold operations in Nevada, and Barrick’s chief executive Mark Bristow has said there are opportunities to work together in the state. Newmont and Barrick previously considered a merger in 2014 but the deal was scotched by Barrick’s executive chairman John Thornton, a former Goldman Sachs banker. Barrick owns 1,000 shares in Newmont, out of a total of 535m outstanding shares in the company. 
20;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2019-02-22T20:11:44Z;Barrick/Newmont: pan it;After past acquisitions that were less than glorious, the latest $19bn deal seems hubristic;People pay a premium for gold, but producers of the shiny stuff would rather not. Look at the two largest gold mining deals in the past six months. Barrick Gold acquired the UK’s Randgold for no premium. Last month Newmont Mining bid for Canada’s Goldcorp on a low-ish 17 per cent premium. Reports that Barrick may buy Newmont Mining, with no premium, continue the trend. Miners probably fear their shareholders.For good reason. As an example, until Randgold, Barrick had hardly covered itself in glory on past purchases. One in particular, its 2011 $7.6bn purchase of copper miner Equinox, rankled. Barrick’s debt jumped. Servicing it became harder as gold prices later fell. The nil premium $6bn takeover for Randgold, completed in January, made more sense given that it brought in well-regarded chief executive Mark Bristow. Randgold shareholders could benefit from a larger gold portfolio.However, tacking another nearly $19bn deal for US-listed Newmont appears hubristic. Put the two together and the new company easily tops the gold production table with well over 10m ounces a year, depending on any asset sales later. Even so, Barrick must have had potentially furious shareholders in mind. Its press release specifically mentions an all-share, nil premium deal.On those terms, and putting aside any regulatory objections, the combination would make financial sense, adding to earnings per share. Neither side holds much debt, so that is not a concern. Even if Newmont dropped the Goldcorp deal, adding a $650m break fee would not move that needle much. At the same time Barrick and Newmont have contiguous gold assets in Nevada, so there are potential cost savings there.However, Newmont shareholders might rightly ask why, if unappreciated Goldcorp deserved even a modest premium, their own company should receive none. That question should stop a Barrick-Newmont deal.Lex publishes two popular newsletters for premium subscribers. Wednesday: Lex Letter From London, New York or San Francisco.

It said no decision had been taken on a deal.If Barrick were to proceed it would mark a stunning offensive by Barrick’s chief Mark Bristow, the ambitious South African who was chief executive of Randgold, and executive chairman John Thornton, a former Goldman Sachs banker.It comes as gold prices hit their highest level in 10 months this week, a rally that has renewed interest in the gold sector following years of lacklustre returns and investor apathy.“It’s an enormous deal,” said Robert Gill, a fund manager a Lincluden Investment Management in Canada. “There’s an argument that can be made that for the gold sector to come back into favour, capital will move first to the largest players so there’s an incentive to be a large player.”The move threatens to thwart Newmont’s $10bn acquisition of Canadian miner Goldcorp, which it announced in January. The deal, which still needs to be voted on by shareholders, would create a larger gold miner than Barrick with production of 6m-7m ounces a year.If the Barrick-Newmont deal were to go ahead then Barrick would have to pay a break-up fee of $650m to Goldcorp. The size of the deal would also be closely scrutinised by competition authorities.Barrick is set to produce between 5.1m and 5.6m ounces of gold this year, while Newmont said this week it was targeting 5.2m ounces of gold production.Barrick’s statement on Friday followed media reports that the company was considering a takeover of Newmont, to be followed by the sale of its Australian mines to gold miner Newcrest.Newmont did not respond to questions on the announcement. Newcrest declined to comment.“Barrick Gold today confirmed that the company has reviewed the opportunity to merge with Newmont Mining Corporation in an all-share nil premium transaction,” Barrick said. “No decision has been taken at this time.”Barrick shares were down about 1 per cent at midday in New York while Newmont was up 5 per cent.Newmont’s proposed $10bn acquisition of Goldcorp drew a lukewarm response from analysts and investors when it was announced last month. Investors baulked at the 17 per cent premium Newmont had offered as well as the projected $100m of annual cost savings.Colorado-based Newmont, which was founded by promoter Colonel William Boyce Thompson in 1916, has no gold mines in Canada while Goldcorp has no mines in the US.Barrick and Newmont, however, both have large operations in Nevada, increasing the opportunities for cost savings and synergies. On February 13 Mr Bristow said there were “combination opportunities with other operators in the area”.There was an opportunity to combine their processing capacity in Nevada, Mr Bristow said. Bankers said there could be $1bn of synergies in Nevada if the two companies combined operations.“The Achilles heel of Nevada is the processing facilities,” he told the Financial Times.Newmont currently owns 25 per cent of Barrick’s Turquoise Ridge underground mine in Nevada. Turquoise Ridge has the highest grades of gold in the industry, according to Barrick.Barrick and Newmont discussed a merger in 2014 but talks were ended by Mr Thornton, according to Vincent Calarco, who was chairman of Newmont at the time. Mr Calarco said that efforts to find a consensus were “rejected out of hand repeatedly”.Additional reporting by Arash Massoudi in London
22;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2019-01-21T12:26:40Z;Newmont’s incoming CEO defends $10bn Goldcorp deal;;The incoming chief executive of the world’s largest gold miner says he’s confident Newmont Mining will be able to maintain profitable gold production at 6m to 7m ounces a year for “a couple of decades” following its $10bn acquisition of Goldcorp.Tom Palmer, who is set to replace Gary Goldberg as Newmont chief executive later this year following the closure of the deal, said there was an opportunity to find more gold at Goldcorp’s mines in Mexico, Argentina and Canada.“We see a real value proposition in this acquisition in bringing Newmont’s exploration expertise to bear on these assets,” Mr Palmer told the Financial Times. “We see real opportunity to leverage our technology and expertise in that space.”Shares in Colorado-based Newmont have fallen 9 per cent since it announced the deal to acquire Vancouver-based Goldcorp last Monday.Mr Palmer, who previously worked at Rio Tinto, said Newmont had sent its “best and brightest” to do due diligence on Goldcorp’s assets.Mr Palmer pointed to the potential for adding gold at Goldcorp’s remote Cerro Negro mine in Argentina as well as its Penasquito mine in northern Mexico.Goldcorp bought Cerro Negro for $3.6bn in 2010 but had to write down the project by $2.3bn in 2015. The mine is located 600m above sea level in southern Argentina.“When we look at Cerro Negro we see the opportunity to bring some of Newmont’s operational expertise to bear, we are quite excited about the exploration around that region,” he said.In Canada, Goldcorp’s Musselwhite mine below Opapimiskan Lake also has potential, Mr Palmer said. The Musselwhite mine includes some 17,500 hectares of mine claims and leases in the North Caribou Greenstone belt, according to Goldcorp.Mr Palmer, currently chief operating officer at Newmont, was recruited by Mr Goldberg to join Newmont in November 2014. They first met when they both worked for Rio Tinto.Still, Mr Palmer said the miner would not chase growth “for growth’s sake”.He added: “We’re not chasing volume.”
23;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2019-01-15T18:02:11Z;Newmont Mining shares down again in wake of Goldcorp takeover plan;;Shares in Newmont Mining fell again on Tuesday as its $10bn takeover of Canadian rival Goldcorp drew lukewarm response from analysts and investors.The New York-listed group announced plans to buy Goldcorp on Monday, a deal it said would create the world’s biggest gold producer with the biggest reserve and resource base in the industry. It will also take Newmont into new geographies such as Canada and Chile.“This is not a deal we have to do. This is a deal we want to do,” said Newmont chief executive Gary Goldberg.However, investors baulked at the 17 per cent premium Newmont said it would pay for its struggling rival and also the surprise news that Mr Goldberg would retire by the end of the year.All of that triggered a sharp fall in its share price, which continued on Tuesday. Newmont was down 2.6 per cent at $30.94, giving the company a market value of $16.4bn“While this transaction will give Newmont some growth potential and operational upside, we do not see the justification for Newmont to pay a significant (17 per cent) premium,” said Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina.The premium paid by Newmont is in stark contrast to the deal that saw Barrick Gold take control of London’s Randgold Resources. That was structured as a nil-premium merger.Others expressed disappointment at the projected $100m of annual cost savings from the Newmont-Goldcorp deal.“Newmont has nothing in Canada. Goldcorp don’t have anything in the US. The company came out and said they can save $100mln a year. Chopping out HQ costs will probably go some way to getting to that but from an asset and jurisdictional perspective, I don’t see the perfect fit,” said Numis Securities.
24;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2019-01-15T10:55:35Z;Investors hit out at payout due Goldcorp chief from Newmont deal;Shareholders’ Gold Council says David Garofalo ‘massively overpaid’ since appointment;A group of gold investors including New York hedge fund Paulson & Co has slammed Newmont’s planned $10bn acquisition of rival Goldcorp and the estimated $8m reward due its chief executive from the deal.The 16-member Shareholders’ Gold Council, which was formed last year to promote the interests of gold investors, said Goldcorp’s CEO, David Garofalo, had been “massively overpaid” since his appointment in 2016 and now stood to garner $8m due to change of control provisions in his contract.Shares in Vancouver-based Goldcorp have fallen by 26 per cent under Mr Garofalo, while he was paid over C$16m in aggregate compensation in 2016 and 2017, the group said. Newmont’s proposal on Monday will see it offer 0.3280 of its own shares for each Goldcorp share, plus 2 cents in cash, an 18 per cent premium to Friday’s closing price.“While Mr Garofalo has been massively overpaid, stockholders have lost over C$3.7bn since his appointment, and Goldcorp now wants to sell itself at only a slight premium to its 1,3,5,7 and 10-year low in share price,” the Shareholders’ Gold Council said.“The merger with Newmont is only a victory for shareholders in as much as it eliminates another gold company with executive incentives that are grossly misaligned with those of shareholders,” it added.Mr Garofalo said on Monday that he wasn’t clear yet whether he would stay on at the combined company following the deal.Newmont’s chief executive Gary Goldberg said he would remain in his position to close the acquisition after which the company’s chief operating officer Tom Palmer will take over.Newmont’s shares fell by 9 per cent following news of the deal on Monday to close at $31.78 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Goldcorp’s rose by 8 per cent to close at C$13.83 in Toronto.
25;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2019-01-15T01:33:17Z;Gold miners prepare to strike deals;Newmont’s tie-up with Goldcorp looks set to boost further M&A in fragmented sector;Who is next? That is the question investors are asking after Newmont Mining made a $10bn swoop for Canada’s Goldcorp, a deal that will create the world’s leading gold producer.Following Barrick Gold’s $6bn takeover of Randgold Resources last September, analysts now expect a flurry of dealmaking as the industry seeks to improve its performance and boost shareholder returns.“Now you’ve got these two large players with impressive production and renewed vigour, you’re going to see a number of the mid-tier players have to do something or want to do something,” said Robert Gill, a portfolio manager at Lincluden Investment Management in Canada.Others agree. The gold mining industry “can look forward to heightened levels of M&A over the next year or two,” said Michael Stoner, analyst at Berenberg in London.Gold miners have lost money for shareholders over the past five years, leading to calls for consolidation, a reduction in management pay and efforts to reduce costs and jettison marginal assets. Dismayed by a lack of action, last year a group of investors including hedge fund Paulson & Co formed a “Shareholders Gold Council” to pressurise miners to act.Canada’s Barrick Gold was the first to move and Mark Bristow, the chief executive of the combined group, has promised to slash head office costs and sell smaller mines.That has now been followed by Colorado-based Newmont, whose deal for Goldcorp promises to create an even bigger gold producer focused on its most productive assets.Newmont Goldcorp, as the merged company will be known, is targeting production of 6m to 7m ounces of gold annually as it moves into Canada and Chile. It will look to sell between $1bn and $1.5bn of mines but cost savings from the deal are relatively slim at $100m a year.“Simply put, this is not a deal we have to do. This is a deal that we want to do,” said Gary Goldberg, chief executive of Newmont.“Combining forces will also give us the sectors’ best project pipeline and exploration portfolio in terms of quality and depth.”The recent dealmaking in the gold sector comes as investors rediscover their appetite for the metal. As global equity markets have swooned and concerns about slowing global growth have intensified, gold has risen to a six-month high of close to $1,300 a troy ounce.Analysts say there is an obvious need for consolidation in the gold mining industry because it is more fragmented than in other commodities, such as iron ore, where three large miners dominate the market.“There is more consolidation to come in gold,” predicted Jonathan Guy, an analyst at Numis Securities in London. “If you look at iron ore, copper, nickel . . . all these sectors are more consolidated. Gold has always had far more companies than is justified by the size of the industry. This is needed.”“But the real question is who is next?” he added, saying that Canada’s Kinross Gold and Agnico Eagle would feel the pressure to do deals. Gold miners in Australia and South Africa could also be forced to act, he said.Bankers point to Melbourne-based Newcrest Mining as one company that is keen to make acquisitions. “Newcrest is out there with nobody to dance with,” one banker said.However, Stephen Walker, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, reckoned Newmont’s purchase of Goldcorp could actually slow consolidation — at least for a time.“We believe this second combination of two senior global gold producers, could delay further M&A . . . as companies seek to acquire non-core assets expected to be sold by Newmont Goldcorp and new Barrick,” he said.A host of mid-tier gold miners are keen to buy unwanted assets from both Newmont and Barrick if they can raise the finance.“We’ve had people already reaching out today with interest in different things . . . but we need to go through a methodical process,” said Mr Goldberg on Monday.For Goldcorp the deal with Newmont will be greeted with relief, not least for chief executive David Garofalo, who stands to walk away with an $8m payout.Three years ago, the Vancouver-based group was the biggest gold miner in the world, even though it was not the biggest in terms of production. But a string of problems, including falling production, rising costs and declining reserves, have hammered its share price and left it looking for a buyer, according to bankers.“There’s no question that [Barrick-Randgold deal] was a catalyst,” said Mr Gill. “They [Goldcorp] were facing a number of issues. When something this earth-shattering happens in the industry they’ve got to sit up and take notice. It lit a fire to make them act quicker.”
26;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2019-01-14T10:30:54Z;Newmont to buy Goldcorp in $10bn gold mining tie-up;Combined group would challenge rival Barrick as world’s biggest gold producer;Newmont Mining is to acquire Canada’s Goldcorp in a $10bn transaction, creating the world’s biggest gold miner as dealmaking activity in the industry intensifies.The New York-listed group is offering 0.3280 of its own shares for each Goldcorp share, plus 2 cents in cash, an 18 per cent premium to Friday’s closing price. Including debt, the deal values GoldCorp at $12.5bn.The takeover comes as big gold companies try to revive their fortunes after being shunned by investors who have grown tired of the sector’s lacklustre returns, profligate spending and excessive executive pay. Analysts also believe there are far too many gold companies given the size of the industry.Newmont’s swoop follows on the heels of Barrick Gold’s $6bn takeover of Randgold Resources, a deal that stunned the industry and left rivals struggling to catch up. It comes as the gold price trades close to a six-month high of about $1,300.“The industry is in full consolidation mode,” said Jonathan Guy, analyst at Numis Securities. “The big question is, who is next?”Newmont said the combined company would have the largest gold reserves and resources in the sector, with mines in the Americas, Australia and Ghana. In 2018, the two miners produced 7.8m ounces of gold, 1.2m ounces more than the merged Barrick-Randgold.“This combination will create the world’s leading gold business with the best assets, people, prospects and value-creation opportunities,” said Gary Goldberg, Newmont chief executive. However, investors gave the deal a lukewarm response as Newmont’s shares were down 9 per cent by midday trading.The combined company, which will be 65 per cent owned by Newmont shareholders, is planning to divest $1bn to $1.5bn of assets over the next two years and will target annual production of 6m to 7m ounces over the next decade.The asset sales echo a similar pledge made by Barrick to focus only on its biggest and best mines. Goldcorp’s top assets include the Cerro Negro mine in Argentina, the Peñasquito mine in Mexico and its 40 per cent interest in the Pueblo Viejo mine in the Dominican Republic.Mr Goldberg will run the new company until the fourth quarter of 2019 when he will be succeeded by Tom Palmer, Newmont’s chief operating officer. The combination of the two companies is expected to generate $100m a year in cost savings.Traders said Newmont, widely regarded as the best run company in the gold sector alongside Randgold, was taking advantage of Goldcorp’s recent dismal performance.Shares in Goldcorp have lost a third of their value over the past two years as it struggled with a number of operational issues. They slumped further in October after the company flagged rising costs, falling production and a decline in reserves.Newmont Goldcorp, as the new company will be called, will have a market value of almost $30bn and a workforce of about 38,000 people. The deal, which is subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the second quarter.Newmont was advised by BMO Capital Markets, Citi and Goldman Sachs, while TD Securities and BofA Merrill Lynch acted for Goldcorp.
27;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2018-09-26T09:46:29Z;Newmont squashes Barrick Gold bid talk;;Newmont Mining has scotched talk of a bid for Canadian rival Barrick Gold, saying there was no value in a tie-up.Speaking at the Denver Gold Forum on Tuesday, Newmont chief Gary Goldberg said the company had examined a deal in the past and had not “seen anything”.“I don’t see that changing,” he told Bloomberg News.After Barrick Gold announced on Monday a $6bn all-stock offer for Africa-focused rival Randgold Resources, there was talk that Newmont might look to wreck the deal with a bid for its Canadian rival.Analysts at RBC Capital Markets said Newmont, the darling of the gold mining industry, could wring $300m of operating and cost savings from combining its mines in Nevada with those of Barrick.Mr Goldberg acknowledged those opportunities in Nevada on Tuesday and said he was interested in buying Barrick’s half shares of the jointly-owned Kalgoorlie mine in Australia.Newmont and Barrick, the world’s biggest gold company by production, came close to combining in 2014 but discussions broke down following disagreement over leadership roles and where the company would be based.Rather than balk at its offer for Randgold, which operates in some challenging and politically volatile countries in Africa, Barrick shareholders have broadly welcomed the deal and its share price has risen.Randgold has been one of the best operators in the gold space over the past decade, avoiding the billion-dollar mistakes and writedowns that have blighted the rest of the gold industry.Its chief executive Mark Bristow, who built the company from scratch, developing four mines across Africa, is one of the most respected bosses in the sector.He has promised to bring the Randgold way of doing business to Barrick, one of the worst performing gold companies of the past decade.
28;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2018-09-25T03:00:45Z;The odd couple that will lead the world’s new number one in gold;John Thornton and Mark Bristow to run $18bn Barrick Gold and Randgold combination;The $18bn combination of Canada’s Barrick Gold and London’s Randgold Resources brings together two of the biggest personalities in the mining industry: a former highflying banker from Goldman Sachs and a pugnacious South African miner and geologist.How these two powerful personalities will work together will govern the success of a deal that the two companies say will create a global mining colossus designed to appeal to all investors and not just gold fanatics.However, there are already concerns about how John Thornton, known for his tough management style, will work alongside Mark Bristow, who single-handedly built Randgold into one of the biggest gold companies in the world.Under the deal announced on Monday, the two men will retain their positions as executive chairman and chief executive — the first time Barrick has had a chief executive since 2014.“Mark is viewed as one of the best operators in the industry — they ought to give him a lot of rein,” said Robert Gill, a portfolio manager at Lincluden Investment Management.The two companies have been discussing a possible combination for three years but talks intensified over the past nine months, leading Africa-focused Randgold to recommend a $6bn all-stock offer from Barrick on Monday. The tie-up will create the world’s biggest gold company, with annual production of 6.5m ounces of gold, eclipsing its nearest competitor, US-listed Newmont Mining.The deal comes as investors have been shunning the gold mining sector, which has a well-deserved reputation for overspending, poor capital discipline and, in North America, excessive executive pay.Only last week, New York hedge fund Paulson & Co launched a 16-member Shareholders’ Gold Council, in a bid to push miners to improve their performance.Since 2008, the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs index, which includes Barrick and Randgold as constituents, has more than halved in value as the industry has taken tens of billions of dollars of impairment charges on ill-timed deals and wildly ambitious projects.By bringing together Barrick’s scale and reach with Randgold’s entrepreneurial management team, Mr Thornton and Mr Bristow say they can create a “new champion for value in the gold mining industry”.“Randgold has the agility and swift-footedness of a younger and smaller company, much like Barrick in its early years, while Barrick has the infrastructure and global reach of a large corporate company,” Mr Thornton said on Monday.Analysts and bankers say a deal helps both companies address key strategic problems.Since Mr Thornton was appointed executive chairman of Barrick in 2014, the Toronto-based group has sold off assets, slashed debt and focused on generating cash rather than expanding its gold reserves.But that has also seen its output fall, threatening its position as the world’s largest gold producer, which it was in danger of ceding to rival Newmont. Buying Randgold is one way of addressing those concerns as well as hiring one of the industry’s most highly regarded executives in Mr Bristow.“Effectively, Barrick has had to buy Randgold to get Mark Bristow,” said one senior mining banker.For Africa-focused Randgold, a tie-up with Barrick answers questions about its long-term growth prospects. Under Mr Bristow’s leadership Randgold has been one of the best performing gold miners in the world.Measured by total shareholder returns, Randgold is among the top ten performers in the FTSE 100 over the past decade, up 120 per cent. It has never reported a quarterly loss or taken a writedown, an impressive feat for a company that mines a volatile commodity.But the company has not had a big exploration success for several years and has lost its premium over other listed gold companies. It is also facing a tough, new mining code in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it has one of its biggest mines, and a moribund gold price.Although its shares rallied 6 per cent on Monday, they are still down by 30 per cent this year.“This industry needs consolidation because all the main gold mining companies are starting to run out of reserves starting in 2020. They’re not discovering any new reserves,” said James Rasteh of Coast Capital Management, a New York-based hedge fund.At Barrick, Mr Thornton is a divisive leader who gained a reputation for a hard-charging work ethic while at Goldman Sachs, where he rose to be president before leaving in 2003.He has fired hundreds of middle managers and tried to promote a Goldman-style “partnership culture”. “At Goldman Sachs, [cutting] 10 per cent was like breathing. We did it every year,” he told the Globe and Mail in an interview this month.His response to an unflattering piece in the Wall Street Journal in August was to call a company-wide town hall meeting where he espoused his management philosophy and views on the industry in a near-7,000 word speech.Mr Thornton has also cultivated a close relationship with China, where he serves as a professor at the elite Tsinghua University. Under his leadership, Barrick sold a 50 per cent stake in its Veladero gold mine in Argentina to China’s Shandong Gold.Working with China offers “political risk mitigation”, Mr Thornton said on Monday.Mr Bristow has a completely different background to Mr Thornton. He trained as a geologist at Natal University in South Africa before founding Randgold and building it mine by mine into one of the largest gold producers.An amateur pilot who lives in Mauritius, and a keen motorcyclist, he has been a vocal critic of the gold industry for years, accusing it of overspending and not delivering value for shareholders.An energetic businessman who frequently travels across Africa, Mr Bristow was still taking business calls from hospital following open heart surgery in November 2017.Following the merger, the new company, dubbed “Brandgold” by analysts, will focus on five “tier one” assets, described as low-cost mines capable of producing 500,000 ounces of gold annually for at least 10 years. Any assets that don’t meet this investment criteria will be sold.Mr Bristow will manage the expanded company’s day-to-day business, while Mr Thornton will provide leadership at the board level and focus on strategic issues.“They’re singing from the same hymn sheets,” Richard Hatch, an analyst at Berenberg, said. “There’s a difference in culture in the two organisations but it’s with Thornton’s blessing that Mark and the Randgold culture will be dominant force in the new Barrick.”Mr Bristow insisted there was “no culture” clash between the two leaderships teams and the two sides had spent time together in workshops talking about the two company’s mining assets. They had already found areas where they could share expertise such as in open pit and underground mining, he said.Mr Thornton’s focus on lean management and decentralised decision-making, putting more control in local mine managers’ hands, chimes with Mr Bristow’s approach, the Randgold boss said.“There’s no difference in his outlook and philosophy and mine — the difference is I’ve done it,” said Mr Bristow.
29;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2018-03-18T05:00:25Z;Barrick Gold’s restructuring comes at a cost;Canadian miner set to lose top spot to US rival as output and share price falls;As John Thornton approaches his fourth anniversary as executive chairman of Barrick Gold, he has transformed the once deal-hungry company into a leaner, more efficient miner.But his restructuring has come at a cost: Barrick is set to lose its position as the world’s largest gold miner to older US rival Newmont Mining as its output and market value falls.A former Goldman Sachs president and China expert, Mr Thornton has cut Barrick’s debt, sold down assets and embraced technology from big data to autonomous vehicles.But the miner’s share price has fallen 30 per cent since Mr Thornton took the helm at the Canadian company, compared with a 55 per cent rise in Colorado-based Newmont’s.“The restructuring has run its course, they’ve got their debt down to manageable levels, reworked the portfolio,” says Joe Foster, a portfolio manager at VanEck, the second-largest shareholder of Barrick with a 4 per cent stake.“Now investors are saying what’s next? What’s going to drive the stock from here? That’s the big question mark.”Barrick claims its approach has already delivered results — with more than $2bn in free cash flow generated in the past two years, a corporate record. Its also cut its total debt from $8bn in 2016 to $6.4bn.The company has four projects in its pipeline but these will only add about 1m ounces to its production starting in 2021. As a result, it forecasts its gold output will decline from more than 5.32m ounces last year to between 4.6m to 4.2m ounces between 2019 and 2022.Some analysts expect an even steeper drop, with BMO Capital Markets forecasting Barrick’s production to fall below 4m ounces after 2021.That is in stark contrast to Newmont, which forecasts production between 4.6m to 5.1m ounces through to 2022.“You want companies to create value, and it’s getting more difficult for them,” Mr Foster adds. “These development projects are just keeping them in place, they’re not advancing.”Mr Thornton has made it clear that large acquisitions are off the table — a far cry from the $10.4bn hostile bid for Vancouver-based Placer Dome in 2006 that turned Barrick into the largest gold producer in the world under its founder, Hungarian émigré Peter Munk.“We simply will not yield to pressure to, ‘just find something’ in order to ‘grow’,” Mr Thornton told shareholders.“History shows that mining companies overpay for mediocre assets and invest in projects with low returns, when times are good,” he added.Barrick has its own experience of this, with its $7.3bn acquisition of copper miner Equinox Minerals in 2011, which left the group heavily in debt. The deal was badly timed: two years later gold prices collapsed after a 12-year bull run.But other gold miners are starting to make forays into buying assets again. Last year Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris set up a company to invest in emerging gold projects around the world led by Andrew Wray, a former chief financial officer of Acacia Mining.Barrick says it has also not written off doing more deals, but says they must add clear value for shareholders. The company examined a number of opportunities last year, Mr Thornton said, but passed on all of them.Robert Gill, a portfolio manager at Lincluden Investment Management, says shareholders should be patient.“You’ve got to break a few eggs to make an omelette,” Mr Gill says. “You’re certainly not going to grow as fast, production will be declining, but the company’s profitability will increase, the balance sheet will increase, the risk of investing in Barrick will decrease.“The overall quality of the company will be better but it will be a smaller company.”That is reflected in Barrick’s new motto for executives: “Grow our free cash flow per share over the long term.”To incentivise this, Mr Thornton wants to make all employees shareholders by granting stocks they have to hold for the life of their employment. So far, employees own more than 1.5m shares in the company.He is also betting on two big themes: technology and China.Barrick has focused on making its operations more digital, centred on its CodeMine digital hub in Nevada, which is overseen by its first chief innovation officer Michelle Ash.That has seen employees launch hackathons and attend innovation conferences in Silicon Valley. This year Barrick plans to launch the Barrick Data Fabric, a big data platform.Barrick has also tested autonomous trucks at its Cortez mine in Nevada, which can be controlled by operators on the surface.Mr Thornton, who is also professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing, has also deepened the company’s connections to China, which is the largest consumer of gold. Last June Barrick sold 50 per cent of its Veladero mine in Argentina to Shandong Gold Mining for $960m.In a world of growing resource nationalism that relationship could help the company negotiate with governments. Barrick is trying to end a dispute in Tanzania that has seen Acacia Mining, in which it has a 64 per cent stake, banned from exporting since last March.London-listed Acacia said last month it had held talks with Chinese gold companies about selling a stake in some of its mines in the east African country.Further joint ventures are likely rather than outright acquisitions.“Under Mr Thornton and the current crew they are going to display some prudence,” Mr Gill says. “They will take their time and there will be a certain hurdle rate. They’re OK with becoming number two.”
30;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2018-01-24T18:21:49Z;Gold miners headed for best week since September;;Gold miners are headed for their best week in nearly five months on the back of a sharp jump in the yellow metal.The NYSE Arca Gold BUGS index, consisting of 17 gold miners including Barrick Gold and Goldcorp that are listed on a major US exchange, is up 5.5 per cent so far this week — leaving it on track for its biggest weekly gain since the week ended September 1.Barrick Gold shares rose 1.6 per cent to $15.07, Goldcorp shares climbed 1.4 per cent to $14.98, Newmont Mining shares climbed 2.9 per cent to $41.47 and Randgold Resources shares were up 2.8 per cent to $102.80.Gold miners have advanced on the back of a rally in the precious metal, which is up 1.6 per cent so far this week. On Wednesday, it was tracking its highest close since August 2016.It was weakness in the US dollar, the currency in which gold is denominated, that helped fuel the yellow metal’s advance this week. Indeed, the dollar index, a gauge of the buck against a basket of peers, is down 1.4 per cent so far this week and is headed for its sixth straight weekly loss — the longest such streak since 2010.The dollar lurched lower following remarks from US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who said at Davos that weakness in the buck would be good for US trade in the short term.The broader NYSE Arca gold miners index, which includes 50 companies on a major stock market accessible by foreign investors, is up 3.6 per cent this week and headed for its best week since Dec 22.
31;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2017-09-11T17:22:28Z;Gold miners sink as havens are hit by fading Irma fears;Popular bullion ETFs also dragged down by the sector’s broad decline;Fading fears over North Korea and the impact of Hurricane Irma dented investor appetite for safer assets, sending the price of gold down by the most since early July and weighing on the shares of gold miners trading on Wall Street.Although investors continue to be nervous over the stand-off between the US and North Korea, the conflict appears to have simmered down somewhat and Hurricane Irma’s swerve away from Miami and its downgrade to a tropical storm have crimped investor appetite for safety.“A weekend without any signs of further escalation has seen this slip further back in the mind of traders for now, and whilst the potential threat is unlikely to disappear entirely anytime soon, there has at least been a pause in the rising geopolitical tension between Washington and Pyongyang,” said David Cheetham, chief market analyst at XTB.Gold had climbed to a one-year high earlier this month as investors sought out its haven properties and the US dollar wilted, but the Wall Street relief rally on Monday sent the price of a troy ounce down 0.9 per cent to $1,335.2 by midday in New York.That sent the shares of a host of US-listed gold miners sliding on Monday.Newmont Mining Corp fell 1.3 per cent and Barrick Gold declined 1.5 per cent. Canadian gold miners also took a hit, with Franco-Nevada dipping 0.5 per cent and Goldcorp nudged 0.9 per cent lower.Two popular exchange traded funds that invest in gold miners were dragged down by the sector’s broad decline.The $8.4bn VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF fell 1.5 per cent, while its $4.4bn “junior” counterpart, which invests in smaller miners of the lustrous metal, edged 1.1 per cent lower. GLD, the biggest ETF that tracks the physical metal, also declined 1.1 per cent.The poor performance of gold miners stood in sharp contrast to the rest of Wall Street, with every major sector rallying on Monday and the S&P 500 heading towards a new record close by midday in New York.Insurance stocks led the rally, thanks to the ebbing fears of mass destruction in Florida.Materials stocks enjoyed a 1 per cent bounce but the jump was powered by chemicals companies rather than construction materials companies, such as Martin Marietta Materials and Vulcan Materials, as investors pared back their estimate for how much rebuilding work will be needed in Texas and Florida after hurricanes Harvey and Irma.Martin Marrietta and Vulcan fell 2.7 per cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively, by midday on Monday.Home Depot also dipped 1.5 per cent and the SPDR Homebuilders ETF fell 0.4 per cent, after both had climbed strongly earlier this month as the storm clouds gathered.Goldman Sachs at the weekend lowered its third-quarter economic growth estimate by 0.8 per cent to 2 per cent but stressed that it expected this weakness to be reversed over the following three quarters, as rebuilding efforts stimulates the economy and eventually “more than recouping the lost output”.
32;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2017-02-06T15:53:13Z;Gold miners in best winning streak since 2014;;Geopolitical concerns are working out well for gold miners.Gold miners’ shares have advanced for seven consecutive days, their longest winning streak since August 2014 as investor anxiety supports gold prices.The NYSE ARCA gold miners index, which includes nearly 50 names such as Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining, was up 0.8 per cent on Monday. The gains come as gold prices have climbed 3.2 per cent to $1,226.76 a troy ounce over that seven-day period.Concerns about a possible currency war, following US President Donald Trump’s accusations that Japan manipulated currency markets to artificially weaken the yen, have also helped bolster gold prices.“The acceleration of protectionism and ‘currency war’ chatter directed toward key trading partners should be seen as a catalyst driving the yellow metal to higher ranges,” said Rob Sica, director of global metals at TD Securities.“The recent weakening of the [US dollar] and the realization that the GOP-controlled Congress may not quickly deliver on its key legislative agenda, following the delay of the Obama Care repeal and replace legislation, could drive gold up from the recent $1,198-1,225/oz range to $1,250-1,264/oz.”Gold miners clocked their biggest annual gain since 2002 and their first annual gain in six years in 2016 — rising more than 50 per cent — driven by a jump in gold prices that came as companies’ focus on cost-cutting helped lift their margins. They have advanced more than 17 per cent so far this year.
33;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2016-12-16T22:22:47Z;Shares in gold miners maintain momentum;Index on track for best annual gain since 2003 as companies focus on cost-cutting;Despite the recent downturn in gold prices, shares of companies that mine the precious metal were up on Friday, with the index still on track for their biggest annual gain in 13 years.The NYSE Arca gold miner index, made up of 39 companies including Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining, was up 1.6 per cent at one stage on Friday before ceding ground to close 0.1 per cent lower. However, it has still gained 38.7 per cent so far this year — leaving it poised for its best annual gain since 2003, when it rose 47.1 per cent. The gains come after five consecutive annual declines.Barrick Gold shares are up 93.5 per cent this year to $14.28, while shares in Newmont Mining are up 76 per cent over the same period to $31.66. Meanwhile, Goldcorp shares have advanced 8.4 per cent so far this year to $12.53, while AngloGold Ashanti shares are up 33.9 per cent year-to-date to $9.51, despite slipping 0.3 per cent on Friday.Gold miners had rallied into the start of the year buoyed by a surge in the price of the precious metal.The Federal Reserve had overestimated the pace at which it would be able to tighten policy, signalling four rate rises for the year after it first lifted rates in December 2015. However, it only delivered one, this week. The absence of interest rate rises for much of the year helped lift the precious metal, which offers no yield.Indeed, low interest rates and geopolitical uncertainties pushed the yellow metal up more than 20 per cent in the year to October.However, Donald Trump’s election victory in November and the Federal Reserve’s decision to lift rates and forecast a faster pace of tightening in the coming year, has seen gold’s year-to-date gains trimmed to just 7 per cent. And that in turn crimped some of the rally in gold miners, which had been up 78 per cent until the end of October.So what has helped gold miners in the wake of the recent drop in prices? Suki Cooper, an analyst at Standard Chartered, said miners have been focused on “cutting costs rather than chasing ounces”, adding that lower oil prices and US dollar strength had helped miners’ profit margins even as gold prices have fallen.But she cautioned there will still be “pressure into year end as rising US rate hike expectations are exacerbated by weak demand from core consumers, India and China”.Friday’s rally in shares of gold producers accompanied a mixed day of trading in US stocks. At the close in New York, the S&P 500 was 0.2 per cent lower at 2,258, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at 19,843. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.4 per cent to 5,437.Elsewhere, financials, which are poised to be the second-biggest gainers on the benchmark S&P 500 this year, underperformed on Friday, falling 0.9 per cent. The sector is up 20.8 per cent year-to-date. Energy, which is poised to be the best-performing sector on the benchmark index this year with year-to-date gains of 25.6 per cent, was up 0.6 per cent on Friday.Twitter: @mamtabadkar
34;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2016-11-14T15:31:38Z;Indonesian ore export ban reversal unlikely;Mining law expected to tighten from January 2017 despite intense industry lobbying;"Indonesia’s government is garnering praise from international investors for its pro-business stance, and the growing strength of President Joko Widodo augurs well for future economic reforms. But mining and energy policy continues to cast a cloud over the investment environment.Almost three years after implementation, Indonesia’s 2014 ban on the export of several metal ores (including nickel, bauxite and copper) has failed to achieve its stated objective of spurring investment in domestic refining capacity in bauxite and copper, although it has had some success in nickel.This mixed success reflects the fact that Indonesia’s 2009 mining law — which outlined the 2014 ban — failed to take account of the different characteristics of each mineral, in terms of where the greatest value-add lies in the supply chain.Investment flows into Indonesia’s mining sector tumbled as a direct consequence of the law (see chart), while exports of minerals have shrunk to negligible levels. Chinese importers — the main source of demand — have turned to Malaysia to source bauxite and to the Philippines for nickel.Moreover, the policy’s restrictions are set to become even more onerous for the industry: from January 2017 only shipments of fully refined metals are allowed, tightening from the current law that also allows partially processed metals.Government officials have sent conflicting messages about the likelihood of a reversal of the ban, but we think it will remain largely in place. FT Confidential Research recently spoke with Luhut Pandjaitan, coordinating economic minister for maritime affairs (see box) — who oversees the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry — and believe that the government will:The minister oversees a wide range of policy portfolios, including: maritime resource management; natural resource management; infrastructure development; human resource development; and science and technology.The portfolios were previously managed by different coordinating authorities. The reshuffle of portfolios was aimed at reducing the supervisory burden shouldered by the Coordinating Economic Ministry.Mr Pandjaitan’s authority on this and other energy policies has grown in recent months. Although Igansius Jonan, a former transport minister, was unexpectedly awarded the position of energy and resources minister in mid-October following a reshuffle, we believe Mr Jonan’s lack of experience means it is Mr Pandjaitan who calls the shots.One reason why backtracking on the nickel export ban does not make sense is that the current policy has spurred investment. About 20 companies, many Chinese, have committed to investing $6bn in processing facilities over the past five years. Such investments have resulted in the complete construction of 12 smelting facilities (see chart).China remains short of domestic supplies of nickel ore, while Indonesia is one of few global suppliers. Chinese companies have agreed to comply with the ruling in order to secure supply chains.Another reason is that investing in nickel smelting in Indonesia is commercially attractive. Nickel mining costs just 2-3 per cent of its ultimate market value. Loading large barges for processing in China is inefficient relative to producing onshore in Indonesia and transporting finished products. “This efficiency advantage of onshore refining might have reduced slightly in the wake of the ongoing collapse in shipping costs, but not by too much,” says Julian Hill, a consultant at Deloitte Indonesia.As a result, we expect total nickel smelting input capacity to reach 33.9m tonnes annually by 2017 and approximately 37.5m by 2018 — accounting for roughly 95 per cent of current mining production. However, there is still room for further investment — in both nickel smelting and stainless steel production — as total annual capacity probably exceeds 60m tonnes.We also expect nickel production to fall in the Philippines following President Rodrigo Duterte’s crackdown on mining operations, which could divert further Chinese demand towards Indonesia.Bauxite is a different animal. Indonesia’s share of global bauxite supply is much smaller than for nickel, while China has a considerable domestic supply. Malaysia has also stepped up its production (see chart).There is also a significant surplus of bauxite refining capacity in China and globally. Since 2014 only two companies have invested in Indonesian alumina processing: Indonesia Chemical Alumina and Well Harvest Winning.Indonesian bauxite producers, such as state-owned Aneka Tambang, have been lobbying the government to relax the ban on bauxite exports, with up to 80 per cent of the country’s current bauxite mining capacity lying idle as a result of current policy. Output has plummeted (see chart).However, legal obstacles mean policy is unlikely to change. Unlike both nickel and copper, bauxite ores already have high metal concentrations (up to 30 per cent), meaning that processing it into concentrate before alumina refining is unnecessary. Given that the mining law bans the export of “unprocessed” minerals from 2017, there is no legal wriggle room to incentivise smelter development by allowing bauxite miners to invest in processing for concentrate, a policy currently implemented in the copper sector. As a result, the government legally has no other option but to allow exports of refined products only.Copper is different again. Production of the metal is largely accounted for by two large foreign-invested projects: Newmont in Nusa Tenggara and Freeport Indonesia in Papua. Government royalties from Freeport alone have totalled nearly $15bn over the last 20 years.An amendment to the existing law allows producers to export raw copper ore on condition they pay a 5 per cent export tax and show proof of plans to begin refining. Companies such as Freeport have generally complied, but have also quite deliberately delayed investment. Freeport’s plans are mired in uncertainty while it tries to secure an extension of the contract for operations at its giant Grasberg mine on Papua beyond 2021.The commercial case for copper refining — as opposed to processing — in Indonesia remains unconvincing, since processing copper ore into concentrate generates over 90 per cent of the market value of the end-product, compared with less than 10 per cent for nickel and bauxite. Copper concentrate accounts for the vast majority of copper export value (see chart).Copper is also highly politicised. President Widodo has refused to negotiate an extension of Freeport’s so-called contract of work, which the company wants to extend until 2041.Freeport is, in theory, required gradually to sell down more of its majority ownership to domestic operators. As a result, while it has earmarked $15bn for mine expansion and $2bn for a planned smelter, this remains on hold until there is greater policy clarity, which may not come until closer to 2019.Yet the government’s ability to force Freeport to comply is limited. An abrupt halt to Freeport’s operations would result in massive lay-offs in restive Papua, where the mine is the single largest private employer.We also think the government will be forced to continue to allow copper ore exports to continue, due to the impact a total ban would have on the recent $2.6bn acquisition of an 82.2 per cent stake in Newmont by a consortium comprising local mining magnates and Medco Energi, a company with personal ties to the ruling PDI-P party. FTCR’s conversations with sources close to the Newmont deal revealed that the acquisition was allegedly agreed on the basis it could continue exporting raw ore beyond 2017.Jakarta would have to amend the 2009 mining law in order to allow copper concentrate exports to continue. The Indonesian Mining Association told FTCR that, given the limited time available before the tighter 2017 regulations come in, the only realistic option is to issue a ministerial regulation. We think this is likely, in spite of possible legal challenges. Failure to reach a consensus would result in the sector being left in limbo for another year or two and jeopardise the Medco acquisition.These uncertainties could add to longer-term fiscal pressure on the government, though, unlike with oil and gas, the share of profits from the mining sector going into fiscal coffers has been comparatively small. That said, non-tax government revenue from the mining sector rose 27.5 per cent last year to Rp37.6tn ($2.78bn), despite a poor industry-wide environment.—FT Confidential Research is an independent research service from the Financial Times, providing in-depth analysis of and statistical insight into China and Southeast Asia.

36;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Gold miners clock worst day in nearly 15 months;;A punishing day for gold bugs.Gold miners fell the most since July 2015 on Tuesday as hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials and strength in the US dollar pushed gold prices to their lowest level in more than three months.Gold, which offers no yield, is punished when interest rates rise, while strength in the US dollar, the currency in which the precious metal is denominated makes it more expensive for foreign buyers.That saw the NYSE Arca gold miners index fell 8.4 per cent as gold slid 3.3 per cent to $1,268.73. Newmont Mining led the decline on the broader S&P 500 falling 10 per cent to $34.25.Moreover, it is worth noting that following the Denver Gold Show, UBS analysts pointed out that miners were more interested in growing than returning capital to shareholders.“Disappointingly, few made mention of lifting returns to shareholders. In fact, some continue to put growth ahead of dividends in terms of the capital allocation process,” Jo Battershill, an analyst at UBS, said. “The average 2016 dividend yield of UBS covered golds is an uninspiring 1.2% and we remain concerned that a return to thoughts of growth will simply mask the poor shareholder returns.”
37;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2016-10-04T16:54:19Z;Gold miners face biggest drop in more than month;;Gold miners lost some of their shine on Tuesday.The NYSE Arca gold miners fell 6.6 per cent and were poised for the biggest one-day drop in more than a month as hawkish expectations about a rate rise by the Federal Reserve and strength in the US dollar pushed gold prices down by the most in more than three months.Gold, which is dollar-denominated, suffers when the currency strengthens as it makes the precious metal more expensive for foreign buyers. Moreover, higher interest rates also weigh on gold as it offers no yield.On the back of stronger than expected US economic data federal fund futures currently imply a 62.7 per cent chance of a move by the Fed in December.All that in turn saw investors punish companies that mine for the precious metal.
38;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2016-08-26T21:35:03Z;Gold mining stocks have volatile day after Fed remarks on rates;S&P 500 in the red as utilities and telecoms sectors under pressure;"Gold prices gyrated and shares in gold miners advanced on Friday following
a string of speeches by top Federal Reserve policymakers at the Jackson Hole symposium.Gold bugs initially breathed a sigh of relief after Fed chair Janet Yellen said the argument for a rate rise had “strengthened” but stopped short of signalling that a move could come in September.Investors appeared to view the remarks as more dovish and pushed the precious metal up as much as 1.5 per cent to $1,342.36 a troy ounce.However, on the heels of her speech, Stanley Fischer, Fed vice-chairman, issued bullish remarks on the US economy in an interview with CNBC and said Ms Yellen’s remarks were consistent with the possibility of a rate rise as early as next month.His remarks saw gold, which carries no yield and therefore benefits from a low-rate environment, pare its gains and close 0.1 per cent lower at $1,321.18.“It could be argued that while the message from Jackson Hole was somewhat hawkish, it was not hawkish enough to convince gold traders to aggressively sell gold,” said Bart Melek, head of global commodity strategy at TD Securities.The NYSE Arca Gold Miners index rose as much as 3.5 per cent before paring back its gains to trade 0.2 per cent lower by the close in New York.Shares in Barrick Gold climbed as much as 3.9 per cent before giving up those gains to close 0.3 per cent lower at $18.22. Newmont Mining shares advanced as much as 3.2 per cent but finished down 0.6 per cent to $39.93 in New York.Meanwhile, utilities and telecommunications stocks came under pressure on the back of the comments from Mr Fischer indicating that a September rate rise may be on the table.Investors favour utilities and telecoms in a low-rate environment since they pay hefty dividends that can replace the income provided by bonds.The sectors have been strong performers this year, each rising more than 14 per cent as the Fed has had to dramatically pare down its expectations for when it will add to the December 2015 rate rise.The groups, were, however, the biggest laggards on Friday, with utilities dropping 2.1 per cent and telecoms down 1.1 per cent.The broader markets were also in the red, shedding an earlier rise as investors digested the Fed commentary.The S&P 500 was down 0.2 per cent to 2,169, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.3 per cent to 18,395.4. The Nasdaq Composite bucked the trend, ticking 0.1 per cent higher to 5,218.9."

However, bigger energy majors like Occidental, ExxonMobil and Chevron edged higher 1.1 per cent to $77.72, 0.3 per cent to $88.02 and 0.5 per cent to $102.20, respectively.In point terms, Apple was the biggest contributor to the S&P 500’s decline, with the world’s biggest company by market capitalisation slipping 0.8 per cent to $108.03 to shave half a point off the index by itself.IBM also contributed to an underwhelming day for technology stocks, falling 0.8 per cent to $159.05. In fact, only 12 of the 68 technology companies in the main US stock market gauge climbed on Wednesday, taking the index 0.5 per cent lower on the day after hitting a 16-year high on Tuesday.The S&P 500 declined 0.5 per cent to 2,175.4, the Dow Jones shed 0.4 per cent to 18,481.5 and the Nasdaq fell 0.8 per cent to 5,217.7.
40;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2016-08-15T08:41:18Z;Gold and silver miners set to raise or resume dividend payments;Confidence in sector rises thanks to higher precious metals prices;Gold and silver miners are increasingly looking to raise or resume dividend payments, highlighting the renewed confidence in the sector driven by this year’s rise in precious metal prices.Gold and silver have been among the best performing metals during 2016, powering a sharp rally in stock prices and helping miners to ease concerns over their finances. Since the start of the year, gold has risen 27 per cent while silver is up 46 per cent giving more scope to the sector — which had already worked hard to curb spiralling costs — to repay debts or reward investors.In recent days large gold miners including Newmont Mining and Randgold Resources have talked up the prospect of higher shareholder payouts because of their improving balance sheets. Centamin, the UK-miner of Egyptian gold, last week more than doubled its interim dividend.Underscoring the improved confidence Newcrest Mining, the largest Australian gold miner, on Monday announced its first dividend payment for more than three years.Sandeep Biswas, chief executive, said Newcrest had cut net debt by more than a quarter in its past financial year and had met its financial targets. “The resulting improvement… together with Newcrest’s profitability and market conditions, has given the board confidence” to return to dividend payouts, Mr Biswas said.“The amount of free cash flow the industry is generating has increased significantly in recent months,” said Jonathan Guy, analyst at Numis in London. “Gold is up and costs have been falling and so there is much more potential for companies to resume or increase dividends. The market is going to be looking for companies to deliver messages on higher payouts.”Many miners slashed dividends after the price of gold, which peaked at about $1,900 in 2011, started to fall sharply in 2013. In some cases miners which had borrowed heavily to invest in projects abandoned investor payouts.Randgold, whose shares have doubled in value this year, has said that by the end of the year it should add enough cash to its debt-free balance sheet to get to the level at which it could increase its dividend.Analysts have also highlighted that Newmont is on track to reach its target ratio of net debt to earnings, increasing the likelihood that more cash could come back to investors.The brighter outlook for gold and silver is putting more pressure on those miners that gave up paying dividends to set out plans for a resumption.AngloGold Ashanti, the world’s third largest gold miner by volume, is likely to tell investors on Monday about its plans to resume a dividend, which it last paid in 2013. AngloGold said last month that it would report a return to profit in its interim earnings.“With the balance sheet strong, we believe attention will now turn [to] capital allocation . . . the most obvious and discussed option is reinstatement of dividends,” said Goldman Sachs in a note to investors this month.Hochschild Mining, the UK-listed silver miner, is also considering whether it could resume dividends after three years. “The board takes the dividend seriously,” said Hochschild, which reports earnings on Tuesday.The improvements within the precious metals sector contrast with the tougher conditions for more diversified miners of industrial metals.This year the largest diversified miners including BHP Billiton, Vale and Rio Tinto have cut their payment commitments while Glencore and Anglo American have abandoned a payout to preserve cash.

The index has rallied 20.4 per cent since the Brexit vote last month.New York-listed shares in Barrick Gold advanced 4.2 per cent to $23.34, Goldcorp climbed 0.6 per cent to $20.10, Newmont Mining rose 2.6 per cent to $41.42 and Kinross Gold was up 1.8 per cent to $5.74.Burnishing the rally was a 0.5 per cent rise in gold to $1,363.84 an ounce — its highest intraday level since March 2014. The gold price have climbed 8.5 per cent since the Brexit vote as UK uncertainty has added to concerns about the health of the global economy.The rise in the yellow metal also comes as open interest, the number of contracts bought by investors on Comex, climbed to a record high for the year, according to George Gero, managing director at RBC Wealth Management.“While this is becoming a crowded trade as open interest shows, many asset allocators missed the first half of the year and now are trying to catch up as investors globally reach for gold as a haven,” Mr Gero said. “Gold is a haven for inflation and now it seems deflation as well,” he added.Royal Gold shares advanced 4.6 per cent to $78.25, buoyed by investor optimism on gold and after analysts at Raymond James upgraded the stock to “outperform” from “market perform” and lifted their price target to $85 from $72.The rally in shares of gold miners came on a day when US stocks began in the red but turned positive by the close in New York.The S&P 500 was 0.5 per cent higher at 2,099.7 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.4 per cent to 17,918.6. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.8 per cent higher at 4,859.2.Elsewhere, shares in American Airlines fell 2 per cent to $28.35 after analysts at Credit Suisse downgraded the stock to “underweight” from “overweight”.Analyst Julie Yates said the bank was “backing away from our [overly] optimistic upgrade in January” that was prompted by the view that unit revenues in the industry would recover by the second quarter and that American Airlines would improve too. Ms Yates noted that the move was “admittedly, one of our worst stock calls”.She added that the carrier “faces the most significant headwind on fuel year-on-year as it is unhedged and has enjoyed the lowest per/gallon price”.Ms Yates also downgraded United Continental to “neutral” from “overweight” and lowered the price target to $42 from $64, sending shares in the company 2.4 per cent lower to $39.31.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
42;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2016-05-16T20:35:36Z;Freeport-McMoRan gains ground on broker upgrade;Energy sector given a boost from crude price forecasts;Freeport-McMoRan was one of the leading gainers on the S&P 500 on Monday after analysts at Cowen & Co boosted their price target on the stock.Freeport shares jumped 6.1 per cent to $11.05, after analysts at Cowen lifted their price target on the stock to $15 — the highest on Wall Street — from $10, and maintained their “outperform” rating, noting that the company had “made impressive progress in the deleveraging progress”.Earlier this month Freeport said that it had struck a deal to sell its stake in a vast Congo copper mine to China Molybdenum CMOC for $2.65bn in cash as it stepped up efforts to reduce its debt burden.The company also said it was in exclusive talks to sell its interests in Freeport Cobalt, its Finnish mine-to-market solution business for cobalt products, and the Kisanfu Exploration project in Congo, to CMOC for $100m and $50m respectively.“We believe management remains steadfastly focused on right-sizing the balance sheet for the current environment,” Anthony Rizzuto, an analyst at Cowen, said. “There has been considerable debate as to the appropriate next step for [Freeport]. This could take the form of further outright asset sales, minority interest transaction, or even an equity issuance.”Freeport shares have advanced 63 per cent so far this year, with their performance at the start of the week also buoyed by a broader rally among miners.Oil prices received a shot in the arm after analysts at Goldman Sachs upgraded their crude price forecasts. That in turn ignited a rally in shares of energy companies, with the S&P 500 energy sector rising 1.6 per cent and posting the biggest gains along with the materials sector on the benchmark index.At the close in New York, the S&P 500 had advanced 1 per cent to 2,066.66 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also gained 1 per cent to 17,710.71. The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.2 per cent to 4,775.46.Gold miners climbed on the back of a stronger physical price as the precious metal surged as much as 1.2 per cent to $1,288.83 an ounce earlier in the day, following soft economic data out of China.Shares in Newmont Mining advanced 4 per cent to $35.42, Barrick Gold climbed 2.7 per cent to $18.91 and Goldcorp rose 3 per cent to $18.49. Miners held their advance even as gold pared its gains, ending the day 0.1 per cent higher at $1,274.66 an ounce.“The miners are benefiting from the general sentiment that bad data out of China could draw another round of stimulus,” said Jeremy Sussman, an analyst at Clarksons Platou Securities. “Miners tend to do well when data suggests a degree of uncertainty.”Elsewhere, Apple shares advanced 3.7 per cent to $93.88 after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a $1bn plus stake in the iPhone maker.Shares in the world’s largest company had declined 14 per cent so far this year as of last week after the company disclosed is first quarterly revenue drop in 13 years and its first drop in iPhone sales.Anacor Pharmaceuticals surged more than 57 per cent to $100.67 after Pfizer said it would buy the company for $5.2bn.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
43;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Gold back in vogue with investors amid uncertain economic outlook;Higher demand for the precious metal is also boosting gold miners’ share prices;"The shoppers thronging Harrods department store in London love a bargain as much as anyone, but in one corner of the second floor the prices have already risen 19 per cent this year.This is where the upmarket store sells its gold bullion, giving people the chance to buy the precious metal as an investment during uncertain economic times. A gold sliver resembling a mobile phone SIM card costs about £40, while a kilo, similar in size to a small chocolate bar, is available for £29,000. Shoppers can purchase bars embossed with the store’s famous logo, while Chinese buyers may like the Year of the Monkey image. Even a Jean Paul Gaultier motif is available for a small premium.It is a long way from Harrods’ display cases to the vast mines around the world that extract the precious metal. But these diverse parts of the gold industry are revelling in the strongest opening to a year for more than three decades, with the gold price hitting a 13-month high of $1,283 per ounce on Friday, raising hopes of an end to a damaging downturn for the sector.Gold is back in demand amid increasing concerns over the health of the global economy and the ability of central banks to engineer a recovery. When the European Central Bank further cut interest rates on Thursday, it helped to drive up the price of gold, which is seen as a safe haven asset.The same belief that is animating gold’s retail buyers is spurring the shares of leading miners. Barrick Gold, the world’s largest gold miner by volume, is up about 90 per cent so far this year. Randgold Resources, the most valuable of the UK-listed miners, is up 54 per cent over the same period. And miners’ stocks in Australia and South Africa have rocketed as weaker local currencies have boosted earnings.For investors, the recovery is well overdue. Gold’s US dollar price peaked in 2011 and since then, the leading miners of the precious metal have written off tens of billions of dollars of investments made during a decade-long bull market. According to Deutsche Bank analysts, writedowns from just the four leading North American miners — Barrick, Newmont Mining, Goldcorp and Kinross — add up to $57bn over the past five years.“I hate that we have had to take such a large writedown. The fact that nearly all of our peers have done the same or worse over the past few years doesn’t soften the blow,” said Chuck Jeannes, whose final bow as Goldcorp’s chief executive last month was marred by the company’s $4.9bn impairment of certain projects.That story of painful financial adjustment after a period of over-exuberant investment has played out across the mining industry over the past year, as the prices of many commodities hit their lowest levels in a decade, partly because of China’s economic slowdown. Dividends have been scrapped or cut, by gold producers as well as the bigger diversified miners.But because gold’s price fall began earlier, miners of this precious metal have had longer to react than more diversified peers. And the most recent results from the gold producers suggest that they are at last getting to grips with the consequence of the downturn — and this is stimulating share prices.“I think collectively the sector is now starting to meeting shareholders’ expectations, for the first time in many years,” says Stephen Walker, analyst at RBC Capital Markets.“The vast majority of companies are heading in the right direction and you can see that in their share price performance, which has been helped by the recent gold price move. Although if the gold producers continue to meet or beat expectations, the outperformance could continue even in a flat gold price environment.”In spite of a 10 per cent fall in the gold price during 2015, the big gold miners improved their free cash flow while reducing debts built up during the boom times. Their cost-cutting was admittedly helped by external factors: Newmont, the second-largest producer, said favourable oil prices and exchange rates accounted for 60 per cent of its cost improvements last year.Miners have also adjusted to reality by making more conservative assumptions about gold prices.Nowhere is the new reality more evident than at Barrick. Five years ago it boasted of a planned surge in growth that would by now have seen it producing more than 9m ounces of gold annually. Yet in the event Barrick mined just 6.1m oz last year; in three years' time, output may fall below 5m oz, which would likely strip it of the title of world’s largest gold producer.Complex projects have been stopped and other mines sold. “Our production will be measured by quality, not quantity,” said Kelvin Dushnisky, Barrick’s president. “While we are producing fewer ounces today than we have in recent years, we are generating significantly more cash.”With more companies acting similarly, gold mine output may have peaked — another factor that should support the long-term price of the precious metal. According to Thomson Reuters’ GFMS gold survey, mine output dropped 4 per cent year-on-year in the final quarter of 2015, and will shrink this year for the first time since 2008.And gold reserves — representing companies’ stocks of ore that they will be able to extract profitably — are also falling. Deutsche analysts say the big four North American gold miners have just 15 years of reserves, in effect meaning they have not replaced the last two years of production.In an industry such as mining, the long-term health of companies will eventually depend on putting an end to the decline in reserves. But for the time being, Mr Walker says investors’ concerns over reserves are being set aside.“They accept that reserves may decline and are now more focused on improved margins that generate free cash flows that help reduce debt. Investors will take that,” he adds.Gold demand might be rising but the benefits have not yet washed down to the world’s biggest jewellers. Whereas disturbing macroeconomic trends are fomenting interest in gold as an investment, for retailers they are factors keeping people out of stores.Chow Tai Fook, the Chinese jewellery retailer, said last month that gold sales in its stores were down by more than 30 per cent during the three-week Chinese new year holiday compared to the same period one year earlier. The plunge was partly because of “the weakening of consumer sentiment on luxury goods due to economic slowdown and the recent volatility in the stock market”, said the company.And on the other side of the world, Tiffany — which reports its 2015 results next week — has already said its holiday-season sales, of all types of jewellery, were down 5 per cent on a like-for-like basis, with the strong dollar hitting tourist spending in its New York stores.With few industrial uses for gold, jewellery remains the largest component of demand, according to the World Gold Council — and more than 60 per cent is from China and India, where customers are traditionally highly sensitive to changes in the price of the precious metal. Last year jewellery demand for gold fell 3 per cent to 2,400 tonnes.By contrast, investment in gold has been on the rise. The gold council said central bank gold purchases surged in the second half of last year, making 2015 the sixth year in succession that these financial institutions have been net buyers.“Reserve management — particularly diversification away from the US dollar — remains essential. Central banks are keeping their foot firmly on the gold purchasing pedal,” said the gold council.This year’s big change in demand, however, has involved exchange traded funds based on gold.ETFs have bought more tonnes of gold this year than they sold during all of 2015. At one stage this month BlackRock’s iShares Gold Trust exchange traded product had to suspend issuance because it had not registered enough new shares to meet demand."
44;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2016-03-07T21:33:43Z;Energy sector stands out as oil extends rebound;Materials sector is firmer on brighter outlook for the Chinese economy;The resurgence in shares of US energy producers remained the most striking trend on Wall Street even as the broader equity market struggled for direction.A strong rally in the oil price lifted the S&P 500 Energy sector up 2.4 per cent, with Murphy Oil and Southwestern Energy clocking gains of 12.6 and 9.7 per cent respectively.The energy sector has chartered a volatile course this year, whipsawed by the swings in the oil price. West Texas Intermediate, the US oil benchmark, fell as low as $26.21 on February 11 but has since rallied hard, rising 42 per cent. On Monday it was up 5.6 per cent at $37.94.The advance comes as the number of rigs drilling for oil in the US has dropped to the lowest level since 2009 and as Saudi Arabia and Russia have agreed to freeze crude output at January levels.The materials sector, whose fortunes are shaped by the outlook for the Chinese economy, also had a better showing with a 1.2 per cent increase. CF Industries was the biggest gainer in the materials sector, advancing 6.6 per cent to $36.88, while shares in Alcoa gained 4.9 per cent to $10.04.The sector was helped after China’s Premier Li Keqiang laid out a plan to target growth of between 6.5 per cent and 7 per cent this year — more ambitious than many economists had forecast.Anxiety about the Chinese economy is enduring a significant retreat from the double-digit growth that marked much of the last two decades and has been one of the several drags on the US stock market in 2016.Monday, though, proved a calmer day for the wider stock market. By the close of markets in New York, the S&P 500, the broadest gauge of large-cap US stocks, had edged up 0.1 per cent to 2,001.76. After a three-week rally, the index has trimmed its loss for the year to 2 per cent from 10 per cent.The relative lack of direction was echoed by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was up 0.4 per cent at 17,073.95, and the Nasdaq Composite, down 0.2 per cent to 4,708.25.Elsewhere, gold miners advanced on Monday as the precious metal advanced ahead of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy setting meeting next week. Expectations for a rate rise in March remain low and that has bolstered sentiment for the non-yielding precious metal.Gold prices have advanced more than 19 per cent so far this year and hit a 13-month high in the previous trading session.Shares in Barrick Gold advanced 1 per cent to $13.86, while shares in Newmont Mining climbed 1.6 per cent to $26.53. Shares in Kinross Gold advanced 0.8 per cent to $3.02 and AngloGold Ashanti shares rose 3.7 per cent to $13.40.Shares in Celldex Therapeutics fell 53.7 per cent to $3.79, after the biopharmaceutical company said it would discontinue a late-stage study of its brain cancer treatment, Rintega, after an independent interim analysis showed disappointing results.Meanwhile, shares in Dunkin’ Brands, the company behind Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-Robbins, fell 2.4 per cent to $46.97 after analysts at Guggenheim Securities downgraded the stock to “neutral” from “buy”.

That has pressured the dollar against many rivals, in turn buoying investor sentiment for gold. Weakness in the dollar, the currency in which gold is denominated, makes it cheaper for foreign buyers.However, Robin Bhar, an analyst at Société Générale said: “The recent stabilisation in global financial markets has caused the market probability of a 25 basis-point Fed rate raise by December 2016 to recover partially to around 50 per cent, which the gold price has yet to react to.’’Higher metals prices helped the S&P 500 metals and mining index advance 23.8 per cent over the month, leaving the sector on course for its best month since April 1999.Elsewhere, shares in Signet Jewelers jumped 9.4 per cent to $108.40 on Monday after reporting better than expected fourth-quarter profits.The Bermuda-based retailer, which operates Kay Jewelers and Zales, reported adjusted earnings of $3.63 per share, ahead of analysts’ expectation for $3.59.Signet’s board also approved a new $750m share repurchase programme and announced an 18 per cent increase in its dividend.Shares in Valeant Pharmaceuticals fell 18.4 per cent to $65.78 as the drugmaker postponed its conference call to discuss fourth-quarter results and withdrew its previous financial guidance. Valeant also said chief executive Michael Pearson was returning to work after taking medical leave.Consol Energy shares jumped more than 10 per cent to $8.63 after announcing plans to sell a coal mine in southwestern Virgina and plans to suspend its dividend.The S&P 500 ended the month lower for the third month in a row. The benchmark index fell 0.8 per cent on Monday, bringing it to a narrow loss of 0.4 per cent over the month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 per cent to 16,516.50 over the month while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.2 per cent to 4,557.95.

This follows a 20 per cent decline on Monday, amid a sell-off in copper and after ratings agency Fitch axed the company’s credit rating.Meanwhile, Aluminium maker Alcoa was the third biggest decliner, with shares sliding 10 per cent to $7.19. The company said late Monday that it swung to a loss in the fourth-quarter on the back of income tax charges and sales that fell nearly 18 per cent. Adjusting for one-time items however Alcoa reported earnings per share that topped forecasts. Shares were up after the results however and did not appear to be the trigger for bearish sentiment today.But mining stocks have been roiled amid renewed concerns on China, the world’s largest commodity consumer, and weakness in the renminbi.The S&P 500 metals and mining industry index, which includes just Alcoa, Freeport Mc-Moran, Nucor and Newmont Mining fell for the ninth consecutive day and has declined more than 20 per cent in 2016.Matthew Korn, an analyst at Barlcays, explains just how China has thrown a spanner in the works for mining stocks:We’ve seen a more volatile, weaker [Chinese yuan] and continued PMI contraction combined with unclear, arguably contradictory policy measures that all suggest, as our economists put it, “China’s economic situation has become inherently unstable.”This does not suggest a good set-up for mining stocks – instead the prospect for calling a bottom appears to be pushed out yet again.With concerns mounting about global economic growth it is unclear when miners could see their fortunes change.
48;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2016-01-06T18:01:31Z;Chipotle slips on same-store sales setback;But energy sector is the worst performer on benchmark of US stocks;Chipotle shares were punished on Wednesday after the company said that a key sales metric fell more than previously estimated in the fourth quarter amid a string of food safety scares tied to its restaurants.One such incident had resulted in a grand jury subpoena as part of a criminal investigation.An E.coli outbreak linked to Chipotle restaurants in October and November and an incident involving an outbreak of norovirus at a restaurant in Massachusetts pushed same-store sales 14.6 per cent lower in the fourth quarter.This was worse than the 8 to 11 per cent decline the company had forecast in December.Like-for-like sales dropped 30 per cent in the month of December, the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.The company also reduced its earnings estimates for the quarter and now expects to report earnings in the range of $1.70 to $1.90 a share, compared with its previous forecasts for $2.45 to $2.85.Chipotle also said it was served a grand jury subpoena from the US District Court for the Central District of California in conjunction with the US Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations in December. The subpoena related to a norovirus incident at a restaurant in California in August.Chipotle shares, which fell 30 per cent last year, declined 5 per cent to $426.72.Shares in Pioneer Natural Resources fell 7.2 per cent to $116.15 after the oil and gas explorer announced plans to increase the size of a share offering and lifted its capital spending programme amid a protracted decline in crude prices.Pioneer said late on Tuesday that it would sell 12m new shares at $117 per share, with an option to sell an additional 1.8m shares. The funds are expected to be used, in part, to develop the company’s drilling in the Permian basin.The bigger share offering “is a surprise given Pioneer’s relative balance- sheet strength and its lack of needs on the acquisition front (in contrast to recent playbooks of smaller Permian peers using equity to fund M&A while keeping leverage at palatable levels)”, said Phillips Johnston, an analyst at Capital One Securities.Moreover, at a time when energy companies have scrambled to reduce costs, Pioneer said it was lifting its 2016 capital spending budget.The company estimates between $2.4bn to $2.6bn in spending this year, compared with $2.2bn the previous year. The new programme was, however, in line with analysts’ estimates.The Dallas-based company also said that it may incur “unusual non-cash impairment charges” of between $800m to $1bn on its Eagle Ford Shale assets in the fourth quarter.The decline in Pioneer shares came alongside a broader sell-off in energy stocks. The S&P 500 energy sector fell 2.6 per cent and was the worst performing sector on the benchmark index.Meanwhile, shares of gold miners advanced on the back of a rally in gold prices. Shares in Barrick Gold climbed 4 per cent to $7.94, shares in Goldcorp advanced 2 per cent to $11.81 and Newmont Mining shares rose 0.8 per cent to $18.56.The precious metal has begun the new year on the front foot as concerns on the health of the Chinese economy and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have boosted purchases of safe haven assets.In afternoon trading, the S&P 500 fell 1.3 per cent to 1,990.26, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.5 per cent to 16,906.51 and the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.1 per cent to 4,835.77.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
49;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2015-10-30T21:12:16Z;Materials bounce back after tough time;Investors hunting for bargains help buoy S&P 500 sector;Materials stocks have turned their fortunes round after a punishing year and were the best-performing sector on the S&P 500 in October.The S&P 500 materials sector — which includes copper miner Freeport-McMoRan, aluminium producer Alcoa, gold producer Newmont Mining and chemicals companies such as DuPont and Dow Chemical — advanced 13.45 per cent in October.It outperformed the S&P 500, which gained 8.3 per cent this month.A drop in commodity prices and concerns about an economic slowdown in China, the world’s biggest copper and oil consumer, have left the sector down more than 6 per cent this year.But materials benefited from less anxiety about China this month and received a shot in the arm after the People’s Bank of China unexpectedly cut interest rates for the fifth time this year as policymakers increased efforts to arrest the economic slowdown.Investors hunting for bargains helped buoy the sector. “There was a bit of bottom fishing going on,” said Russ Koesterich at BlackRock.Finally the sector benefited from diminishing expectations that the US Federal Reserve would raise interest rates, and the resulting weakening in the dollar.But materials’ fortunes could change. The Fed indicated this week that a rate rise remained a possibility in December.“It will be interesting to see if the sector will be able to maintain this momentum going into November, because if the Fed hikes and this is accompanied by dollar strength it will be a headwind for the group,” Mr Koesterich added.LinkedIn shares jumped 11 per cent to $240.87 by the close after better than expected third-quarter results accompanied an upbeat sales outlook. The professional networking site revealed adjusted earnings of 78 cents a share, ahead of forecasts for 45 cents. Sales rose 37 per cent to $780m, above expectations for $756.4m.Current quarter sales were expected to be $845m to $850m, compared with Wall Street estimates of $846.7m.Shares in SolarCity declined 22 per cent to $29.65 after the rooftop solar power company reported its fourth consecutive quarterly loss and issued a disappointing outlook.SolarCity reported a net loss of $19m, or 20 cents a share, in the three months that ended in September, compared with a profit of $19.2m, or 21 cents, in the period a year ago. Sales nearly doubled to $113.9m.For the current quarter SolarCity projects a loss in the range of $2.60 to $2.75 a share, wider than analysts’ expectations for $2.05 a share.Valeant fell 15.9 per cent to $93.7 after it said it was severing ties with a so-called speciality pharmacy group.The Canadian drugmaker’s relationship with Philidor has been scrutinised in recent weeks after a short seller alleged in a research note that the pharmacy was part of an accounting fraud designed to inflate Valeant’s sales.US stocks struggled, with the S&P 500 sliding 0.48 per cent to 2,079.36.Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.52 per cent at 17,663.54, and the Nasdaq Composite was 0.40 per cent lower at 5,053.75.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar

I’m flabbergasted by the move today.”Trading activity soared in New York as markets whipsawed — more than 8.6bn shares traded hands on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, the third busiest trading day of the year.Equity volatility as gauged by the CBOE’s Vix index, a measure of the expected moves in the S&P 500 over the coming month, rose as high as 19.2 in early morning trading, before retreating 4.7 per cent to 16.2. Vix readings above 20 in the past have indicated an escalation of investor worry.Utilities led the benchmark index, with the S&P 500 utility index rising 2.5 per cent, buoyed by a 3.3 per cent rise from Duke Energy to $75.27. Public Service Enterprise Group climbed 3.3 per cent to $41.64 while PPL, an electricity provider in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee, gained 3 per cent to $30.93.Often viewed as a proxy for bonds, utilities — which carry high debt loads, are among the most correlated to interest rate moves and offer above average dividend yields — have rallied as turmoil in the Eurozone and China lapped volatility higher.That unease has weighed on trader expectations of when the Federal Reserve will begin to raise interest rates — a major headwind for the sector. Federal Funds futures now imply the US central bank will not lift rates until March 2016.The material sector was the only industry to remain in negative territory after the late-day rally, as investors took fright at turmoil in Chinese equities and gold and copper prices slid.Newmont Mining Corp, the gold producer, was the steepest faller on the S&P 500, sliding 6 per cent to $22.41, while Freeport-McMoRan, the copper and gold producer, dropped 3.3 per cent to $17.25, adding to Monday’s 3 per cent decline.Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices dropped 15.4 per cent to $2.09 after it warned on sales and cut guidance after the market close yesterday. Computer graphic chipmaker Nvidia shed 1.9 per cent to $19.79.Additional reporting by Pan Yuk.

The sale will help AngloGold reduce net debt, which stood at $3.1bn at the year end.It had vowed to cut net debt by about $1bn after it abandoned a pla n to spin off its non South African assets last year. Key investors objected to elements of the restructuring, including a proposed $2bn rights issue.Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan, chief executive, said the deal “gets debt levels where we want them to be . . . This has nailed the balance sheet in one go”.He told the Financial Times: “Portfolio restructuring or a split is not the focus right now.”AngloGold would benefit from not having to spend $200m to complete an expansion project at Cripple Creek, Mr Venkatakrishnan said. The miner is retaining a royalty on Newmont’s future output from the mine.It was the largest sale of a US gold asset for several years, which helped to create interest.Several North American miners have grown cautious about international ventures and have been keen to highlight their ability to grow in a relatively stable jurisdiction such as the US. Newmont already has extensive assets in Nevada.“We expected North American miners to compete for it,” Mr Venkatakrishnan said.Shares in most gold miners remain far from their peaks, with the price of the precious metal about a third lower than its highs in 2011.Newmont is one of two gold miners — alongside Barrick Gold — that has a larger annual output than AngloGold. Its believes that it can improve operations at Cripple Creek, which is a short distance from its headquarters in Colorado.The US miner said it expected to cut mining costs by 10 per cent and improve the amount of gold recovered.AngloGold’s operating costs at the mine were $829 per ounce last year. Newmont said it expected costs of between $725/oz and $775/oz. Cripple Creek has 4m oz of gold reserves.Newmont said it would issue equity to cover most of the cost of the deal.
54;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2015-05-11T08:24:29Z;Peru fails to dig its way out of deadlock amid mining unrest;South America’s former star is failing to adapt to the end of the commodities boom;"Peru’s government dispatched troops to the south west of the country at the weekend after violent protests against a copper mine project resulted in the death of a second activist and a policeman last week.Local people say the proposed mine will ruin the environment and damage agriculture if it becomes operational.President Ollanta Humala said he has not “lost hope” that dialogue over the project could be resumed.” However, any breakthrough in the long running dispute over the Tía María mine seems distant.Nearly $25bn of mining investments in Peru have been stalled by the violent unrest and rising costs, paralysing the economy of the world’s third largest copper-producing nationThe fate of the $1.4bn mine, proposed by Grupo Mexico’s Southern Copper, is symptomatic of how momentum has been lost in what has been one of Latin America’s great growth stories. The end of the commodities boom has left Peru, where mining contributes some 15 per cent of gross domestic product, struggling to adapt.“Renewed protests against Tia Maria will further delay the project and could derail it altogether; more widely they highlight structural challenges facing mining activity in Peru limiting the government’s efforts to attract investment,” said the Eurasia Group.Tía María has been subject to a strike since March while Minas Conga, another high profile project, spearheaded by US gold giant Newmont, has been stalled since late 2011 after protests left several dead.President Humala, a former army officer, won a close election four years ago pledging to support the poor in the country’s many mining disputes. But the bitter battles have continued and little else has been achieved, critics say. Meanwhile, the economy has slowed sharply. Expectations are low as the clock ticks down on the 15 months remaining of the president’s five-year term.“Peruvians are waiting for this government to end,” said Luis Nunes, a political scientist. “Business leaders, politicians and people on the street fault the president for his inability to make decisions, to take action.” The government had expected $64bn in mining investments by the end of the decade, but more than a third is frozen because of protests and rising costs.Part of the paralysis stems from a revolving door in the government. Mr Humala has run through a long list of cabinet ministers, including seven prime ministers — a record — since his inauguration. All but one of the prime ministers has left in the midst of scandal. The most recent, Pedro Cateriano survived a confidence vote on April 27.The government’s next battle will be to convince a highly fractured Congress to grant it special powers to legislate on economic issues. Analysts doubt the votes are there.Peru’s economy has slowed partly as demand for resources has declined in Asia. Its average annual growth rate over the past decade was 6.4 per cent, but that plummeted to 2.4 per cent last year, and just 1.3 per cent in the first two months of this year.The finance ministry is sticking to its forecast of 4.2 per cent expansion for the full year. March mining production numbers are in its favour, with copper output up by 9.3 per cent and gold up by 10.4 per cent over the same month last year.But few economists share this upbeat outlook. Francisco Rodríguez, chief Andean economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, expects growth of around 2.4 per cent. “The Humala administration has very little political capital left to engineer a turnround in the economy,” he says.“Humala is unpopular not only in public opinion but also with the business sector, most of which — unfairly in my view — criticise him for the slowdown,” adds Mr Rodríguez.The president’s popularity has been below 30 per cent for more than a year, with a late April poll by GfK putting his approval rating at 24 per cent. The economy is the biggest worry in a country used to the status of South America’s star.The government has been announcing stimulus measures in stages for a year. It is also betting on an increase in mining production and public investment to get the economy growing. But construction on some awarded major public works projects have yet to start, including work on the $6bn second line of Lima’s metro.“What is dragging down growth is a combination of the delays in private investments, such as mining projects,” said Munir Jalil, chief Andean economist at Citi, which has forecast growth at 3.8 per cent with the forecast on the downside. “And the electoral race for the presidency starting in the second half of the year.”Mr Humala is constitutionally banned from seeking immediate re-election, but the April 2016 poll will be a crowded race with at least 20 parties already registered to run.The list of candidates is likely to include former president, Alan García, and Keiko Fujimori, the popular daughter of another former president currently serving a long prison sentence. Her party is the strongest force in Congress. For Mr Nunes: “Peru’s already fractured political system could grow even more fragile post-2016.”"

It could raise up to $1bn to help the South African group cut its debt after a plan for a rights issue failed last year.Newmont Mining of the US and Canada’s Kinross Gold are among a group of miners conducting second-round talks with AngloGold over a deal for part or all of Cripple Creek, according to people familiar with the sale process. Iamgold and Goldcorp, two other Canadian companies, have also shown interest.A number of North American miners are expected to be keen to strengthen their holdings close to home to counterbalance riskier assets overseas. It would follow the example of Goldcorp, which only operates in the Americas and has become the world’s largest miner by market capitalisation.Kinross has fallen out of favour with investors because of its significant exposure to Russia, source of almost 30 per cent of its output, amid increased tension between President Vladimir Putin and the west.Colorado-based Newmont was embroiled last year in a dispute with Indonesia’s government over its copper and gold mine in the country. It has also run into fierce local opposition to a proposed mine in Peru.Newmont said this month it would build a mine in Nevada and last year discussed a tie-up with Barrick Gold that would have refocused the merged company on their combined holdings in the US state, although the idea was shelved after extensive talks.Patrick Chidley, a mining analyst at HSBC in New York, said some miners were willing to pay more for assets in less risky jurisdictions.“Some companies have shown that they are not managing risks in emerging markets very well and some countries have been guilty of increasing their demands of miners, to the point where companies have started to say ‘enough is enough’. So assets in places such as the US or Canada may attract higher valuations,” Mr Chidley said.Chief executive of AngloGold Ashanti is known for his personal touch but he does not shy away from tough decisionsContinue readingAngloGold, the world’s third-largest gold miner by output, would like to sell part or all of Cripple Creek and may try to retain operational control. Kinross and Newmont declined to comment on their interest in Cripple Creek.AngloGold’s willingness to sell comes after Srinivasan Venkatakrishnan, chief executive, last year abandoned a proposal to restructure the group into two separate companies. Investors were unhappy at the prospect of a $2.1bn rights issue that would have accompanied the restructuring.Mr Venkatakrishnan has said AngloGold “will not act in haste” as it seeks to cut its $3.1bn of net debt by $1bn within the next three years.The company is in the final stages of an expansion at Cripple Creek to nearly double annual output. The mine has about 10m oz of gold resources.

Adjusted earnings of 17 cents a share topped forecasts for 12 cents.Newmont has been working to lower costs, as gold prices have fallen more than 35 per cent since a June 2011 peak. Its shares, which have advanced 37 per cent this year, climbed 4.58 per cent on Friday to close at $25.58.Deere underperformed the S&P 500, after it lowered full-year sales forecasts as lower commodity prices and falling farm incomes weighed on demand.The agricultural equipment maker, which is based in Moline, Illinois, said sales for fiscal 2015 would be 17 per cent lower than the previous year. In late November it had projected a 15 per cent drop. Profits are expected to be $1.8bn, just shy of the earlier forecast of $1.9bn.Sales declined for the fourth straight quarter, down 17 per cent to $5.6bn in the three months ended in January. Fiscal first-quarter profits fell to $387m, or $1.12 a share, compared with $681m, or $1.81 a share, in the period a year ago.Wall Street analysts had expected earnings of 84 cents a share on sales of $5.5bn. “Deere’s first-quarter performance reflected sluggish conditions in the global farm sector, which reduced demand for agricultural machinery, particularly larger models, and led to lower sales and income,” said Samuel Allen, chief executive.Deere shares nudged up to close at $92.43.Luxury department store chain Nordstrom advanced nearly 6 per cent to $81.74, after it said it would increase its capital expenditure plans nearly 60 per cent in 2015 as it attempts to capture consumer spending.The Seattle-based company said it would spend $1.2bn in the year to next January 31 to open more stores. The news came alongside fourth-quarter earnings that fell 5 per cent to $255m, or $1.32 a share, and missed analyst forecasts. Sales rose 9 per cent to $4.04bn, ahead of estimates.Intuit, the company behind TurboTax and QuickBooksOnline, led the S&P 500, climbing 6.16 per cent to $96.72, as it reported growth in its online subscriber base. QuickBooks subscribers rose 50 per cent in the fiscal second quarter, compared with a 43 per cent rise the previous quarter.The company, which is based in Mountain View, California, reported a narrower than expected loss of 23 cents a share, on sales of $808m that topped analyst forecasts.Uncertainty surrounding the Greek bailout crisis weighed on US stocks earlier on Friday, but the S&P 500 recovered to close up 0.61 per cent to 2,110.30, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.86 per cent to 18,140.44, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up 0.63 per cent to 4,955.97.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar
57;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2015-01-15T17:58:41Z;Best Buy blighted by gloomy sales outlook;Electronics retailer sinks on S&P 500 after forecasting flat sales growth;Best Buy was punished by investors on Thursday despite reporting strong holiday sales figures, as the electronics retailer warned on its sales outlook for the first half of its new fiscal year.The Richfield, Minnesota-based company said it expected same-store sales growth in the first half would be in the flat to negative low-single digits and that non-Gaap operating income would decline by 30-50 basis points.The company warned of external pressures, including deflationary pricing, weak industry demand for certain consumer electronics, declining demand for extended warranties and exchange rate volatility. These could hurt its results and are driving structural changes in the industry.Best Buy reported a 2.6 per cent rise in domestic same-store sales during the nine-week holiday period ended January 3 compared to a year ago, driven by sales in televisions and mobile phones. But the company warned that sales were “partially driven by the excitement around high-profile products and would not likely continue at holiday levels”.Online sales grew 13.4 per cent in the same period, slower than the 23.5 per cent growth reported in the year-ago period when gaming helped boost sales.“At this point, we don’t think Best Buy is seeing anything to spark a lot of caution in its posture,” Michael Lasser, an analyst at UBS said. He added that the company’s decision to warn on sales “just reflects the realities of the consumer electronics business that include intense competition and rapid price deflation”.Best Buy was the worst the performing stock on the US benchmark as its shares fell 14 per cent to $34.30. The retailer’s shares are down more than 9 per cent in the last year.Samsung Electronics and BlackBerry both denied reports that the South Korean electronics group was in talks over an acquisition of the Canadian smartphone maker. BlackBerry shares, which had surged 30 per cent on Wednesday, on a report that Samsung had made an approach to buy the company for as much as $7.5bn, declined 20 per cent to $10.10.The Swiss National Bank’s surprise decision to scrap its three-year-old ceiling of SFr1.20 per euro, pushed gold prices up 2.5 per cent to $1,259.80 an ounce, as the precious metal regained its safe haven status. The rise in gold prices also buoyed gold stocks. Shares of Kinross Gold advanced 9 per cent to $3.50, shares of Newmont Mining gained 9 per cent to $21.51 and Barrick Gold shares gained 9 per cent to $11.37.Target shares gained 2 per cent to $75.67, after the retailer said it was pulling out of Canada and filed an “application for protection” under Canadian law, in a move that leaves 17,600 workers at risk of losing their jobs.Shares of food retailing company Supervalu gained nearly 4 per cent to $9.44 after analysts at Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to “neutral” from “sell” and raised their price target to $9 from $8.The S&P 500 slipped 1 per cent to 1,992.67, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.6 per cent to 17,320.71.

58;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2015-01-11T13:37:54Z;Gold miners struggle to shine in investors’ eyes;Many investors are impatient to see restructuring but fall in bullion price has cut cash flows;Gold miners are hoping that the four-year low in the precious metal’s price, recorded in November, marked the end of a torrid period for the industry – and that the outlook will be brighter in 2015.But many investors in gold fear the miners are still placing too much faith in a cyclical recovery and not making structural changes to put the sector on a stronger footing.In 2013, gold suffered its first “down” year in more than a decade, trading above $1,650 in January and ending the year at just over $1,200. For most of 2014, the price remained in a range between $1,200 and $1,300, recovering from lows of $1,132 two months ago to close at the end of the year at $1,206.For the mining groups, this period of price falls resulted in billions of dollars of asset writedowns, large annual losses and urgent cost cutting. Nevertheless, some investors continue to express frustration that the companies have not made more drastic changes, such as cutting more mines or seeking mergers.Gold miners have already lowered their calculated reserves– the ore that they consider economically viable to mine – in response to the price falls. But many reserves are still unprofitable at recent spot prices, according to Catherine Raw, portfolio manager at BlackRock Natural Resources.“This is a huge challenge . . . Until the industry accepts this, it is not going to attract investment,” she told the Mines and Money conference in London last month. “We need to start seeing some really painful decisions being made.”Ms Raw suggests some of the miners’ restructuring efforts to date have been less than might meet the eye. For example, while overall costs for the largest North American gold miners have sunk since 2011, this has happened because of cuts to exploration budgets and lower “sustaining” capital expenditure.Operating costs and back-office administration costs have actually risen, she says.Another bugbear is the state of gold miners’ balance sheets, following an aggregate $70bn of borrowing over the past decade to fund projects and deals. Falls in the gold price have cut the companies’ cash flows and made it more difficult for them to pay down their debt.Some companies “have so much debt that they cannot manoeuvre to take advantage of the low valuations”, suggests Joe Foster, portfolio manager of Van Eck Gold Funds.Larger mining groups have entertained the idea of restructuring to relieve some of their debt burdens. AngloGold unveiled a debt reduction plan involving a $2.1bn rights issue and demerger, but investors shot the idea down within days because of the dilution of their holdings.Barrick Gold, the Canadian miner, has sold some smaller mines and, in 2013, raised equity to pay down debt. It also considered a merger with Newmont Mining of the US – including a spin-off of international assets – but negotiations broke down amid acrimony in April.Whether the larger mining groups have to revisit such plans in 2015, or sell more choice assets, is likely to depend on whether gold sinks far below its current “floor” level of about $1,200 an ounce, analysts suggest.However, smaller companies, some of which own just one asset, have little room for manoeuvre, as they cannot spread their back office costs across several mines.George Ogilvie, chief executive of Kirkland Lake, a Canadian miner, says: “I think we are going to see more M&A activity . . . Investors will start demanding that companies start consolidating.”According to Mr Foster, disposals by large companies and deals by some of the more robust mid-cap miners mean that the “shape of the industry will change”. Some of the more successful mid-caps, including London-listed Randgold Resources – one of only two gold miners whose shares outperformed the bullion price during gold’s bull run, according to Investec – are now talking about acquisition options.Until the industry accepts [that many reserves are unprofitable at recent spot prices], it is not going to attract investment. We need to start seeing some really painful decisions being madeJoe Wickwire, manager of the Fidelity Advisor Gold Fund, says consolidation is inevitable. “The industry is going to get smaller,” he argues. “There are assets out there that are probably better served in someone else’s hands.”One factor in the gold miners’ favour is that the price fall means they are now a more leveraged play on the performance of the metal, and so could outperform bullion if the market does rise.But investors, having put up $86bn in fresh equity capital since 2002, based on Investec’s calculations, have been burnt by poor returns from the sector.Over the past two years, the combined market capitalisation of global gold miners has fallen from a peak of about $260bn to $80bn, the broker estimates. As a result, while the price of bullion has fallen 30 per cent over the period, the FTSE Gold Mines index is down nearly twice that amount.Evy Hambro, chief investment officer of the equity team of BlackRock Natural Resources, says the mining companies will have to work hard to change investor perceptions.“You are going to need to be persuading investors to sell their shares in Microsoft or Apple to be able to help you finance your way out of trouble,” he told the Mines and Money conference. “That is a major challenge for the industry.”

But shares are up more than 170 per cent since its 2011 listing.Analysts at Deutsche Bank downgraded General Electric to “hold” from “buy” and cut their price target to $28 from $30, pushing shares of the company down 2.2 per cent to $24.07.“GE is on the right strategic track to create long-term shareholder value by continuing to focus on structural and operating cost reduction, shrinking GE Capital and improving overall efficiency,” John Inch, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said. But he expects earnings headwinds to result from General Electric’s capital reduction plans.Shares of Crescent Point Energy Corp gained as much as 1 per cent to $25.18, after the Canadian oil producer became the latest energy company to announce that it would cut capital spending amid a drop in oil prices. The company said it would lower capital expenditures by 28 per cent from its 2014 guidance to C$1.45bn and that it had increased oil hedges.Gold stocks rallied as gold prices climbed 1 per cent to $1,218.81 an ounce, amid global volatility. Shares of Newmont Mining gained 4 per cent to $20.27, shares of Barrick Gold advanced 3 per cent to $11.27 and Goldcorp shares gained 8 per cent to $20.31.The S&P 500 saw a fifth straight day of declines, dragged down by energy and industrials.The US benchmark fell 0.9 per cent to 2,002.61, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.7 per cent to 17,371.64, and the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.3 per cent to 4,592.74.mamta.badkar@ft.comTwitter: @mamtabadkar

The utilities sector of the S&P 500 fell 2 per cent, while the energy sector lost nearly 1 per cent and has dropped 19 per cent in the past six months.Oil stocks suffered as the price of Brent crude briefly dipped to a five-and-a-half-year low of $56.74 a barrel. BP lost 2 per cent in New York, while Royal Dutch Shell fell 1 per cent.However, shares in silver and gold miners were boosted by a rise in the price of the metals. Gold rose 2 per cent to $1,204.16 per ounce, while the price of silver jumped 3 per cent to $15.78 per ounce.First Majestic Silver Corp gained 8 per cent, Newmont Mining was up 4 per cent and Rio Tinto climbed 2 per cent.Procter & Gamble was cut to neutral from buy by analysts at BTIG, who wrote that “limited upside” to margin improvements and significant headwinds from foreign exchange rates warranted the rating.The Ohio-based consumer goods maker spun off its Duracell battery business in November and said it wanted to focus on a smaller number of brands, following sales of P&G’s pet food and Pringles businesses.Chief executive AG Lafley said he aimed to revive sales by sharpening its focus of products. P&G’s fourth-quarter revenues slipped to $20.8bn, down from $21.2bn a year ago.Shares in the company have risen 13 per cent this year, and 15 analysts rate it a buy, 17 as a hold and two as a sell, according to Bloomberg data.Overall, US equities were weaker.

61;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”
62;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2014-12-21T14:32:17Z;Talk of rebound in mining deals as valuations sink;Private equity could also move to take advantage of cyclical slump;Tumbling commodity prices are aggravating the problems of cash-strapped mining groups and could spur a rebound in dealmaking in the sector, analysts and bankers said.Mining stocks, which enjoyed a bull run for the best part of a decade as China growth spurred demand for commodities, suffered another year of declines in 2014. The S&P Global Mining Index has fallen each year since 2011. The value of mergers and acquisitions in mining fell for the third consecutive year to $48bn, its lowest level since 2004, according to Dealogic.“This is a year when many mining companies will be talking about whether there are synergies from bringing their businesses together,” Jeffrey Couch, head of mining and metals for Europe, Middle East and Africa at BMO Capital Markets, said. “Some of the smaller companies will be cash-constrained, and equity capital markets are not supportive of early-stage project mining companies.”Stephen Davy, head of Emea metals & mining at Credit Suisse, agreed that 2015 could be active.“I would be surprised if at least one major transaction does not happen,” he said. “Where margins are tight and balance sheets stretched, investors are going to really push for deals that have strong industrial logic and where value can be unlocked.”Many chief executives are adamant that they are not seeking to buy assets. Several miners made expensive acquisitions during the boom and are under pressure to raise payouts to investors instead.But bankers said private equity ventures could also deploy money to take advantage of valuations close to a cyclical low.Mr Davy said: “If ever there was a time when private equity funds could get deals done in mining, it must be now. There has been no equity capital for mining for two years, valuations have been crushed, there are many assets for sale and there are limited strategic buyers for those assets. It’s as close to a perfect storm as I think we’ll see for PE.”One of the larger such vehicles — X2, headed by Mick Davis, one of the most successful mining bosses during the past decade — has raised $4.8bn of equity commitments and previously considered a deal for assets being spun out of BHP Billiton, the largest miner by market capitalisation.The largest miners, including BHP, Rio Tinto, Anglo American and Vale, are considered to be in more robust shape than many smaller companies but are restructuring by selling or spinning off non-core assets. Vale is considering a partial initial public offering of its base metals operations.Glencore, one of the few large miners that has said it could seek deals, sounded out Rio this year about a potential merger and could revisit the idea in 2015. Barrick and Newmont, the two largest gold miners by output, also discussed a combination and may also return to the idea, some analysts think.Richard Horrocks-Taylor, European head of metals and mining investment banking for RBC Capital Markets, said: “The key thing for the sector is which commodities have stabilised, or will stabilise? If we start to see the bottom in many commodities, we will see increased activity.”Among the worst performing commodities has been iron ore, with the benchmark price having halved this year. Copper is down 14 per cent and silver has fallen 17 per cent.
63;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2014-10-06T17:15:55Z;Peru’s local elections: not much for miners to celebrate;;"Peru’s elections of mayors and regional governors on Sunday were a strange sight.In Lima, the capital, the second place finisher – 30 points behind the winner – was feted like a victor. Meanwhile the anti-mining regional governor of mineral-rich Cajamarca – with the highest total out of 25 races – had little to celebrate.Luis Castañeda made a comeback to lead Lima with nearly 50 per cent, but it was APRA candidate Enrique Cornejo who received the most attention by coming from nowhere to win 15 per cent. APRA, the country’s oldest party, never does well in the capital so his performance was seen as a big win. He celebrated accordingly, making the rounds of TV stations.Most important to investors was the one who could not celebrate: the anti-mining Gregorio Santos (pictured), who won a resounding victory in Cajamarca in the northern highlands. Santos has been in prison since June, accused of corruption.He says the charges were cooked up by the government and mining companies because he opposes the $5bn Minas Conga copper and gold mine, involving Newmont Mining Corporation and Minas Buenaventura of Peru. While there is now debate on what will happen with Santos, what is certain is that Conga will remain stalled. It has been on hold since late 2011, when Santos led protests to stop it.Amid a fall in mineral prices, softer demand from Asia, and glitches at some large mines -all of which has hit Peru hard – Santos’ enduring popularity may give goosebumps to government officials in the administration of Ollanta Humala, the president, as well as some mining investors in the world’s third largest copper producing nation.After all, minerals represent 60 per cent of Peru’s export revenues and Santos has argued that Cajamarca should turn its back on extractive industries. Even if he never officially takes office, he obviously has a following. As LatAm Confidential, a Financial Times research publication, put it in its latest issue:Extensive Social conflicts, often involving small indigenous communities surrounding issues such as water and land rights continue to complicate the development of Peru’s mining sector.Related reading:

64;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2014-10-03T15:39:33Z;Gold: mine, all mine;"Costs are getting too close to prices; expect a psychological shift soon";"If gold rusts, what shall iron do, asked Geoffrey Chaucer in the prologue of his Canterbury Tales. Traders have answered the second question. This year the lesser metal has collapsed to five-year lows. Gold could follow soon. For the third time in 15 months, its price approaches a significant level: $1,180 an ounce. If gold goes lower, mining company executives will start to fidget about pricing impairments on their reserves for the year end accounts.Gold mining stocks have struggled. MSCI’s Gold Miners index has lost 70 per cent since peaking in September 2011. According to Credit Suisse, producer costs sit near $1,150; too close for comfort.Accounting rules require miners to calculate the value of their reserves based on recent prices. If prices fall too much, the miners need to charge impairments through the income statement. A drop in the gold price below $1,180 could bring more of these charges. For example, Newmont, a top three producer, has used $1,300 to price its reserves. Others, such as Randgold, employ a more conservative price.But few of the majors have assumed prices falling to $1,000. It would mean some of their reserves become uneconomic to produce. Expect a psychological shift soon.Gold never tarnishes but its value does. Costs are too close to current prices. As the stronger dollar depresses gold’s price, that will dig into the profits of the miners.Tweet the Lex team at @FTLex"
65;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2014-09-12T08:10:26Z;Fresnillo targets gold with move to buy Newmont share of Penmont;;Fresnillo, the FTSE 100 miner best known as a silver producer, is going deeper into gold by buying Newmont Mining’s stake in the companies’ Penmont joint venture in Mexico for $450m.Fresnillo already owns 56 per cent of the venture, which includes its Herradura, Noche Buena and Soledad Dipolos mines in Sonora province as well as two advanced exploration projects, Mega Centauro and Centauro Deep.Acquiring full control should help Fresnillo get to 750,000 ounces of gold output in 2018 compared with a current target of 500,000oz. The deal, which requires shareholder approval, would add 2m oz to the miner’s gold reserves.Last year Fresnillo produced 426,000oz of gold.Herradura, which has operated since 1997, is expected to contribute about 350,000oz annually up to 2019. But Fresnillo warned that group gold production would fall between 4 per cent and 8 per cent short of this year’s 450,000oz target because of work to improve the processing capacity at Herradura. “We are confident that the reduction in 2014 production will be made up in 2015,” the group said.Fresnillo said its preliminary assessment of the Mega Centauro project suggested it would have an average annual gold production of 200,000oz, while the Centauro Deep project is expected to average 225,000oz.Total investment for the projects is estimated at $150m and $365m respectively, which Fresnillo said would give an internal rate of return for both projects in the “low to mid-teens” at current gold prices. The mines are expected to go into production in 2016 and 2017.Gold prices have stabilised at about $1200 to $1300 following an 18 per cent fall last year, which has forced many producers to cut out more marginal projects and bear down on spiralling costs.Octavio Alvídrez, chief executive, said: “At a time when many industry peers are rationalising their portfolios, this transaction illustrates the ability of a conservatively managed business like Fresnillo to take advantage of long-term value opportunities by investing through the commodity price cycle.”For Newmont, the sale of its 44 per cent Penmont stake is another element in slimming down its portfolio. The US gold producer, the world’s second largest by output, and its larger rival Barrick Gold have been pulling back from smaller ventures. In July Newmont completed the sale of the Jundee mine in Australia to Northern Star Resources for $91m. Gary Goldberg, chief executive, has also suggested Newmont may seek to expand in copper, one of the base metals for which demand is expected to be robust.
66;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2014-08-25T22:08:25Z;Peru to become world’s second-largest copper producer;;"Peru is set to become the world’s second-largest copper miner, behind neighbouring Chile, thanks to a $20bn pipeline of Chinese mining projects, according to senior officials in Lima.Last month’s $7bn acquisition of Glencore’s Las Bambas copper project in Peru by China Minmetals’ MMG subsidiary has reinforced the links between the two countries, as Beijing seeks to secure more resources to drive economic growth.MMG’s Las Bambas deal means Chinese backers are now behind one-third of all Peru’s new mining investments by value, estimated by the country at $61bn.While US companies – including Newmont Mining and Freeport-McMoRan – have been among the biggest investors in Peruvian mining, Chinese projects in the country are now worth more than those from the US and Canada combined.Eleodoro Mayorga, Peru’s energy and mining minister, said: “We have excellent relations with the Chinese; China has evolved as a partner. There is more openness, not only at a financial level, [but] also at trade and social responsibility levels.“It is not the closed, traditional, governmental China, but transnational companies playing the market game,” he said in an interview with the Financial Times.Peru expects to add 1.2m tonnes of copper to its production by 2016, according to Guillermo Shinno, deputy mining minister – which will take its output past that of China, which was the world’s second-largest producer.Las Bambas is one of Peru’s largest copper projects, with annual output of 450,000 tonnes expected when the mine goes into full production.Glencore had said the mine could open in the second half of 2015, but MMG is analysing the project’s schedule and budget after taking over operations at the mine this month. The project was initiated by Xstrata before its takeover by Glencore last year.Other Chinese mining investments in Peru include Chinalco’s $4.82bn Toromocho copper mine, which is currently undergoing an expansion; Minmetals and Jiangxi’s $2.5bn El Galeno, a copper, gold and silver project; a $1.5bn enlargement of an iron ore mine by Shougang Hierro Peru in Marcona; and Jinzhao Mining’s planned $3.28bn investment in Pampa de Pongo, another iron ore mine.Peru’s mining sector has sometimes proved complex for foreign investment because of local conflicts, often over land and water rights. These conflicts are at risk of being reignited when regional elections take place in October – with LatAm Confidential, a Financial Times research publication, reporting that certain prominent candidates likely to side with local communities against mining groups.Three years ago, Minas Conga, a $5bn gold project involving Newmont and Minas Buenaventura of Peru, was halted by riots in Cajamarca, amid local concern over water resources. More recently, Zijin’s $1.5bn Río Blanco copper project has stalled owing to community conflicts.Some mining analysts have flagged up access to water as a growing concern around the world for mining companies.However, Mr Mayorga said foreign investors were becoming more sensitive to these potential flashpoints with communities in mining regions.He argued that new investors had “more consciousness” of water as an issue. “There is no new investor arriving in Peru who could think it will take the water away from the river and from the community,” Mr Mayorga claimed. “Today, each project arrives with a solution in hand.”Additional reporting by James Wilson in London"
67;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2014-08-12T17:03:03Z;Intercept surges on liver treatment trial;;Intercept Pharmaceuticals shares surged after the biotech company said results from a mid-stage trial of a treatment for liver disease showed the medication was effective.The drug at the centre of the trial, obeticholic acid, also known as OCA, treats patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, which does not currently have a regulatory-approved treatment.The liver inflammation, which resembles liver disease caused by heavy drinking, can lead to cancer or organ failure. The trial showed liver scarring did not worsen in 46 per cent of patients compared with 21 per cent who were on placebo.Analysts with Deutsche Bank forecast the medication could generate annual sales near $9bn at its peak, dependent on approval.“We are more confident in OCA as a leading therapy in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis,” Alethia Young, an analyst with Deutsche Bank, said. “We view the data as relatively straightforward and better than our expectations.”Intercept, which expects to begin a new, late-stage trial in the first half of 2015, said the treatment also showed some improvement in patients suffering from fibrosis.Mark Pruzanski, the company’s chief executive, noted that the fibrosis results were noteworthy considering the short length of the completed trial and the relatively small sample size.“The fibrosis benefit with OCA treatment is the first time we are aware of that a therapeutic has been shown to significantly improve liver fibrosis in a meaningful proportion of NASH patients, an unexpected and positive finding,” he said.Shares of Intercept surged 16 per cent to $276.12 while rival Conatus Pharmaceuticals, which is also developing medications to treat liver disease, rose 3 per cent to $7.74.The broader Nasdaq biotech index, which has climbed 11 per cent this year, fell 0.4 per cent to 2,635.24.NII Holdings, the Latin American telecoms operator with shares listed in New York, collapsed on Tuesday after the company warned continued losses would likely force it to file for bankruptcy.The company, which once held a market capitalisation near $15bn, saw its valuation slide two-thirds to less than $30m.Juan Figuereo, the company’s chief financial officer, said sales continued to deteriorate as the mobile operator lost 77,000 subscribers in the quarter.He added that NII Holdings, which had $4.8bn in net debt at the end of the period, would “continue to work with our advisers to identify and evaluate potential strategic transactions”. NII Holdings shares slid 76 per cent to $0.16.Kate Spade shares touched to a pre-crisis peak on Tuesday before tumbling after the accessible fashion label lifted its full year profit forecast and said second-quarter results eclipsed Wall Street expectations.The company, which also owns the Jack Spade brand for men, said its namesake women’s brand was largely responsible for an almost 55 per cent increase in North American sales last quarter to $208m.The rise in sales in the US, as well as overseas, prompted Kate Spade to lift its profit forecast for the year to a range of $120m to $130m compared with an earlier range of $115m to $125m.America’s fashion market remains an intensely competitive one – both at the high and low end. In an echo of several other fashion retailers, Kate Spade noted a “more promotional retail environment”.The company’s shares, which advanced as much as 10 per cent in early morning trading, fell 26 per cent to $28.81 after executives warned margins would moderate following the second-quarter expansion.Rival Michael Kors declined 3 per cent to $77.44 while Coach fell nearly 1 per cent to $35.98.Gold miners were buoyed by a bout of unease after the government in Kiev said it would refuse entry to a Russian convoy allegedly carrying humanitarian aid.Spot gold prices climbed 0.6 per cent to $1,316.28 per troy ounce as a lack of clarity over Moscow’s intentions with the delivery raised concerns that the convoy could be used for Russia to directly intervene.Newmont Mining shares climbed 2 per cent to $27.06, Goldcorp rose 2 per cent to $28.83 and Barrick Gold advanced 3 per cent to $19.18.Overall, US equity markets shifted lower after two days of gains.

68;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Freeport-McMoRan close to Indonesian deal;;Freeport-McMoRan is on the verge of signing a deal with Indonesia that will lift curbs on exports from one of the world’s largest copper mines.The copper miner was among foreign companies hit by a ban on exports from Indonesia since the start of this year after the government decided more metal should be processed within the country rather than shipped as concentrate.Freeport said on Wednesday it expected a memorandum of understanding to be signed “imminently” with the government to allow exports to resume in August. Freeport would pay a $115m bond to underpin a commitment to develop a smelter. The company would also agree to higher royalty payments on gold and copper from the Grasberg mine.“We are encouraged by our discussions with the Indonesian government toward reaching a near-term agreement,” the company said.This year the mine has been operating at about half its normal rate, with some of its output being smelted locally.Freeport and Newmont Mining, the US gold miner, were the largest foreign miners hit by the Indonesian export ban, which also significantly tightened the world supply of nickel. Newmont has halted operations and this month filed an arbitration claim against the government to try to overcome the export restrictions.International mining companies hope incoming president Joko Widodo can build better relations but Mr Widodo has said he will stick to the export ban.Freeport said it assumed exports would resume next month but said it would otherwise bring in plans to reduce operating costs, defer capital expenditure and cut its workforce.In its second-quarter earnings Freeport said net income was flat at $482m, or $0.46 per share, compared with the same period in 2013. Revenues rose from $4.3 to $5.5bn.Freeport, one of the few miners that also has extensive oil and gas interests, shuffled part of its portfolio in the quarter, selling holdings in Texas’s Eagle Ford shale to Encana for $3.1bn and putting part of the proceeds into buying deepwater Gulf of Mexico assets.
69;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2014-07-14T21:13:20Z;Miners hit by precious metals pullback;;A sudden pullback in gold and silver prices after a month’s rally sent precious metal miners lower on Monday.Gains in the two commodities have been fuelled by improving economic activity, particularly in China, as well as the resurgence over the past week of euro area fears and discord over when the Federal Reserve will first raise interest rates.Spot gold, which has climbed more than 7 per cent since the start of June, tumbled 2.5 per cent to $1,305.51 an ounce while silver prices slid 3 per cent.Analysts with Credit Suisse said bullion movements over the remainder of the year would be tied to Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen’s view of the economy and how the central bank normalises monetary policy.“How markets in general and gold in particular develop from here through to year-end will in our view continue to be strongly influenced by shifting perceptions of Fed policy intentions under Yellen,” analyst Marcus Garvey said.Mr Garvey noted gold would probably find support over the coming weeks as the deluge of economic data quickens. Fed commentary on inflation, labour market trends and wage pressures is also likely to have a “strong impact on market sentiment”, he added.Shares of Newmont Mining fell 2.35 per cent to $25.32, Goldcorp declined 2.15 per cent to $27.81, Eldorado Gold slipped 3.24 per cent to $7.47 and Barrick Gold slid 2.13 per cent to $18.88.The pharmaceutical industry sustained this year’s frenetic pace of dealmaking on Monday, when US drugmaker Mylan agreed to buy a series of medicines from rival Abbott for $5.3bn in shares.As part of the deal, Mylan will secure more than 100 generic medicines for conditions that include gastroenteritis and respiratory problems that Abbott currently sells in developed markets outside the US.The acquisition will add about $1.9bn of annual revenues to Mylan, according to the company. Under the terms of the agreement, a new company will be created in the Netherlands to own the assets, which Mylan will then merge with.Shares of Mylan rose 2.07 per cent to $51.24 while Abbott advanced 1.26 per cent to $41.82.Citigroup climbed 3 per cent to $48.42 after the bank agreed to a $7bn settlement with the Department of Justice to resolve a long-running investigation into the sale of mortgage-backed securities.That forced Citi to take a $3.8bn legal charge in its second-quarter results. Excluding the charge, Citi earned $1.24 a share, better than lowly expectations of $1.05.Like rivals, Citi enjoyed the benefits of the improvement in the financial health of US households, allowing the bank to release $696m straight on to its bottom line.Analysts with Morgan Stanley said the deal with regulators was a “positive”. The figures lifted the broader banking sector.Bank of America shares climbed 1.24 per cent to $15.57, Morgan Stanley rose 1.27 per cent to $31.81 and JPMorgan shares were 1.24 per cent higher to $56.29.New orders for Boeing jets at the Farnborough air show lifted shares of the aircraft maker 1.12 per cent to $129.52.The company said Monarch Airlines had picked it as the preferred bidder to replace its aircraft fleet in a deal for 30 planes, worth $3.1bn at list prices.Dublin-based leasing company Avolon also committed to buying six 787-9 Dreamliners and five 737 Max 9 aircraft, at more than $2bn in total.Independent oil and gas company Whiting Petroleum soared after announcing a $6bn all-stock deal to acquire Kodiak Oil & Gas over the weekend.Whiting said the combined company would produce more than 107,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in the Bakken and Three Forks region of North Dakota.Shares of Whiting increased 7.69 per cent to $84.58 while Kodiak rose 4.78 per cent to $14.91.Overall, US equity markets climbed ahead of a busy week of earnings announcements. Analysts estimate second-quarter earnings growth of 5.4 per cent compared with 3.4 per cent in the first quarter, according to FactSet.The benchmark S&P 500 advanced 0.48 per cent to 1,977.10 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.66 per cent to 17,055.42.

70;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2014-07-09T16:40:02Z;Copper on the rebound as sentiment shifts;;Just a few months ago, the best-known base metal was looking like the least loved. Copper, first mined 10,000 years ago and used extensively in construction and electrical applications, tumbled 10 per cent in the first quarter of the year to $6,430 a tonne, and hit its lowest level since 2010.The fall was sparked by events in China, which consumes more than 40 per cent of global copper supply. The country’s first domestic bond default raised fears about the economy, and the possible unwinding of financing deals using copper as collateral. With a surge in mine production anticipated this year, further price falls seemed possible. Thomson Reuters GFMS, a metals research firm, said in its annual industry survey in April that copper could test $6,000 a tonne this year. Goldman Sachs forecast a year-end price of $6,200 a tonne.That now seems a long way away. Despite a blip in June, due to worries about an alleged metals fraud in the Chinese port of Qingdao, copper has rebounded 8 per cent since March. On Wednesday afternoon, at $7,140 a tonne for three month delivery on the London Metal Exchange, the price is down just 3 per cent for the year.Several factors have contributed to the red metal’s rebound. The first is a general shift in investor sentiment towards commodities that has also dragged other metal prices higher, from palladium to nickel and aluminium. Better economic data from China, where factory output is increasing, have also helped.“Around April, a lot of funds were bearish on China,” says Matthew Wonnacott, an analyst at CRU, a commodities consultancy. “Now, the idea that it will have a not-so-bad year has been good for the copper price.”Shifting expectations of supply and demand have worked in copper’s favour too. While Chinese demand in the first quarter was poor, it has since picked up, and year on year growth of about 5.5 per cent appears achievable, according to Vivienne Lloyd, base metals analyst at Macquarie. US and EU consumption has also been healthy.Although mine production is increasing, with two new operations in Chile coming on line in June, supply of refined metal has disappointed.Problems and maintenance shutdowns at smelters in China in the first half of the year have limited refined copper production. In addition, some smelters deliberately pushed through less material while prices were below $7,000 a tonne, according to an analyst at one of the world’s biggest metals traders.“These guys make more money when prices are higher, so they were in no rush to produce,” the trader says. “You can mine as much copper as you like, but you are still dependent on these guys [in China] to turn it into refined product.”As a result, copper analysts are having to change their models. CRU, which had forecast a refined metal surplus of 100,000 tonnes for 2014, now reckons the market will be balanced, and in deficit if China’s State Reserves Bureau “takes a chunk out of the market” for its stockpile, as it does periodically.“The surplus narrative is not as strong as it was at the start of the year,” Mr Wonnacott says.Additional support for the copper price has come from new laws in Indonesia, which are designed to spur local manufacturing. The government’s ban on mineral ore exports in January mainly had an impact on producers of nickel and bauxite. But copper miners have also been affected by higher export taxes. This is important because Indonesia produces a lot of “clean” concentrates that contain few impurities and are in high demand in China. Neither Freeport-McMoRan, which operates the Grasberg mine, one of the world’s biggest, nor Newmont’s, with its Batu Hijau mine, have exported copper concentrate under the new legislation.A compromise on the export taxes is still possible but the presidential election has pushed the issue down the government’s list of priorities. As a result, Newmont has shuttered its mine and taken the Indonesian government to international arbitration.“Indonesia has a lot to do with the [copper] price rising,” says George Cheveley, a fund manager at Investec Asset Management. “There continues to be uncertainty as to when we will see exports. Reports in recent days suggest a settlement may be close but we have heard this before.”It is not all good news for copper bulls. With higher prices, and few scheduled closures, Chinese smelters are expected to increase production later this year. Stephen Briggs, an analyst at BNP Paribas, says a sustained rally above $7,000 a tonne is not justified.Analysts at Macquarie agree, writing in a report that “our outlook for the copper price is for a downturn” in the second half of the year.
71;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Gold bulls deeply suspicious of hedging;‘Hedge book’ now at 87 tonnes, from 1999 peak of 3,000 tonnes;To hedge, or not to hedge?It’s a question the gold industry has grappled with for decades and goes right to the heart of the question about why investors buy gold shares – to gain exposure to a rising gold price or invest in the exploration and development skills of miners.Julian Baring, the UK fund manager dubbed the “Gold Guru”, once reportedly said he did not like hedging because behind every hedge there was invariably a ditch and these are usually wet and miserable places.That was certainly the case in the early 2000s as the gold price took off and panicked miners spent billions of dollars closing their hedge positions. The 1990s were not much better, when excessive hedging by the industry (and central bank gold sales) pushed the price of gold below the cash cost of production.But for others, selling future gold production at fixed prices can, if properly, designed, executed and governed help miners fulfil their development plans even in the face of yo-yoing prices.For now, hedging remains deeply unpopular with investors, presumably because they are bullish on the gold price. At the end of March, the total amount of future gold production hedged, known as the global “hedge book”, stood at 87 tonnes – just 2 per cent of mine supply and a fraction of its 1999 peak of 3,000 tonnes.But there are signs that sentiment is starting to change. Last week Polyus Gold International, Russia’s largest producer of the precious metal, announced the biggest hedging transaction since the buybacks executed by AngloGold Ashanti and Barrick Gold in 2008-09.The programme will enable Polyus Gold to keep investing in Natalka, one of the largest undeveloped gold deposits in the world and means the industry will return to net hedging this year, according to Thomson Reuters GFMS, a research house. But only just.With gold currently trading near $1,300 a troy ounce and the market in modest contango, GFMS, which publishes a quarterly analysis of the global hedge book, does not see any of the large gold producers following the lead of Polyus Gold.Rather than lock in a “severely constrained margin” at current prices it thinks the likes of Barrick and Newmont will look to prop up profits by cutting costs and curtailing non-essential capital spending.Whether this is sensible is the subject of much debate.“Should the industry really have zero hedging when it is dealing with a commodity that went from $100 to $850 between 1976 and 1979 and then collapsed to $300 by 1982? A commodity which went from $750 in 2008 to $1,850 in 2011 and back to $1,180 in 2013,” equity analysts at Citigroup asked in a report published earlier this week.They believe gold producers should try to educate investors, explaining that hedging can help ensure their strategic plans are not tossed around by gold price volatility.“Perhaps put it to shareholders that the board would like to hedge 5 per cent of production in 2014, 10 per cent in 2015, 15 per cent in 2016, 20 per cent in 2017, 25 per cent in 2018 and then maintain that 25 per cent in perpetuity,” they suggest.This would offer the best of both worlds – neither the all-in approach of the 1990s nor the current zero-tolerance approach to hedging, says Citi.But given the current antipathy to hedging it will be a tough sell.The Commodities Note is an online commentary on the industry from the Financial Times
72;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Newmont subsidiary calls for arbitration over mineral export limits;;The local subsidiary of US mining group Newmont has filed for international arbitration against the government of Indonesia over restrictions on mineral exports, risking a political backlash during the country’s presidential election.Newmont Nusa Tenggara, which shut its Indonesian gold and copper mine and sent home 3,200 workers last month, said in a statement on Tuesday that the export ban violated its contract of work with the government and had “inflicted hardship and economic loss” on its employees and contractors.Newmont said its subsidiary is spending $20m-$25m a month to ensure “care and maintenance” at the closed mine and that its outlook would be affected by the shutdown.The group said it was seeking “injunctive relief” to allow it to resume exports and restart the Batu Hijau mine on the island of Sumbawa.The move comes during a tightly fought presidential election campaign, which has seen vociferous calls for greater resource nationalism.Indonesia is seeking to cancel all of the bilateral investment treaties under which cases like that of Newmont are usually brought, after an angry response from outgoing President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to an unrelated billion-dollar international lawsuit from UK-listed Churchill Mining.When Churchill launched its case in 2012, Mr Yudhoyono said he did not want multinational companies to “pressure developing countries like Indonesia”.Indonesia banned the exports of unprocessed minerals in January in a bid to promote the development of a downstream processing industry, despite years of lobbying against the policy from mining companies and warnings of tens of thousands of job losses.Martiono Hadinoto, the president director of Newmont Nusa Tenggara, which is 56 per cent owned by Newmont and Japan’s Sumitomo, said that after six months of talks with the government in “good faith” it had been “left with no option but to seek relief through international arbitration to ensure our stakeholders’ jobs, rights, and interests are protected”.He added that the company wanted “continued dialogue with the government to lead to a resolution outside of arbitration”.Craig Tevendale, an international arbitration lawyer at Herbert Smith Freehills in London, said that given Indonesia’s indignant response to recent arbitration cases and the climate of resource nationalism, Newmont was making a high-stakes gamble.“Bringing a case against a host state can be seen as a provocative step, with far reaching repercussions,” said Mr Tevendale, who has worked on previous corporate arbitration cases involving Indonesia. “It’s usually done as a very last resort. Sometimes there’s a tipping point in terms of the destruction of value beyond which a board of directors have to say we owe a duty to shareholders to recoup this money.”Bringing a case against a host state can be seen as a provocative step, with far reaching repercussionsMahendra Siregar, the head of Indonesia’s investment co-ordinating board, told the Financial Times that the government had reached or was close to reaching implementation agreements with about half of the 107 companies affected by the new mining law.He said he hoped that the other negotiations would conclude soon and that Newmont’s case would not have any adverse impact on investors’ perceptions about Indonesia.“It’s important for investors to understand that emerging markets are going to have new aspirations with regard to development objectives,” he explained. “The advancement of Indonesia’s development is for everybody’s gain, it’s not a zero sum game. Let’s do our best to produce common benefits.”
73;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2014-06-05T10:33:59Z;Newmont halts Indonesia mining operations;;US mining group Newmont has halted operations at its Indonesian gold and copper mine and will put 3,200 workers on leave with reduced pay from Friday, after it failed to reach a compromise with the government over export restrictions.Indonesia is a key global supplier of metals and a law implemented in January banning exports of raw minerals unless companies build processing plants has thrown the industry into turmoil.The measure, which is designed to promote industrial development in southeast Asia’s biggest economy, has forced many producers to shut down, sending the global price of nickel soaring and prompting threats of legal action from companies including Newmont.The US miner and its counterpart Freeport-McMoRan, which operates a much larger copper and gold mine in Indonesia, both claim that the export restrictions breach their contracts of work and have been locked in negotiations with mining officials for months to find a workaround.Officials and industry executives have said the government and the companies were close to a deal under which the miners would agree to build a copper smelter and be allowed to resume exports if they pay a small export tax.If there was a complete cessation of exports out of Indonesia, it would make a significant difference to the global marketBut Newmont said on Thursday that with its storage facilities full and talks still inconclusive it was no longer able to continue mining operations.“We have taken numerous steps to help resolve the export issue and support the government’s desire to increase in-country smelting,” said Martiono Hadianto, president director of Newmont Nusa Tenggara, the group’s local subsidiary. “However, despite our best efforts, we have not been able to export copper concentrate since January and we still do not have an export permit.”The discussions have been complicated by Indonesia’s upcoming presidential election on July 9, with incumbent Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono stepping down after reaching the two-term limit. Both presidential candidates, Prabowo Subianto and Joko Widodo, have indicated they will keep the mineral export ban in place.Newmont said on Thursday that it was putting 80 per cent of the 4,000 employees at its Batu Hijau mine, on the island of Sumbawa, on leave with reduced pay, leaving a skeleton staff responsible for “care and maintenance” at the site.Freeport has warned previously that the export ban would force it to cut production by 60 per cent, resulting in 15,000 job losses and costing the government an annual $1.6bn in lost royalties and taxes.But Mr Hadianto said he was hopeful that “continued dialogue with the government will lead to resolution in the near term”.Jim Lennon, a metals consultant for Macquarie, the investment bank, said the Newmont shutdown was unlikely to have an immediate impact on the international copper market given that Indonesia only produces about 1.5 per cent of global supply.By contrast, Indonesia accounts for about a quarter of global nickel and prices of that metal have soared by more than 40 per cent since the export ban came into force.Mr Lennon added that there could be long-term consequences if Newmont and Freeport do not iron out their differences with the Indonesian government soon. “If there was a complete cessation of exports out of Indonesia, it would make a significant difference to the global market,” he said.“But there is a widespread expectation that they will reach a deal on a smelter soon and will resume exports.” 
74;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2014-06-02T21:16:14Z;Gold miners under pressure from price falls;;Gold mining stocks remained under pressure as the precious metal tumbled for a fifth consecutive day, touching its lowest level since February.Strategists with several investment banks said they expected gold prices to remain weak, despite a still depressed 10-year Treasury yield.Shares of Newmont Mining fell 1.35 per cent to $22.58 while Goldcorp declined 2 per cent to $22.90 and Barrick Gold slipped 1.30 per cent to $15.90.Gold prices were “intent on trading lower but in a very orderly fashion”, UBS strategist Edel Tully said.“There’s no rush from physical buyers here, rather they’re happy to wait for lower levels in what is seasonally a quiet time for physical demand,” Ms Tully added.Compounding the move in gold were conflicting reports on manufacturing activity in the US this May.Figures from the Institute for Supply Management at first showed an unexpected decline in growth – before the group was forced to issue a correction.The final report indicated manufacturing activity that was nearly in line with Wall Street expectations, the latest is a stream of data indicative of a firming US economy.Shares of semiconductor maker Broadcom bounced higher after the company said it wanted to sell or wind down its cellular baseband chip business.The move reflected rival Qualcomm’s dominance in the sector.While Qualcomm maintains a lead over rivals in areas such as its 4G LTE mobile broadband chips and has increased its market share, Broadcom’s baseband modem share has shrunk.Broadcom said it had engaged investment bank JPMorgan, sending its shares 9.32 per cent higher to $34.84.Qualcomm shares inched less than 1 per cent higher to $80.48.Allergan shares continued to rise after activist investor Bill Ackman filed paperwork with the US Securities and Exchange Commission seeking a special meeting of Allergan shareholders.Mr Ackman, who is Allergan’s largest investor and a supporter of a $53bn takeover of the company by Valeant Pharmaceuticals, intends to remove some of Allergan’s board directors and force the board to begin discussions with Valeant.Shares of Allergan climbed 2.86 per cent to $172.25, a new record high, while Valeant rose 2.26 per cent to $134.17.Semiconductor company Xilinx fell 1.26 per cent to $46.37 after Goldman Sachs dimmed its view on the industry, warning that orders for communication equipment could decline in the second half of the year.Overall, US equity markets continued a slow march higher after a correction to the monthly ISM manufacturing report.The survey of American manufacturing in May starts a busy week for US economic data that ends with the monthly jobs tally.Investors and economists have hoped that reports from May will offer a clearer snapshot of the US economy than April when a number of indicators, including the jobs tally, were buoyed by the post-winter rebound.The S&P 500 nudged slightly up to 1,924.97 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched higher to 16,743.63.

75;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2014-06-02T14:30:38Z;Barrick Gold’s chief admits lessons learnt from recent setbacks;;Barrick Gold built its case for a merger with Newmont Mining on the savings the world’s two largest gold miners by output could extract from their joint holdings in Nevada. Now Barrick’s chief executive says that the miner has “moved on” from the aborted merger attempt but insists Nevada remains central to its plans.Jamie Sokalsky played up the potential for Barrick to grow on the back of its own gold discoveries in the US state, and says that even without a merger Barrick will still look for ways to co-operate in Nevada with Newmont. “There are some things we could do on the ground,” he says.Mr Sokalsky also adds the Canadian group has “learned some hard lessons” from recent setbacks such as its shelved attempt to build its huge Pascua-Lama gold mine in South America and will now take a more gradual approach to growth. The change of emphasis shows how miners have been forced to temper their ambitions because of the weak gold price.Barrick and Newmont, the number two gold producer, halted merger talks in April amid acrimony. The merger was predicated on creating what Barrick estimated as $1bn of annual synergies through combining their holdings in Nevada, the centre of US gold mining, while spinning off mines across Africa and Asia into a separate company, which Mr Sokalsky was expected to have led.Some investors were dismayed by the idea that Barrick – which accumulated large debts during a phase of expansion as the gold price soared until last year – was ready for a further “land grab” by combining with Newmont. The merger idea was revealed months after Barrick had to issue fresh equity to reduce debt.Mr Sokalsky, who has led Barrick since 2012, denied the merger would have been at odds with the more cautious course the company says it is steering since the gold price fall.“It was a unique opportunity with large synergies and portfolio optimisation and that was in line with what we had been doing,” he says. “We can move on with the same strategy. It was not a must-have.”Barrick is still highlighting its options in Nevada and is expected next year to decide on how to proceed with its large discovery at Goldrush, near its Cortez mine in the state. For Barrick, stung by costly overseas misadventures, holdings in mining-friendly jurisdictions such as Nevada are a way of lowering political risk.“It was a unique opportunity with large synergies and portfolio optimisation and that was in line with what we had been doing,” he says. “We can move on with the same strategy. It was not a must-haveMr Sokalsky says Barrick is making a “sea change” in its approach to big projects after problems with Pascua-Lama, a gold project straddling the Chile-Argentina border that has run vastly over budget. The project is being ramped down and shelved until the gold price recovers.“Some day this will be one of the best gold and silver mines in the world but right now we have to solve some challenges on the regulatory and legal side, and that is going to take some time,” Mr Sokalsky says. Smaller, “staged” projects now make more sense, he adds.Barrick’s net debt of $10.5bn is “absolutely manageable”, with $1bn due in the next four years, he says. “We have a lot of levers to pull.”Mr Sokalsky was chief financial officer before becoming chief executive but his role at the company is set to come under scrutiny, not least because the merger plan with Barrick would apparently have seen Gary Goldberg, Newmont’s chief executive, take over that role at the combined group.Barrick also has a new executive chairman in John Thornton, the former Goldman Sachs banker who took over from founder Peter Munk in April. Mr Thornton is expected to take a significant part in setting strategy and has said he sees a case for further diversification at Barrick, which already mines copper as well as gold.Whether and how to diversify would be an “ongoing discussion . . . the objective is to make the most amount of money,” says Mr Sokalsky. “I am very much looking forward to being CEO of the company going forward and helping to move it forward. I love this company, I have been at Barrick for 20 years.”

Its shares rose 3.4 per cent to $15.22.Office Depot was buoyed on Tuesday by an upgrade from broker Goldman Sachs as the investment bank warmed to industry consolidation that will eventually lower the company’s cost base.“We see a significant opportunity for Office Depot to deliver impressive earnings growth in 2014 to 2016 from the merger integration and a broader cost-cutting initiative, off an exceptionally low margin base,” analyst Matthew Fassler said.The investment bank noted that the industry was still “one of the toughest in retail” with secular pressures on office supplies and declining paper consumption.Goldman downgraded Staples to ‘sell’ from ‘neutral’ on those concerns.Shares in Office Depot rose 2.58 per cent to $5.17 while Staples fell 1.97 per cent to $11.42.Hillshire Brands, the US company behind Jimmy Dean sausages and Sara Lee frozen desserts, surged by more than a fifth after finding itself in a rival’s crosshairs.Pilgrim’s Pride offered to buy Hillshire for $6.4bn in cash. The proposal from Pilgrim’s comes less than a month after Hillshire signed a deal to acquire Pinnacle Foods for $6.6bn.William Lovette, chief executive of Pilgrim’s Pride, said he would prefer a “negotiated transaction” and urged Hillshire to abandon the agreement with Pinnacle Foods.Shares in Hillshire jumped more than 22 per cent to $45.19, Pilgrim’s Pride rose 1.67 per cent to $25.52 and Pinnacle Foods dipped 5.38 per cent to $31.48.Pfizer shares closed up 0.41 per cent to $29.61 a day after the US drugmaker formally abandoned its £69.4bn offer for UK rival AstraZeneca.AstraZeneca shares trading in New York fell 0.32 per cent to $72.05.Overall, the benchmark S&P 500 touched new record highs on the firming economic reports.The S&P 500 rose 0.6 per cent to 1,911.91 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.42 per cent to 16,675.50.

77;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2014-05-22T08:32:01Z;Polymetal buys Kazakh gold project for $600m;;Polymetal International is to pay at least $619m for a gold project in Kazakhstan, ending a search for deals with an asset that could raise the precious metal miner’s output by 30 per cent within five years.The acquisition is the largest by a UK-listed gold mining group since last year’s steep fall in the price of the metal forced many miners to reassess projects. Vitaly Nesis, chief executive, said Polymetal had been on an “opportunistic M&A hunt after the decline of the gold price”.The deal increases Polymetal’s reserves of gold by about 50 per cent while improving their overall grade, and helps the miner address concerns over its growth prospects and the relatively short remaining lives of many of its mines, most of which are in Russia.However, Bakyrchik, the main deposit being acquired, has a reputation as being difficult to develop because of what Mr Nesis acknowledged was its “complex metallurgy”.Polymetal is to pay an initial $618.5m, comprising $318.5m in cash and $300m of its shares, to buy the holding company for the Kyzyl gold project. The project is being sold by Sumeru companies linked to Timur Kulibayev, the billionaire son-in-law of Kazakhstan’s president Nursultan Nazarbayev.Mr Kulibayev consolidated control of the project last year when he bought 50 per cent for $235m from Turquoise Hill, the Canada-listed miner best known as the owner of the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia.Polymetal may make further payments of up to $500m, depending on the gold price and Polymetal’s share price over the next seven years.“This is a full price but for a top-notch asset,” said Mr Nesis.The deposits were mined at various times from the 1950s through to the 1990s, and again after an international consortium acquired the project in 1992.Polymetal would take a “fundamentally different” approach to the mine’s development, said Mr Nesis, including using an open-pit mining method rather than building an underground mine.Annual output of between 300,000 and 400,000 oz of gold was expected, Mr Nesis said. Polymetal produced almost 1.3m oz last year, including silver measured on a “gold-equivalent” basis.Analysts at Citi said valuing the deal was difficult until Polymetal completed a feasibility study for the mine’s development at the end of 2015.“It is not clear what the final acquisition price will eventually be . . . there are just too many uncertainties to conclude whether this will be positive or negative,” they said. “We have a ‘sneaking suspicion’ that this could eventually be very good [for Polymetal].

National Oilwell Varco reported a 9 per cent rise in sales from a year earlier to $5.8bn.Profits climbed 17 per cent to $589m, or $1.37 per share. When adjusting for certain transaction costs, the company said it earned $1.40 a share, ahead of Wall Street forecasts. Shares fell 7.4 per cent to $77.31.Shares in Bank of America slumped 6.3 per cent to $14.95 after the company said it would return less capital to shareholders than previously announced after finding an error in the way it accounted for structured notes.Bank of America had previously announced plans for a $4bn share buyback and an increase of its dividend to 5 cents a share from one cent.The accounting mistake relates to the bank’s treatment of structured notes issued by Merrill Lynch, the bank it acquired at the height of the financial crisis in 2008.Analysts at Morgan Stanley said the market reaction was “overdone” with the mistake dimming estimated 2015 earnings by 1.3 per cent.“Market seems to be pricing in elimination of stock buybacks through 2016,” Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck said. “We feel this is too punitive given Bank of America’s high level of capital from which they’re starting from . . . and the fact that they self-reported this mistake.”The failure, at least at this moment, of two mergers has put pressure on shares of Newmont Mining and Mylan, even as large-scale deal activity continues at a heady pace.On Monday, Barrick Gold said it had been informed by Newmont Mining that talks between the two producers about a possible merger were done.“Although Barrick believes the interests of shareholders are best served through the completion of this business combination, Newmont’s board has determined that the interests of Newmont’s shareholders are best served by remaining independent,” the company said in a statement.With the price of the yellow metal tumbling, producers are eyeing combinations to cut costs.Last week, Canadian producer Osisko Mining was taken over in a $2.9bn deal by competitors Yamana Gold and Agnico Eagle Mines.After reaching a post-crisis high of $1,900 an ounce in September 2011, the gold price has fallen steadily as the twin threats of deflation and spiralling inflation have eased.Newmont Mining shares fell 6.7 per cent to $24.67 while Barrick declined 3 per cent to $17.33.Mylan, the US drug company which increased its bid for Swedish drugmaker Meda last week, was rebuffed for a second time on Monday, sending its shares lower.Shares in Mylan declined 2.7 per cent to $50.67 while Meda shares trading in Stockholm fell 8 per cent to SKr118.50.Overall, US equity markets began a busy week on a shaky footing.While pending home sales and a regional report on manufacturing showed underlying improvements in economic activity, investors remained on the side ahead of earnings reports from a fifth of S&P 500 companies and the monthly non-farm payrolls report.The benchmark S&P 500 was up 0.32 per cent at 1,869.43 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.53 per cent to 16,448.74. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite nudged down to 4,074.40.
79;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2014-04-28T12:49:27Z;Gold producing rivals attack each other as merger talks end;Newmont and Barrick talks fail over deal that would have reshaped the gold mining sector;"Merger talks between Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining have collapsed amid sharp criticism from each of the other’s attitude to attempts to combine the world’s two largest gold producers by output.The mutual recriminations surfaced after the end of advanced discussions that would have reshaped the gold mining sector at a time of severe stress for many producers. They have been racing to cut costs after a decade-long bull run for gold went into sharp reverse last year.Newmont took aim at John Thornton, Barrick’s co-chairman, on Monday saying the former Goldman Sachs banker had been unconstructive on “fundamental strategic and structural issues”.Barrick of Canada, the larger and more valuable of the two, said the US company Newmont had “sought to renege on three foundational elements” of a proposed merger, which Barrick said had been agreed more than two weeks ago.Barrick had been in talks with Newmont over a combination that would have created a lower-cost producer based on output from their large US mines. Other assets would have been spun off into smaller companies. The two companies together produce about 10 to 12 per cent of annual gold mine output.Newmont shares fell 7 per cent to $24.61 on Monday while Barrick declined 3 per cent to $17.40.Barrick said the elements of a deal that Newmont had sought to change were a Toronto head office for the merged company; the identification of specific assets for a spin-off; and “carefully constructed governance arrangements”, particularly over the roles and authority of the chairman, the lead director and chief executive at a merged group.Newmont denied that it reneged and said it “strongly disagrees with Barrick’s characterisation of events that followed”.Earlier on Monday, Newmont released a letter sent from Vincent Calarco, its chairman, to Barrick directors, saying efforts to find consensus had been “rejected out of hand repeatedly”.Newmont took aim at Mr Thornton, who is due to succeed Peter Munk, Barrick’s founder, as sole chairman this week.“While our team has found your management team’s engagement to be constructive and professional, the same constructive nature cannot be said of our discussions with your co-chairman on certain fundamental strategic and structural issues over the past two weeks,” Mr Calarco wrote.According to Newmont, Mr Thornton had told the US company that talks were “dead”. “That unilateral declaration made us question whether we actually shared the vision and values that are necessary to forge a successful new company,” Mr Calarco wrote.Newmont also criticised Mr Munk, who said the US company was “not shareholder-friendly”.Barrick and Newmont have sporadically held merger talks. Some of their biggest mines are in the same stretch of Nevada, which analysts say would have obvious cost-cutting advantages at a time when miners are under pressure to reduce spending.Both Barrick and Newmont have also been criticised by some analysts for having become too unwieldy as the search for gold deposits has led them into more complicated regions around the world.Last week, Mr Munk advocated a merger, saying a combination based on both groups’ US mines would have been low risk as well as low cost.Gold mining has long been a specialised sector of the mining industry. There is a stable of investors who historically preferred to invest in “pure play” gold mining companies and they have attracted higher valuations than other miners.Barrick was founded in the 1980s by Mr Munk and grew through acquisitions to become the world’s largest gold miner by output, although annual production is now falling as the company retrenches. Colorado-based Newmont was founded in 1921."
80;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2014-04-24T23:12:11Z;Gold miner and the metal itself help in fight against malaria;A look at how AngloGold Ashanti in Ghana is taking a lead role;When AngloGold Ashanti began a malaria control programme at its gold mine in Obuasi in the Ashanti region of southwest Ghana in 2005, the main local hospital was handling 6,800 cases of the disease a month.Almost a decade later, and after an annual investment of $1.5m, it has cut that volume to about 100 a month, and as low as 47 in March. “This is very positive,” says Sylvester Segbaya, director of the company’s malaria control programme. “We’ve sharply reduced the burden.”Often nature works synergistically, generating problems and solutions in the same place. This applies to gold mining, which often brings large volumes of people close to areas of ­stagnant water in humid climates where mosquitoes can breed.The industry risks ­harbouring – if not encouraging malaria – through artisanal mining processes, during which gold is washed and sorted with water, and more generally by bringing employees into high-risk areas.Yet both the mining companies and the precious metal itself can play an important role in tackling the disease. The juxtaposition of a lethal disease and large companies extracting gold is beginning to mobilise greater efforts to tackle malaria.With 2,500 of the malaria cases among AngloGold Ashanti’s own employees a decade ago – amounting to a third of its workforce – there was a strong element of self-interest in it doing more.With an average of three days absence per infection, the company estimated it was losing 7,500 man-days a month and spending $660,000 a year on treatment. Malaria caused absenteeism from employment and from schools in the local community.“Malaria from the very word ‘go’ is a big problem,” Mr Segbaya says. “We saw it affecting the productivity of our employees and everything else. Even when staff got back to work, they were not as fit and strong as they used to be, and had lower output. It was harming our operations.”The company placed great emphasis on indoor residual spraying to kill and deter mosquitoes, ­carrying out programmes every six months. Large-scale government programmes had been carried out several decades ago, but since neglected.It also launched larviciding in selected places to kill mosquito eggs. More recently, AngloGold has ensured that all suspected cases are confirmed with testing ahead of treatment.It has begun to distribute bed nets alongside government programmes, al­though Mr Segbaya says there is still some debate on their value at the company.“The challenge we saw was that people had the option to use the nets or not,” he argues. “We didn’t want to leave the results to individual’s discretion. Data have shown that people use them only 40 or 50 per cent of the time.”However, the company’s success in this area has led to its appointment – ­unusual for a business – as the principal recipient of a grant in Ghana for bed net distribution by the Global Fund to fight Aids, TB and Malaria. It also advises the US President’s Malaria Initiative on insecticide spraying.Just as importantly, the company has begun to expand its programme to its other mines in Ghana and the various countries where it operates, including Guinea, Mali and Tanzania.Its thinking has also helped inspire other mining companies to wage war on malaria, including Newmont of the US and Kinross of Canada.Critics say that larger companies could be doing more to tackle malaria, for instance increasing the focus on artisanal mining communities.Many people also point to the primary role of government in operating malaria control programmes.Mr Segbaya says: “The problem is always that government support has been very limited. We had to follow with the funding.”In the absence of sufficient public sector financing and activity, Mr Segbaya says he is working with Ghana’s government to create “a national fund overseen by high-profile people with integrity, and with companies to make their contribution”.Meanwhile, there is another important role that gold plays in the fight against malaria.Trevor Keel, head of technology at the World Gold Council, says the metal is an essential part of modern rapid diagnostic tests for those infected with the parasite. Some 200m kits are distributed globally each year.The malaria antibody is attached to gold nanoparticles during manufacture. These will attract any malaria antigens in a blood sample. That turns the particles from red to purple, resulting in a “positive” two-line readout on the device.“Without the gold, these tests would be useless,” says Mr Keel.His organisation is now working on support for the development of a new thermal contrast technology that will improve the sensitivity of standard rapid diagnostic tests.More generally, gold itself is finding new applications, both in diagnostics for a wider range of diseases and even in some treatments, such as for dysentery.Gold may find a broader range of medical uses, while the businesses that extract it are mobilising to tackle the malaria with which mining can all too often be associated.
81;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2014-04-24T14:40:10Z;Barrick Gold and Newmont examine prospects of golden merger;;They might not like the word, but employees at Barrick Gold’s giant Goldstrike mine know all about the synergies their company wants from a potential merger with Newmont Mining.The road to Goldstrike through the low scrub hills of Nevada leads first past Newmont’s mines practically right next door. For these neighbours – the world’s two largest gold producers by output – this gold-rich state has been essential to their prospects for decades.Peter Munk, Barrick’s founder and chairman, says he believed “from day one” in Nevada more than a quarter-century ago that a merger with Newmont would make sense. Just days before he leaves Barrick, is the 86-year-old entrepreneur on track to get his wish?Peter Munk, who started Barrick Gold in 1982, has seen the group rise through 16 takeovers but falter in recent years through writedowns, writes James Wilson.Continue readingBarrick and Newmont have been in talks over a potential all-share $33bn merger, which is on ice but could yet be resurrected. Combined, the companies produce three times as much gold as their nearest rival, but a lot of this output would be spun out into units with the companies’ Australasian and African mines – a route that Barrick has travelled already by creating African Barrick Gold in 2010.It would leave a core Americas-focused miner that would produce more gold at lower cost than either of today’s companies.Even fully combined, the two companies produce about 12 per cent of annually mined gold, meaning competition issues are unlikely to arise, given that the gold market only partly depends on mine supply.Mr Munk’s penchant for dealmaking built Barrick into the world’s largest gold miner, but a merger with Newmont would be of a different nature to the acquisitions struck over the past decade, when his company’s dash for growth was marked by a rising gold price. Today, after a 28 per cent plunge in the gold price last year and huge writedowns on overambitious projects, Barrick and other miners are seeking ways out of crisis.“This is a merger out of necessity – a reaction to the gold price. Both companies’ balance sheets are absolutely stretched,” says Jorge Beristain, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. “They have downsized and they have cut growth capex to the bone – what else is left? This is one of the last things left to them to do . . . The gold market is pricing gold at a level of maximum pain for companies, telling them ‘Heal thyself – figure out a way to cut costs’.”Peter Munk, the founder and chairman of Barrick Gold, has hailed the potential benefits of merging the world’s largest gold miner with its US rival Newmont Mining, saying that investors should welcome the cost cuts and lower political risk that a combination could deliver, writes James Wilson.Continue readingShares in both companies are down 60 per cent since the end of 2011, while the S&P 500 index is up 53 per cent.Newmont cut $1bn, or 14 per cent, from spending in 2013. Its operating cash flow fell from $2.4bn to $1.6bn. Barrick, where operating cash flow fell from $6bn to $4.2bn, cut its capex from $7bn to $5.4bn. The companies also sold a combined $1.6bn of assets.People close to the plans say $1bn of synergies could be gleaned from bringing together the assets of the companies, which have combined revenues of $18bn. Analysts say the sum is open to question but acknowledge savings could be made.“This is a good deal in principle with clear synergies and a real rationale,” says Patrick Chidley, an HSBC analyst. “They are a stone’s throw from each other in Nevada and there is clearly a massive opportunity to combine functions, but it is still tough to get to $1bn of synergies from what we can see. But there may be other gains from lowering the cost of capital for a combined company.”Mr Beristain says the companies could also “cherry pick the winners” from their combined exploration portfolios, saying: “I don’t think $1bn of synergies is out of the question. These are very top-heavy companies.”This is a good deal in principle with clear synergies and a real rationale. They are a stone’s throw from each other in Nevada, and there is clearly a massive opportunity to combine functionsSavings are not the whole story. Recasting Barrick and Newmont along regional and possibly commodity lines – both companies also produce copper– would also be attractive, says Mr Chidley.“We have been saying for a while that these companies should be split up and reconfigured into units that investors want to invest in. There is also a good chance to spin out a decent-sized copper producer. Many gold investors simply do not want to invest in copper assets,” he says.Mr Munk takes a similar view. “We have all the mines . . . imagine if you could repackage them and create a totally different company, operating primarily out of Nevada,” he says. “Who else has the luck, fortune and historical background to own that sort of acreage in the most productive gold region in America?”Are these advantages enough to sell the deal to investors grown very sceptical of mining dealmaking and empire building? Barrick’s last deal – to buy copper producer Equinox in 2011 – was an expensive mistake, as Mr Munk himself admits.Synergies – compared with valuations – may revive mergerContinue readingOne investor says there are so many possible permutations and spin-offs from company’s combined assets that it is virtually impossible to say what value could be created. Both companies are heavily laden with debt – almost $16bn combined, net of cash – so doubts remain over how much debt could be assigned to the balance sheets of any units created from the merger.“There’s just not enough cash flow, and both have generally declining assets,” the investor says. “You would have some of the new units re-rating, some derating – what’s the value overall?”Barrick’s previous attempt at a spin-off, African Barrick Gold, has not been a great success. Shares in the UK-listed, Tanzania focused miner are at less than half their initial offer value in 2010, though they have recovered this year.Newmont and Barrick have a long history of rivalry, but Mr Munk believes the right people are in place for a merger to succeed. The talk has been of a company where John Thornton, the ex-Goldman Sachs banker who is taking over next week as Barrick’s chairman, would become executive chairman and Gary Goldberg, Newmont chief executive, would become CEO of the combined group.“Personalities cannot be allowed to get in the way,” the investor says. “If there is a good deal to be done – with the emphasis on the ‘if’ – it has to be allowed to come out.”Tanzania-focused subsidiary on the mendAfrican Barrick Gold showed signs of continued improvement after first-quarter gold output rose 18 per cent year on year while headline all-in costs fell more than a quarter, writes James Wilson.The Tanzania-focused subsidiary of Barrick said quarterly revenues of $216m were 12 per cent lower year on year because of lower gold prices. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation fell 21 per cent to $65m.African Barrick also said it had given the go-ahead to an expansion at its Bulyanhulu mine that would add about 9 per cent to annual production. Shares in the UK-listed group, where Barrick owns 64 per cent after selling part of its holding last month, rose 1.8p to 250p.
82;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2014-04-23T16:59:43Z;Newmont / Barrick Gold: lustre;Synergies – compared with valuations – may revive merger;"A gold mine is a hole in the ground with a liar on top. It is not clear if Mark Twain ever said that. It is also not always true. Sometimes gold mining stocks are an honest value.Newmont Mining and Barrick Gold, the largest gold miners, have valuations of more than twice Rio Tinto’s or BHP Billiton’s – using the ratio of price to expected earnings. Rio and BHP, diversified miners, are on 10 and 12 times, respectively; Newmont and Barrick are on 32 and 21.That sounds heady. But in the context of the merger which Barrick and Newmont have – for now – stopped discussing, synergies must be accounted for. This brings the valuations down. About $1bn of savings have been mooted – or up to $10bn pre-tax, capitalised. Newmont’s market capitalisation is just $12bn, after a hammering in gold prices over the past year and writedowns on key projects.Any merger might appear to offer a decent shot at creating value, then. In Nevada, where the two companies mine about a third of their combined 12m gold ounces, some of their operations are separated by little more than a fence and security guards. The companies’ combined operating and capital spending budget will be $65bn over the next half-decade, JPMorgan thinks: two-thirds of an Apollo moon programme. A small cut to that could result in a big boost to the combined companies’ value, if the synergies can be achieved, and gold prices do not tank further.There are projects further afield – where gold miners are increasingly unwilling to go, given capital required and the political risks. Newmont and Barrick could spin out a fifth of production, including projects in Asia and Australia, along with some debt, to investors who want higher risk and returns. But in any rump Americas-focused company it will still be critical to achieve the projected synergies.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
83;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Barrick Gold chief hails benefits of Newmont merger;;Peter Munk, the founder and chairman of Barrick Gold, has hailed the potential benefits of merging the world’s largest gold miner with its US rival Newmont Mining, saying that investors should welcome the cost cuts and lower political risk that a combination could deliver.Barrick, of Canada, and Newmont had been in advanced merger talks, according to people familiar with their plans, but the discussions stalled – frustrating attempts to present a deal to investors before both companies’ annual meetings this month.The attempts to broker a merger come as the gold mining sector is under severe pressure to cut costs and restructure, reversing a dash for growth that took place as the price of the metal soared for much of the past 12 years, before plummeting in 2013.The two companies – which have not commented on the talks – have a combined market capitalisation of more than $30bn and would produce about 12 per cent of annual gold mine output, three times more than the next largest producer.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Munk said there were “obviously synergies available” from combining Barrick and Newmont, pointing out that the two companies had many assets “cheek by jowl” in Nevada, the US’s foremost gold producing state.People familiar with the talks have said $1bn in synergies could result if a combined company concentrated on Nevada and spun off other assets – and suggested such a deal could still take place.Mr Munk founded Barrick in 1982 and said he had long believed that a combination with Newmont would benefit shareholders. The fall in the gold price meant there was now more to be gained, he argued.The average major investor who wants to invest in the ideal gold company hates maximum political risks and loves minimal political risks. That gives you a clear definition of where you ought to be – you ought to be in Canada and the US“Each dollar saved can make a difference – that is why savings are so essential and critical to shareholders,” Mr Munk said. “At a low gold price, they become much more important.”Mr Munk said he believed investors would welcome the lower political risk associated with a company that was more focused on North America.“You just know that the average major investor who wants to invest in the ideal gold company hates maximum political risks and loves minimal political risks,” he said. “That gives you a clear definition of where you ought to be – you ought to be in Canada and the US.“We are spending most of our money drilling [in Nevada]. Imagine how much more efficient [that] would become . . . imagine how much more effective a mining exploration programme would be.”Mr Munk, who is 86, turned the company into the world’s largest and most valuable gold miner, before embarking on a diversification through the purchase of copper miner Equinox in 2011.That deal was widely seen as overly expensive and the past two years have been difficult for Barrick, which sank to a $10.3bn loss last year after a sharp gold price fall and writedowns on a costly Andean mine project. The company raised $3bn of equity to cut debt and improve its balance sheet, and has sold assets for more than $1bn since last year in a retreat from some of its smaller and higher-cost mines.Mr Munk is due to step down as chairman at Barrick next week, handing over to John Thornton, formerly a senior banker at Goldman Sachs.
84;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2014-04-20T12:36:15Z;Barrick and Newmont still open to $30bn merger;;Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining, the world’s two largest producers of gold, are still considering ways to pursue a $30bn merger, despite halting advanced talks on Friday over a potential tie-up.They had been discussing a deal that could have combined their substantial gold mine holdings in North America while spinning off some of their international assets into a separate vehicle.Their talks almost reached a stage that would have allowed a merger to be announced on Tuesday, ahead of Newmont’s annual shareholder meeting, according to people familiar with the plans, which were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.But, while the companies have decided to end their negotiations for the time being, they have not ruled out pursuing a deal in the future, the people said on Sunday.With a combined market capitalisation of almost $33bn, a merger between Barrick and Newmont would be the biggest carried out in the gold sector. Talks between the companies came after both had been retrenching following a sharp fall in the gold price and demonstrated the need for major players in the industry to cut costs and reduce risk in more marginal jurisdictions.A tie-up would also have been a remarkable conclusion to the career of Peter Munk, Barrick’s octogenarian founder, who is due to step down as chairman at the Canadian group’s shareholder meeting on April 30. He is due to be succeeded by John Thornton, the former Goldman Sachs investment banker who is already Barrick’s co-chairman and was closely involved in the latest merger plans.Barrick and Newmont, which is headquartered in Colorado, have talked in the past about a possible link-up. Their combined annual gold output last year, of about 12m ounces of gold, is almost three times greater than that of AngloGold Ashanti, the number three producer.Both Barrick and Newmont have substantial mining operations in Nevada, the centre of US gold production, and a merger would have been partly based on synergies of combining operations in North America. The two companies are already partners at one Nevada mine.Other assets – including Newmont’s Australasian mines and African Barrick Gold, Barrick’s UK-listed subsidiary – could have been included in a spin-off. The two companies are joint owners of a gold mine in Kalgoorlie, Australia.Both Newmont and Barrick have also been open to the possibility of expanding beyond the gold sector. Barrick diversified into copper by buying Equinox in 2011 while Newmont – which took on several key executives from Rio Tinto’s copper division – has also been looking at buying more copper assets. Most recently, it considered a bid for Las Bambas, recently sold by Glencore Xstrata.

Broadly, however, investor shifts seem to point to further weakness, he says.“Although a short-term trading focus generally does not mesh well with most institutional fund managers’s management style, we expect that shorter, more volatile multi-week rotations are likely to persist through the second quarter and into the third,” Mr Sluymer said.Tesla shares declined 2.11 per cent to $193.91, Facebook fell 3 per cent before recovering to close slightly higher at $59.08 and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals slipped by 0.67 per cent to $288.08.Coca-Cola led the benchmark S&P 500 after the company reported adjusted earnings that matched Wall Street expectations.First-quarter profits fell to $1.62bn, or 36 cents a share, from $1.75bn, or 39 cents a share, in the same quarter in 2013.Revenues declined 4 per cent to $10.6bn. When adjusting for certain items, Coca-Cola said it earned 44 cents per share.The Atlanta-based company said volumes of sparkling beverages in the North American market fell 1 per cent during the quarter.On a call with analysts, chairman and chief executive Muhtar Kent said he was determined to “accelerate” sparkling beverage growth by increasing marketing efforts as well as making new investments to support its brands.“These strategies to accelerate sparkling growth are solid and we expect to see improving results throughout the year,” he said.Shares in Coca-Cola rose 3.72 per cent to close at $40.17.Aaron’s, the US retailer that specialises in renting and selling furniture, was under pressure on Tuesday after the company rejected a takeover proposal and announced it had purchased a retail credit financing firm.The company has agreed to pay $700m for Progressive Finance Holdings, a maker of software used by retailers in the controversial so-called “lease to own” part of the retail market.Aaron’s, which has a market value of about $2.1bn, also rebuffed a takeover offer from private equity firm Vintage Capital. Shares in the company declined just over 4 per cent to end at $29.24.Overall, US equity indices shook off early declines to end the day slightly higher. The S&P 500 rose 0.68 per cent to 1,842.98 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.55 per cent higher at 16,262.56. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.29 per cent to close at 4,034.16.
86;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;US miners hit out at Indonesia copper tax;;US mining majors Freeport McMoRan and Newmont have hit out at Indonesia’s new tax on the export of copper concentrate, saying it is in breach of their long-standing contracts of work with the government.Both companies, which employ thousands of people at their vast copper and gold mines in Indonesia, said on Wednesday they were in talks with the government to resolve the situation. Newmont said it was considering other remedies including “possible legal action”.Indonesia, a major global exporter of metals such as bauxite, copper, and nickel, implemented a hotly-contested ban on the export of unprocessed mineral ores on January 12 as part of a drive to promote the development of a refining industry.Freeport and Newmont, which together contribute well over $1bn a year in taxes and royalties to the Indonesian government, initially won a reprieve, getting permission to export their partially processed copper concentrate until 2017.But the finance ministry delivered a sting in the tail when it announced shortly afterwards that the companies would have to pay a progressive export tax that will start at 25 per cent and rise to 60 per cent by 2017.Both Freeport and Newmont said that the new tax was in breach of their contracts of work with the government, which lay out the royalties and taxes that the companies must pay and state that they should not be subject to any further taxes, duties or fees imposed by the government.Freeport said on Wednesday that the new regulations conflict with the “contractual rights” of its 91 per cent-owned subsidiary Freeport Indonesia. It said it was working with the government to clarify the situation and defend Freeport Indonesia’s rights under its contract of work.Newmont went a step further, saying its Indonesian subsidiary “will continue to engage with government officials in Indonesia in an effort to resolve this issue, while also considering other remedies, including possible legal action.”Analysts said the new export tax would significantly dent Freeport and Newmont’s profitability at a time when costs in Indonesia have been rising and global metals prices remain depressed.One veteran mining industry consultant said the companies were still keen to reach a compromise with the government because any attempt to bring legal action ran the risk of making their position in the country untenable.“If you go for international arbitration, your chances of successfully maintaining your operations in Indonesia are going to be slim, given the government’s control over licensing,” he said.Freeport warned previously that the mineral export ban would force it to cut production by 60 per cent, leading to 15,000 redundancies and costing the government an annual $1.6bn in lost royalties and taxes.
87;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-03T03:00:05Z;Emerging market debt burdens may be sorely understated;Recent paper suggests overseas liabilities of EMs are greater than previously thought;For emerging economies, coronavirus struck first through the financial markets. Long before the numbers of cases and deaths in these countries began to spread alarm, many emerging markets experienced a sudden halt in foreign investment inflows.Overseas investors have taken $95bn out of EM stocks and bonds since late January, according to the Institute of International Finance, dwarfing the withdrawals that followed the onset of the global financial crisis in September 2008.As Covid-19 infections rise and fragile health systems struggle to cope, foreign investors may be low on the list of concerns for EM governments. But these outflows will have a big impact on the fiscal measures policymakers can bring to bear on the crisis.Emerging markets’ overseas liabilities, moreover, may be bigger than previously imagined. A paper published by Matteo Maggiori at Stanford and colleagues at Harvard, Chicago Booth and Columbia Business School suggests the true ownership of EM bonds by overseas investors is much greater than shown in standard data — in some countries, by many multiples.The paper also suggests that foreign holdings of shares issued by Chinese companies may be many times greater than the $160bn that shows up in US national accounts. Should US-China relations sour in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis, these giant holdings could become a source of significant risk.Mr Maggiori and his colleagues question the normal practice of allocating securities in national accounts on the basis of the residency rather than the nationality of their issuer. It may make sense, for example, for a bond issued by a Brazilian subsidiary of Banco Santander to be added to the debt statistics of Brazil (the residency of its issuer) rather than Spain (the nationality of the issuer’s ultimate owner), because the bond’s proceeds are likely to be put to use in Brazil.But it makes much less sense for a bond issued by Petrobras International Finance Company, a Cayman Island subsidiary of the Brazilian oil group, to be added to the debt statistics of the Cayman Islands. Yet that is what happens in standard, residency-based financial statistics such as the US’s Treasury International Capital data (TIC) and the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).Mr Maggiori says this results in a vast understatement of the investments by US, European and other international investors in emerging economies. So the academics developed an algorithm to reallocate the securities logged in the TIC and CPIS data according to nationality rather than residency.The results are startling. TIC data show that US ownership of Brazilian bonds at the end of 2017 amounted to $8bn, based on the residency of issuers. But restated by nationality, the total rises to $68bn. For Chinese bonds, the total rises from $3bn to $55bn. Mr Maggiori says the results sound a warning as the coronavirus crisis threatens to tip emerging markets into a debt crisis.“If we are going to see a wave of corporate defaults, it’s a risk worth thinking about that a lot of issuance has taken place offshore,” he said. “[Our work] shows that exposures are quite large.”What is also striking is the role played by tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. In the TIC data, of Brazil’s $59bn in reallocated bonds, $42bn were issued in tax havens. Of China’s $52bn, $44bn were issued in tax havens. The results also shine a light on the role of so-called variable interest equity structures in US investments in Chinese companies. VIEs allow US investors to hold shares in these companies, circumventing Chinese restrictions on foreign ownership of some operating businesses. But in these transactions what investors actually buy are shares in listed companies, generally resident in the Cayman Islands, that give them a claim on the profits of Chinese operating businesses.By reallocating such investments on the basis of nationality rather than residence, the paper shows that US “ownership” of Chinese companies at the end of 2017 was not $160bn, as shown in US national statistics, but $700bn. This puts it closer to the amount of Chinese ownership of US Treasuries, of about $1.1tn. This is significant because Chinese regulators are certainly aware of the smoke-and-mirrors act being carried out by VIEs. They could, should they wish, bring the practice to an end.Mr Maggiori is not suggesting they will. But he thinks the risk is worth noting. “You read a lot about the possibility of China dumping its US Treasuries but very little about the possibility of China imposing its own regulations. If we’re talking about one, we should certainly be talking about the other,” he said.jonathan.wheatley@ft.com
88;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2014-01-21T11:17:39Z;Indonesia’s ore export ban: no deterrent to investment?;;"Many mining companies in Indonesia have warned that a ban on the export of some unprocessed mineral ores, brought into force this month, will deter foreign investment in the sector.But Mahendra Siregar, the ambitious technocrat who heads Indonesia’s investment co-ordinating board (BKPM), believes that investment will in fact be boosted by the new rule as three metal smelters come on stream this year and 25 more are built over the next three years.Although many analysts remain sceptical about the economic rationale of refining metals in Indonesia, given the poor infrastructure and slim profit margins, Siregar says these 28 projects will generate Rp150tn ($12.5bn) of new investment.“The new policy gives incentives and support for investors to invest in the processing sector,” he said on Tuesday as he unveiled the latest quarterly investment figures. “From that point of view, it will have a positive impact on foreign direct investment.”Mining executives are not so sure. But, when it comes to the muddled world of policy-making and regulation in Indonesia, nobody is ever so sure.A motley range of mining companies from tiny Indonesian nickel miners to US copper and gold giants Freeport and Newmont are lobbying the government for exemptions to the new rules.Freeport and Newmont have already won a reprieve from the export ban after the government decided at the last minute to allow companies producing semi-processed “concentrates” of copper, iron, zinc, lead and manganese to continue shipping overseas until 2017.But they have to pay a special export tax that will rise from 20 per cent to 25 per cent to 60 per cent before all shipments must cease in 2017.Analysts say this could make it unattractive to continue producing in Indonesia, especially given rising costs.The problem for the government is that the more it caves in to the miners’ demands, the more it will deter smelting investors who say they can only justify building billion-dollar plants if they have a captive market.With parliamentary and presidential elections coming this year, a final resolution is unlikely any time soon.Additional reporting by Taufan Hidayat in JakartaRelated reading:

89;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2014-01-14T17:57:11Z;Gold mining: Squandered opportunity;Investor demands for restructuring and an end to the old approach of sprawling expansion are growing;In the vast open pit at Goldstrike, electric shovels 20 metres tall crunch easily through the rock of northern Nevada. Three scoops fill a truck that hauls off 300 tonnes of gold-bearing ore, while underground teams nearby bore richer deposits at 25 metres a day.The site, excavated over almost three decades, set Barrick Gold on its way to becoming the world’s largest gold miner. Yet more than 9,000km to the south, at a mine the company hopes will one day be as successful, things are very different.Pascua Lama, 5,000 metres up in the Andes straddling Chile and Argentina, has been blighted by cost overruns and environmental disputes. Barrick has written off more than $5bn on the incomplete project: engineers are now putting it into what might be a long hibernation until the gold price – and the Canadian company’s balance sheet – recover.The tale of two mines epitomises the profound change in fortunes for the gold mining industry. Barrick and its peers once enjoyed premium valuations as eager investors anticipated outsized returns from a climbing gold price. Profits flowed easily from the likes of Goldstrike’s 2m ounces of annual production in pro-mining and accessible jurisdictions such as Nevada.Now, mishandled investments and bloated projects have taken the shine off gold miners, which in recent years have generally underperformed the metal itself. Peter Munk, the Canadian entrepreneur who built Barrick, steps down as chairman this year with a shadow cast over the end of his career by his company’s problems.Deutsche Bank says the four largest North American gold companies – Barrick, Newmont, Goldcorp and Kinross – are worth less than in 2006, when gold was half today’s price of around $1,245 per oz. The value of AngloGold Ashanti, the South African miner that is the world’s third-largest producer by output, has fallen by more than 40 per cent over the same period.Further disappointments await. Some of the world’s largest gold miners are expected soon to announce cuts to the reserves they calculate are in the ground, acknowledging that millions of ounces of ore are no longer economic to mine as the gold price has tumbled.For some investors, this is more than just an inevitable turn of the commodity price wheel of fortune in a cyclical industry. They hope 2014 will bring a fundamental rethink of the “big gold” model that created sprawling companies such as Barrick and Newmont – each producing more than 5m oz of gold annually – while doing little to satisfy shareholders.“We need to see a cleansing of the sector that allows companies to ’fess up to the mistakes they have made and reset the dial,” says Evy Hambro, co-manager of the BlackRock World Mining Trust. “Many gold companies have been growing for the sake of growth, often financed with share issues – and that has ultimately watered down returns for investors. Companies have been going backwards rather than forwards from an investor point of view.”Some miners are still gunning for growth. This week Goldcorp, which has come to rival Barrick as the world’s most valuable gold miner, unveiled a hostile C$2.6bn bid for Osisko, a Canadian rival.For others, the need for change has been more urgent. Barrick raised $3bn in equity in November to shore up its finances by paying off part of its load of debt. Many analysts expect other gold miners to try to come back to markets for more cash – a tall order if investors have lost trust.Moreover, this is the first crisis to envelop miners since most abandoned hedging, and following the creation of exchange traded funds in gold – simple instruments that have given many investors the exposure they want to the metal without the complications and risks of holding companies’ shares. Companies could face even frostier times ahead unless they can restore faith that, through growth or dividends, they can provide returns that are better than can be obtained from simply holding gold.Neil Gregson, a fund manager at JPMorgan Asset Management, says miners became lazy in the way they ran their businesses as the price of gold rose 600 per cent in the first 11 years of the century. “They thought that the gold price would always save them,” he says. “They lost touch with their operations.”Some problems of the gold sector afflicted the whole mining industry over a decade when prices for most commodities rose strongly. As companies scrambled to take advantage by increasing output, the race to expand drove up costs, particularly for salaries of experienced staff and for equipment. It also prompted companies to accelerate more marginal projects, confident that the price would offer support.“Costs went up far more quickly than anyone realised. No one had their head around the cost inflation until it was too late,” says Joe Foster, a portfolio manager at Van Eck International Investors Gold Fund.In all mines, rising prices induce miners to exploit more marginal areas of lower ore grades. Digging more dirt with each ounce of metal inevitably adds to operating costs.These problems are compounded in gold mining. The precious metal is not abundant and deposits are usually smaller and more quickly exhausted than base metals. As gold miners have grown, they have had to run ever faster and harder to replace the ore they have dug out of the ground each year – with limited success. According to SNL, a data provider, some 800m oz was added to global gold reserves and resources in the decade and a half up to 2012 – but 1.2bn oz was mined during that period.Nor has the quality of reserves been maintained. Mark Bristow, chief executive of Randgold Resources, says the grade of reserves has gone from 2.6g per tonne in 2000 to about 1.1g/tonne, meaning mining will be costlier.Mr Foster at Van Eck says: “There is a natural limit to the size of a gold company. You just don’t find many mega deposits in mother nature, which is one reason why the supermajor model does not work for the gold industry.”…With few big new deposits in easily mineable areas, the bigger miners have had to compensate. One obvious way has been by acquisition – such as Kinross buying Red Back Mining for $7.1bn, or Newcrest, Australia’s largest gold miner, buying Lihir of Papua New Guinea for $9.5bn, both in 2010. Yet buying reserves, rather than finding them through exploration, is expensive and can stretch management capacity, while economies of scale are limited. Mr Hambro says: “There are no real synergies in being bigger if you have one deposit in Australia, a second in Brazil and a third in west Africa.”Alternatively, miners can plough ahead with big, eye-catching projects, often in riskier locations, such as Barrick’s Pascua Lama. But larger mines require more cost and time between discovery and production.Deutsche’s Mr Beristain believes bigger miners, with access to cheap capital, have been taking too many risks with large-scale projects, while increasing the likelihood of falling victim to “resource nationalism” – the desire of governments to get a greater share of revenues from mining.For example, Barrick and Goldcorp had to bow last year to demands in the Dominican Republic for a renegotiated agreement over their Pueblo Viejo mine, a key project for both companies. This month Goldcorp said its effective tax rate had increased from 29 per cent a year ago to 41 per cent as a result of the Pueblo Viejo deal as well as a tax rise in Mexico.…Companies’ overly rosy assessments of their costs of production have unwittingly raised expectations for governments – and investors. By focusing on day-to-day operating costs, gold miners glossed over spending on starting projects or keeping mines running smoothly. Many miners belonging to the World Gold Council, an industry group, have now started publishing their “all-in sustaining costs” of production– revealing little scope for returns to investors at current prices.Companies are cutting costs. But other changes require more fundamental attention. One solution advocated by investors is that companies break themselves up.Smaller units might be nimbler and cheaper to run – notably the salary bill for top executives – and more “under the radar” for governments and NGOs opposed to mining development. The $12m share package given to John Thornton on becoming co-chairman at Barrick in 2012 was a lightning rod for investor discontent.Gold Fields, one of Africa’s largest producers, unbundled some South African operations into a company called Sibanye Gold in 2012. Barrick has also hived off a subsidiary called African Barrick Gold, although its attempts to sell the UK-listed unit have foundered. A small hedge fund, Two Fish Management, last year called for Barrick to unbundle more regional business units.A second idea is that gold miners should diversify. Barrick bought Equinox, a copper producer, in 2011 and Newmont is seeking deeper exposure to copper. Gary Goldberg, Newmont’s chief executive, says the premium valuation that gold miners once attracted will not return, so there should be no penalty for diversifying.Another mining chief executive says: “If investors gave us credit for it we’d all like to be mining other metals because it makes sense not to have all eggs in the same basket. Our core competencies are digging and infrastructure and logistics and so it doesn’t matter so much what exactly we are digging.”The problem is that investors are cool on the idea. Mr Foster calls it “another syndrome of being a supermajor” for the likes of Barrick and Newmont. “They know that they can’t grow in gold so they are looking at non-gold alternatives. But as a gold investor I won’t be interested. Gold is a unique asset class and people buy gold companies for their gold exposure,” he says.Some stronger miners still see opportunities to grow. Even without any deal for Osisko, Chuck Jeannes, Goldcorp’s chief executive, expects output to be more than 40 per cent higher in 2017.Other, weaker miners are limited to trying to pare back costs, sell non-core assets and slow spending on new projects – a strategy that smacks to some of hoping that, once again, a rising gold price will offer salvation.“The silver lining is that companies will have much cleaner balance sheets going forward. Now they need to change their model, reduce their size and improve their management and boards,” says Mr Beristain. “I am still not sure all companies have grasped this – or whether those that have are really believing it wholeheartedly.”——————————————-Juniors: Fewer lines in the water slash hopes of a big catchWaiting to meet investors at a gold industry conference, Darin Wagner has a succinct summary of the plight of many of the hundreds of junior gold miners – the exploration companies driven by hopes of striking it rich but whose chances of being funded have shrunk with the gold price.“There’s a lot of turkeys that aren’t going to fly,” says Mr Wagner, chief executive of Balmoral Resources, a Canadian explorer that did manage to raise money in 2013. “It’s not much fun at the moment.”In Toronto, a traditional venue for equity fundraising for mining, the number of new Canadian mining listings halved last year compared with 2012 while the amount of mining equity raised on the TSX Venture exchange was down 54 per cent. More than half of Canada’s 1,600 listed mining companies are in gold.For big gold producers, a healthy junior sector raises the chances of gaining access to a significant project. “The more lines you have in the water, the more chance you have of catching a fish . . . no major gold miner can replace everything through exploration and you have to buy some production in, so we need juniors,” says Paul Rollinson, chief executive of Kinross Gold, one of the world’s largest producers.The last company in which Mr Wagner was involved was sold for $420m to a bigger miner, a classic example of how the junior sector should work. “If you have had some success people will give you the ‘what if’ money,” says Mr Wagner. He suggests that companies such as his, exploring in Canada, will be favoured over those in more exotic locations.“When times are good people are non-selective. When times are bad they need comfort food,” he says. “They come back to what they know – Canada, Nevada, Mexico.”But the poor outlook for gold prices has brought many explorers to the point where they invoke comparisons with sentiment in the late 1990s following the Bre-X scandal, where the company claimed it had discovered the world’s biggest gold deposit in Indonesia. It was later found that the samples had been falsified.“Post Bre-X was worse but this is a close second,” Mr Wagner says. “Gold explorers and producers are getting viewed with suspicion, rather than outright disgust.”
90;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2014-01-12T10:14:14Z;Indonesia slaps ban on mineral exports;;Indonesia has implemented a hotly contested ban on the export of unprocessed minerals after agreeing last minute carve-outs that are expected to grant a temporary reprieve to the country’s biggest foreign miners, Freeport McMoRan and Newmont.The government claims the requirement to process ore domestically will boost industrial development but mining companies and economists have argued that the move will instead lead to mass lay-offs and shrink export revenues at a time when Indonesia is already suffering from a widening current-account deficit.The ban, which was first written into law in 2009, was scheduled for introduction on Sunday. Eleventh-hour negotiations between mining companies and the government resulted in ministers giving an impromptu press conference just before midnight at the house of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, outside Jakarta.“Starting from midnight on January 12 2014, the export of raw minerals or ore is banned,” said Jero Wacik, the minister for energy and mineral resources. “The goal is in line with the law, to increase the added value.”But the ministers said that in order to minimise job losses and damage to the local economy in mining areas, there would be temporary exemptions for those companies who plan to build smelters and those who were exporting certain types of already “concentrated” products, such as Freeport and Newmont.However, full details of the last-minute compromise are yet to emerge, underlining the policy confusion that has deterred many companies from investing in Indonesia’s mining sector, despite its great potential.The ban could add to pressure on Indonesia’s fragile financial position, costing it several billions of dollars in export revenue when it is already suffering a large current-account deficit, importing more than it exports. This has weighed on the rupiah, one of the world’s worst-performing currencies last year.Mining executives warned that, especially with parliamentary and presidential elections due in April and July respectively, the mining regulations could well be changed again in the coming months.“We can work with most regulatory regimes around the world but it is the constant change in Indonesia from export restrictions to divestment rules that makes it so tough,” said one senior mining executive in Jakarta. “It is no longer set up for major new mines that take years and require billions of dollars of investment up front like Freeport’s Grasberg and Newmont’s Batu Hijau.”Indonesia is a major player in global metal markets, accounting for around 20 per cent of world nickel supply and 10 per cent of aluminium supply, and the wrangling over the ban has been closely watched by traders around the world as well as by manufacturers in China, who rely on Indonesian nickel ore for stainless steel production and Indonesian bauxite to make aluminium.Nickel prices in London jumped by 3 per cent on Friday in anticipation of the ban, which is expected still to be applied to nickel ore and bauxite, which is mostly by produced by small Indonesian miners unable to bear the cost of building smelters.Poltak Sitanggang, chairman of the Indonesian mineral mining association, a lobby group for small miners, said thousands of workers had already been sent home because companies were struggling to cope with the uncertainty.“Some banks asked miners to repay loans before January 12 and some have already had difficulties with their buyers and suppliers because of this regulation,” he said. “We support the government in wanting to add more value but we don’t support this sudden stop. We also don’t understand why Newmont and Freeport have been given exemptions but not small Indonesian miners.”
91;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2013-12-29T17:21:48Z;Gold miners braced for cuts in reserves after plunge in prices;;The gold mining sector is braced for asset writedowns and a fall in the amount of reserves in the ground after the precipitous drop in the price of the metal this year.Some of the world’s largest gold miners face having to tell investors that their growth has gone into reverse because the falling price has made it uneconomic to mine some of the areas previously classed as reserves.Miners’ reserves are vital to their prospects and valuations, since companies would quickly shrink if they did not replace what they dug from the ground each year. Rising price expectations have until now helped gold miners be more optimistic about their reserves and to include ounces that they would previously not have been able to mine profitably.“Gold has been going up for 12 of the last 13 years and reserves have gone up with the price. This [2014] is definitely the year we will see reserves falling across much of the sector,” said Jorge Beristain, an analyst with Deutsche Bank. “Reserve calculations have been based on a series of suppositions that in the present environment are no longer tenable.”Gold miners including Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining, the world’s largest by ounces of annual production, have had a difficult year in 2013 because of the effect of the gold price on some of their most important projects.Miners usually update their reserve statements early each year, and do not all assume the same price. Barrick’s last reserve statement assumed a gold price of $1,500 per ounce for most of its 140m oz of reserves, while Newmont based its statements on a $1,400/oz price.Gold started the year at about $1,600/oz but fell sharply in April and has been hovering at about $1,200/oz in recent days.Newmont, whose 99m oz of reserves are the industry’s second-largest, said early this year that a $100 fall in the gold price would cut reserves by 7.6 per cent. Barrick has previously said a $300/oz change in the assumed gold price would see its reserves fall less than 10 per cent, with a lower impact at its larger, more important mines.“I would guess some miners might have to use $1,100 as the price for their reserves,” says a senior executive at one UK-listed company. “Or they might take the view that the gold market is in a very strange place in terms of volatile behaviour at the moment, which they might use to justify using a higher price.”Some miners use lower gold prices in reserve calculations. Kinross Gold, a large Canadian miner, based its latest reserves on a $1,200 price.Barrick and a number of other gold miners including Newcrest Mining, Australia’s largest, have already made billions of dollars of writedowns during 2013 as the gold price fell.However, some miners face having to acknowledge further impairments connected to goodwill held on their balance sheets or the carrying value of projects.“The writedowns of the past quarters in 2013 have tended to be connected with the costs of projects. What we are talking about now is cuts to the value of companies’ land holdings and the gold that they hope is in the ground,” Mr Beristain said.Silver miners also face writedowns and reserve cuts because their price assumptions are well above current spot prices, he added.
92;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2013-11-07T16:51:42Z;Peter Munk’s legacy hangs on solving Barrick Gold’s problems;;Peter Munk’s long business career has brought him into plenty of difficulties as well as triumphs – but the Canadian entrepreneur marks his 86th birthday on Friday amid one of his toughest challenges yet.Barrick Gold, the mining group that Mr Munk has steered over three decades and turned into the world’s largest gold miner, is in the throes of one of Canada’s largest capital calls, raising at least $3bn of equity. It comes in the teeth of deep gloom about gold prices after a sharp sell-off this year, and after Barrick decided to suspend work on Pascua-Lama, its flagship new mine, admitting that the ballooning costs of the South American venture made it unviable for the foreseeable future. Barrick made a $5bn writedown on the mine this year.Beyond these operating and financial difficulties, Barrick’s challenges are also about Mr Munk himself. Some investors have this year been increasingly hostile towards the company’s corporate governance standards – including the continued influence of Mr Munk as chairman, and the presence on the board of a côterie of close allies, some of whom have been directors for almost 30 years. His son Anthony is also on the board.Barrick’s balance sheet, its Pascua-Lama project and its corporate governance “have been front and centre of investors’ concerns”, says Jorge Beristain, an analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York.Trying to ease these concerns and cement support for the equity issue, the miner has promised plans for “rejuvenation” of its board and extra independent directors by the end of the year, as well as for an overhaul of its pay practices after criticism of a $12m award for John Thornton, the former Goldman Sachs banker named co-chairman last year.The circumstances point to a troubled end to the long career of Mr Munk at Barrick. Some who know him well believe he may be prepared to step down as early as next year’s annual meeting, leaving Mr Thornton as chairman. That could presage a wider management and board shake-up.However allies of Mr Munk, whose influence at Barrick is in stark contrast to his relatively small holding in the company, also consider that he will not step away until confident that Barrick is back on a sound footing – with the capital raising and the Pascua-Lama suspension seen as key steps towards that end.“Peter has a huge amount of emotional capital tied up in the business. He is not going when he sees it in its hour of need. He wants to help put the ship back on course and a huge amount of work has been done this year,” says a supporter.Peter Munk’s three decades as the driving force at Barrick Gold have been just one lengthy chapter in a career that has seen him lauded as one of Canada’s most important entrepreneurs – and one who has known humbling failure as well as success, writes James Wilson.Since the 1960s his businesses have ranged from Clairtone stereo equipment, which collapsed in the early 1970s, to the Trizec commercial property empire, sold for more than $5bn. A refugee from the Nazis in 1940s Hungary, and a trained electrical engineer, he made Toronto his home and been a prominent philanthropist in Canada.At Barrick Mr Munk started with one Canadian mine and built the world’s largest gold miner by output through deals such as the acquisition of Placer Dome in 2006. Mr Munk has espoused the idea that “being a founder is for life” but as his career draws to a close he faces criticism that the time has come to cut his influence at the company and allow boardroom renewal.More is at stake than just Mr Munk’s legacy. Barrick’s attempt to restructure highlights the strains in the “Big Gold” model that had the world’s leading producers striving for size and scale, chasing ever more marginal production as the gold price soared. With debt and costs also rising Barrick, which owns more than two dozen mines across five continents, is selling off smaller and higher cost operations – though it failed to sellAfrican Barrick Gold, its UK-listed subsidiary, at the start of the year – and axing 1,800 jobs from a bloated corporate structure. “There is not a single aspect of our business that we have not been evaluating,” said Jamie Sokalsky, Barrick’s chief executive, as he justified the share issue.Just five of Barrick’s mines produce more than half of its 7m troy ounces of gold annually, and the mismanaged development of Pascua-Lama exemplifies the ends to which large gold miners have had to go to try to replenish reserves. The project is more than 5,000m up in the Andes and straddles Argentina and Chile, forcing the company into arduous negotiations with two governments. While Pascua-Lama’s costs would be low once in production, the mine has so far cost $5.7bn and is only half built. It has added to the strain on Barrick’s balance sheet, where debt soared to more than $15bn after its acquisition of copper miner Equinox in 2011.Barrick’s Equinox deal has made it a test bed for the idea that gold miners – which once attracted better valuations than miners of other metals – could sensibly diversify. The deal soured many investors on Barrick, but its copper output is rising. Newmont Mining, Barrick’s largest gold rival, is now also publicly exploring a big expansion into copper.Barrick’s capital raising – what one underwriter advertises as a “once in a decade chance to buy” with the share price at about $19 compared with more than $50 two years ago – is underwritten by banks. However anything less than a full take-up of the offer would be a severe embarrassment to the company and a blow to its relations with the underwriters. The equity raised will be used to cut net debt by about 20 per cent, with a full repayment of debt due next year.“It is not a long-term fix but it buys time,” says a banker at a North American institution.Deutsche’s Mr Beristain believes more gold miners will need to raise equity if the gold price continues to hover at about $1,300 per troy ounce or lower. Gold soared from $300 per ounce in 2003 but has fallen from above $1,600 per ounce this year. Miners’ costs escalated over the same period, leaving many mines barely profitable.“There is going to be a limited window for equity issuance for the gold sector. As a company you do not want to have to go back to the market,” he says. “I give Barrick credit for being further along than many gold miners in reshaping their balance sheet. They had to move more urgently because they were in the biggest trouble. There is nothing like having your feet to the fire.”This article has been amended to correct the cost of the Pascua-Lama project
93;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2013-10-07T09:39:16Z;Peruvian mining: back on track?;;"Mineral-rich Peru appears to be getting back to the game following news that Minmetals of China has submitted a bid for Glencore Xstrata’s Las Bambas copper project, one of the largest new copper projects in the world. Two other Chinese companies, Chinalco and Jiangxi Copper, as well as Newmont Mining of the US have also expressed interest in the mine.Glencore is selling Las Bambas as a condition of its acquisition of Xstrata imposed by Chinese regulators. But Peru’s government has good reason to want a “first class” buyer, in the words of mining minister Jorge Merino, as it appears to be serious about re-igniting several large mining projects that have been stalled by protests or other issues.According to Merino, Peru wants “a group that is first class, that not only [as regards] high operating standards but also on the issue of the environment and social inclusion.” Peru’s economy is heavily dependent on mining, and resolving social conflicts afflicting the industry has been one of the toughest challenges for the government of President Ollanta Humala.Recently, however, there has been progress. This month the government restarted talks with Canada’s Bear Creek Mining over the stalled Santa Ana silver project in the southern province of Puno, the focus of deadly protests in 2011 which lead Alan García, Humala’s predecessor, to rescind the permit. Now Merino says the government wants to reach a “friendly solution”. Separately, Bear Creek recently won government approval of an environmental study for its $600m Corani silver project, also in Puno.Another case is the $1bn Tía María copper mining project near Arequipa, also in southern Peru, run by Arizona-based Southern Copper. It was halted in 2011 after clashes between residents and police left three dead. Merino recently said he was “sure that Tía María is going to be one of the new projects in development.”But there is still one big stone in the shoe: the stalled $5bn Minas Conga project, a joint enterprise between Colorado-based Newmont Mining and Minas Buenaventura of Peru. It has been dogged by bloody riots in and around the northern region of Cajamarca. Reuters quoted Gary Goldberg, Newmont’s president, as saying the company would take no decision on Conga until after Peru’s October 2014 regional elections.However, he added that “when you look at public opinion polls, they’re starting to move in our direction.” And last week, despite many locals still opposing the project, representatives of more than 30 local communities told Merino they would back the restarting of works at Conga.The government also said last week it had started talks with the mining industry on how to facilitate investment, following complaints from private miners that red tape had hindered them from starting new ventures or expanding old ones. Cutting bureaucracy should pay dividends: Peru has some $57bn worth of mining projects in the pipeline, including the $3bn Pampa de Pongo, proposed by China’s Jinzhao, that is awaiting an environmental licence.However, there are limits on what the government can or will do. On the Conga case, for example, Humala was clear. “As the state, we’ve fulfilled what we had to do, which was to guarantee private property and public order,” he said, stressing that “today, the rhythm that the Conga project advances is completely in the field of the private company, it is not a matter of the state.”Related reading:

96;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2013-09-30T23:02:58Z;Newmont looks at Glencore Peru project for copper diversification;;Newmont Mining has joined the ranks of miners interested in Glencore Xstrata’s Peruvian copper mining project, underlining an attempt by the US’s largest gold producer to diversify.Glencore is selling Las Bambas in an auction that it hopes could fetch up to $5bn, with Chinese mining groups among the favourites to acquire the asset.Newmont, the world’s second-largest gold producer with 5m ounces annually, has told investors it wants to acquire copper assets. In an interview with the Financial Times, Gary Goldberg, Newmont’s chief executive, said Las Bambas, under construction by Xstrata when it was acquired this year by Glencore, was “an interesting prospect” as his company looked at opportunities.“The thing that is interesting is that it is further down the development path, it is closer to production,” said Mr Goldberg. “Clearly we wouldn’t do that on our own. We would look at doing something with other partners.”Mr Goldberg said he “wouldn’t speculate” on whether Newmont remained in the running for Las Bambas. “It is an interesting prospect but there are others out there,” he said.Copper is often found alongside gold but gold miners have usually resisted diversifying because they have generally been more highly valued by investors as “pure play” producers. Barrick Gold, the world’s largest gold miner, angered its investors when it bought Equinox, a copper producer, two years ago for $7.6bn.However, Mr Goldberg said he believed gold companies would no longer receive premium valuations.“I have to do what is right for our shareholders and leverage the value we have in our competencies,” he said. “I am talking about it before I do it and testing so I don’t surprise the market.”Gold prices have suffered their sharpest fall since the 1980s, heightening fears that the metal’s decade-long bull run has endedMr Goldberg, who became Newmont’s chief executive in March, once ran copper operations including the huge Bingham Canyon mine for Rio Tinto.Glencore is selling Las Bambas to comply with conditions set by Chinese regulators during its acquisition of Xstrata and first-round bids were accepted this month. Glencore declined to comment.Newmont has had problems at Conga, another mine in Peru, where it has suspended construction amid local concern over water resources. But Mr Goldberg said Peru was “not a bad place” for further investment.The US miner produces about 65,000 tonnes of copper annually, whereas Las Bambas is expected to produce more than 400,000 tonnes of copper a year.Newmont this month struck a deal to sell a small Nevada gold mine and Mr Goldberg has rowed back on the miner’s ambitions to increase production in favour of a “value over volume” strategy.This story has been amended since first publication to clarify that Newmont has not confirmed whether it has bid for the Las Bambas copper project.
97;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2013-08-15T21:51:18Z;Apple briefly breaks back above $500;Tech stalwart up 28 per cent from 2013 lows;Tech stalwart Apple briefly broke back through the $500-a-share level on renewed hopes of a share buyback, while US indices ticked down as markets continued a subdued August run.Apple rose 1.8 per cent to $498.50 on Wednesday, adding to a 4.8 per cent gain on Tuesday after the iPhone maker received a boost from activist investor Carl Icahn.Mr Icahn tweeted that he had a ‘large position’ in the company, adding to pressure on Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, to redistribute some of the group’s vast cash holdings via a share buyback.It has been a tumultuous year for one of the world’s most valuable companies. Apple shares began the year at almost $550 before steadily falling to below $400 in April.Since then, Apple shares have rebounded more than 27 per cent.Apple’s rise was unable to buoy US indices, however, as the S&P 500 slipped 0.5 per cent to 1,685.39.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.7 per cent to 15,337.66, and the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 0.4 per cent to 3,669.27.US airlines were under pressure for the second consecutive day, as US Airways shares fell.The airline was down 1.2 per cent to $16.17 in Wednesday morning trading after a 13.1 per cent fall the previous day on news that the Department of Justice had sued to block its merger with American Airlines.The merger was due to be completed next month and would have created the world’s largest airline by sales. US airline shares were sold off across the board as a result of the blocking action, with Delta off 2.6 per cent to $19.04 and United Continental down 2.3 per cent to $30.04.The materials sector was among the best areas on the day. Companies that primarily generate raw goods have struggled in 2013 as prices for commodities have fallen on reduced demand from China and emerging markets.Going against the trend, Newmont Mining led the S&P with a 6.2 per cent rise to $31.94, as the gold miner benefited from a 1.1 per cent rise in the precious metal to $1,334.3 an ounce.Cliffs Natural Resources was also among the stronger performers in the benchmark index, up 2.6 per cent to $24.54. Its shares have risen almost 46 per cent in the past month as iron ore prices have climbed off 2013 lows.Forest products company Weyerhaeuser also bolstered the materials sector, 3 per cent better to $27.79 on news that it could sell its homebuilding unit.Macy’s was among the worst performing stocks, off 4.5 per cent to $46.33 after the company missed earnings per share estimates and lowered its full-year 2013 forecast.Shares in Deere & Company, which sells the John Deere line of farm equipment, fell 1.9 per cent to $82.34. A recall of about 7,000 tractors overshadowed reported earnings growth that beat expectations.Deere has struggled due to a combination of global economic weakness and poor weather in the US that delayed crop planting. Shares in the company are off 4.7 per cent on the year to date.Better times may be ahead for Deere, as better growing conditions have improved harvests.The overall pattern of light trading volumes during the traditional August vacation period sees the S&P 500 index off less than 0.1 per cent on the month so far.Jim Russell, senior equity strategist at US bank wealth management, said he had not seen any activity that would indicate a change in investor action.“We’re less inclined to put a huge amount of significance over both last week’s action and maybe even this week’s action, and frankly we think that anything that happens between now and Labor Day is noise,” he said.However, he did add that positive economic news from Europe, where the latest data indicates the eurozone may have emerged from recession, would be a welcome sign that the global environment was improving, and a much needed tailwind for the US.“Because you’ve got a better tone in Europe, we absolutely think it impacts the US profit picture,” he said. “A lot of good things happen if Europe is above the line.”
98;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2013-08-12T16:57:30Z;BlackBerry rises but US indices stay flat;;US stocks opened the week slightly lower, but BlackBerry shares rallied on news that the company is considering moves including joint ventures and a possible sale of the handset maker.BlackBerry shares rose 10.5 per cent to $10.78, and are now up 30 per cent in the past 12 months. The company that once pioneered the business cellphone market fell behind competitors such as Apple and Samsung. Revenue has fallen sharply, as have subscribers.The company pegged its hopes on its new BlackBerry 10 operating system and handsets, which were not well received.The prospect of new handsets from Apple sent the company’s shares higher, up 2.8 per cent to $467.36. The company will reportedly host an event on September 10, at which analysts believe a new iPhone will be announced.Apple also scored a victory recently over Samsung in the patent battles between the two companies. News broke on Friday that the International Trade Commission issued an import ban on handsets that violate two of Apple’s patents but sided with Samsung on a broader patent related to rectangular smartphones with rounded corners.Shares in Apple have fallen more than 24 per cent in the past 12 months, as the once dominant iPhone and iPad have lost ground to Samsung and Google’s Android devices.Apple’s rise helped the Nasdaq lead the major indices, up 0.3 per cent to 3,669.95.The S&P 500 fell 0.1 per cent to 1,689.47, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was nearly unchanged at 15,419.68.Caterpillar shares rose 2.1 per cent to $86.32 to lead the Dow, as positive news on excavator sales in China helped bolster the case for a recovery in the country’s building market.Newmont Mining led the S&P 500, up 4.7 per cent to $30.90. The company’s gain was helped by a 1.7 per cent rise in the price of gold, which the company mines.However, Newmont remains 33.5 per cent lower on the year to date, with spot gold down about 20 per cent in the same period.Materials companies have endured a difficult 2013, as falling commodity prices squeeze revenues. But recovering ore prices have bolstered some companies, such as Cliffs Natural Resources, which rose 0.5 per cent to $24.47.Shares in the iron ore miner are up 45 per cent in the past month, and short positions in the company are down from July peaks.On the other end of the benchmark index, Sysco was the worst performer, off 5.8 per cent to $33.52.The food product distributor reported earnings per share that missed analyst estimates despite beating revenue expectations. The company pointed to tighter margins and restructuring costs as reasons for the disappointing results.An Analyst downgrade hit Tesla sending the company’s shares down 3.7 per cent to $147.38.The S&P 500 has moved sideways in the past month in light trading. The index is 0.9 per cent higher than its July 12 level but 1 per cent off its early August highs.The Nasdaq in that same period has maintained levels near its 2013 highs, up 2.6 per cent since July 12 and only 0.5 per cent off its highs.However, the quiet market is unsurprising given historical precedent, said Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist an S&P Capital IQ.“Investors shouldn’t be too concerned about the currently low trading volume. Since 1950, average monthly S&P 500 trading volume as a per cent of total annual average volume was the highest in December and the lowest in July,” Mr Stovall said. “On a quarterly basis, not surprisingly, it was weakest during the third quarter. Therefore, there may be some truth to the old adage that ‘in the summer, investors focus more on their tans than their portfolios’.”
99;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;Indonesian mining policy: backtracking elegantly;;"When is a new policy not a new policy? When it’s introduced by the Indonesian government, which has a tendency to rush out new measures with minimal consultation, sparking protests from those affected and eventually leading officials to backtrack with all the elegance of Michael Jackson doing the moonwalk.The latest example is the government’s ban on the export of raw minerals, which was meant to force mining companies to build costly smelters and processing plants by 2014 as part of a broader goal to produce more “value-added” products in Indonesia.The proposal sent foreign mining executives from the likes of America’s Freeport McMoRan and Newmont, which operate vast gold and copper mines in the country, into paroxysms of panic and rage. They claimed it was unfeasible to build big smelters in Indonesia at such short notice and that the country lacked the power capacity and the demand for such facilities.And now there are signs that officials from Indonesia’s ministry of energy and mineral resources are backtracking.At an Australian mining conference in Jakarta this week, Susilo Siswoutomo, the vice minister, suggested that mining companies need not make large new investments in order to meet the new requirement to process their minerals.“The word ‘process’ does not mean you have to build a smelter. We don’t want people to export our land but sometimes all you need to do is wash [the minerals] or separate the mud.”The tone of his speech, in which he insisted that Indonesia wanted to attract more foreign investors to its under-explored mining sector rather than scaring them away, was somewhat reassuring to mining executives in the room.Like people suffering bereavement, foreign investors facing tough new nationalistic policies in emerging markets tend to go through five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.Most foreign miners in Indonesia are still in the bargaining phase and, if the government does water down its requirements for processing, perhaps they can avoid the depression.Jero Wacik, the minister of energy and mineral resources, accepted recently that it would be impossible for many companies to meet the 2014 smelter requirement and promised to help miners find “loopholes” to get around the law.But, while these more supportive noises might be appreciated, Indonesia-based executives at Freeport and Newmont may find it hard to persuade their directors and legal counsel at head office to back multi-billion dollar investments based on such muddy compromises.Related reading:

100;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2013-04-11T20:01:22Z;Chile suspends Barrick Gold mine;;"By Jude Webber and Naomi MapstoneAnother mining project in a minerals-rich Andean country has been hit by another environmental/indigenous complaint. Digging up precious metals as a way of achieving economic prosperity, especially in areas of outstanding natural beauty, has never been so fraught.The latest casualty is the Chilean side of Barrick Gold’s Pascua-Lama project, which promises to be one of the world’s biggest gold mines.The project, already wildly over budget and well behind schedule, looks set for more delays and more costs after a court has ordered the suspension of construction in Chile while it considers claims from indigenous communities that the project is destroying glaciers and tainting water supplies.Barrick says the Argentine side, where the process plant and tailings storage facility are located, will not be affected, but it gave no time-frame for the stoppage and said the cost and schedule impact could not be ascertained yet.But it’s a familiar scenario – in Chile a power plant plan bit the dust last year and a hydroelectric project is awaiting government approval – sparking an almost macabre “see it before it’s gone” tourism opportunity.Other parts of South America are no stranger to mining conflicts either. Perhaps the biggest most spectacularly stalled project is Newmont Mining’s $5bn Conga mine in Peru.The company and its local Peruvian partner Buenaventura voluntarily put the project on hold in November 2011 after violent protests by communities who fear the copper project would jeopardise their water supplies. Although the mine site is in Cajamarca, which gets significant mining royalties from nearby projects such as Yanacocha, the world’s second biggest gold mine, poverty levels are high, and many lack basic services such as water and sewage.Newmont is focusing its energies on building four reservoirs while mine work is stalled, but in its annual report this year the company hinted it may be thinking of pulling out.It said:The recurrence of significant political or community opposition or protests could continue to adversely affect Conga ‘s development … Should the company be unable to continue with the current development plan at Conga , the company may in the future reprioritize and reallocate capital to development alternatives…which may result in an impairment of the Conga project.There’s no such talk of Barrick abandoning Pascua-Lama. But it seems that the bigger the mining or energy prospect, the bigger the problems these days.Related reading:

101;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2013-04-09T20:32:34Z;Wall St moves higher ahead of Fed minutes;;JC Penney shares dropped sharply after the struggling department store chain announced that chief executive Ron Johnson will be replaced by his predecessor Mike Ullman. Mr Johnson took over at the company in 2011 and presided over a disastrous fall in sales.Shares initially surged as much as 10 per cent in the after-hours market when news broke out that Mr Johnson had been fired. However, they reversed gains and sold off after the company said Mr Ullman would return as chief executive. The stock fell 12.2 per cent to $13.93 on Tuesday and has lost nearly a third of its market value since the start of the year.Analysts at Morgan Stanley view Mr Johnson’s exit and Mr Ullman’s return as a positive step, but express caution about core challenges.“JC Penney struggles to drive sales with a concentration of private label brands with little to no meaning in today’s market,” the research note said.Rival department stores were down slightly, with Kohl’s down 1.3 per cent to $47.42 and Macy’s was down 0.7 at $43.67.Overall, US equity markets moved higher after initial wobbles, shrugging off concerns over weak quarterly earnings and ahead of the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting in March, due on Wednesday.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.4 per cent higher at 1,568.60, after briefly breaking through the previous closing high reached last week. Seven of 10 main sectors finished in positive territory, with materials and financials stocks leading the gains.Robbert van Batenburg, director of market strategy at Newedge, called the recent market rally a “Lance Armstrong rally, powering ahead by artificial stimulants”.“When considering scenarios for a significant pullback in the US stock market, there are two that stand out. The first is that the stock market retraces as it anticipates the end of the current double dose of QE,” he said.“The more concerning scenario is a market correction fuelled by global cross currents, even though the Fed is still in full QE mode. This could create fears that the Fed stimulus is becoming ineffective and could in turn question the sustainability of the economic recovery.”The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent higher at $3,237.86.As rivalry in the mobile search space heated up, stocks such as Microsoft, Yahoo and Google were in focus. Microsoft rose 3.6 per cent to $29.61 after it teamed up with Nokia and Expedia to file an antitrust complaint against Google.Yahoo shares also rose 1.5 per cent to $23.83. However, Google shrugged off such concerns and closed 0.4 per cent higher at $777.65.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 blue-chip companies and is a price-weighted index, added 0.4 per cent higher at 14,673.46.Materials stocks were attracting buyers. Mining companies such as Newmont Mining and Freeport-McMoRan were rallying, up 2.6 per cent to $40.03 and 4.1 per cent to $33.76 respectively. Cliffs Natural Resources climbed 8.8 per cent to $20.45.Shares in Alcoa were volatile and was unchanged from the previous closing price of $8.39. Thanks to demand from aerospace and motor manufacturers, the company reported a better than expected 59 per cent rise in first-quarter net income. The aluminium producer’s forecast for just 7 per cent growth in global demand for the metal disappointed, however.First Solar shares soared 45.5 per cent to $39.35 after the world’s largest thin-solar panel maker issued full-year guidance and held a conference call with analysts and investors. The company forecast a long-term profit margin of 20-22 per cent and expected sales of $3.8-$4bn. The dramatic rise in the price was also due to a short squeeze as the nearly 30 per cent of outstanding shares were being shorted up until last week, according to Markit data. The stock has nearly doubled in the past 12 months.St Jude Medical shares fell 1.7 per cent to $41.21 after the stock’s rating was cut to “underperform” by RBC capital.
102;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2013-04-05T20:28:21Z;Wall St stocks hit by slowing jobs growth;;US stock indices recovered some of the early losses on Friday but recorded the steepest weekly declines this year after disappointing jobs data raised concerns that federal budget cuts are beginning to affect the economy.The US added just 88,000 jobs in March, far less than economists expected and the slight drop in the unemployment rate to 7.6 per cent was largely explained by the diminishing labour force.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.4 per cent lower at 1,553.28 and recorded a 1 per cent drop on the week, the sharpest decline this year.Over the past week, materials and technology stocks were the worst performers, while investors sought solace in defensive stocks, such as healthcare and telecoms, which registered modest gains.“It is too early to say if the weak numbers are solely due to sequestration. It could be a payback for strong job growth in January and February,” said Brad Sorensen, director of market and sector research at Charles Schwab.“Markets had a very good run so far this year and we would view pullbacks, even deeper corrections, as buying opportunities, as we think markets will continue to rise in the longer term because our economy continues to grow, albeit at a slower pace,” he added.Technology stocks were among the worst hit, with the S&P 500 subsector index down 1 per cent and shedding 2.9 per cent over the week.F5 Networks was the worst performer, shedding 17.8 per cent on the week to $73.21, after a 19 per cent fall on Friday, after the maker of network equipment and seller of information technology cut its outlook for the first quarter, citing disappointing results from its North American business.The move prompted several analysts to cut their ratings on the stock. Piper Jaffray, Topeka Capital and Citi downgraded the stock as a result.The rating of rival Juniper Networks was lowered to “equal weight” by analysts at Barclays, and stock in the company fell 3.1 per cent to $17.55, adding to a 5.3 per cent weekly decline. Cisco Systems shares fell 2 per cent to $20.61 and were 1.4 per cent lower on the week.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7 per cent to 3,203.86 and was down 0.8 per cent on the week.Shares in Apple, the most heavily weighted stock on the Nasdaq, fell 0.9 per cent to $423.94 and lost 1.9 per cent over the week.Other large technology companies were also hit. Over the past week Oracle lost 0.9 per cent to $32.03 while Google shed 1.4 per cent to $783.05.Struggling PC maker Hewlett-Packard shed 7.8 per cent of its value trading at $21.97 this week, after losing 1.5 per cent on Friday.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 blue-chip stocks and is a price-weighted index, fell 0.3 per cent to 14,490.41 and lost 0.1 per cent over the week.Healthcare stocks were one of the best performing sectors this week, after the US government announced it would not cut a key Medicare payment rate but increase it instead. Insurers benefited, recording solid weekly gains.UnitedHealth Group gained 8.5 per cent to $62.10 over the week. Humana, even after falling 1.7 per cent on Friday, stood 13.2 per cent higher on the week.Shares in Aetna added 5.6 per cent to $53.99 over the week, although they lost 1.1 per cent on Friday.Even though energy stocks were largely shunned this week, natural gas producers rallied on Friday after data showed inventories decreased and were 1.8 per cent below five-year average levels, due to colder weather and less drilling.WPX Energy shares rallied 5.2 per cent to $15.87, recording a 0.8 per cent weekly gain. Cabot Oil and Gas rose 5.1 per cent to $66.53 and was 0.5 per cent higher on the week.Chesapeake Energy rose 2.2 per cent to $19.75, but still lost 3.2 per cent over the past five days.The rise in gold prices following the disappointing jobs figures boosted gold miners in early trade, however rally was short lived.Newmont Mining closed 0.6 per cent higher to $39.37, while Goldcorp shares added 0.7 per cent to $31.79.JC Penney shares rallied 2.4 per cent to $15.45 after analysts at Gilford Securities upgraded the stock to “neutral”.

Weekly jobless claims data on Thursday suggested March payrolls would expand by more than 200,000.“These data suggest improvement in underlying labour market conditions and corroborate the stronger payroll gains seen recently, plus 205,000 on average over the past four months,” economists at RBS Securities said.But investors also watched events in Cyprus, after the European Central Bank said emergency funding for the country’s banks would be suspended on Monday if no agreement was reached on a bailout plan. European shares headed lower, weighing on US equities.The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the session down 0.6 per cent at 14,421.34, while the Nasdaq Composite led the benchmarks with a loss of nearly 1 per cent to 3,222.60 as technology shares took a hit.After markets closed, shares in Nike jumped 8 per cent to $57.92 in extended trading after reporting earnings per shares that were slightly higher than analysts’ estimates. The company said fiscal 2013 third-quarter saw revenues from continuing operations rise 9 per cent to $6.2bn, or 10 per cent excluding currency changes.Earlier in the session, Oracle fell 9.7 per cent to $32.31, after the software group reported fiscal third-quarter results late on Wednesday that missed forecasts. The company blamed execution issues and a slower ramp of new sales capacity.“We are always sceptical of Oracle having execution issues as we consider execution a core competency, with rigorous sales processes and multiple levels of deal inspection,” analysts at Macquarie said. “This time we believe it is more plausible given the many changes brought about by co-
president Mark Hurd.”Jabil Circuit reported a 9 per cent slide in fiscal second-quarter earnings, on the back of higher costs associated with its purchase of Nypro in February. Shares in the electronics maker, whose biggest customer is Apple, slid 4.5 per cent to $18.60 as it also downgraded its third-quarter outlook. Shares in Apple see-sawed throughout the session but closed 0.2 per cent higher to $452.90.Guidance from Guess saw its shares slide 7.1 per cent to $25.03. The clothing retailer reported better fourth-quarter earnings but revenues were lower, while the outlook for first-quarter earnings was cut.Shares in KB Home rose 2.6 per cent to $22.14. The homebuilder said its first-quarter net loss shrank to $12.46m, or 16 cents a share, better than a forecast loss of 22 cents a share. Net orders for new homes rose 40 per cent. Elsewhere in the sector, shares in DR Horton fell 2.1 per cent to $24.89; PulteGroup dipped 1.9 per cent to $20.99; while Lennar Corp slid 2.3 per cent to $42.40.A downgrade of Juniper Networks by FBR Capital to “underperform” put pressure on the network supplier, which declined 2.2 per cent to $18.87.In contrast, an upgrade for Dover Corp from Goldman Sachs, saw shares in the manufacturer of specialised products initially rise to as high as $73.67. But they later pared gains to end the session 1.3 per cent lower at $72.39.Oppenheimer raised Yahoo to “outperform” and the stock rose 3.5 per cent to $22.87.Other stocks on the move included Newmont Mining, the gold miner, which gained up 2.8 per cent to $41.51, while Red Hat fell 0.4 per cent to $50.99."
104;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2013-02-01T19:38:02Z;Credit Suisse calls end to gold bull run;;Credit Suisse has called the end of gold’s decade-long bull run, saying the “fear trade” that caused the metal to more than quintuple in value peaked last year.In a note to clients published on Friday, the Swiss bank said gold “appears significantly overvalued”. “We think it highly likely that the market has already seen the absolute high,” it added, in a reference to September 2011, when prices touched $1,920.30 a troy ounce.The call is the most explicit declaration so far from a leading bullion bank that the gold bull market is over. Many other analysts have turned cautious in recent months, with a large contingent believing gold will see a final spurt higher some time later this year or in early 2014 before beginning a long-term decline.Gold rallied from a low of $253.75 in 2001 to hit a nominal record high in 2011. Since then, the metal has struggled for direction, frustrating bulls who believe that it ought to surge higher as central banks around the world continue their unconventional monetary policies.Credit Suisse’s call, if correct, would be a blow to big gold miners such as Barrick Gold, Newmont and AngloGold Ashanti as well as investors that have publicly poured billions of dollars into the market, such as Paulson & Co.The Swiss bank said it expected gold’s “sideways drift” of recent months to “turn into a modest downward trend over the course of this year”.“The acute phase of the global financial crisis is probably over,” said Tom Kendall, precious metals analyst at Credit Suisse. “Markets are now more resilient to ‘bad news’.”Mr Kendall identified the turning point for the market as the moment last summer when Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, promised to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro.In addition, Credit Suisse pointed to the turnround in the US housing market as a possible support for a sustainable recovery in the US economy.“We feel that demand for ‘safe havens’ will continue to moderate over coming months and years as the risk of a truly monumental economic collapse continues to diminish,” the bank said.While Credit Suisse acknowledged concerns that quantitative easing may spur a rise in inflation at some point, it said “the greater risk is that gold will weaken substantially as economic data improve long before inflation expectations move significantly higher”.On Friday gold rallied as the increase in the US unemployment rate made investors more confident that the Federal Reserve would continue its programme of quantitative easing. Nonetheless, at $1,672, the metal remained trapped in its recent range.
105;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2012-09-20T19:08:52Z;Humala stalls as gold fever revisits Peru;;"Almost five hundred years ago, Cajamarca was the site of a momentous chess tournament. Atahualpa, king of the Incas but a novice at chess, lost the series to his captor, Francisco Pizarro. The Spanish conquistador then reneged on his promise to free the Quechua lord in exchange for gold and killed his prisoner instead. The term “checkmate” comes from the old French eschec mat – or “death to the King”.Today, this northern region of Peru has once again put the local ruler, Peruvian president Ollanta Humala, in a seemingly inescapable position because of gold.A planned $5bn investment by Newmont Mining in the country’s largest open-pit gold and copper mine has been thwarted by bloody local riots in and around Cajamarca. Five people were confirmed killed in July, with 15 or 16 fatalities suspected in the past year.Local politicians and residents say the Conga mine, which is still at the construction stage, would harm the local water supply, claims the company deny.The stand-off has jeopardised a $52bn pipeline of mining projects that President Humala needs to keep Peru’s high-growth economy going.“It is just like the old times of the Inca,” says Blanca Llamoctancta, a local Quechua-speaking farmer at the forefront of the anti-Conga riots, referring to the rush for gold. “It seems we haven’t learnt from past mistakes.”The local stand-off sees Mr Humala at a national political impasse. The 50-year-old former army officer won a tight election last year on a social democratic platform, pledging to support the poor in the country’s many simmering mining disputes.While a presidential candidate, Mr Humala, pledged to stop Conga if it threatened the region’s water supply, affecting roughly 350,000 people in the nearby mountain communities. But following his election, he said it was possible to have both “water and gold”.Late last month, he insisted that the Yanacocha mining company, the local subsidiary of Newmont, would first need to ensure clean water in Cajamarca before it took anything from the ground. Newmont has promised reservoirs will provide year-round clean water supplies. Meanwhile, the government is planning a new agency to approve environmental impact studies.But none of this has appeased environmentalists. “It would be a crime to allow Conga to keep going,” says the soft-spoken former priest, Marco Arana, who has been at the forefront of the protests in Cajamarca.After a year in power, Mr Humala is mindful that the billions of dollars of mining investment is crucial to sustaining Peru’s 6 per cent economic growth rate. This growth in turn generates the extra revenues he needs for social programmes. Peru is the world’s sixth biggest gold producer and third biggest copper miner.“While the genesis of the Conga dispute might be explained by local conditions in Cajamarca, its effects reach much, much further,” says Anthony Bebbington, an expert on Peruvian mining conflicts and a former World Bank consultant.The Conga dispute has already cost Mr Humala key staff; there have been two cabinet reshuffles and the president is now on his third prime minister. His latest, Juan Jimenez, said in August that the Conga project had been moved to the backburner after polls showed 78 per cent of local residents opposed it.Similar protests in other regions could stymie plans for Peru to ramp up gold and copper production at a time of high international metals prices. Southern Copper is planning a $600m expansion at its Toquepala mine on top of $1bn at its Tía María mine. Freeport-McMoRan has approved a $4bn expansion of its Cerro Verde operations in Arequipa, while Antamina is investing more than $1bn in expansion, and Xstrata is investing nearly $6bn on building up Las Bambas and Antapaccay. Anglo American has announced that it will invest $3bn on Quellaveco and Chinalco has a $2.2bn investment in Toromocho.Critics, such as Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, former opposition premier, say Conga is evidence of Mr Humala’s political inexperience. The president’s support has suffered, falling to 45 per cent support in a recent Datum poll. The main complaint is that he has failed to manage social conflicts, with almost 50 per cent expecting the strife to spread in coming months.Meanwhile, the Conga crisis is helping build the political careers of others. The protests have pushed to prominence leftwing leaders such as Alberto Moreno, the head of the Peruvian communist party known as “Patria Roja”, and Gregorio Santos, Cajamarca’s governor, who now plans to run in the 2016 presidential election.Adding to the national unease is the Shining Path, a group of Maoist guerrillas that terrorised Peru in the 1980s in a civil war that left 70,000 dead. Many of its leaders, imprisoned 20 years ago, start to leave prison next year. All but a handful are out in the coming five years and have sought to set up a political party, Movadef.At least Abimael Guzmán, the Shining Path founder, and Elena Iparraguirre, his partner, will not be among them: both are serving life sentences. Interviewed in her small cell in Lima’s woman’s prison, Ms Iparraguirre remains unrepentant: she is still a dogmatic communist, committed to “political transformation”, although she acknowledges the Shining Path was defeated militarily and the original group abandoned the armed-struggle.She also distances herself from a breakaway armed group that operates in the Amazon and has killed several police and soldiers this year. “What is going on in the jungle is hocus-pocus to us,” she told the FT.Peru is far richer than it was 20 years ago, thanks to a capitalist revolution. But in rural areas, especially, there are still pockets of extreme poverty that make people vulnerable to extreme ideology, such as that of Ms Iparraguirre.Mining projects, better vetted by Mr Humala’s new environmental agency, could help alleviate that poverty, although in colonial Cajamarca graffiti reads “Ollanta Traitor”.Isaac Humala, the president’s estranged father and a self-described Andean Marxist, has called on his son to reject foreign mining. He sees many similarities between his son’s position and that of the defeated Inca king, Atahualpa.“The gold lust in today’s Peru is worse than in the times of Pizarro,” he says. “If my son wants to govern, he has to come back to his people.”"
106;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2012-08-17T16:02:26Z;African Barrick’s fate thrown into doubt;;The future of African Barrick, the London-listed miner, was thrown into doubt this week, after its parent Barrick Gold confirmed that it was discussing a sale of its 74 per cent stake in Tanzania’s biggest gold miner with state-owned China National Gold.The talks, which come after Canada’s Barrick received preliminary expressions of interest from both China Gold and Zijin Mining, another government-backed Chinese miner, could draw out other bidders for African Barrick, which boasts gold reserves of about 17m ounces.The company, whose shares jumped about 8 per cent this week on news of the possible stake sale, has struggled since its float in 2010, falling short of its targets for production growth and battling rising costs and power disruptions in Tanzania.The discussions between Barrick and China Gold, the country’s largest gold producer, were in the early stages, the companies said, and there is no certainty a deal will be reached.But the news sparked debate about whether African Barrick, with its dominant position in Tanzania, could prove attractive to another African miner seeking geographical or geological diversification.Analysts at Investec questioned whether any other parties would bid for African Barrick. “While the deep underground South African miners [AngloGold, Goldfields] could gain operating diversity from the African Barrick assets, in our view they have substantial organic growth options to pursue and do not necessarily ‘need’ to make a bid,” they said, adding that other African miners such as Newmont, Kinross and Randgold were in a similar position.
107;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2012-08-16T18:03:26Z;Gold price falls as Asia purchases dwindle;;Global demand for gold is seeing a significant slowdown as top consumers in India and China pare purchases amid weak economic growth, abruptly halting a consumption boom that started five years ago with the onset of the financial crisis.The consumption slowdown is driving prices downward, denting the profitability of gold miners such as Barrick Gold of Canada and New York-listed Newmont, and hurting top hedge funds managers such as John Paulson and George Soros.The World Gold Council, a lobby group for the gold miners, on Thursday said demand for the yellow metal fell to 990 tonnes during the second quarter, the lowest since the first quarter of 2010 and down 7 per cent from last year.“India and China represent half of global gold consumption and clearly we are seeing a slowdown in both markets,” Marcus Grubb, managing director for investment at the London-based WGC, said in an interview.Gold prices have fallen back to about $1,600 a troy ounce, down nearly 17 per cent from the all-time high of $1,920.30 an ounce set in September 2011. But prices remain significantly higher than five years ago, when the metal traded at about $650 an ounce. Since the first signs of the financial crisis emerged in mid-2007, corn, gold and oil have been the best performing assets.India, which traditionally has been the world’s largest gold consumer but is about to be surpassed by China, has seen the weakest demand recently due to a combination of slow economic growth and high prices in local currency. The Indian rupee has fallen almost 25 per cent against the US dollar over the past year, lifting the price that Indians pay for gold to nearly record highs.India bought 181.3 tonnes of gold in the second quarter, a two-year low, and the industry believes that purchases will remain weak for the rest of the year as prices in local currency remain high and a weak monsoon, the seasonal rains, hurts agricultural production, cutting rural demand for the yellow metal.Mr Grubb said that India was likely to close the year purchasing just 750 tonnes of gold, down a hefty 25 per cent from last year and the lowest in five years. China, which is on track to buy 850 tonnes, will overtake India to become the world’s largest consumer of gold, according to the WGC estimates.Gold traders are cautious, however, about writing off India as main source of demand as some did in 2009 when consumption also fell sharply because the local economy and currency weakened. As soon as activity picked up and the rupee strengthened against the dollar the following year, gold purchases bounced back nearly 75 per cent, rising in 2010 to a record high of 1,006 tonnes.Investment demand in Europe and the US through exchange traded funds, a vehicle that allows investors to buy titles backed by gold bars, stagnated in the second quarter, with inflows at nearly zero tonnes. Gold ETF inflows stood at 54 tonnes in the April-June period of last year.“The wild card is what will happen to investment in the second half and that will be driven by QE [quantitative easing, or central banks printing money] in the US, the eurozone and even emerging countries like China,” Mr Grubb said.
108;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;US steps up pressure on Uzbekistan;;"The US is stepping up pressure on Uzbekistan after a New York-listed telecommunications operator had its Uzbek licence suspended and five of its local managers were jailed.The US Commission on Security and Co-operation in Europe warned of “a deterioration in bilateral ties” and a “chilling effect on foreign investment” if the executives of MTS were not released from jail, and if an Uzbek investigation into the company’s subsidiary in the country was not handled with more transparency.A copy of the commission’s letter to President Islam Karimov was seen by the Financial Times as annual bilateral talks between the US and Uzbekistan began in Tashkent on Thursday. The US body, also known as the US Helsinki Commission, is headed by Christopher Smith, a Republican congressman, and Benjamin Cardin, a Democrat senator.The US relied on Uzbekistan’s Karshi-Khanabad air base during the invasion of Afghanistan, but relations were strained after Washington condemned Mr Karimov’s regime for the 2005 massacre of hundreds of Uzbek civilians in Andijan. The US was asked to abandon the air base a few months later.The current saga with MTS appears to echo problems faced by other western groups in the region, including London-listed Oxus Gold, Newmont Mining of the US and Wimm-Bill-Dann, the Russian dairy producer which is now part of PepsiCo.Coca-Cola, meanwhile, found itself the subject of a $100m arbitration lawsuit after it became entangled in the divorce between Gulnara Karimova, the president’s daughter, and Mansur Maqsudi, once the largest shareholder in Coca-Cola’s Tashkent bottling factory. The two parties settled the lawsuit confidentially.MTS’s difficulties began in June when Bekzod Akhmedov, head of MTS Uzbekistan, disappeared; his whereabouts are currently unknown. Shortly thereafter, Uzbek authorities accused MTS of owing the state over $900m in outstanding tax payments. MTS has denied any wrongdoing.The company’s Uzbek licence was cancelled indefinitely by a Tashkent court earlier this month after the telecoms regulator ordered the company to shut down its network the same day. On July 17 more than 9m Uzbeks – nearly a third of the country’s population – were left without mobile service, forcing them to queue for hours for a new SIM card from one of MTS’s competitors.Four Uzbek managers at MTS have been in jail since June. A fifth, who is of Russian nationality, was released earlier this month and given permission to fly back to Russia this week just as US-Uzbek bilateral talks were beginning.While MTS operates primarily in Russia and the CIS, more than a third of its 47 per cent free float is owned by US funds, with Lazard Asset Management and Blackrock being among the biggest shareholders. The company has a market capitalisation of $19.1bn.AFK Sistema, the Russian holding owned by the oligarch Vladimir Yevtushenkov, owns the remaining 53 per cent of MTS."
109;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2012-08-03T18:58:08Z;SolGold suffers Solomon Islands setback;;"A decision by Newmont, the US mining group, to withdraw its interest in a gold and copper exploration project in the Solomon Islands hit shares in its junior partner
SolGold.Aim-quoted SolGold successfully raised £15m at 28p a share in October 2010, weeks after its shares spiked to 52.75p after it suggested its Fauro Island project in the Pacific archipelago could be a world-class gold deposit.But since then its shares have fallen sharply, and slipped from Wednesday’s close of 4.25p to 3.38p on Friday as investors digested the withdrawal of Newmont, the gold mining major, from SolGold’s other project in the country.Other exploration assets in Australia and interests in a gold, copper and silver prospect in Ecuador provide some spread of risk for the Brisbane-based company, which changed its name from Solomon Gold in May.But for now SolGold remains one of a growing number of high-risk, low-reward prospectors being squeezed in the junior gold mining arena."
110;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2012-06-06T18:58:54Z;Barrick replaces CEO in board shake-up;;Barrick Gold has ousted Aaron Regent, its chief executive, in an abrupt management shake-up aimed at reversing the slide in the share price of the world’s largest gold miner.Peter Munk, Barrick’s founder and chairman, said the miner’s board had promoted Jamie Sokalsky, chief financial officer, to run the company and Mr Sokalsky, who joined Barrick in 1993, would also replace Mr Regent on the board.“We are fully committed to maximising shareholder value, but have been disappointed with our share price performance,” said Mr Munk in a statement.Mr Regent’s departure comes amid general disappointment with Barrick’s performance, rather than a specific event or disagreement over strategy, said people familiar with the matter.However, analysts at Citi noted that Barrick shares “have performed better” than its North American peers, adding “the company said they measure results on an absolute and relative basis, a tough hurdle for a mining executive, in our view”.Projects such as the $5bn Pascua Lama development on the border of Chile and Argentina would go ahead, the Citi analysts added.Barrick’s Toronto-listed shares are down almost 8 per cent so far this year, compared to Goldcorp’s fall of 8 per cent and Newmont’s of 14 per cent. The gold sector has suffered as investors have turned to exchange traded funds to gain exposure to the precious metal, eradicating pure-play gold miners’ traditional premium to diversified and base metal peers.Investors are wary of the rising costs of building and running mines and the risks of tackling new, more challenging deposits.Barrick shares fell 2.6 per cent on Wednesday morning to C$42.57. The company also said that John Thornton, currently a board director, would become co-chairman alongside Mr Munk.Industry observers pointed out that Barrick has recovered since the miner unsettled investors with the $7.6bn purchase of Equinox, the copper company, in April 2011. Investors baulked at the surprise move into base metals and also criticised the price paid by Barrick to win Equinox from rival bidder, China’s Minmetals.But Mr Munk, who founded Barrick in the early 1980s and helped build it into the largest global gold producer, has a reputation for falling out with his managers, said industry observers – contrasting Mr Regent’s accountancy background with Mr Munk’s entrepreneurial approach.Mr Munk expressed his frustration with the company’s stock price performance at its annual shareholder meeting last month.“What more can you ask for? Record results for six years in a row. Great fundamentals, exceptional performance, meeting guidelines, social responsibility, high quality of people and employment, a great team of management, a leading position in your industry – for god’s sakes, the world should be at your feet,” Mr Munk told the management team.Mr Sokalsky, who said he was “enormously privileged” to take on the chief executive role, joined Barrick as treasurer about 20 years ago and became chief financial officer in 1999.
111;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;Peru says leftists to blame for mines paralysis;;Peru’s government has accused leftist political parties of orchestrating violent anti-mining conflicts that have paralysed two big projects and claimed at least two lives.The government declared a state of emergency in the southern Andean region of Cusco on Monday night after the deadly protests opposing the Tintaya copper mine, owned by Xstrata.Conga, the $4.8bn copper and gold project planned by Newmont of the US and Buenaventura of Peru in the province of Cajamarca, has been paralysed since November, when protesters blockaded a city for 11 days.“There is a radical current that doesn’t want any mining,” Jorge Merino, mining minister, said. “They want Tintaya to go and then it will be Las Bambas,” he added, referring to another project under development by Xstrata.Ollanta Humala, Peru’s president, has said the Conga and Tintaya conflicts are linked by the participation of the Land and Dignity movement headed by former Catholic priest Marco Arana.According to Peru’s ombudsman, Silvio Campana, there are 171 active conflicts in the country, many of them linked to extractive industries or water claims.Peru, the world’s second-biggest producer of copper and silver and sixth biggest producer of gold, is relying on some $50bn in mining investments in the next few years to maintain its stellar economic growth. With growth forecast at 6 per cent this year, the Andean nation is one of the fastest growing economies in Latin America.Investors fear the Tintaya and Conga disputes may spark an escalation in conflicts elsewhere in the country.Oscar Mollohuanca, mayor of Espinar, the epicentre of Monday’s violence, called for the mine to be closed.Critics say the region’s growing appeal as a mining investment hub is increasing demands on water supplies. A significant agricultural irrigation scheme, the Majes Siguas project, is also slated for the region, aiming to irrigate more than 30,000 hectares in a neighbouring province.Mr Mollohuanca, a member of the Land and Dignity party, denied the protests were aimed mainly at boosting the company’s “voluntary contributions” to the community from 3 per cent of pre-tax profits to 30-per cent.“Increasing the contribution is a point to be discussed … with extreme flexibility,” he said. “We believe there should be an increase, but we would not manage [the funds], that would be up to an autonomous, neutral authority.”Mr Mollohuanca and his fellow protesters turned down meetings with a government delegation sent last week, saying they wanted to meet directly with the mining minister.
112;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2012-05-13T16:23:33Z;Tax spurs Indonesia mine investor fears;;Indonesia’s announcement of a new tax on mineral exports helped demonstrate why foreign investors have been wary of investing in the country’s rich mineral resources.The government this month finally laid out the details of a 20 per cent tax on exports of unprocessed metals, including nickel, tin and gold. Companies without plans to build processing facilities onshore will be banned from exporting.The confusion surrounding the new taxes – set after weeks of conflicting proposals and public comments from ministers – reinforces Indonesia’s reputation for regulatory uncertainty at a time when the country is courting foreign investment. Ministers had initially suggested that the tax could be as high as 50 per cent.Analysts say that tax will hit hardest the country’s smaller and newer miners, rendering some mines unprofitable and driving up the cost of nickel for buyers, particularly those from China who have come to rely heavily on Indonesia.Most larger companies, including Newmont and Freeport-McMoRan, will not be affected because they hold long-term contracts that the new rule cannot change.“There’s no intention to kill the mining companies, for sure,” says Jero Wacik, Indonesia’s energy minister, when announcing the tax.But the measures could reinforce a reluctance on the part of global miners to invest in Indonesia – and other countries that chop and change rules regarding mining operations.“Resource nationalism of this type discourages investment, poses a serious barrier to the exploration and development of new mineral deposits around the world, and is another reason why we see long-term constraints to gold supply,” says Tye Burt, chief executive of gold miner Kinross.As Karsten Fuelster of the International Finance Corporation in Jakarta says: “Would you want to do a multibillion-dollar investment in a mine project if you don’t have certainty over what the governing regulation is going to be?”Only 5 per cent of the industry’s exploration spending last year went to the Pacific region, including Indonesia, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea, down from 7 per cent in 2010, according to Metals Economics Group.Regulatory uncertainty and outbreaks of violence, such as sporadic attacks on Freeport-McMoRan’s Grasberg mine in Indonesia’s far east, meant few miners decided to enter the region, “despite [its] high prospectivity for gold, copper and nickel”, MEG says in its report.Indonesia also recently said that companies must divest majority control of their mines within 10 years of starting production, and are discussing new rules limiting exports of coal.“As a junior miner today trying to raise money for an outstanding highly prospective tenement in Indonesia it would be harder than it was a year or so ago,” says Owen Hegarty, vice-chairman of G-Resources Group, a Hong Kong-listed gold miner with operations in Indonesia. “That doesn’t mean its impossible.”The debate reflects the challenge facing regulators from Chile to Australia as they balance the growth of the mining industry with the demands from citizens and governments for a greater share of that success.Mining has in recent years contributed 4-5 per cent of Indonesian economic output, according to PwC. But its share in some areas is much higher and many of Indonesia’s regions richest in minerals, such as Papua, home of the Grasberg mine, are among the poorest in the country.Indonesian regulators “tend to make very big statements and then they pull back on certain things. There is an awareness that there is a need for foreign investors and there is a lack of local capital to develop the mining industry,” says one Singapore-based lawyer. “That balancing going on is … a learning process for them.”The tax is expected to hurt smaller, private sector miners who predominantly export to China for the production of nickel pig iron, a nickel substitute used in making stainless steel. About 55 per cent of China’s nickel ore imports came from Indonesia last year, according to Macquarie Securities.However, Chinese nickel producers have been stockpiling ore in recent months, anticipating export restrictions, lessening the impact on prices. Nickel is down about 8 per cent this year, trading close to two-year lows.“We have not yet seen any movement in the price of Indonesian nickel ore, suggesting that the miners may be taking the hit,” says Colin Hamilton, analyst at Macquarie. “But we expect there to be some pain-sharing and the tax could increase the volatility in nickel prices between the top and bottom of the cycle.”Lucky Ariesandi, an analyst with Kim Eng Securities in Jakarta says: “The margin for [nickel miners] with the highest profit is 40-50 per cent, the cost [of the new tax] is 20 per cent …There will be some miners with lower profitability that cannot make money if they bear the cost themselves. I think the Chinese buyers will have to bear the cost.”
113;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Randgold looks to engineer local support;;In the Democratic Republic of Congo, close to the border with Uganda, Randgold Resources is pressing ahead with work on its Kibali mine in the latest example of how mining companies must juggle local concerns with larger production goals.A successful ramp-up of operations at the mine, which is expected to yield its first gold by the end of next year, should help lift the FTSE 100 group’s annual gold production from about 700,000 ounces to more than 1m by mid-decade. It also involves the tricky issue of relocating more than 15,000 people from in and around a gold field first developed under Belgian colonial rule.In an area scarred by bloody post-colonial conflict that persisted into the past decade, Mark Bristow, Randgold’s chief executive, insists the project has not just won the support of the DRC’s government, but local people who are being relocated into newly built villages. Engineering such support is a delicate matter for major mining companies who are often accused of callously disregarding the welfare of people forced out by mine development.As Kibali proceeds, concerns over the fate of a sacred mountain worshipped by the 8,000 strong Dongria Kondh tribe in India’s Orissa state has stalled plans by Vedanta Resources, the mining and metals group, to develop a bauxite mine aimed at meeting India’s growing demand for aluminium.Elsewhere, protests by Andean farmers in Peru late last year saw the destruction of equipment at the Conga gold mine project, backed by Newmont of the US and its local partner Buenaventura. Opposition there has forced suspension of the project amid concerns on water supplies and the broader environmental impact of the venture. A decision to push ahead with that mine’s development is still to be taken.Yet Kibali work remains on schedule on a project which is 45 per cent owned by Randgold, 45 per cent by AngloGold Ashanti, with the remaining 10 per cent owned by state-controlled Sokimo.Speaking as Randgold delivered first-quarter results last week, Mr Bristow said a key aim of the Kibali development hds been to secure a “social licence” among local people, on a field that “we rent, rather than own” from the state. As well as winning government support through taxes and investment, Randgold is keen to demonstrate the principle that people who are moved should be better off than before.Beyond painstaking engagement with the population affected, Randgold as operator of the project has also carefully cultivated support from the Roman Catholic church that is the dominant social institution in the area.Construction plans for model town of Kokiza, being build to provide new homes for 14 settlements being cleared for the mine project, were unveiled last year.More than 3,500 houses – built of brick with zinc roofs – are planned to accommodate 15,000 or more. In addition, a Catholic church complex with additional places of worship, along with schools, seven medical centres, public market places and a government office are being built.People being moved can expect 50 per cent more floor space than their former accommodation, water and electricity connections and full title deed to their new homes, says Mr Bristow.Building progress has not been entirely smooth, with roofing work needing to be remedied after poor installation. But Mr Bristow estimates construction of the relocation settlement is 40 per cent complete as houses are being built at the rate of 60 a week. That rate of construction, though clearly at a far lower specification than UK homes, has transformed Randgold into one of the FTSE’s leading housebuilders by volume.Randgold’s approach to Kibali goes beyond many other commitments made by western natural resources companies to win the battle for local support. Such examples include the $50,000 by White Nile Petroleum in social spending in 2006 as it sought to develop disputed oil fields in Southern Sudan ahead of independence. Among items then supplied to garner community support were fish nets, maize grinding machines, brick making machines, generators, and sewing machines.However, dealing with conflict and disputes over the sovereign ownership of assets, as well as engineering local support for projects, remains a key issue for many natural resources companies.Randgold remains heavily exposed to Mali, where a return to full civilian rules following a coup in March is still being resolved. Its other main asset is in Ivory Coast, which was hit by a forced suspension of gold sales in 2010 for several months following a disputed presidential election.
114;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2012-04-18T02:31:29Z;Panel calls for changes to $4.8bn Peru mine;;A panel of independent environmental consultants has recommended changes to Newmont Mining’s stalled $4.8bn Peruvian copper and gold project, Conga.The proposed mine, which would represent the single biggest investment in Peruvian history, has been on hold since November when protesters blockaded a regional capital and vandalised public buildings.“This report will not determine the viability of Conga,” said Manuel Pulgar Vidal, environmental minister.Mr Pulgar Vidal and the ministers for agriculture and mines are to study the report before presenting their opinions to a full cabinet meeting that will decide the fate of the project.The report will be released on Wednesday, but Mr Pulgar Vidal said the consultants concluded the project’s environmental impact statement had met required standards. The consultants recommended a number of improvements, including the augmentation of a series of water reservoirs.Luis Lopez Garcia, one of the consultants hired by the government, said some of the recommendations could be implemented easily but others might necessitate “economic studies to see if they make sense”.“It’s not our mission to say if the project is viable or not,” he said.Anti-Conga protesters say the mine would compromise local water supplies.Social conflicts are one of the main risks for investors in Peru’s extractive sector, which accounts for some 60 per cent of the economy. The Conga dispute, which flared up only after the project had received full government approval, has proved a major test for the centre-left government of president Ollanta Humala.The president sacked his prime minister and reshuffled his cabinet in the wake of the Conga protests, installing Oscar Valdés, his former army training officer and interior minister, as the new cabinet leader.Gregorio Santos, the regional governor of Cajamarca, where Newmont and its partners Buenaventura of Peru and the International Finance Corp plan to build the mine, said the report was “a great victory” for anti-Conga protesters and would set the scene for the extractive sector.“There is a need to create safeguards to protect water and generate an economic, social, environmental and technical balance. This is what private investors in Peru have to understand,” he said.Mr Santos’s comments came the same day that Peru’s constitutional court ruled his regional government of Cajamarca had acted unconstitutionally when it declared the Conga project was not viable.Newmont said it was reserving comment until after the release of the full report on Wednesday, but reiterated that Conga’s reservoirs would “more than double the current water storage capacity of four lagoons … and provide a reliable, year-round supply to downstream users.”“Conga’s [environmental impact assessment] underwent extensive reviews by 12 government agencies and was approved by the mines and energy ministry in 2010, following a transparent, three-year EIA process,” the company said.
115;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2012-03-18T20:05:02Z;Conga row to test Humala’s new direction;;Ollanta Humala, Peru’s president, has a $4.8bn headache.The former army officer is on his way to pulling off a remarkable political transformation – from darling of Latin America’s radical left to champion of investment as the motor for “social inclusion” – but a mining dispute is getting in his way.Conga, a major gold and copper project led by Newmont of the US and its Peruvian partner Buenaventura, has been shut for almost four months after protesters blockaded the city of Cajamarca for 11 days over water supply concerns.Investors with interests in the world’s second-biggest silver and copper producer and sixth biggest gold producer are watching the Conga dispute – and Mr Humala – closely.“The aspect that most draws our attention is the decision to step outside the usual channels and institutions and hire international consultants to review the environmental impact statement,” said a spokesman for Anglo American.A team of independent consultants is expected to finish its review of Conga’s EIS on April 6 and recommend whether the project should proceed. With $42.1bn in mining investments slated by 2015, President Humala has a lot riding on their conclusion.Gregorio Santos, the leftist regional governor of Cajamarca and one of the principal opponents of the mine, has already said he will not recognise the consultants’ findings.And the recent kidnapping of seven community workers in the Cajamarca region has underscored the depth of anti-Conga sentiment in some communities.“They appear with gifts whenever they need something, as they do now, in need of social licence to run the Conga mining project,” said Hector Medina, mayor of Chugur, the community that took the workers prisoner in its town hall for two nights.Carlos Mercado, managing director of Foncreagro, which is contracted by Newmont and Buenaventura to deliver social programmes to their nearby mine, Yanacocha, denied his workers were swapping gifts for political support.“Our colleagues have been doing social work,” he said. “It is regrettable that the climate of intimidation has reached levels of kidnapping and holding people against their will.”So far, Mr Humala has won a measure of public support for his handling of Conga. After replacing his prime minister, Salomon Lerner, with Oscar Valdés in a major cabinet reshuffle, his approval rating jumped to 59 per cent in February.A six percentage point-drop in Mr Humala’s approval rating this March is thought to have more to do with the scandal over the president’s brother Antauro, a convicted coup leader, who was photographed enjoying a new, more comfortable prison cell.According to an Ipsos-Apoyo poll on Sunday, 65 per cent of Peruvians support Mr Humala’s decision to bring in international consultants to review Conga.But a separate poll by Datum showed Peruvians are divided about whether he can resolve the dispute, and pessimistic about the impact the project’s failure would have on the country. Forty-one per cent of Peruvians believed Conga would go ahead, while 40 per cent expected the project to fold. Fifty-five per cent of Peruvians believed that if the project did not advance, mining investment would stall or decline.
116;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2012-03-16T20:13:54Z;Workers kidnapped in protest at Peru mine;;Seven community workers contracted by Newmont of the US and Buenaventura of Peru have been kidnapped by opponents of the Andean nation’s stalled $4.8bn Conga copper and gold project.The workers are being held by ronderos, or self-appointed militias, in the town of Chugur.Conga, Peru’s biggest single investment, has been shuttered since November, when protesters blockaded the city of Cajamarca for 11 days because of concerns over the local water supply.Héctor Medina, mayor of Chugur, confirmed that the workers, part of a non-government organisation contracted by Newmont and Buenaventura to deliver social programmes at Yanacocha, were being held “without violence”.Mr Medina accused the workers of trying to win support for Conga in exchange for gifts of school supplies.“We do not want crumbs from Yanacocha,” he told local radio. “I don’t think there will be aggression… Chugur and all its communities reject Conga and the presence of the Yanacocha mine because our river no longer has water. That is our concern.”Carlos Mercado, managing director of the non-government organisation, Foncreagro, denied the workers had been offering gifts in exchange for support for Conga.“Our colleagues have been doing work of a social nature,” he said. “It is regrettable that the climate of intimidation . . . has reached levels of kidnapping and holding people against their will.”Peru, the world’s second biggest producer of copper and silver, and the sixth biggest producer of gold, has $42.1bn in mining investments in the pipeline by 2015, but its high rate of social protest can threaten the viability of projects.The pace of investment in mining has slowed this year as investors assess the response of President Ollanta Humala’s administration to the Conga protests.Mr Humala, once closely linked with Venezuela’s leftist president Hugo Chavez, has stuck doggedly to his new credo of “investment equals social inclusion” since his election.But the Conga protests, which began after the project had received full approval, have forced the new president to sack a prime minister, reshuffle his cabinet and alienate many of his supporters from the left.A team of independent consultants is expected to finish its review of Conga’s environmental impact statement on April 6 and recommend whether the project should proceed. Protesters, lead by Cajamarca’s regional president, Gregorio Santos, have already warned they will not accept the findings.Police had been notified after the company received word that up to 70 people armed with “sticks and stones” were holding the workers in Chugur’s community hall.Conga is a pivotal project for Newmont and Buenaventura, as production from Yanacocha, the biggest gold mine in Latin America, is declining.Carlos Santa Cruz, Newmont’s regional vice-president, said this week the company was prepared to spend “its last drop of sweat” ensuring Conga restarted. The company, which was losing an estimated $2m a day when the protests shut Conga down, has laid off 6,000 workers to stem its losses.
117;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;Indonesia limits foreign ownership of mines;;Foreign investment in Indonesia could take a hit following a recent government decree barring foreign companies from owning more than 49 per cent of certain mines.The new regulation, announced on Thursday, is the latest step by the government to keep at home a greater portion of the gains of the resource boom and growth in foreign investment. The country is the world’s largest tin producer, a leading exporter of coal, and is rich in copper, gold and other minerals.The move echoes a plan floated by Indonesia’s central bank last year to cap foreign ownership of banks at 50 per cent, which would force investors including Singapore’s Temasek to divest significant holdings.Under the mining decree, foreign holders of mining licences will have to begin divesting their share to Indonesian ownership, beginning five years after production starts. By the 10th year, at least 51 per cent must be held locally. A previous decree had put a higher threshold of 80 per cent on foreign ownership.“There’s no question that this could increase the regulatory risks for new entrants,” said one mining analyst.Miner Freeport-McMoRan, which runs the world’s second-largest copper mine at Grasberg, Indonesia, will not be immediately affected by the new decree. Freeport, along with Newmont Mining Corp, operate under different types of contracts which will convert to business licences only when they expire. Freeport’s is not due to expire until 2021.However, the Indonesian government is trying to renegotiate those contracts to increase the percentage of royalties it receives from the miners’ sales.Newmont said the new rules appeared to be similar to the company’s existing contract of work. The miner is already in the process of reducing its holding in the Batu Hijau copper-gold mine to below 50 per cent, selling stakes to Indonesian buyers, as part of long-running discussions with the government.Newmont’s Elang development project is covered by the same existing contract, it added, which remained in place until mutually renegotiated.Stephen Lang, chief executive of Centerra Gold, the Asian-focused mid-cap gold miner, said that the prospect of retrospective changes could unsettle companies considering new investments. “One of the things you look for from governments is stability. What is harmful is when those conditions change after the investment is made,” he said.In another effort to develop local industry and retain more of the proceeds of the resource boom, the government is requiring miners to process metal ores locally, beginning in 2014.Hendra Sinadia, executive secretary of the Indonesian Mining Association, an industry group, said the new regulations were “nationalistic”. The divestiture requirement, he said, failed to take into account that different types of mines took different lengths of time to become profitable.“The characteristic of mines is they’re considered a long-term investment,” he said. “By the fifth year, maybe [the investors] haven’t met the break-even point, and they have to divest?”But, said the analyst, the history of past revisions to local mining laws suggested that implementation of the new decree would likely be less dramatic than suggested by its top line.
118;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2012-03-06T00:33:48Z;Scramble to sell US debt as yields hit record lows;;Companies lined up to sell dollar-denominated debt in what was the busiest day for issuance so far this year after yields in the corporate bond market fell to record lows.Corporate bonds have rallied in recent months as investors search for investments that offer a higher yield than US Treasuries. That demand, along with low benchmark rates on Treasuries, has driven yields on investment-grade bonds to consecutively new lows this year.Average yields on junk bonds have also fallen sharply this year to about 7 per cent but these remain slightly above all-time lows.Companies sold $19.8bn in investment grade and junk bonds by late Monday, the biggest daily issuance tally since November 7 when companies priced $20.7bn of bonds, according to Dealogic, the data tracker. But some deals were still awaited.Issuers ranging from Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Wynn Las Vegas and Newmont Mining priced bonds. DirecTV, the satellite television provider, sold $4bn.Michael Kastner, principal at Halyard Asset Management, said that the strong start for debt issuance this month would continue as companies looked to take advantage of low yields.“This is just the start and we expect an onslaught of issuance as spring unfolds. Rates are low and corporate treasurers are making sure they get in before rates rise,” he said.On Friday, average yields on investment-grade bonds fell to a new record of 3.27 per cent, according to an index from Barclays Capital that dates back to 1973. US blue-chip companies, including Walt Disney, IBM, Procter & Gamble and McDonald’s, have already been able to sell bonds this year at record low costs.The US Federal Reserve began 2012 by pledging to keep interest rates near zero through to the end of 2014. It is also capping long-term yields via the purchase of bonds under Operation Twist.Since last November the yield on the benchmark US 10-year note, which serves as a key reference for corporate bonds, has been anchored at about 2 per cent.“Global central banks are keeping rates at extraordinarily low levels and investors are trying to find ways to get returns on their capital,” said Jason Brady, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management. “Any time rates are low and investors are excited to buy, issuers will find reasons to sell bonds.”Also increasing debt sales is the fact that record low borrowing costs for companies raises the appeal of selling debt and using the proceeds to buy back stock.For February, US equity buybacks ran at their highest in five months, topping $42.2bn, according to TrimTabs.Average yields on junk bonds have plunged from more than 8 per cent at the start of 2012 to about 7 per cent now. The all-time low yield for junk bonds was 6.61 per cent last spring, the Barclays index shows.Mary Austin, portfolio manager for Pax World’s High Yield Bond Fund, questioned whether the deals were attractive for investors at their present low yields.“It’s been hard to be very excited for some of the names that are coming in because yields are very tight, at 5.5 per cent. It’s good for the companies – they manage to increase their cash flow at very low rates. But again, I don’t think I would purchase [high-yield debt] at 5 or 5.5 per cent levels,” she said.Pax was looking at only one of Monday’s deals, the $400m of 10.5-year notes seen being sold around a yield of 7 per cent by Bill Barrett.Additional reporting by Michael Mackenzie
119;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2012-02-17T18:16:19Z;Investors go for gold mining shares;Precious metal producers distribute earnings to investors;"Gold mining shares are being eyed by analysts as attractive dividend earners in the next few years, as precious metals producers distribute more of their earnings to investors.Yields on large-cap gold companies currently average about 1.5 per cent and could climb even higher as mining companies move to attract investors away from physical gold exchange traded funds, says Chris Bailey, head of global direct investment at Close Asset Management.With the price of the precious metal hovering around $1,700 per ounce, mining firms earn big profits, but their share prices have underperformed the gold price across the board for the past 15 months, says Chris Beer, senior portfolio manager at RBC Global Asset Management.Between January 1 2011 and January 1 2012 gold increased in value by about 30 per cent, to $1,737 per ounce. Yet Barrick Gold Corp, the world’s largest gold producer, has seen only a minimal increase in its share price over the same period, rising by just four per cent. However, Goldcorp, the second-largest producer, has seen better fortunes; its share price has increased by 35.8 per cent in the two years to January 2012.In an attempt to reignite investor interest in their companies, several mining firms announced dividend increases in 2011 that saw payouts climb significantly across the sector. Barrick Gold boosted its dividend by 25 per cent, raising it to 0.15 cents per share from 0.12 cents, while Goldcorp announced a 32 per cent increase last December, its third in little more than a year. Iamgold, meanwhile, raised its payment to 25 cents a share, a four-fold increase on the 6 cents payout it paid the previous year.Such a wholesale move by the gold mining industry has Bailey at Close Asset Management predicting that the sector as a whole will move towards paying a “market yield” to investors in the next two to three years, making them more attractive to portfolio holders seeking income-earning companies.Marc Sontrop, portfolio manager of the Melchior Resources Fund, says that 2011 saw some of the largest annual increases to dividend payments in the history of the gold mining sector. Along with the hikes many producers pledged to pay dividends more frequently and, in some cases, link them to the price of gold.For example, AngloGold began paying its dividend quarterly last year, and Franco-Nevada makes its payments every month. Newmont and Eldorado, meanwhile, have linked their dividends to the price of gold bullion, a move that Yamana Gold’s chief executive, Peter Marrone, criticised because he believed it could result in a volatile dividend.One benefit of the high gold price is that mining firms are currently likely to be earning a cash margin of up to $1,000 per ounce, points out Richard Davis, co-manager of the BlackRock World Resources Equity Income fund. Therefore, he says: “They’re in a position to pay back more money to investors through a dividend.”But despite the prospect of a higher yield, RBC’s Beer notes that higher dividends alone are not enough to attract investors in large numbers. “Just because you get a magic three per cent yield doesn’t mean you’ll get a rush to invest,” he says. “What people want is a dividend policy.”Others argue that one of the problems with investing in gold mining companies has always been the lack of yield. But Close Asset Management’s Bailey says such changes to dividend policy could mark a paradigm shift in the industry. He says: “Investors need to grab hold of something when putting their capital into a company and dividend yield is a major draw.”Meanwhile, the disconnect between the price of gold and the mining firms’ share price performance means companies are having to work harder to attract investors’ money. “Mining companies have had to be more creative to differentiate themselves from other investment vehicles,” argues Sontrop at Melchior. “Moving forward with growth plans, making strategic acquisitions and attempts at keeping escalating costs from getting out of hand have eroded investor confidence.”An example of a company attempting to diversify its revenue base and give investors more reasons to buy its shares is Barrick Gold’s acquisition of Canadian copper producer Equinox Minerals in 2011. The company paid £4.5bn for the firm, 16 per cent more than its nearest rival bidder.Even so, Beer at RBC says that some investors will always want access to a real asset such as physical gold, and will steer clear of mining shares, but some will nevertheless be drawn in by the prospect of a higher income. “We don’t know what the magic number is, but it is probably at least 1.5 per cent dividend yield for someone to be lured to invest,” he says.In a world where gold is selling for more than £1,500 an ounce, experts believe there is still a lot of room for the price to rise, just as it did in 1980 when it soared to $850 an ounce. “My instinct is that gold will crack $2,000 this year and $2,500 in the next two to three years,” predicts Bailey.Geordie Clarke is deputy editor of Money Management, a Financial Times magazine"
120;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;Conga dispute: moving forward;;"Peru’s long-running Conga mine dispute inched forward on Tuesday with the naming of two Spanish engineers to oversee an independent review of the $4.8bn copper mine project.The biggest single investment in Peruvian history has been stalled for more than two months after anti-Conga protestors blockaded the provincial capital of Cajamarca for 11 days. The government is hoping it can restart the project after the review.Luis García-López, who has consulted for the United Nations, and Rafael Fernández Rubio, a specialist in hydraulic resources and hydrology, have signed contracts with the government, according to Lima daily La Republica.A Portugese geologist, José Martins Carvalho, who is slated to study groundwater at the mine site, is yet to sign a contract to join the panel of consultants.Water is a key sticking point in the dispute, which has seen regional governor Gregorio Santos join forces with environmental activist Wilson Saavedra and former Catholic priest and environmental activist Marco Arana.They argue the mine, to be built by Newmont of the US and partner Buenaventura of Peru, will destroy local lakes and pollute local water supply.Santos also opposes projects by China Minmetals Corp, Anglo American and Rio Tinto.“All these mining projects are located in fragile watersheds so they’re too complicated to be viable,” he told reporters recently.Oscar Valdés, Peru’s prime minister, says the problem is not a lack of water, but a lack of infrastructure such as dams and pipelines, to give residents access. As the home of Yanacocha and several other mines, Cajamarca has received significant mining tax revenues over the years, but levels of poverty and extreme poverty remain high. Over the estimated 19 years of Conga’s life, the mine would pay $3bn in taxes, with half going to Cajamarca.Many regional governments in Peru have a poor record in spending funds from extractive industries, whether due to corruption, lack of administrative expertise or red tape.The case is a major test of the new administration of Ollanta Humala, who won a narrow victory after moderating his platform and promising to protect investment as the motor for social inclusion.Omar Jabara, a spokesman for Newmont, says he welcomed the naming of experts to re-review the project, which he said was “one of the most thoroughly studied mining projects in the country”.“Conga’s EIA has already undergone extensive reviews by 12 government agencies and was approved by the mines and energy ministry in 2010 following a three-year, public EIA process.”Related reading:

121;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;Peru sets up close scrutiny of Conga mine;;Peru’s government has chosen three international consultants to review the paralysed $4.8bn Conga gold and copper mine, the biggest single investment in the country’s history.Oscar Valdes, prime minister, says the consultants, to be named in 10 days, will focus on community concerns about the mine’s impact on water supply.“To attract more investments we have to be reliable and . . . stand by our commitments,” Mr Valdes told reporters in the presidential palace.Mr Valdes, a former military officer-turned-businessman who was sworn in last month, said the country had to maintain its credibility.US mining company Newmont says it is losing $2m a day as the suspension grinds on, two months after anti-Conga protesters blockaded the town of Cajamarca for 11 days.Amid fears the protests were turning into a “slow motion Bagua” – a clash in which 33 people died during protests over the right to community consultation over investments – the government imposed a state of emergency.The international consultants’ review of Conga’s environmental impact study is an attempt to break the impasse.The government has also announced it will invest more $1.6bn in Cajamarca’s sanitation and water infrastructure, as well as rail, road, power and communication links.Mr Valdes on Tuesday accused Gregorio Santos, regional president of Cajamarca, of “intransigence” and failing to spend millions of dollars in mining revenues to improve basic services.Cajamarca received $45m in mining taxes last year but almost half its residents still live in poverty and almost a third have no access to water and sanitation.Among protesters’ key concerns are water supply and pollution of waterways.Mr Valdes argued on Tuesday the region had more than sufficient water but lacked basic infrastructure to ensure the population had access.Mr Santos has refused to endorse the new review of Conga, instead calling for the project to be cancelled outright, or for the government to agree to new terms for the review.“The problems caused by environmental impact are going to get worse if the government continues to act as judge and jury,” he told reporters last week.Among Mr Santos’s close allies are Wilson Saavedra, head of the Environmental Defence Front, and Marco Arana, a former priest and longtime opponent of Newmont and Buenaventura’s Yanacocha gold mine, also in Cajamarca. All three men belong to Peru’s left and Peru’s government has sought to exclude Mr Saavedra, who served 10 years in jail for crimes linked to his membership of the MRTA terrorist group.Omar Jabara, a spokesman for Newmont, said Conga would replace four lagoons with reservoirs that would given downstream users year-round supply. “The reservoirs would increase existing storage capacity from 1.4m cubic metres to 3.2m cubic metres,” he added.Investors are watching the Conga dispute closely for any signs that Peru is wavering in its commitment to some $51bn in mining, oil and gas investments in the pipeline over the next decade.Mr Santos has singled out other big ticket investments planned for Cajamarca by companies such as China Minmetals, Rio Tinto and Anglo American as being “too complicated to be viable” because of their proximity to waterways.Social protests, often linked to extractive industries or water concerns, are a key risk for investors in Peru. Earlier this year, widespread protests in the south of the country shut down Southern Copper’s $1bn Tia Maria copper project, Bear Creek of Canada’s Santa Ana silver project, Egasur of Brazil’s Inambari dam and Odebrecht of Brazil’s Tambo 40 hydroelectric scheme.

Juniper Networks advanced 6.1 per cent $23.88, while Cisco Systems was one of the best performers in the Dow Jones index, putting on 1.3 per cent to $19.79 ahead of results.Semiconductor manufacturer NetApp was up 8.3 per cent to $37.51 on reports it could be a subject of takeover bids.Cloud business software developer Salesforce.com rallied 6.3 per cent to $114.51 as Canaccord Genuity analysts said the company’s recent weakness on new billings, could prove temporary, “and not necessarily indicative of [the] firm’s outlook”.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.7 per cent to 2,788.33, but Google, the second most heavily weighted stock in the index, plunged 10 per cent to $581.35 in after-hours trading, when the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that missed expectations by a large margin.The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced just 0.4 per cent to 12,623.98. The S&P 500 finished 0.5 per cent higher at 1,314.50, a gain of 4.5 per cent for the year.The benchmark index is set for its best January since 1997, but analysts warned a disappointing start to the earnings season could weigh on the index. Of the 59 S&P 500 companies that had reported by Thursday afternoon, only 49 per cent had beat expectations, the lowest level in 10 years, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.“Investors are now faced with losing the catalyst that strong earnings growth typically provides during reporting season,” said Barry Knapp, chief US equity strategist at Barclays Capital.Bank stocks continued to rally, as Morgan Stanley and Bank of America beat analyst expectations with fourth-quarter results, but materials, the other star sector of this year’s rally, sold off as profit fell at copper miner Freeport-McMoRan and Newmont Mining lowered its 2012 copper production forecast.BofA eked out a fourth-quarter profit on strong loan growth, although a lossmaking quarter for its investment banking unit weighed on performance, continuing the trend set by JPMorgan and Citigroup.Morgan Stanley declared a loss, but one that was much smaller than expected by analysts, as the investment bank bucked the trend to report an increase in trading revenue.BofA closed up 2.4 per cent to $6.96, after breaching $7 for the first time since the end of October in the morning session. Morgan Stanley climbed 5.4 per cent to $18.28. Other big bank stocks also rallied, except for Wells Fargo, which slipped 0.3 per cent to $30.15.Regional bank Huntington Bancshares fell 4 per cent to $5.79 as its average return on assets fell slightly despite a surge in lending, as the low interest rate environment appeared to take a toll.Freeport-McMoRan opened 2.5 per cent lower, before paring losses to end the day off just 0.2 per cent to $44.37. Fourth-quarter profit of $640m was less than half the figure for the same period in 2010. But many analysts had predicted worse results, after labour disputes hit production at its Indonesian mines in the fourth quarter. Newmont Mining fell 1.2 per cent to $59.60, after raising its forecast for gold output, but lowering guidance on copper extraction.Gas-focused energy exploration and production companies continued their torrid 2012, after natural gas futures, which have been plummeting for some time, hit a decade low.Cabot Oil & Gas fell 6.5 per cent to $63.09 and Range Resources fell 4.1 per cent to $54.06. Cabot is now off almost 17 per cent year to date.Ebay climbed 3.9 per cent to $31.51, as the company beat fourth-quarter estimates, thanks mainly to heavy usage of its PayPal electronic payments site. But some analysts focused on the less than stellar performance at Ebay’s core internet auction website business.“We continue to question the sustainability of the recent mid-teens core general merchandise volume growth rates heading to 2012,” said Brian Nowak at Nomura.Car parts manufacturer Johnson Controls slumped 8.4 per cent to $32.60 for the worst performance in the S&P 500 as the company lowered full-year earnings guidance, citing weakness in demand from Europe.But the aircraft part supplier Rockwell Collins climbed 5.5 per cent to $59.96 after the company said it was doubling production of parts for Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner this quarter.First Solar slumped 10 per cent to $38.70, on reports the German government will cut subsidies for solar energy. The solar industry remains heavily dependent on support from eurozone governments for demand.Eastman Kodak, the company that invented the handheld camera, ended a prolonged share price slide by filing for bankruptcy. The shares were last trading at 36 cents.

But the index closed at 1,293.66, a gain of just 0.4 per cent, as financials, which had trended positive in the morning session, finished the day as the only sector in the red.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.5 per cent to 12,482.22, while the Nasdaq Composite index climbed 0.6 per cent to 2,728.08.Earlier, contrasting results from Citigroup and Wells Fargo had emphasised the diverging fortunes of investment banking franchises and more conventional mortgage lenders.Citigroup ended the day off 8.2 per cent to $28.22, giving up half its gains for the year, as its investment banking arm reported a fourth-quarter loss, and overall net income of $1.2bn came in significantly below analyst expectations.Wells Fargo climbed 0.7 per cent to $29.83, as the largest US home lender reported record fourth-quarter earnings. Deposits at Wells rose 13 per cent during the quarter and residential mortgage lending increased more than a third to $120bn.For much of the day investors had appeared ready to wait for other banks to report their own results, rather than taking flight from the sector as a whole. Bank of America had enjoyed the best opening in the Dow Jones index, while Goldman Sachs was also in the black at midday.But BofA ended the day off 2 per cent to $6.48, Goldman was down 1.3 per cent to $97.68, Morgan Stanley fell 2.3 per cent to $16.25 and JPMorgan Chase, which had disappointed analysts with its own fourth-quarter results on Friday, closed down 2.8 per cent to $34.91.Despite the late sell-off, analysts were optimistic that bank stocks could avoid the large, correlated falls that characterised the second half of 2011.“I think investors are willing to put Q4 bank results behind them, and I think we remain on a general trend of financial stocks outperforming as long as sentiment towards the US economy improves,” said Richard Staite at Atlantic Equities.The day had started positively as US investors focused on positive data from better than expected Chinese gross domestic product and German investor sentiment numbers to offset Standard & Poor’s downgrade of eurozone sovereigns and the eurozone bail-out fund over the long American weekend.“Investors appear ever more convinced that central banks will do what it takes to ensure recovery regardless of downgrades,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist with Prudential Financial, “but technical analysts will point to low volume and the limited breadth of this equity rally. Volume is oxygen for bulls, and we’re not seeing that yet.”Elsewhere, shares in Sears Holdings surged 9.5 per cent to $36.75 as an analyst suggested Edward Lampert, Sears’ chairman and a big shareholder, may take the troubled department store chain private, buying out other shareholders.Sears’ market capitalisation has halved since the start of November, as the company announced store closures in December. Mr Lampert increased his personal stake in the company last week.Carnival Corporation plunged 13.7 per cent to $29.60 as investors traded shares in the cruise ship operator for the first time since one of its liners ran aground off the coast of Italy on the weekend.Carnival has estimated the initial financial impact of the disaster at $95m.RR Donnelley slumped 15.8 per cent to $12.13 for the worst performance in the S&P 500, as the corporate digital communications provider lowered its full-year 2011 revenue forecast to $10.6bn from as much as $10.8bn in November.Amazon investors brushed off a cybersecurity breach at its wholly owned subsidiary, the online shoe-seller Zappos, as shares closed up 1.8 per cent at $181.66.Saudi Arabia’s decision to target a crude oil price of $100 a barrel, a third higher than its previous publicly stated target, helped US energy companies with proved oil reserves.Denbury Resources climbed 4.4 per cent to $17.82, while ExxonMobil was up 1 per cent to $85.69 and Chevron climbed 0.6 per cent to $106.72. But gas explorers continued to suffer, with Cabot Oil & Gas down 1.2 per cent to $66.36, as US natural gas prices hit new multiyear lows on Monday.Newmont Mining fell 3.9 per cent to $60.94 after the company said copper output would be lower and capital expenditure higher in 2012 compared to 2011.Shares in Boeing climbed 0.9 per cent to $75.24, as European rival Airbus said total aircraft orders will probably drop by more than 50 per cent this year to as few as 600 from an all-time high of 1,419 in 2011.Illinois Tool Works climbed 3.2 per cent to $50.96, after the company said over the weekend it would allow Relational Investors, an activist investment firm, to appoint a board member.

Lennar, DR Horton and PulteGroup are all now up more than 40 per cent in the quarter to date.Elsewhere Wall Street brushed off a rise in US jobless claims to record solid gains on as financial stocks bounced off a difficult previous session.The S&P 500 climbed 1.1 per cent to 1,263.02, moving back into positive territory for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also climbed 1.1 per cent to 12,287.04 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.9 per cent to 2,613.74.Although new jobless claims ticked up 15,000 in the week ending December 24, but Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak, said that should not hold back US markets:“[The rise] is marginally more than was predicted but at 381,000 [claims] remain comfortably below that 400,000 line in the sand that points to steady job creation,” he wrote to clients.The financial sector of the S&P 500 climbed 1.6 per cent, outperforming all other sectors.Bank of America climbed 3.3 per cent to $5.46 and JPMorgan Chase was up 2.4 per cent to $33.42, although bank stocks were recovering from a poor day on Wednesday, when they had significantly underperformed the market.Yahoo climbed 2.2 per cent to $16.13 on reports that Alibaba, a potential suitor for the internet portal company, had hired lobbyists, raising speculation of more bidding activity.Shares in Mosaic, a fertiliser maker, fell fractionally to $50.28, after the company said it will cut output by as much as 250,000 metric tonnes through the first quarter of 2012 because of low prices for phosphate products.Shares in Amazon were also down a few cents to $173.86, even though the company reported it sold a record number of Kindle devices, running into the “millions”, over the holiday period.Investors seemed focused on a negative research note from Goldman Sachs which reported that Christmas shopping data released by comScore, a digital research company, implied that Amazon’s 2011 sales will come in at $17.87bn. That would be slightly below analyst expectations of $18.19bn.“For [Amazon] to materially appreciate in the near term would require the company to beat and raise on the bottom line over the next few quarters,” Heather Bellini wrote to Goldman clients. “Given our lower operating forecasts for 2012, we see this scenario as unlikely.”Amazon is set to end the year off 4 per cent, with investors showing signs of nerves over the strategy of Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive, to drive sales by heavy investment in new products.With one day of trading left in 2011, the consumer discretionary sector of the S&P 500 is set to end the year up 5 per cent, the best performance apart from defensive utility and consumer staple stocks. That has been driven by robust US consumer spending, even as worries about global growth have resurfaced, but analysts are questioning whether the outperformance can continue.The holiday season has been characterised by heavy discounting and high volumes of internet purchases by price-conscious shoppers. The latest quarterly results season saw several star retail stocks report falling or stalling margins.Consumer electronics chain Best Buy fell 15.5 per cent on December 13, after profits fell, despite an increase in revenue, because of lower margins. And on December 22 Bed, Bath and Beyond, tumbled 6.3 per cent in a rising market, as it broke a long run of margin growth.“This lower gross margin, we believe, will be a trend across retail as the cost of sales increases, and the internet, a lower margin sales channel, continues to hurt margins,” said David Strasser, retail analyst at Janney.Analysts also question whether retail spending can continue to outpace economic growth. The personal savings rate fell steadily over the year to 3.3 per cent in September, the lowest level since 2007, suggesting consumers may be cutting back on savings to fund spending.The holiday season has also seen signs of cracks in the emerging market-driven growth story that has seen luxury retailers trade at a premium this year. Tiffany was heavily penalised by investors at the end of November when it forecast “weakness” in sales in western European and north-eastern US.“No matter how good the performance in Asia, mature markets still matter,” said David Schick, retail analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “We’re starting to see weakness in financial markets impacting on high end consumer spending.”
125;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2011-12-14T09:25:55Z;Copper projects at risk as Peru leaders get tough;Community unrest is becoming the biggest threat to mining ventures;When Ollanta Humala won Peru’s presidential elections in June, the mining industry took fright.Six months later, the leftwing president, who rode to power on a promise of a windfall tax on the sector, has surprised even the most optimistic industry observers.Confronted with growing unrest over Minas Conga, a $4.8bn project that would be the country’s largest ever single investment, Mr Humala might have been expected to take the side of the protesters, his natural supporter base.Instead he has come down on the side of Newmont and Buenaventura, the miners, and is taking no prisoners. Ten days ago he declared a state of emergency, and over the weekend he replaced half of his cabinet, including the prime minister, apparently because of the failure of the negotiating process.Despite the remarkably business-friendly attitude demonstrated by this response, the escalation of the dispute over Conga should worry investors in Peru’s mining sector.The ramifications are potentially huge: Peru is the target of large investments by many big international miners, including Xstrata, BHP Billiton and Anglo American, and is set to be the source of a large part of the supply growth for key commodities in the next five years – most strikingly copper, for which it could contribute a third of new supply.Mr Humala’s actions over the past fortnight demonstrate that he is becoming more confrontational.As well as imposing a state of emergency, he has appointed Oscar Valdes, a retired army lieutenant-colonel, as his new prime minister, suggesting a hardline approach to the protesters.If the new approach aggravates rather than resolves social unrest, those mining projects that are delicately poised on the cusp of development could suffer.Indeed, there is overwhelming consensus among mining executives in Peru that community unrest is the most severe threat to mining investment in the country. Unlike neighbouring Chile, where many mines are in the desert, Peru’s mineral-rich mountains are also home to countless farming communities, which compete with the mining industry for resources – primarily water.Should the unrest at Conga spread to the rest of the state of Cajamarca, as much as $9.6bn of mining investment will be under threat, according to César Pérez-Novoa of Celfin Capital, including Rio Tinto’s La Granja project and Anglo’s Michiquillay deposit.Already this year, Southern Copper’s Tia Maria project and Bear Creek’s Santa Ana project have been scuttled by protests while Anglo American said recently in September that it would “pause” development at Quellaveco, one of its main copper projects, due to a dispute with the local communities.While higher taxes can be anticipated and budgeted for, local protests cannot. The greater the level of confrontation between government, miners and local communities, the harder it is for the industry to plan for future investments in the country.Indeed, Pedro Fuenzalida of LarrainVial, a leading South American brokerage, has pushed back his expectations for all Peruvian mining projects that are not yet under construction.In a worst-case scenario, that could affect such mega-projects as Xstrata’s flagship Las Bambas mine, Chinalco’s Toromocho, and the expansions of Cerro Verde and Antamina, two large copper mines owned by consortiums of miners including BHP Billiton, Xstrata and Freeport-McMoRan.Between them, the projects mentioned above are slated to bring about 1.5m tonnes of annual copper production on to the market in the next five years – more than the total current output of Peru, the second-largest copper producer in the world.The risks of Mr Humala’s hardball approach are clear.
126;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2011-12-11T16:19:09Z;Gold producers rush to boost dividends;Miners’ equities have lagged behind surge in bullion price;Gold miners are rushing to boost their dividends in the hope of wooing investors from gold-linked exchange-traded funds and other vehicles.In the latest move, Iamgold, a mid-sized producer with mines in west Africa, Canada and Suriname, announced a 25 per cent increase in its pay-out on Friday. Iamgold’s annual dividend is now 25 cents a share, more than four times last year’s 6 cents pay-out.Earlier this month, Goldcorp, another Toronto-based producer, lifted its dividend by 32 per cent, the third increase in little more than a year. Barrick Gold, the world’s biggest producer by volume, pushed up its pay-out by a quarter.Steve Letwin, Iamgold’s chief executive,said that “in the past there was this belief that people buy gold equities for growth only. The management view was: ‘We are much better off holding on to the cash and investing it for growth than giving it to the shareholders’. I’m a believer that you can do both, and I think others are seeing that as well.”Gold mining equities have lagged behind the surge in the bullion price. Barrick shares are one-fifth higher than in December 2009, while the gold price has soared more than 50 per cent, closing on Friday at $1,712 an ounce.Peter Munk, Barrick’s chairman, said in September: “ETFs are wonderful things. But they have taken demand away from gold equities.“Being the biggest has worked against us,” he added. “The bigger you are, the more likely you are to have a strike, or to maybe run into environmental problems at any of your mines around the world. So it’s thought of as safer for the gold investor to buy an ETF.”Miners are also exposed to volatile costs. With mine expansion and construction activity picking up. Mr Letwin said that “costs are a clear and present danger. Everyone has their hand out.”Chris Beer, a precious-metals fund manager at Royal Bank of Canada, said that some gold miners had sought to boost shareholder value through acquisitions in recent years. But, he added, “they’re just bigger, with more shares – not necessarily better in share-price performance”.Gold miners’ current dividend yields, averaging little more than 1 per cent, are less than half those of oil shares and a third below base metals stocks. Gold miners also traditionally pay out a far lower proportion of their cash flow.Denver-based Newmont Mining, among others, pledged this year to link its dividend pay-out to the bullion price.Even so, Barry Cooper, analyst at CIBC World Markets, told clients in a recent report that “the fascination with gold dividends is a function of the economic times the world is facing. As with most fads, this, too, will pass.”In Mr Cooper’s view, “gold companies should continue their struggle to provide growth over cash distribution if left with a choice”. According to a recent RBC Capital Markets poll of institutional investors, 63 per cent said raising dividends would be the best way to narrow the divergence between the gold price and equities. Almost a fifth of respondents said nothing should be done, citing a structural change in the relationship between gold and equities, and 12 per cent suggested share buy-backs.
127;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2011-12-11T04:41:57Z;New Peru PM promises ‘moderate’ policies;;"Peru’s new prime minister denied on Sunday that the government was in crisis after the sudden resignation of his predecessor and the suspension of a $4.8bn gold mining project.Oscar Valdés, a former military officer, pledged a continuation of “moderate” policies amid fears of a “militarisation” of the administration of Ollanta Humala, the president and himself a former army officer and leader of a failed coup in 2000.A cabinet reshuffle was expected to unseat several ministers but Mr Valdés pledged that Luis Miguel Castilla, a well-respected centrist, would remain as finance minister.Departing prime minister Salomón Lerner was Mr Humala’s election campaign manager and a leading force behind the president’s ideological shift from radical leftist to moderate.Mr Lerner had also taken the lead in talks with protestors opposed Newmont’s Conga mine, the biggest single investment in Peruvian history.His resignation letter suggested a rupture with the president over how to proceed with the Conga dispute, which paralysed the region of Cajamarca for almost a fortnight before Mr Humala called in troops and declared a state of emergency.Locals say Conga would turn four highland lakes they rely on for drinking water and irrigation into waste disposal ponds and have mounted increasingly violent protests.“Our way has been dialogue and consensus-building among Peruvians to avoid confrontation and reaffirm our democratic life and vocation,” Mr Lerner said in the letter, a copy of which was published by La Republica, a Lima daily paper.“The beginning of a new era of government requires . . . strategy of government action . . . I resign with the sole purpose that you have complete freedom to make such adjustments.”Jo-Marie Burt – a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights group – said the Conga dispute had become “a battle for the heart and soul of the Humala administration.“Mr Lerner seems to have really been the force for promoting the dialogue in Cajamarca”, she said and the naming of a former military officer to replace him was “very concerning”.Mr Humala has called the Conga protesters “intransigent” and promised an “iron fist” for those who compromise the rights of the public.Defusing social conflicts is a challenge for Mr Humala and his ideologically divided cabinet, given their promises to provide impoverished Peruvians with a stake in the country’s stellar economic growth.The president has repeatedly said he sees the $50bn in projected mining and oil investment over the next decade as a driver of his “social inclusion” policies. He has increased mining royalties since taking office on July 28 and ushered in a law to give communities the right to be consulted about mining or extractive industry investments.However, the list of big ticket projects that have ground to a halt in the past year over environmental or community concerns – many before Mr Humala came to power – is growing, including Southern Copper’s $1bn Tia Maria copper project; Bear Creek of Canada’s Santa Ana silver project; Egasur of Brazil’s Inambari hydroelectric dam; and Odebrecht of Brazil’s Tambo 40 hydroelectric scheme.Following protocol, Mr Humala’s entire cabinet tendered their resignations upon Mr Lerner’s resignation, giving the president the opportunity to reshuffle his team.While Mr Lerner’s resignation came as a surprise, Lima has been buzzing with rumours of a reshuffle for weeks, with Carlos Herrera Descalzi, the mining minister; Susana Baca, culture minister; Miguel Caillaux, agriculture minister; Ricardo Giesecke, environment minister and Aíd García Naranjo, women and social development minister, among those thought to be in danger of losing their posts."
128;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2011-12-05T16:06:49Z;Peru’s slow-moving mining emergency;;"The state of emergency declared in Peru late on Sunday night will have been welcomed by executives in the global mining industry. But what looks like a remarkably pro-business move by Ollanta Humala, Peru’s president, may not make it much easier for miners to negotiate Peru’s thorny business environment.After almost a decade of stellar commodities-fuelled economic growth and political stability Peru has become one of the darlings of Latin America’s investment scene.But by continuing to encourage foreign investment after his election victory in June, the former firebrand leftwinger has angered many of his grassroots supporters. In Cajamarca, where a $4.8bn gold and copper mine being built by Newmont Mining Corp would empty four lakes that locals use for drinking water and irrigation, protests have become increasingly violent.Last week, Newmont suspended work at its Conga mine pending a solution to the conflict, sending a collective shudder through the mining community, which accounts for 60 per cent of Peru’s GDP.The state of emergency has restored calm to the streets of Cajamarca, where anti-Conga protestors, lead by regional governor Gregorio Santos, had blocked roads, destroyed property and extorted hapless drivers with “taxes”.Humala was strongly critical of the protestors. In a televised address to the nation, he said “the intransigence of local and regional leaders [had] been exposed”.“Not even the most basic agreements could be reached to ensure social peace and the reestablishment of social services,” he said.Conga has become a battleground for Peru’s disgruntled left, which expected to wield far greater influence in Humala’s administration. To their annoyance, the government has said there is no need to review Conga’s environmental impact statement approved by the former administration last year.But a very public split between the environment ministry – which raised serious concerns about Conga’s environmental impacts – and the mining and energy ministry, underscore weaknesses in both Humala’s administration and Peru’s mining licensing, regulation and oversight.Activists have long criticized the environmental impact statement approval process, which rests with the ministry of mines and energy, and called for the toothless environmental oversight agency to be given real powers.As long as Peru’s institutions are weak – see Transparency International’s latest ranking, which puts Peru on a par with El Salvador and Colombia – companies are vulnerable.Away from Lima, where mining companies operate, the problem is more often than not an absent, rather than a weak, state.Community relations can be a nightmare, from figuring out who exactly belongs to a community and who are its legitimate leaders, to managing the very high expectations of a company’s responsibilities.Mining companies in Peru are routinely expected to build roads, schools, clinics and other infrastructure. Even the most responsible companies can face sudden blow-ups in community relations after years of painstaking negotiations.This is in part because violent confrontation has increasingly become the means by which communities and protestors secure gains.It was only after 33 people were killed in clashes near the jungle town of Bagua in 2009 that former president Alan Garcia agreed to consider a law granting communities the right to be consulted over investments, for example. (He later vetoed the bill, saying it would grant communities the right to veto projects of value to the entire nation).Humala’s administration is still working out how to apply its new law of consultation. It is also, with the Conga dispute, working out how to reconcile its commitment to investors with its promises to honour social inclusion and the environment; and how to bring protestors to the negotiating table, instead of the streets.Related reading:

It’s not exactly a textbook strategy from a capital management perspective,” said Barton Crockett, an entertainment analyst at Lazard Capital.Elsewhere stocks fell on Tuesday, as a downward revision to US third-quarter growth figures put paid to hopes of a rally after Monday’s sell-off.The S&P 500 closed down 0.4 per cent at 1,188.04, stuck below 1,200, a level it breached for the first time in a month on Monday.With trading volumes light, Colin Cieszynski at CMC Markets warned the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday could drive further losses. “Getaway day traders may have closed out positions and be unwilling to take on new positions over an extended weekend,” he said.The Nasdaq Composite index was off just 0.1 per cent to 2,521.28, given ballast by Apple, by far the most heavily weighted stock in the index, which was up 2 per cent to $376.51, after Jefferies said Apple had not cut orders to suppliers for iPads by as much as other research firms have suggested.The blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5 per cent per cent to 11,508.97.Hewlett-Packard closed down 0.8 per cent at $26.65. The computer maker fell as low $25.25 in early trading as investors reacted with dismay to the company’s pessimistic outlook for 2012.A downward adjustment to fiscal 2012 guidance had been widely expected, but the scale took analysts by surprise: new chief executive Meg Whitman predicted full-year earnings per share of $4, well below the $4.56 median analyst prediction, with the company downbeat on both consumer and business demand.Jeffrey Fidacaro, a computer analyst at Susquehanna, said HP had at least frontloaded bad news.”We believe this could provide a conservative floor to prudently set up the stock for estimate increases from here,” he told clients.Strong earnings boosted Medtronic. Shares in the medical research group surged 4.5 per cent to $34.75, after profits for the quarter ended October 28 jumped 50 per cent compared with the same period in 2010.Declining soup sales knocked Campbell’s, which fell 5.3 per cent to $31.84, as quarterly profits fell 4 per cent year on year.Starwood Hotels and Resorts slipped 4.7 per cent to $45.39 after Nomura analyst Harry Curtis, lowered earnings estimates, citing the company’s strong exposure to Europe. Starwood derives as much as 12 per cent of total earnings from the continent, twice as much as rivals such as Marriott International.Nvidia continued to benefit from widespread reports that it will supply semiconductors for the next generation of Apple MacBooks. Shares rose 3.1 per cent to $15.08 putting the stock up 8.3 per cent for the week, and only 3 per cent off for the year.Fellow semiconductor stock Analog Devices fell 3 per cent $33.32, after the company revealed the extent of the fall in orders through the third quarter.Gilead Sciences bounced back somewhat from its 10 per cent fall on Monday, as investors got over the initial shock of the $11bn price tag it agreed to pay for Pharmasset.The stock traded 6.9 per cent higher at $38.76, as analysts weighed up the long-term potential of the acquisition. “We believe that this makes a lot of sense and will provide Gilead with a highly synergistic asset with a very long tail,” Yaron Werber at Citigroup wrote to clients.Groupon fell 14.9 per cent to $20.07, within touching distance of its $20 debut price, with options traders buying puts for the right to sell the stock for as little as $13.Gold miner Newmont Mining prospered in market volatility yet again, up
0.8 per cent to $65.79, with bearish investors possibly seeking exposure to gold.The financial sector of the S&P 500 fell 0.9 per cent, but the big US banks avoided hefty losses.Jefferies, whose European exposures and funding model have come in for intense scrutiny, was down 1.4 per cent to $10.06.The IntercontinentalExchange was up 1.5 per cent to $115.91, as the derivatives exchange benefited from negative sentiment towards its larger rival the CME Group.The CME was partially responsible for regulating MF Global, the broker-dealer which filed for bankruptcy at the start of the month. CME shares were 0.4 per cent lower at $240.57."
130;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2011-10-27T15:14:24Z;Gold price lifts Barrick profit by 45%;;Barrick Gold, the world’s biggest gold miner by output, lifted third-quarter earnings by 45 per cent, with a higher gold price more than offsetting lower production.Barrick also raised its dividend by a quarter to 15 cents a share, joining other gold miners in a drive to attract investors with higher pay-outs.Gold producers’ shares lagged behind the recent surge in the price of the yellow metal as investors have turned to more rewarding vehicles, notably gold-backed exchange traded funds.Denver-based Newmont Mining lifted its dividend by 17 per cent earlier this week, bringing it to more than double the level at the end of last year. Newmont promised earlier this year to increase the pay-out by five cents a share for each $100 rise in the previous quarter’s gold price.Barrick posted record net income of $1.37bn, or $1.37 a share, up from $942m, or 96 cents a share, a year earlier.The average gold price received climbed by 41 per cent to $1,743 an ounce. Third-quarter production from its 26 mines slipped 6 per cent to 3.9m ounces. Cash costs rose by 12 per cent to $453 an ounce.Barrick shares were little changed in early trading on Thursday.The company said it was still on track to reach full-year output of 7.6m-7.8m ounces. It recently announced two sizeable new discoveries at its Cortez property in Nevada.Barrick has substantially increased its exposure to copper with the $7.6bn acquisition earlier this year of Equinox Minerals, whose main asset was the big Lumwana copper mine in Zambia. Barrick’s copper output soared by two-thirds to 140m lbs in the third quarter.Barrick said it was accelerating an expansion study at Lumwana that could double processing rates.
131;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2011-10-17T19:29:03Z;Bumi puts off $2bn deal to acquire miner;;Bumi, the resources company founded by London financier Nat Rothschild, has abruptly postponed a $2bn acquisition of diversified miner Bumi Resources Minerals, owned by the Indonesian Bakrie group.Bumi said four months ago it would issue $2bn in convertible bonds to buy a 75 per cent stake in BRM, to broaden the portfolio of the company, formerly known as Vallar.Bumi said in a statement on Monday that the deal “will not proceed at this time due to continuing market uncertainties”.Shares in BRM, which generates the bulk of earnings from a 24 per cent stake in the Indonesian operations of US gold miner Newmont, have dropped nearly 30 per cent below the June offer. On Monday they fell more than 6 per cent.“This action ‘not to proceed’ with the BRM stake sale at this time is taken in the best interest of all our Bumi Resources shareholders and to avoid any risk of they being disadvantaged …because of the current volatile market environment,” Dileep Srivastava, head of investor relations at Bumi Resources, said in an email to the Financial Times.No timeframe was provided for when the acquisition might proceed. Damage from market turbulence is not limited to the BRM deal. It is also threatening to unravel the current shareholder structure of Bumi, in which the Bakrie family hold the largest stake, of 47 per cent.The family is facing some of the most serious debt issues since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis and may have to sell down holdings to repay a $1.34bn loan syndicated by Credit Suisse.The loan has been recalled before a March 2012 maturity due to a 25 per cent fall in Bumi’s shares from an initial listing price of £10 last year to close at 756p on Monday. They are down 47 per cent from a high of £14 in April, rendering the Bakrie holdings insufficient to act as collateral to cover the facility.Mr Srivastava said the postponement was part of efforts to cut interest charges at Bumi Resources by 50 per cent to $300m by the end of 2012. Bumi Resources is trying to refinance a $1.9bn loan from Chinese sovereign wealth fund CIC.In June, its net debt stood at $3.42bn, an increase of 25 per cent from January 2010. Its net income was virtually flat at $278m in the first six months of 2011, or slightly less than the interest charges on the CIC loan.In the same reporting period, Bumi Resources’ net capital gearing ratio rose from 131 per cent to 140 per cent, or from $3.6bn in January 2010 to $4.79bn in June 2011. Revenue rose 24 per cent to $2.14bn.PT Bakrie Brothers (BNBR), which holds $597m, or roughly half of the Credit Suisse-led loan, said in a statement on Monday it was “in final negotiations and documentation of a new financing facility to enable BNBR to satisfactorily resolve any issues in the Credit Suisse loan through a combination of partial repayment of existing lenders and rolling the balance into a new facility”.The Bakries have been in discussions with trading company Glencore, which is considering lending the family several hundred million dollars.The other half of the loan is held by Long Haul Holdings, an unlisted Bakrie company.
132;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2011-10-05T01:22:08Z;Shifting forces make up gold price;;"From Mr Timothy Green.Sir, Mark Williams (“Gold bugs beware – the bubble is finally bursting”, October 4) misunderstands the shifting forces that make up the gold price. The bubble to $850 in 1980 was momentarily driven by Nelson Bunker Hunt’s attempt to corner the silver market; virtually no business was done at that level. The average price that year was $614 and settled into the $350-$450 range for years. But that was enough to stimulate a mining boom that doubled output. “Gold bugs” then invested, not in the metal but in blossoming Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining, and did very nicely. At seminars they always told me they were “in gold” and then wondered why its price did not rise.Today the dynamics have changed. The money is again in the metal itself and miners often feel neglected (although “Qatar Gold”, as in your report of October 4, is showing confidence).Most significant is the return of the central banks as net buyers for the first time in decades. This is a sea change, not a passing whim. With countries and their currencies under financial siege, banks will sit on their gold as will grass-roots physical investors. The bubble will not be easily pricked.Timothy Green, London SW1, UK"
133;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2011-09-20T18:47:01Z;Netflix hit by investor confidence;;Netflix shares slumped 9.5 per cent to $130.03 on Tuesday, as the combined impact of a corporate restructuring and an unexpected fall in subscribers continued to weigh on the movie-streaming company.The stock is down 13 per cent this week, after Netflix announced on Monday that it will hive off its physical DVD delivery business into a separate company called Qwikster. Last week shares fell 24 per cent after the company revealed a pricing change introduced in July had cost it 1m new subscribers.“In the long run, it makes sense to separate into two companies because the growth profiles and future prospects of the DVD and streaming businesses are dramatically different,” said Edward Williams at BMO Capital Markets. “But the brand has been tarnished because they didn’t communicate the pricing change to customers well. We don’t know how much subscriber churn there is going to be as a result.”George Askew, the Netflix analyst at Sitfel Nicolaus, said the company’s decision to set up Qwikster is a first step to selling the DVD delivery business altogether.Netflix’s market capitalisation has now fallen by more than half in just over two months, from a share price peak of $304.79 in mid-July.The wider market had a see-saw day. The S&P 500 was up as much as 1.5 per cent in mid-afternoon, but ended the day in negative territory after a late sell off.The benchmark index fell 0.2 per cent to 1,202.10 and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.9 per cent to 2,590.24. But the blue-chip heavy Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.1 per cent to 11,408.66.“The S&P 500 has always pared gains on reaching 1,220 during the past month,” said Colin Cieszynski, a market strategist at CMC Markets. “There are a lot of resting sell orders which kick in at that point, so this is a normal technical correction.”Other analysts pointed to investors paring risk ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee’s monetary policy announcement tomorrow.Barry Knapp at Barclays Capital suggested financial stocks might sell off in anticipation of “Operation Twist”, an expected move by the Fed to lower long-term interest rates, which would in turn impact on the margins banks can charge on lending.Citigroup fell 2.8 per cent to $26.93 after RBC Capital Markets reduced earnings expectations, citing “lower than expected capital markets revenues and a lower net interest margin [on lending]”.But the worst performing sectors in the S&P 500 were industrials and materials, which fell 1 and 0.7 pe cent respectively, although companies in those sectors would stand to benefit from cheaper long-term loans.CF Industries fell 6.5 per cent to $163.67 and Cliffs Natural Resources 6.4 per cent to $70.60.Defensive stocks, including utilities and healthcare companies, were the best performers.Pharmaceutical company Celgene Corporation rose 7.1 per cent to $65.56 on expected resolution of an ongoing European review of its Revlimid product.Watson Pharmaceuticals gained 3.8 per cent to close at $72.01 on the unexpected approval of its generic Lovenox drug by US regulators.Newmont Mining jumped 5.5 per cent to $69.90 after the gold miner promised to pay out higher dividends with the price of gold at historically high levels.Newmont said it would increase its gold price- linked dividend by 7.5 cents a share for gold prices above $1,700 an ounce and 2.5 cents a share for gold prices above $2,000 an ounce.Advertising group Interpublic was the best performing stock in the S&P 500, up 8.3 per cent to $8.13, in what appeared to be a reaction by statistical traders to a sell-off in the stock on Monday.The stock had fallen more than 5 per cent on Monday and it remains well below its 50-day moving average of $9.45.Apple shares hit an all-time high of $422.86 before slipping back to $413.45, a gain of 0.5 per cent.Kulbinder Garcha at Credit Suisse said emerging markets penetration could result in extra $68bn in sales and $18 in EPS,” for Apple by 2015.“Apple is only at the cusp of unleashing its vast EM potential”, Mr Garcha said in a note to clients.Goodrich Corp, which jumped by 15.8 per cent on Monday on reports that industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corporation was preparing a bid for the aircraft manufacturer, rose another 4 per cent to $111.82 on conflicting reports of a possible sale price.In US data news, new home construction fell 5 per cent in August to 571,000, according to numbers released on Tuesday.“The further fall in housing starts in August adds to other evidence, such as the recent drop in consumer confidence and fall in mortgage approvals, suggesting that demand for new homes remains close to rock bottom,” said analysts at Capital Economics.“This goes some way to explaining why equity prices of homebuilders have recently fallen by more than the wider market.”But homebuilder stocks took the news in their stride. PulteGroup was up 2.9 per cent to $2.85. Lennar fell 1.1 per cent to $14.31, although it remains in positive territory for the week after it revealed an increase in orders in quarterly results on Monday.
134;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2011-09-19T18:06:25Z;Investors bet miners will follow gold’s gains;;"Gold has risen 28 per cent to date this year – making it one of the best-performing investments. And yet the share price of Barrick Gold, the world’s largest producer of the precious metal, is trading only 40 cents higher than where it started the year.Barrick is not alone in its relative underperformance: the S&P/TSX index of global gold mining equities has underperformed the yellow metal by 33 percentage points in the past year – including dividends.This divergence between the share prices of miners and the gold price has opened up what is rapidly becoming one of the hottest trades among hedge funds and other asset managers. Increasing numbers are betting that the underperformance of the gold mining sector is unsustainable, making equities ripe for a rapid rally.“It’s something that everybody is thinking about at the moment,” Evy Hambro, manager of BlackRock’s Gold & General fund, one of the largest gold funds, tells FT.com in a video interview. “A lot of our clients are switching out of the gold ETF [exchange traded fund] into gold equities and gold equity funds to take advantage of the opportunity.”The disconnect between equities and bullion is a central point of debate at the gold industry’s two largest annual gatherings, both taking place this week – the London Bullion Market Association conference in Montreal, and the Denver Gold Forum. Mr Hambro’s views have been echoed by other large investors, analysts and mining executives.One argument why gold equities should rebound is historical. Gold mining stocks have enjoyed a strong correlation with the gold price in the past. The current disparity, by this reasoning, is the result of an indiscriminate sell-off across equity markets, and should soon reverse.“At some point it has to turn,” says Nick Holland, chief executive of Gold Fields, the fourth-largest gold miner. “We’re just at a strange point in the cycle.”“We’re confident the gap will close,” adds Mr Hambro: “It has always closed in the past. This is an abnormally long one and an abnormally large one.”However, there have been several structural shifts in the market that could explain the underperformance of the equities.Investors increasingly buy gold as a form of insurance against further economic turmoil. Mining companies – which can miss production targets, suffer strikes, accidents and higher taxes, or see their profits eroded by cost inflation – appear to offer less reliable protection against such a scenario.Instead, money has been pouring into ETFs. SPDR Gold Shares, the largest of these, now has $72bn invested in it.But despite helping to drive the gold rally, many believe ETFs, which were heavily promoted by the gold mining industry, have cannibalised demand for gold equities. Barrick’s shares are trading at less than 10 times next year’s consensus earnings – down from a ratio of more than 30 times only five years ago.“The guys who created the ETFs are now the losers,” says Peter Munk, chairman and founder of Barrick. “We are now selling at multiples equal to base metals. Today copper guys are laughing at me,” he adds wistfully.Another reason why equities could continue to underperform is the lack of growth prospects for the industry. While some companies, such as Goldcorp or Yamana Gold, are planning a substantial production increase, the industry as a whole struggles even to maintain production at current levels. Barrick’s acquisition in April of Equinox, a copper mining company, was seen by many as a tacit admission that there were no growth opportunities for the company in gold.Richard O’Brien, chief executive of Newmont, the second-largest gold miner, concedes that “we could see this kind of derating continue for a while”.For all that, however, many are still betting that the current disconnect between mining equities and bullion is unsustainable.For a start, gold miners are beginning to respond to their share-price underperformance. The most popular response is to raise dividends, offering investors one thing ETFs cannot: a yield.Newmont recently introduced a dividend structure that committed to raising the annual dividend by 20 cents for every $100 rise in the gold price; on Monday, it announced an additional 10 cent increase for every $100 above $2,000. Gold Resource Corporation, a small US-listed miner, said it might start paying dividends in physical gold.“The industry is conscious of needing to give shareholders more of a direct link to the gold price,” says Mr O’Brien of Newmont. “I think the dividend is the best way to do that.”Nonetheless, the dividend yield on global gold mining equities remains a puny 0.7 per cent, according to Bloomberg data. That compares to 3 per cent for the FTSE All World index.“To the extent that we can get dividends up to a meaningful level, that will end up being a distinguishing factor,” says Chuck Jeannes, chief executive of Goldcorp, the fifth-largest gold miner.If that were to fail to restore the historical balance, then the gold sector could be poised for a series of deals, analysts say.The equity markets are pricing in a gold price of about $1,400 an ounce, says Patrick Chidley, gold equities analyst at HSBC in New York. But there is a liquid market in gold forwards, meaning miners could guarantee a price above $1,800 an ounce for several years by hedging.“The obvious conclusion is that private equity will begin to get interested,” says Mr Chidley. “I’ve never seen these stocks this cheap and I don’t think the game is over. That’s what is being priced in at the moment.”"
135;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2011-09-12T21:21:04Z;China bond-buying hopes drive Wall Street up;;The S&P 500 ended the day in positive territory for only the second time this month after a late surge of buying on a Financial Times report that Italy is in talks with Chinese officials about a possible investment in its sovereign bonds.The benchmark index climbed 0.7 per cent to 1,162.27, snapping two days of losses.The index had been in negative territory for almost the entire day, falling a full percentage point in early trading. But news that the world’s second-largest economy might be riding to the rescue of a distressed European government triggered a strong rally, 30 minutes before the close of trading.Cautious analysts warned that the rally could be undone on Tuesday, once investors have time to reflect on Chinese involvement, which is unconfirmed.“Whatever the Chinese might or might not have done today, the hole in European sovereign financing is daunting and the potential for contagion is huge. Investors should keep very cautious,” said Channing Smith at Tulsa-based Capital Advisors.Banks were the main beneficiaries of the rally. The financial component of the S&P 500 had fallen hard in early trading, trading ominously near its year-low of 158.91, touched on August 23. But at the close, financials were up 1.2 per cent, second only to tech stocks.Regional banks performed particularly well, with PNC Financial Services up 3.8 per cent to $48.16 after presenting to investors at a Barclays Capital conference.Bank of America rallied 1 per cent to $7.05, outperforming its peers, as investors welcomed the downsizing plan unveiled by chief executive Brian Moynihan.But Morgan Stanley fell 1.5 per cent to $15.05.Bank stocks in the S&P 500, which continue to be dogged by fears of exposure to European peers and mortgage-related lawsuits, are still only up 5 per cent from their year-low last month.On Monday, Glenn Schorr, Nomura’s US banks analyst, tried to put a figure on the losses banks face from the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s litigation over the misselling of securities to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.“While the suits read badly, we took a bottom-up and security-by-security approach on over 700 securities covered in the suits …and believe that the loss recoupment number for the industry is more likely in the $9bn-$20bn range, versus the $25bn-$40bn estimates we have seen, with our bias more at the low end,” Mr Schorr said.“Given the significant costs to litigate these claims”, Mr Schorr also predicted the case is likely to end in a settlement, costing the banks about $10bn, rather than litigation.McGraw-Hill Companies shares rose 4 per cent to $40.26, as the company bowed to pressure from activist hedge fund investor Jana Partners, to split in two to maximise shareholder value.Semiconductor stocks also performed strongly. Micron Technology rose 5.3 per cent to $6.69, SanDisk Corp added 3.3 per cent to $40.02.The Philadelphia index of 30 semiconductor companies rose 3 per cent to 358.96. It has recovered nearly 10 per cent from its August year-low. The strong performance of a sector closely linked to prospects for global growth suggested some optimism among investors.In another sign of positive sentiment, shares in Newmont, the gold miner, were off 1.9 per cent at $64.07. Newmont shares are considered a bet on rising gold prices, so only tend to fall if the S&P 500 is rising on investor confidence.Freeport-McMoRan, the gold and copper miner, also fell 1.6 per cent to $41.31, as talks continued to avert a strike at its mines in Peru.Those two companies pushed material stocks down 0.8 per cent, the only sector in the S&P 500 to fall.Tenet Healthcare was the biggest faller in the S&P 500, down 10 per cent at $4.52, after the Dallas company warned earnings would be at the lower end of estimates. The company blamed growing admissions through Medicaid, the government’s health programme for low earners, which offers relatively low reimbursement.Johnson & Johnson, the healthcare product company, fell 0.1 per cent to $63.59 after failing to win clearance for wider use of Simponi, a two-year-old arthritis drug.Yahoo fell 1.5 per cent to $14.26, as sacked former chief executive Carol Bartz said she would leave the company’s board of directors .
136;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2011-09-08T21:14:22Z;Wall St retreats ahead of Obama speech;;"Yahoo shares rose 6.1 per cent to $14.44, despite a verbal broadside from sacked former chief executive Carol Bartz.Ms Bartz branded her former executive colleagues “doofuses”, but Yahoo investors were cheered when Third Point, an activist hedge fund, revealed it had taken a 5.2 per cent stake in the company. Third Point will push for the resignation of the board of directors and a clearer strategy, the fund said in filings.But the broad S&P 500 closed down 1.1 per cent at 1185.88, despite breaking through the 1,200 barrier earlier in the day, a level it has only touched on three other days since early August.Traders appeared to take advantage of Wednesday’s strong bounce – when the S&P 500 rose almost 3 per cent – to book profits ahead of President Obama’s speech to Congress on jobs on Thursday evening.“Our metrics still suggest risk is elevated and with no end in sight to European problems, our position is to sell into the strength of the market,” said Channing Smith, fund manager at Tulsa-based Capital Advisors.Semiconductor stocks surged, with Micron Technology, maker of Dram memory chips for personal computers, up 3.1 per cent at $6.25, extending its
gains for the week to almost 15 per cent.SanDisk rose 2.4 per cent to $38.52, and even embattled sector heavyweight Cisco was among the top gainers in the S&P 500, up 2.6 per cent at $16.29.Semiconductor stocks tend to be highly cyclical since demand for the components, which feature in everything from smartphones to solar panels and industrial machinery, is closely linked to global growth.But on Thursday the surge seemed to be driven by a positive earnings forecast by Nvidia on Wednesday.Analysts continued to warn of a potential fall in demand. JPMorgan lowered earnings estimates across the industry, citing “the tougher macro-environment” and “signs of weakness appear across the board”.Elsewhere, gold miner Newmont Mining rose 2.9 per cent to $65.66. Trading in the stock has soared in the past month as equity investors seek exposure to rising gold prices as a hedge against global growth.Newmont is now up 18 per cent since the start of August, while the S&P 500 index is off 8 per cent over the same period.But gold analysts point out this breaks with recent trading patterns in the stock. Until August, gold stocks had closely tracked stock market indices this year.“If you look at the betas of gold mining stocks against the S&P, they had become much more correlated with the index over the past five or six years,” says Alex Hacking at Citigroup.Mr Hacking said safe haven-seeking investors had triggered the more recent divergence between the stock and the broad index, but noted that gold mining stocks have underperformed gold itself.“Central banks and risk averse investors want physical gold, not a paper entitlement to the dividends of a gold mining company. Also whenever you get a spike in a metal price, the price-earnings ratios of associated mining stocks naturally come down. The market is distrustful of spikes in commodity prices, and is not willing to pay a high share price for earnings that might be temporary.”Filtration company Pall Corp, which fell 9.8 per cent to $44.03, was by far the biggest mover in the index.At 76 cents a share, Pall’s preliminary fourth-quarter results missed expectations, and Eric Krasnoff, chief executive, conceded they pointed to a “disappointing finish to an otherwise good year”.Urban Outfitters fell 1.2 per cent to $24.96 as RBC Capital and Citigroup lowered earnings per share estimates for the current quarter.Urban shares are now off 3.9 per cent for the week after the company used a scheduled update late on Tuesday to report that same-store sales were down as much as 3 per cent in the third quarter to date.Macroeconomic news was mixed with jobless claims rising unexpectedly by 2,000 to 414,000 in the week ended September 3 but the US trade deficit eased slightly in July as imports fell.Financial stocks in the S&P 500 were down 2.3 per cent, more than any other sector. Bank of America fell 3.7 per cent at $7.20 and Citigroup was off 3.5 per cent at $27.98.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1 per cent at 11,295.81 and the Nasdaq Composite index was off 0.8 per cent to 2,529.14."
137;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2011-09-07T18:21:42Z;No need for silly gold valuations;The soaring price of gold has given gold miners windfall profits;Being the world’s most successful share promoters, perhaps of all time, ought to come with rewards. But the creators of the SPDR Gold Trust, the miners behind the World Gold Council, are being left behind by their creation.There is no doubt that the exchange-traded fund was a brilliant invention for gold miners. It now holds 1,232 tonnes of the yellow metal, mined by its inventors and reburied in the vaults of HSBC in London. Its buried treasure is worth $71.6bn, and the Trust – known as GLD, its ticker – was briefly the world’s biggest ETF this summer.That value could be seen as a direct transfer from investors to gold miners, thanks to its role in making it easy to buy gold, attracting new investors and pushing up the price.Gold miners have much to be pleased about, with the soaring price of gold since GLD was created in 2004 giving them windfall profits. Their shares rose an annualised 13 per cent over the period.Despite all that, gold miners seem to have lost their shine. The HUI Gold Bugs index of miners stands at 15 times cash flow, way below the 20-30 times it used to trade at. Back in the early 1990s, when gold was deeply unfashionable with investors, bigger miners traded at 20-25 times cash flow.Peter Munk, chairman of Barrick Gold and one of the prime movers behind GLD, points out that large gold miners such as Barrick, the largest, and Newmont, the second biggest, always used to trade at a premium to base metals miners. No longer. “Today copper producers laugh at me,” he said on Wednesday.By making it easy to buy gold the miners removed a big reason for buying their shares.Institutional investors are often banned from buying physical gold, or do not want the hassle and cost of storing bullion. Those wanting the precious metal used to use mining shares as a proxy. Now they no longer need to, there is no reason for those shares to trade at silly valuations.
138;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2011-09-02T20:57:39Z;Mortgage mis-selling cloud hangs heavy over banks;;Weak employment data and reports that a government regulator would bring mortgage-related lawsuits against US-based banks, reversed what had been a week of strong gains on Wall Street.By Wednesday the S&P 500 index had recorded four successive days of gains for the first time since late June, and by Monday the index had closed above 1,200 for the first time since August 4. But at midday Friday it was down 1.7 per cent on the day.Traders said the sell-off was driven by the payrolls data, which showed the economy failed to add any jobs in August. But they said the decision by a government regulator to bring lawsuits against banks, would exacerbate problems.“[The bank lawsuits] kind of shocks me. Why would the administration, which has control over these things, let a regulator sue the banks, when it’s trying to create jobs?” said Randy Warren, fund manager at Warren Financial Service.“The banks have been leading markets lower for three years, and now we could go back to the lows at the start of August,” he added.The S&P 500 index was at 1,183.58, up only 0.5 per cent for the week, far beneath the week high of 1,230 on Wednesday. Financial stocks in the index were down 2.8 per cent Friday, and off 0.7 per cent for the week.The lawsuit to be bought by the Federal Housing and Finance Agency will accuse banks of mis-selling mortgage-backed securities.Richard Staite, US banks analyst at Atlantic Equities, said the biggest US players in mortgage securitisation up to 2008 were Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan.All three stocks fell on Friday. Bank of America, down 6.5 per cent on the day and 4.6 per cent lower for the week, was among the biggest fallers in the S&P 500.Goldman fell 4.6 per cent Friday to $106.96. The stock was down 4.3 per cent for the week and on course for its second day of big losses after the bank wrote down $53m of delinquent mortgage loans on Thursday as part of a deal over mortgage and foreclosure practices at its former subsidiary Litton Loan Servicing.JPMorgan shares were down 3.9 per cent at $34.90, a 3.6 per cent loss for the week. Regional banks, which originated many mortgages, but were less active in securitisation, fared slightly better. Regions Financial was down 2.2 per cent to $4.22 on Friday. But Citigroup, which Mr Staite said had not been active in securitising, was down 3.7 per cent on Friday and 3.2 per cent lower for the week at $28.90.“The lawsuit leaves huge uncertainty hanging over the whole sector,” Mr Staite said.“The fact that a regulator has filed a case may add credibility to private lawsuits that are already pending. And more suits could follow in the next year.”Mr Staite said bank stocks could remain volatile for some time, as investors have no real way of calculating either how much lawsuits will cost, or how able banks are to withstand losses.“There is no precedent for similar lawsuits, so investors don’t know how the courts will react. And banks have been reluctant to disclose the size of their legal reserves, because the people making claims might use the information to their advantage.”Netflix, the DVD and movie-streaming website, fell 9.3 per cent on Friday, down 4.9 per cent for the week at $211.70, after the cable network Starz broke off contract renewal talks over differences in pricing and packaging.“We believe Starz accounts for roughly 8 per cent of total NFLX viewing hours and the absence of the Starz content diminishes NFLX overall film content,” Credit Suisse analyst John Blackledge said.However he maintained his $310 target price and urged clients to buy while the share price was depressed.AT&T was down 2.9 per cent for the week at $28.19, after the government declared its intention to block the mobile network’s $39bn bid for smaller rival T Mobile, on competition grounds.Sprint, the third-largest network in the US, which would be dwarfed by both AT&T and Verizon, was the main beneficiary of the government’s move. Despite a 5 per cent fall Friday, Sprint shares were still up 9.2 per cent for the week at $3.55.Newmont Mining, was a top performer, up 2.7 per cent on Friday at $64.18. The stock was up 3.2 per cent for the week suggesting there was still plenty of appetite for counter-cyclical stocks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just 0.3 per cent for the week at 11,315.53, but the Nasdaq Composite index rose 1 per cent to 2,505.22.
139;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2011-08-12T20:54:54Z;US stocks end week on a high note;;US stocks ended an historically volatile week on a high note, paring their losses from Monday’s session, which saw the biggest one-day drop in share prices since 2008.In focus on Friday were retail groups, which gained initially on strong earnings and macroeconomic data. But those gains were cut when the University of Michigan consumer confidence index fell unexpectedly sharply, to its lowest in three decades.Nordstrom, which was up as much as 7 per cent at the opening bell, was up 4.6 per cent to $44.27 at midday on Friday. The high-end goods retailer topped earnings forecasts and brought its full-year profits projection back to where it began the year, after lowering it earlier. Polo Ralph Lauren, which reported strong earnings earlier this week, was up 5.5 per cent on Friday to $137.70.Kohl’s, the department store chain, also beat forecasts and opened higher, jumping 5 per cent. However, executives said they “weren’t happy” with their sales, and the stock ended just 0.1 per cent higher on Friday, at $47.54.It was reported on Friday that US headline retail sales rose 0.5 per cent in July, while June’s increase was revised from 0.1 per cent to 0.3 per cent, with notable improvements in electronics goods sales that do not simply reflect rising gas and food prices.“The consumer is at the centre of the weak economy debate,” said Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG. “Even a modestly better than expected number provides us with some level of relief.”By the closing bell on Friday, the S&P 500 was up 0.5 per cent to 1,178.80, with industrials and consumer groups advancing, but financials declining.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.1 per cent higher at 11,269.40, and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 0.6 per cent to 2,507.98.The S&P 500, despite extraordinary volatility– the index moved 50 points each session from Monday to Thursday for the first time – lost just 1.8 per cent this week, and the Dow just 1.6 per cent.That pales in comparison with last week’s S&P decline of more than 7 per cent, the market’s worst five days in two years. The index is down 6.3 per cent on the year.But buyers began to emerge as the week wore on. Factors in their favour included resistance to falling below 1,100 points on the S&P 500 index, as well as some timely and unexpected economic data, such as a fall in jobless claims.There were also tempting bargains such as Apple, which at one point fell into “correction” territory, down more than 10 per cent from the year’s peak price. Apple was up 0.9 per cent on the week to $376.99. The biggest gainer on the week, MEMC Electronic Materials, maker of solar panel wafers, was rebounding from its lowest price since the dotcom bust in 2002. It added 17.8 per cent to $6.53.Financial groups were the worst performers of the week, haunted by concerns ranging from a slowing economy to spillover effects from European bank troubles and the impact of near-zero yields on their deposits. The KBW Banks index fell 8.9 per cent on the week, adding to its 10 per cent decline the previous week.Bank of America, fell 12 per cent over the week, bouncing back somewhat from a 20 per cent drop on Monday. It was the worst performer in the Dow, however, and was trading at $7.19 on Friday – below the $8 level for the first time since early 2009.Citigroup fell 10.7 per cent on the week, to $29.85. Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase were among the better performers, with analysts citing them as potentially better able to weather the storm, falling 4.2 per cent and 4.5 per cent, respectively.Despite the rout, analysts continued to recommend that investors buy or hold their shares. “We struggle to find the source of another US banking crisis: liquidity is high, capital is high and changes in asset prices are more subdued,” said Brian Foran at Nomura.“The big risk, we believe, is re-rating for limited growth and low rates,” he added, terming it “the ‘Japan-isation’ of US banks.”Stocks that offered dividend yields higher than Treasuries did well on the week. Mortgage-buying real estate investment trusts, which return their cash flows directly to investors, were up for the week. Annaly Capital Management added 2 per cent to $17.88, and Capstead Mortgage rose 5.6 per cent to $12.90.Materials was the only sector to rise this week, up 0.2 per cent, amid expectations that it would benefit from higher commodity prices – which many believe the Fed’s low rates could bring. CF Industries, the fertiliser group, added 14.7 per cent to $168.20 on the week. Newmont Mining, the gold miner, added 5.6 per cent to $57.44.News Corp, the media group headed by Rupert Murdoch, jumped 10.6 per cent on the week to $16.23, after it promised share buy-backs and Mr Murdoch said he would remain in charge. Analysts at Citigroup recommended selling the stock, citing how much it had risen.
140;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2011-08-10T20:56:48Z;US stocks resume downturn;;US equities once again fell sharply on Wednesday, wiping out a late-Tuesday rally that many had hoped would represent a bottom to August’s steep declines.Financials continued to lead the move lower, dropping 7.1 per cent as a sector by the close. Citigroup fell 10.5 per cent to $28.49, and Bank of America fell 6.8 per cent to $6.77.The major indices ended the session at the day’s lows, with S&P 500 index falling 4.4 per cent to 1,120.75. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 4.6 per cent to 10,719.48, and the Nasdaq Composite index was off 4.1 per cent to 2,381.05.The chief executive of Bank of America, Brian Moynihan, sought to allay fears. On Wednesday he said the bank would seek to pay a dividend as soon as possible, and said it would not seek new equity capital.But the two largest US financial institutions, seen as highly sensitive to a US economic slowdown, only endured further volatility. Wednesday’s losses wiped out the brief rally in the shares on Tuesday, bringing them back near their lows seen after a 20 per cent correction on Monday.Leading financial declines on Wednesday were regional banks. Regions Financial fell 11.5 per cent to $4.23, and SunTrust slipped 11.5 per cent to $5.80. Wells Fargo, seen as one of the better-capitalised banks, still fell 7.7 per cent, to $22.88.Analysts at RBC Capital Markets recommended that investors should keep buying bank stocks. “It is important to remember that bank fundamentals are strong and we believe they are getting stronger,” they wrote.However, they also warned that regulatory uncertainty was weighing on the stocks. “The Federal Reserve needs to provide the [systemically important financial institution] buffers and a timetable to reach them,” they wrote.The troubles of large European banks weighed as well. France’s credit rating, much as the US’s was earlier this week, is feared to be vulnerable as European countries are all called to fund bail-outs to “peripheral” economies such as Greece.Glenn Schorr, analyst at Nomura, said: “Despite the low valuations, we believe macro concerns will probably keep buyers on the sidelines in the near term”.There were gains in the sector, however, unlike in previous sessions. Capital One, the consumer lender and credit card group, agreed to acquire the US card businesses of HSBC for $30bn, which follows its earlier $9bn deal to buy ING’s US deposit unit. It is now among the five largest consumer depositaries in the US. The shares rose 0.7 per cent to $41.05.“This is a strong acquisition for Capital One and complements the ING acquisition,” said analysts at Citigroup.AvalonBay Communications, the property management group, was up 0.1 per cent to $125.67, after it was named as a possible buyer of rival Archstone, still owned by the bankrupt Lehman Brothers estate.The market had initially slipped to new lows on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve announced it would hold rates near zero until 2013, but did not extend any additional liquidity programmes.After the S&P 500 dropped to just above 1,100, many traders stepped in to close shorts, believing that the Fed’s promise of liquidity could be a catalyst for gains. But the market quickly resumed its initial move at Wednesday’s open.“The Fed did not commit to a third round [of quantitative easing] yesterday. Some traders seeking a bottom may have inferred they were likely to do so, but they didn’t do that,” said Clark Yingst, chief market strategist at Joseph Gunnar.Mr Yingst said that energy groups and other commodity-linked companies would benefit the most if investors believed “QE3” of some form was imminent. “Hard assets will be what people are seeking if there is ultimately going to be a round three of easing,” he said.ExxonMobil, the crude oil giant, was down 4.4 per cent at $68.03 on Wednesday, and Freeport-McMoRan, the copper miner, was down 3.3 per cent at $43.55.Materials groups CF Industries, the fertiliser producer, and Newmont Mining, the gold producer, were among the market’s most resilient performers, as the sector outperformed, down 3.3 per cent. CF’s shares were off by 0.3 per cent at $149.59 and Newmont added 0.7 per cent to $55.81.Retailer Macy’s succumbed to the sell-off, dropping 3.6 per cent to $24.52, despite the department store chain raising its full-year earnings forecast from $2.45 to as much as $2.65 a share.Polo Ralph Lauren, the apparel designer, added 4.5 per cent to $125.28 after it topped analyst expectations by earning $1.90 for the quarter, versus forecasts of $1.47.Walt Disney fell 9.1 per cent to $31.54 as the entertainment and media group missed forecasts for its revenues this quarter. Sales totalled $1.62bn, versus $1.83bn that had been forecast.Analysts at Nomura lowered their price target from $45 to $42 a share. “The stock is likely to be range-bound unless the macro outlook brightens or earnings begin to beat expectations again,” they said.
141;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2011-08-08T20:22:58Z;Bank and energy stocks lead US declines;;US stocks took a steep dive on Monday as traders reacted late in the session to the US credit rating downgrade by Standard & Poor’s, with the benchmark S&P experiencing its biggest one-day fall since December 2008.The benchmark S&P 500 slumped 6.7 per cent to 1,119.68, its lowest level in 11 months, with banks on the index targeted by traders fearful of the perceived weakness of the US economy.The volume of shares traded was also high, as the verdict on the downgrade – which signalled a lack of confidence in the US economy – was handed down in dramatic fashion.It followed heavy losses in the previous week, the worst for US stocks in two years, as fears over the strength of the recovery came to the fore.Smaller company shares fared the worst on Monday as the Nasdaq Composite index sunk 6.9 per cent to 2,357.69. The Russell 2000 index of small and mid-cap groups dropped 7.9 per cent.The main indices had been bolstered briefly on Friday by indications that the European Central Bank would buy Italian and Spanish debt.That continued to shield stocks from a more precipitous fall early in the session before a late sell-off after Barack Obama, US president, made an afternoon speech on the credit downgrade that traders felt lacked conviction.Bank of America  was the biggest faller on the S&P 500, plummeting 20.1 per cent to $6.75 after American International Group filed a lawsuit against the bank for loses incurred on mortgage-backed securities.Citigroup also dropped 15.8 per cent to $28.16, while Genworth Financial sank 16.8 per cent to $5.64.Energy stocks again also saw steep declines, dropping 3.3 per cent in the opening minutes of trading as oil and gas prices fell. Stocks directly tied to the economy were also targeted in the sell-off.Alpha Natural Resources, the coal producer, continued its downward slide after second-quarter losses last week, slumping a further 18.5 per cent to $26.35.Valero Energy, the pertroleum company, was also down 11.6 per cent to $18.31, while US Steel lost 13.1 per cent to $28.84.Sunoco, another petroleum company that last week admitted it had just finished an “abysmal” quarter, fell a further 11.6 per cent to $30.08.But a new record for gold saw shares of Newmont Mining, a producer of the precious metal, lose just 0.5 per cent to $54.13 a share. Newmont shares were among the few to post gains last week, adding 0.2 per cent.Large-cap shares were not targeted as hard, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 5.6 per cent to 10,809.85.It was heavily weighed by the steep drop in shares of Bank of America, but strategists at UBS and Morgan Stanley recommended shifts into large-cap growth shares as a defensive move.Tyson Foods, the only S&P 500 company reporting earnings, was down 3.7 per cent at $15.71 despite the meat and poultry seller topped earnings expectations for the quarter, earning 46 cents a share versus forecasts of 39 cents.Dean Foods, which unlike Tyson primarily uses agricultural commodities as inputs, saw its shares drop 7.3 per cent to $8.40, among the worst performers in the S&P 500.Despite the day’s losses, strategists were broadly arguing that the rating agency’s downgrade was not a strong direct catalyst for share prices, which globally enjoyed their worst week since the 2008 financial crisis amid slowing economic growth in big economies and worries about European sovereign debt.“Today’s tape is going to look worse than it should,” said Nicholas Bohnsack, sector strategist at Strategas, a research firm. “Did S&P really tell us something we didn’t know?“Corporates are the new sovereigns with so much cash on their balance sheets. That kind of goes out the window for a day or two here as we sort out where Treasuries will be priced but I don’t think this will have an impact on companies.”Bruce Bittles, chief market strategist at Baird, suggested that there could be a case for a turnround, given that investor sentiment as measured by the American Association of Individual Investors showed a drop in the percentage of retail investors surveyed calling themselves “bears” – marking a bottom for the widely followed indicator.“The equity markets are extremely oversold and investor fear is beginning to creep in,” he said.However, he warned: “Until the momentum is interrupted by two sessions where upside volume overwhelms downside volume by a ratio of at least 10 to one, investors should be defensive.”Elsewhere, Priceline.com, the discount travel website, among the best market performers of the past two years, fell back after big jumps last week as its earnings and travel bookings came in ahead of expectations. Its stock dropped 4.3 per cent to $505.00.Sprint Nextel, the mobile phone company, extended its recent slump, falling 15.9 per cent to $3.13, in spite of announcing that it would launch its new 4G model, priced at less than $100, later this month.
142;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2011-08-01T09:03:32Z;Only two numbers matter for mining groups;Spot iron ore and copper prices will set the tone for reporting season;Investors in diversified mining companies can understand this month’s earnings season by keeping two numbers in mind: 175 and 9,800.Those are today’s spot prices of iron ore ($175 per tonne) and copper ($9,800 per tonne). Mining and selling these two commodities has become a licence to print money. Last week’s financial updates from Freeport-McMoRan, Anglo American, and Vale all attest to this, and they point the way for Xstrata, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton.The money is in the margin. It costs Rio and BHP – the second- and third-largest iron ore producers – between $30-$40 to produce one tonne of iron ore in their Pilbara mines in Australia. They are selling in to a market that is paying five times that amount on a spot basis. In the six months to June Freeport sold its copper at prices that were on average 4.5 times more than its production cost per pound.In the resurgent boom of the past year many industrial commodities have hit a hot streak of price appreciation. In some ways the gains from coking coal have been more impressive than iron ore or copper. But these two commodities – which show up in every new city and apartment high-rise in China – are driving the profits of the majors like never before.Iron ore and copper delivered $3.9bn in first-half operating profits at Anglo, or 65 per cent of the total, with iron ore leading the way.Looking ahead to Rio Tinto, iron ore and base metals (a division that includes copper) are forecast to generate around 85 per cent of the diversified miner’s earnings. JP Morgan forecasts operating profits of $7bn from iron ore alone, compared to an interim total of $10bn.Other analysts see copper contributing about half of Xstrata’s operating profits in the first half.These two commodities’ strength may reflect timing in the commodities cycle. Infrastructure-heavy commodities like iron ore have historically picked up faster than late-cycle commodities like platinum, which is used in cars, electronics, and jewellery. The first half of 2011 may be near the beginning of the post-crisis industrial cycle, pointing the way for these early risers to revert to normal prices by 2013 or so.But it is becoming more mainstream in past months to view these commodities as supercyclical– and capable of driving the miners’ earnings for years to come. For copper, the argument rests on a dearth of new mines, endemic worker strikes, and a mining base whose old-warhorse deposits are deteriorating rapidly in quality.On the iron ore side, a more controversial supercycle theory holds that a rash of project delays will combine with cooling-but-still-hot Chinese steel consumption to keep the price above $150 per tonne for many years to come. Wood Mackenzie, the commodities consultancy, lent credence to the theory this month by writing about the iron ore market: “We think a supply deficit is inevitable until at least 2015.”Vale, the world’s biggest iron ore miner, announced last week it would pay a $3bn extra dividend to cope with its windfall gains. This is much like Antofagasta and Freeport, which have paid special dividends this year from copper.Rio, BHP, Anglo, and Xstrata all have swing commodities, or divisions that differentiate them from the others and push their earnings one way or another. For Rio it is aluminium, for BHP it is oil and gas, for Anglo it is platinum, and for Xstrata ferrochrome. But it may be some time before any of these divisions seriously encroach on copper and iron ore (a commodity Xstrata does not produce).There is another metal that is doing extremely well, but for different reasons.To understand the bonanza enjoyed by Barrick, Newmont and AngloGold Ashanti, all investors have to do is remember one number: 1,600.
143;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2011-07-10T16:05:46Z;Polyus seeks to join the FTSE 100;;Polyus Gold, Russia’s largest gold miner, will seek to join London’s FTSE 100 as it angles to merge with top foreign peers and become one of the leading gold producers.German Pikhoya, Polyus’s chief executive, said the company was on track to acquire the City-listed Kazakhgold through a reverse takeover by July 25 and would use the London listing it acquired through the deal as a platform for yet another merger.“We are talking about establishing one of the biggest gold mining companies, which basically means we are [looking at merging with] big, big players,” he told the Financial Times in an interview.Polyus is the eighth-largest gold producer by market capitalisation, with the forthcoming takeover valuing Polyus at $13bn and Kazakhgold at $400m.Mikhail Prokhorov, one of Polyus’s billionaire shareholders, announced last month that the company hoped to merge with one of the industry top-10 players as soon the end of the year, with the new entity becoming the world’s second-biggest gold miner by valuation after Barrick Gold, with a market capitalisation of more than $40bn.While Vedomosti, the Russian business daily, has previously reported that Polyus was in discussions with the $31.6bn Newmont Mining Corp of the US, the $27.5bn Newcrest Mining of Australia and $17.5bn AngloGold Ashanti of South Africa, Polyus has declined to comment on any negotiations.The group’s reverse takeover with Kazakhgold will mark the end of Polyus’s year-long quest to obtain a premium listing in London.Mr Pikhoya noted that the listing was a key aspect to Polyus’s future success given that London was “a historic host for mining and gold mining companies” and offered access to a wide investor base.Yet the company’s flotation will comes as foreign mining groups face a tougher time in London following several corporate governance scandals, including the expulsion of two non-executive directors at Eurasian Natural Resources Corp by the Kazakh group’s three oligarch shareholders.Mr Pikhoya admitted that the fallout at ENRC presented “an extra challenge” for Polyus, which has faced its obstacles of its own.The company spent the past year in London’s High Court arguing with Kazakhgold’s former owners over the sale price, a feud that led the Kazakh government to put a nearly year-long freeze on the reverse takeover.Meanwhile, the listing comes at a strange time for Polyus’s management. Mr Pikhoya has been chief executive of Polyus for just over a week after Mr Prokhorov, chief executive since December, announced he would quit business and go into Russian politics.Mr Pikhoya stressed that Polyus’s conflict with the former shareholders was over and that the management was in the process of bringing Polyus closer to British corporate governance standards through appointing independent directors and making the switch from annual to quarterly reporting under International Financial Reporting Standards.Analysts said the improvements could make Polyus more appealing to a foreign partner, as could the group’s large reserves.Though relatively small compared with its top-10 peers, the company has the third-biggest reserves after Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining.
144;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2011-06-30T22:34:33Z;Oxus Gold halts trading on Aim;;Oxus Gold, the UK mining company focused on central Asia, has halted share trading on Aim amid an escalating dispute with Uzbekistan at its last remaining gold mine.Oxus suspended share trading on Wednesday after failing to publish 2010 financial results in line with the London junior market’s rules. The company said it had been prevented by the Uzbek authorities from obtaining the information necessary to complete the reports in time to meet Aim requirements.The dispute between Oxus and Uzbekistan revolves around the Amantaytau Goldfields joint venture in the Kyzylkum desert where some of the world’s biggest gold reserves are being developed.Under a deal struck in 2001, Oxus holds a 50 per cent stake in Amantaytau in a partnership with Uzbekistan’s state geology and mineral resources committee and Navoi Mining and Metals, the Uzbek state mining group.Oxus announced plans to sell its stake in Amantaytau to its Uzbek partners in February claiming that pressure from the authorities had made it impossible to continue the venture. Uzbekistan’s rejection of a proposal to draw CITIC, the Chinese investment group, into the project in a $189m equity and investment deal, derailed Oxus’ plans to expand into a new gold mine.Tensions escalated after Uzbekistan launched an exhaustive audit of Amantaytau and barred Oxus management from entering the mine. An Uzbek metallurgist employed by the venture has been imprisoned on charges of espionage.Oxus accused Uzbekistan of conducting the audit in bad faith and threatened to take the government to international arbitration unless it received a fair value for its share of the assets.For its part Uzbekistan accused Oxus of financial wrongdoing that had allegedly brought the gold project to the verge of bankruptcy. Oxus denied the allegations and said it was the victim of “creeping expropriation” in Uzbekistan.The case highlights the risks investors often face when operating in partnership with authoritarian governments in central Asia.Newmont, the US mining group, abandoned a gold mining project in Uzbekistan during a tax dispute in 2006 that saw the government seize some of the venture’s assets. The case was settled the following year when Newmont sold its stake in the project to Uzbekistan for $80m.Amantaytau is Oxus’ last remaining gold mine in central Asia where the UK company has been operating since the 1990s.Oxus lost control of a gold mine in Kyrgyzstan after falling out with the new government that took power after a popular uprising in 2005.Both Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan lie in the Tien Shan gold belt, one of the world’s best endowed gold and silver bearing regions.Oxus said it would resume share trading on Aim once it was in a position to publish its annual report and accounts for the year ended December 31 2010.
145;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2011-05-09T21:50:25Z;Wall St gains muted by eurozone debt fears;;Dollar Thrifty Automotive surged after Hertz Global offered to buy the car rental company, while the wider markets advanced after deal activity and a rise in commodities outweighed concerns over the financial health of the eurozone.Dollar Thrifty bounced 13.8 per cent to $79.27 after Hertz made a $2.2bn offer for its smaller rival.The offer is a 24 per cent premium over a rival offer made by Avis Budget last September, and is 17 per cent higher than the 60-day average share price.The move comes eight months after Hertz supposedly bowed out of a battle to buy Dollar Thrifty, saying it would not seek to match a higher offer by Avis. Shares in Hertz were down 1 per cent to $16.68 while Avis gained 0.3 per cent to $18.47.In other deal action, Alkermes said it would merge with a drug technology unit of Elan, the Irish drugmaker, in a cash and stock deal valued at $960m. Shares in Alkermes rose 5 per cent to $15.19.This assorted deal activity helped encourage sentiment across Wall Street, but the biggest gains came from the energy and material sectors as commodity prices rebounded.In the energy sector, Baker Hughes rose 3.4 per cent to $71.65 while Marathon Oil added 5.3 per cent to $52.19. The S&P energy index was up 1.6 per cent, paring some of the 7 per cent losses seen on the index last week.The S&P material sector was up 1.6 per cent, with US Steel adding 2.3 per cent to $46.67 and Newmont Mining rising 1.8 per cent to $54.69.This follows sharp losses for both of these sectors in the middle of last week as commodity prices fell sharply. On Thursday, oil prices fell more than $10 a barrel in the biggest one-day correction since the financial crisis, while other commodities such as silver and copper also lost ground.The gains in the session left the S&P 500 index up 0.5 per cent to 1,346.29. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4 per cent to 12,684.83 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.6 per cent to 2,843.25.The positive impact on Wall Street was limited by concerns over peripheral eurozone finances after Standard & Poor’s cut Greece’s credit rating again. It comes as European officials acknowledged that Greece’s €110bn ($157bn) rescue package a year ago was insufficient and further help would be needed.On Friday the US markets were sent lower after rumours that Greece was in talks to exit the single currency. “Lingering sovereign debt concerns” could cause “additional volatility as the week progresses”, said Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets.The downgrade news worried the financial sector, and the S&P financial index lost 0.2 per cent – the worst performing sector on Wall Street.Bank of America was down 1.1 per cent to $12.18 while Fifth Third Bancorp lost 1.5 per cent to $12.80.Elsewhere in the sector, Citigroup fell 2.3 per cent to $44.16 after putting into effect a one-for-10 reverse stock split. The move reduced the number of outstanding shares of Citigroup’s common stock from about 29bn to 2.9bn.Citigroup is the most actively traded stock in the US and the move helped bring about a relatively low-volume session.Elsewhere on Wall Street, homebuilding stocks were weighed down by worrying data showing that in the last few months US house prices suffered their largest drop in over two yearsAccording to figures from Zillow.com, the real estate website, home values fell 3 per cent in the first three months of 2011 from the previous quarter, and 1.1 per cent in March from the previous month. Prices have fallen for 57 consecutive months, according to Zillow.The news, a further sign that the US housing market is a long way from recovery, left shares in Lennar down 1.4 per cent to $18.28. Elsewhere in the homebuilding sector, DR Hortonwas 1 per cent lower at $11.81 while PulteGroupfell 2.1 per cent to $7.79.The S&P homebuilders index was down 1.5 per cent.

146;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2011-04-20T18:58:22Z;Gold pierces $1,500 to set fresh high;Traders expect price to continue rising;"The price of gold leapt to a record above $1,500 a troy ounce and silver soared past $45 as the huge debt burden of western countries burnished the appeal of the precious metals.Investors are focusing on fears of the debasement of paper currencies amid rising inflation from China to Europe and a warning by Standard & Poor’s that the US could lose its triple A credit rating.Matthew Turner, precious metals strategist at Mitsubishi, the Japanese trading house, said: “It’s about whether governments can wrestle back control of the economic situation.“At the moment gold is rising in dollars because people think the US is losing control.”As gold and silver powered ahead, the dollar on Wednesday tumbled to its lowest level in 16 months against an international basket of currencies, and was within reach of an all-time low.The mood of gold investors has reversed sharply since the start of this year, when upbeat expectations for the global economy induced many to take their profits.But since then the jump in oil prices, the turmoil in the Middle East and the earthquake in Japan has caused that confidence in the economy to fade. One senior precious metals banker said, “A lot of them sold a portion of their holdings in January; now they are coming back.”Investors’ holdings of gold via exchange-traded funds have risen by 1.38m ounces so far in April – the biggest gain for any month since August 2010.James Steel, precious metals analyst at HSBC in New York, said: “For the moment, the gold rally appears to have a charmed life. Whether sovereign risk concerns stem from the US or the EU, gold seems to be the beneficiary.”On the spot market, bullion rose 0.9 per cent on Wednesday to hit a fresh nominal high of $1,505.70 a troy ounce. Adjusted for inflation, however, it remains below the peak hit in 1980. Silver soared 3.4 per cent higher to $45.37 a troy ounce – the highest since the billionaire Hunt brothers notoriously cornered the market in 1980.The surge in the price of gold is delivering bumper returns to investors. Prominent hedge fund managers such as John Paulson, built large positions in the metal, in an explicit bet that governments and central banks could not preserve the value of paper currencies as they withdrew the extraordinary policies put in place during the financial crisis.The apparent political deadlock over the US government’s ballooning debt has knocked many Americans’ confidence in the dollar and driven them to hard assets.In Utah, the state government last month passed a bill making gold and silver coins legal tender, while the US Mint’s sales of silver coins have been running at record pace.Several traditionally conservative investment funds, including the Texas Teachers’ pension fund and the endowment fund of the University of Texas, have also invested a small portion of their assets in gold.Many expect its rally to continue – although analysts warn that a hawkish tone from Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman, next week could damp enthusiasm.However, gold’s ascent appears relatively modest when compared with its cheaper cousin, silver. The metal’s price has spiked 154 per cent over the past 12 months – compared with a 32 per cent rise for gold – leading many analysts and investors to call the market a bubble."
147;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2011-04-07T21:12:53Z;Wall Street dips on Japan quake news;;The industrial and technology sectors helped lead Wall Street lower after another earthquake hit the already devastated north-east coast of Japan.The industrial sector saw the sharpest falls. The S&P industrial index fell 0.5 per cent, led by General Electric, which was down 1 per cent to $20.35, and 3M, which fell 0.7 per cent to $93.19.General Electric, which helped supply the reactors to the stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, lost 6.9 per cent in the days following last month’s Japanese earthquake.“This is another setback for the markets, raising the level on the global uncertainty thermometer just another touch,” said Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Wealth Management.Technology stocks, which saw sharp losses after the previous earthquake due to supply worries, were hit by the news.JDS Uniphase lost 3 per cent to $18.99, while Cisco Systems fell 0.9 per cent to $17.91. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index fell 0.5 per cent.In the wider markets the S&P 500 index was down 0.2 per cent at 1,333.51, recovering from the much sharper losses earlier in the session after a tsunami warning was lifted in Japan and officials at the nuclear agency there said no further troubles had been reported following the earthquake.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 12,409.49 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.1 per cent to 2,796.14.Before the earthquake, the markets had been hovering in neutral territory as traders reacted warily to the decision by the European Central Bank to raise interest rates by 25 basis points to 1.25 per cent, a move that suggested the era of ultra-loose monetary policy was coming to an end.Helping to limit the losses of the session was strong US economic data. Figures from the labour department showed that new applications for unemployment benefits had dropped by 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 382,000 last week, in a further sign that the US labour market was continuing to improve.“The downward trend continues, as the pace of lay-offs by small businesses slows further,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.Elsewhere on Wall Street, retail stocks were in focus after a number of same-store sales figures from key industry leaders. Costco Wholesale, the discount retailer, reported that same-store sales were up 13 per cent in March, beating analysts’ expectations and sending the shares up 3.8 per cent to $77.82.Elsewhere, Limited Brands rose 1.6 per cent to $35.80 after the clothing retailer, which owns Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, reported same-store sales had climbed 1.4 per cent in March, beating the 1.1 per cent rise that was expected by analysts.Bed Bath & Beyond saw some of the strongest gains in the session, rising 10.5 per cent to $54.55 after the home furnishings retailer forecast annual earnings of $3.38 to $3.53 a share, more than the $3.33 expected by analysts.“The company delivered a high quality beat with better than anticipated sales,” said analysts at Citigroup.But the results from the retail sector were not all positive. Gap, the clothing retailer, reported same-store sales down 10 per cent, while Target reported sales down 5.5 per cent. Shares in Gap lost 1.5 per cent to $22.72 while Target was down 2.6 per cent to $49.62.Overall though, the results were better than expected and so the retail sector was up 0.4 per cent.In corporate news, Newmont Mining, the largest gold miner in the US by market capitalisation, was up 3.3 per cent to $58.29 after announcing plans to increase its annual gold production to approximately 7m ounces by 2017, a 35 per cent increase from current levels.The company also announced a new dividend policy that will link its quarterly dividend payment to its average realised price of gold sales. The price of gold has gone up 65 per cent in the past two years and is now trading around record highs near $1,450 a troy ounce.Among other companies in focus, Rite Aid put on 1.9 per cent to $1.08, reporting that its fiscal fourth quarter loss had narrowed slightly. Pier 1 Imports added 10.5 per cent to $11.65 after the home furnishings retailer reported fourth-quarter earnings of 48 cents a share, beating the average analyst estimate.
148;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2011-04-06T21:10:35Z;Tech stocks lift Wall Street higher;;Cisco Systems led the gains in the technology sector after a candid admission of management failures led to hopes of a turnround. But losses in the materials and energy sectors weighed on Wall Street, leaving the wider indices only slightly higher in the session.Shares in the internet equipment company were up 4.9 per cent to $18.07 after John Chambers, chief executive, made a rare admission of failure and signalled a shake-up to refocus Cisco on its most important markets.He said that the company’s strategy was “sound”, but added that they had been slow to make decisions and had “lost the accountability that has been a hallmark of our ability to execute consistently for our customers”.Cisco’s stock has fallen 27 per cent since the start of 2010 at a time when the Nasdaq Composite has risen by 23.4 per cent.Elsewhere in the technology sector, semiconductor stocks saw gains. These were led by Broadcom, the chipmaker, which added 3.9 per cent to $39.95 after Oppenheimer upgraded its rating on the stock from “perform” to “outperform”, citing the growth in wireless markets and networking.This helped related semiconductor stocks. Advanced Micro Devices was up 4 per cent to $8.43, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor index rose 1.5 per cent, adding to the 2.3 per cent gain in the previous session. Sentiment in the sector continued to be high following Texas Instruments’ agreed $6.5bn deal to acquire National Semiconductor.Overall, the S&P technology sector was up 0.7 per cent, the best performing S&P sub-index. The benchmark S&P 500 was only up 0.2 per cent at 1,335.54.In the energy sector, oilfield service stocks were the worst performing. Cameron International lost 2.5 per cent to $55.30 while Halliburton fell 2.6 per cent to $48.41. The S&P energy sector was 0.9 per cent softer.In the materials sector, it was coal miners that suffered the most as investor confidence in global demand took a turn. Massey Energy fell 3.5 per cent to $67.59 while Peabody Energy declined 3.7 per cent to $69.56.The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite were up 0.3 per cent to 12,427.13 and 2,799.82 respectively.The S&P 500 index has now added 6.2 per cent this year boosted by a sense that the fundamentals of the US economy are improving. “Macro outlook in the US is slightly more positive compared to the past few quarters. Economic sentiment in Europe remains choppy, but trends appear to be stabilising,” said analysts at Citi Investment Research.Technical analysts at JPMorgan Securities argued that in the short term the S&P was likely to see highs of 1,344, while in the second quarter the index was likely to trade between 1,353 and 1,367.Over the year the S&P 500 would face a ceiling of between 1,420 and 1,440, they argued, suggesting the S&P could still rise a further 7.8 per cent this year at its peak, on top of the 6.2 per cent added already.In corporate news, shares in Monsanto lost ground after the world’s largest seed company by revenues reported disappointing revenues, sending the shares down 5.7 per cent to $69.16. But the company also beat estimates for its earnings per share and confirmed guidance for the year.American Superconductor tumbled 41.6 per cent to $14.47 after the maker of wind turbine components and transmission lines said it expected to report a loss for the fiscal fourth quarter after Sinovel Wind Group refused to accept shipments.Cephalon was down 0.5 per cent to $77.02 after the drugmaker rejected the $5.7bn bid offer from Valeant Pharmaceuticals, saying that the offer undervalued the company.Dish Network, the satellite television provider, was fractionally higher at $24.32 after it won an auction to buy the bankrupt Blockbuster film rental chain for $320m. Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy protection in September with debt of more than $1.4bn and assets of $1bn.Transatlantic Holdings added 2.8 per cent to $50.60 after the reinsurer formerly owned by American International Group said that its first-quarter catastrophes cost was $355m, including about $240m from last month’s Japanese earthquake and tsunami.Optical networking stocks saw gains. JDS Uniphase added 2.3 per cent to $19.58 while Oclaro rose 7.6 per cent to $11.72.

Shares were down 1.4 per cent to $13.68.Last Friday, financial stocks on Wall Street were given a boost following a decision by the Fed to relax the rules on banks returning cash to their shareholders. But this news left the S&P financial index down 0.7 per cent, the worst performing sector of the session.JPMorgan Chase, which itself announced a dividend last Friday, was down 1 per cent to $45.01. Elsewhere, Zions Bancorporation fell 1.2 per cent to $23.11, while Regions Financial lost 1.8 per cent to $7.17. Goldman Sachs was 1.3 per cent lower to $158.65.In the wider markets, the S&P 500 was down 0.4 per cent to 1,289.25, adding to the 0.4 per cent loss in the previous session, as oil prices ticked up and traders continued to try and assess the impact of the conflict in Libya and the fallout from the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan.Adobe Systems, the software developer, was down 3.2 per cent to $31.83 after lowering its second-quarter revenue forecast due to the Japanese earthquake.Japan is Adobe’s second-biggest market after the US and accounts for between 10 to 15 per cent of revenue each quarter. The company also reported an 85 per cent rise in fiscal first-quarter profit.The S&P technology sector was down 0.3 per cent with semiconductor stocks losing ground in spite of assurances from analysts that the supply chain disruptions from the Japanese disaster would not sprawl.“We believe the Japan earthquake will result in only a temporary disruption to the semiconductor supply chain and stock prices,” analysts at JPMorgan said. “As a result, we maintain our constructive stance on semiconductors,” the note continued.Investors remained nervous and Applied Materials lost 1.2 per cent to $14.93, while Rubicon Technology fell 2.8 per cent to $25.80. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index fell 0.6 per cent, down 1.7 per cent overall since the natural disaster in Japan.Elsewhere in the technology sector Jabil Circuit, the world’s third-largest electronics manufacturing services company, was up 8.6 per cent to $20.58 after giving a third-quarter earnings forecast that exceeded analysts’ expectations.

But the wider markets endured another day of losses due to the ever-growing turmoil in north Africa and the Middle East.Howard Schultz, Starbucks CEO, said he expected the coffee chain to make “a number of acquisitions” as part of its expansion into the single-cup, home-brewing market.“We are building and investing in resources and people to build a significant consumer products business that over time will rival the size and scale of our retail company,” Mr Schultz told the Wall Street Journal.Morgan Stanley also upgraded the coffee chain to “overweight” from “equal weight” with a $40 price target, saying it was optimistic about the company’s plans to enter the “rapidly growing $3bn global single-serve coffee market”. Shares in Starbucks were up 1.5 per cent to $33.60, one of the biggest gains on the S&P 500.Elsewhere in the sector, McDonald’s was up 0.3 per cent to $76.29. The S&P restaurant and bar index was up 0.4 per cent, one of the few sectors to rise in the session.The S&P 500 closed down 0.8 per cent to 1,310.13, adding to the 0.7 per cent loss in the previous session, as Libya lurched further towards civil war, causing oil and gold prices to spike higher for another day.The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.7 per cent to 12,090.03 while the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.4 per cent to 2,745.63 in the sessionThe S&P 500 index is now off 2.5 per cent from its mid-February high on fears that sustained high oil prices will hamper economic growth. “The recent surge in oil prices poses a threat to the US expansion,” said analysts at Morgan Stanley in a report.These fears over the economic recovery hit the materials sector particularly hard. Freeport-McMoRan, the world’s largest copper miner by market capitalisation, was down 3 per cent to $50.14 while Cliff Natural Resources was down 3.4 per cent to $95.77. The S&P materials index was 1.8 per cent lower, the worst performing sector in the session.Industrial stocks also saw sharp losses for the same reasons. Boeing, the aerospace and defence company, was 1.3 per cent lower to $70.88 while Joy Global, which manufactures mining equipment, fell 2.9 per cent to $93.82. The S&P industrial index was down 0.8 per cent.The Vix volatility index, a measure of fear in the marketplace, was up 8.1 per cent. The index is now up 31.4 per cent since its mid-February lows before the markets began reacting strongly to the global political tensions.Semiconductor stocks were some of the worse performing after Wells Fargo cut its view of the sector to “market weight” from “overweight” for the first time in more than two yearsThis left the Philadelphia Semiconductor index down 3.1 per cent as Micron Technology fell 5.2 per cent to $11.03 and Nvidia lost 1.4 per cent to $20.47.The technology sector was down 1.2 per cent despite deal activity elsewhere in the sector.

Unemployment claims fell to their lowest level since May 2008 last week, declining by 20,000 from the previous week to 368,000. The less volatile four-week
moving average was down 13,000, to 388,000 claims.“The underlying downtrend in initial jobless claims is undeniable and provides strong evidence that the labour market recovery is for real,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.The data bodes well for the official non-farm payroll figures which come out on Friday. Economists are expecting that about 192,000 jobs will have been created in February, well ahead of the 36,000 created in the previous month.Separate data from the Institute for Supply Management showed strong growth in activity in the US service sector. The ISM non-manufacturing index was up to 59.7 from 59.4 theprevious month, which was the highest reading since August 2005. A reading over 50 indicates expansion.Shares in News Corp rose after it was given permission by the British government to buy the rest of the British Sky Broadcasting Group.Jeremy Hunt, UK culture secretary, said he was minded to wave through News Corp’s £8.3bn proposed bid for the 61 per cent of BSkyB that it does not already own, on the condition that it spins off Sky News as a separate listed company.The deal will go to a short consultation period but, as it stands, News Corp will avoid a lengthy referral to the Competition Commission and negotiations on a final price for BSkyB will begin. Shares in News Corp were up 1.6 per cent to $17.64.That helped lift the media sector, which was up 2.2 per cent in the session. CBSrose 2 per cent to $24.35 while Time Warner added 1.8 per cent to $37.92.A wide range of sectors benefited from the upturn in sentiment on Wall Street and across the world.In the materials sector, Alcoa, the world’s largest aluminium producer, was up 2.8 per cent to $16.63 while Peabody Energy was up 5.1 per cent to $69.32.The S&P materials index was up 2 per cent with only the gold producers in the sector losing ground as the precious metal fell back from recent highs – Newmont Mining was 2.1 per cent lower at $53.60.The industrial sector saw strong gains as risk appetite picked up.General Electric rose
2.1 per cent to $20.75, one of the strongest gainers on the Dow, while 3M was 1.6 per cent higher at $92.81.In the technology sector, Apple was up 2.1 per cent to $359.56 following the unveiling of its new iPad 2 in the previous session.Elsewhere, Oracle, the IT group, was up 2.8 per cent to $33.03 while Dell added 1.9 per cent to $15.73.

The Fed chairman said sustained higher oil prices “would represent a threat both to economic growth and to overall price stability, particularly if they were to cause inflation expectations to become less well anchored”.He also gave no indication of any further measures to stimulate the economy, which some traders had been hoping for.Any positive sentiment was further dashed as oil prices spiked higher on concerns that the unrest sweeping across north Africa and the Middle East might spread to Saudi Arabia.In the first three trading sessions of last week, the S&P fell 2.8 per cent on similar concerns. These worries damped risk appetite in the US and around the world, causing material stocks to dive lower.Titanium Metals was down 6.2 per cent to $17.82 while AK Steel was 4.7 per cent lower at $15.23. The S&P materials sector was down 2.3 per cent.Consumer services stocks were also depressed by the higher oil price and comments by Mr Bernanke.Carnival, the world’s largest cruise ship operator, was down 6.1 per cent to $40.08 while Priceline.com, the online travel company, lost 1.9 per cent to $445.29.But promising economic data helped limit the losses on Wall Street.Figures from the Institute for Supply Management showed that the US manufacturing sector had seen strong growth in February.The index rose from 60.8 in January to 61, which is the highest reading since 2004. A number over 50 on the index indicates that the sector is growing.In earnings news, AutoZone, a retailer of car parts, reported earnings up 20 per cent and same-store sales up by 7.1 per cent. The stock added 2.2 per cent to $263.52.But that failed to lift related stocks. O’Reilly Automotive was down 0.8 per cent to $55.15 while Advance Auto Parts was 0.1 per cent lower at $62.63.There were some signs that the tide might be turning for car part retailers, which have profited since the financial crisis on people’s reluctance to buy new cars.General Motors reported that its sales had jumped 46 per cent in February from the same period a year ago due, primarily to a rise in demand from retail customers.The Buick and Cadillac car brands reported sales up by 73 per cent and 70 per cent, respectively.GM shares were down 1.7 per cent to $32.95, however, as the sales figures failed to impress investors.Separately, Ford reported that its sales had risen 14 per cent. Its stock was 2.6 per cent lower at $14.66.Elsewhere, Las Vegas Sands, the casino resort company, fell 6.3 per cent to $43.70 after reporting that it was being investigated by the SEC and the Department of Justice over its compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.Lorillard, which primarily makes menthol cigarettes, was up 1.6 per cent to $78.98 after the US Food and Drugs Agency said evidence was “insufficient” that smoking menthol cigarettes is riskier than normal cigarettes.Tower Group, the insurance provider, was down 12.6 per cent to $23.76 after its 2011 earnings view fell short of analyst estimates.Sonus Networks was up 33.3 per cent to $4.16 after the internet telecoms company reported fourth-quarter profit up 11 per cent and issued a revenue guidance that surpassed expectations.
153;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2011-02-17T22:45:05Z;Manufacturing data lift Wall Street;;Cliffs Natural Resources jumped on strong quarterly earnings while the wider markets edged to new 30-month highs as blockbuster manufacturing data outweighed disappointing employment numbers.The iron and coal miner’s record fourth-quarter earnings exceeded expectations, sending the shares up 7.2 per cent to $100.55. The company reported net income of $384.4m, or $2.82 per share, ahead of the $2.18 Wall Street expected.That lifted the iron and steel sector by 2.6 per cent, with Allegheny Technology, the speciality metal manufacturer, adding 1 per cent to $69.16.Indices fell in early trading after employment data showed that the number of people claiming unemployment benefits had risen by 25,000 to 410,000 in the second week of February – economists had expected the total claims to come in at 400,000.Data also showed that consumer price inflation had risen more than expected in January. Headline CPI was up 0.4 per cent while core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 0.2 per cent.But losses on the S&P 500 were pared later in the session after data from the Philadelphia Fed showing that US manufacturing had risen strongly in February, surging unexpectedly from 19.3 in January to 35.9 in February.“The Philly Fed number was extraordinary,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors. “It just blew away expectations.”That helped the S&P 500 to close up 0.3 per cent to 1,340.43, a fresh 2½-year high. In the previous session the index reached the point where it had doubled from its March 2009 low.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent higher to 12,318.14 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2 per cent to 2,831.58.The industrial sector saw healthy gains after the release of the manufacturing figures.Masco, the US building products group, was up 3 per cent to $13.20 while the S&P construction and materials index added 1.3 per cent.The data managed to outweigh concerns over global political instability as unrest continued to spread throughout the Middle East, lifting oil and gold prices.The turmoil did help certain sectors and stocks, however. The oilfield service sector gained from the higher oil prices, rising 1.7 per cent with Noble up 3.5 per cent to $41.33 and Halliburton adding 2 per cent to $48.43.Newmont Mining, the gold miner, was up 1.7 per cent to $58.96 as gold prices spiked up.In earnings news, CBS said net profit had risen 78 per cent to $319.4m in the fourth quarter.Earnings for the media group were boosted by local advertising revenue as television, radio and billboards proved popular with advertisers rebounding from the recession. This lifted the stock up 1.1 per cent to $22.35.Williams, the energy group and gas pipeline operator, added 8.4 per cent to $30.08 after announcing that it planned to separate its exploration and production businesses into two independent, publicly traded groups. The company also said it would boost its quarterly dividend by 60 per cent to 20 cents a share for the first quarter of 2011.That helped lift El Paso, another pipeline owner, by 3.9 per cent to $18. The stock was also helped by news that Raymond James Financial had raised its rating on the stock from “market perform” to “outperform”. The S&P pipeline index was up 6.4 per cent.Elsewhere in the energy sector, Duke Energy said fourth-quarter profit had risen 23 per cent, boosted by asset sales, sending its shares up 2.4 per cent to $18.12.

154;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-24T23:05:53+0000;Motorola split marked with S&P’s biggest rise;;"Newly formed Motorola Mobility soared while the S&P 500 edged lower, dragged down by falling commodity prices.In the first day of trading after Motorola was split in two, both the handset-focused Motorola Mobility and Motorola Solutions, which makes networking systems, rallied.Mobility jumped 9.5 per cent to $33.12, which was the biggest gain on the
S&P 500.Kulbinder Garcha, an analyst at Credit Suisse, gave the stock an “outperform” rating, saying that he expected smartphones to lead a recovery and the launch of Mobility’s first tablet device in early 2011 to add to earnings per share. He also said the company’s excess cash should not be ignored.But Ron Hall, an analyst at JPMorgan, rated Mobility “underweight”, citing concerns about smartphone and tablet competition, especially as Verizon starts to offer the iPhone. “We estimate that over 50 per cent of Motorola Mobility’s smartphone units sales could come from Verizon,” he said.“We believe the loss of around 4m smartphone units in 2011 would decrease our earnings per share forecast by around 55 per cent and that a larger share loss is possible given the continuing dominant position of Apple’s iPhone in the market.“In a worst-case scenario, we believe Verizon share loss could cause Motorola Mobility to fail to break even for full year 2011,”
he said.Mobility’s rivals edged higher with shares in Apple, which hit another all-time high on Monday, gaining 0.5 per cent to $331.21. US-listed shares in Research in Motion nudged up 0.3 per cent to $59.10.Analysts at JPMorgan were more positive about the prospects for Motorola Systems, initiating coverage with a “neutral” rating and a $38 price target.They said that, while the company’s enterprise assets were growing fast, investors should be more cautious about the government
division, where demand could be hit by tightening budgets.Shares in Motorola Solutions spent much of the session edging just slightly higher before a last-minute spurt to gain 6.6 per cent to $39.77 by the closing bell.The wider markets were mixed after Monday’s rally. The S&P 500 closed down 0.1 per cent to 1,270.18, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.2 per cent up at 11,691.18 while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.4 per cent to close at 2,681.25.Energy stocks lost steam as oil fell back below $90. The S&P 500 energy index led the fallers, down 0.6 per cent with Halliburton losing 2.9 per cent to $39.55.The S&P 500 materials index was also lower, losing 0.5 per cent, as commodity prices fell on Tuesday. Precious metals miners suffered particularly as silver and gold sold off.Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold gave up 0.7 per cent to $118.75 while Newmont Mining declined by 3.3 per cent to $59.08.But there were some bright spots in materials. Alcoa, the aluminium producer that rose on Monday after positive analyst comments, advanced further after it was chosen as 2011’s “top stock” by CNBC’s Jim Cramer, who said it could reach $22. Shares in Alcoa gained 4.6 per cent to $16.52.Elsewhere in materials, Molycorp rallied 7.3 per cent to $61.69 after the owner of the world’s largest rare earth deposit outside China said it might double planned production.Rare earth stocks have risen in recent weeks after China cut its export quotas for the elements used in technical devices.Molycorp has soared 26.8 per cent in the past five days with rival Rare Element Resources rocketing 68.9 per cent over the week.General Motors also benefited from increased demand in China with car sales to the country jumping 28.8 per cent in 2010. Its shares added 2.3 per cent to $37.90. Monthly car sales numbers showed that General Motors also expanded in the US in December with car sales rising by 7.5 per cent. Rival Ford put on 0.8 per cent to $17.38.In deals news, Atheros Communications soared 18.85 per cent in late trading to $44 after it was reported that Qualcomm could be interested in making a bid for the semiconductor manufacturer. The deal would be worth about $3.5bn or $45 per share, about a 22 per cent premium to the share price before the report.If it goes ahead, the acquisition would be Qualcomm's largest ever and the latest in a series of deals in the technology sector.Investors were unsurprised by the minutes from the December meeting of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee, and shrugged off a larger than expected rise
in US factory orders for November."

Zions Bancorp added 1 per cent to $21.29 and Regions Financial rose 0.3 per cent to $6.08.Deals were also in focus. Amazon.com edged lower by 0.5 per cent to $175.68 after it invested $175m in LivingSocial.com, a daily coupon website.There has been increased interest in the surging popularity of discount websites and it was reported earlier in the week that Google was interested in buying the daily discount website Groupon for $5bn-$6bn. Shares in Google nudged up 0.2 per cent to $573.There were two more deals in the energy sector.Chevron edged up 0.5 per cent to $84.89 after it sold an 18 per cent stake in its deepwater Indonesian gasfields to Chinese group Sinopec for $680m.Chevron owned 80 per cent of the project with Italian company Eni and Indonesia’s state-owned oil and gas company Pertamina holding the rest.Walter Energy sealed a $3.25bn deal for Canadian Western Coal in an acquisition that will create a leading metallurgical coal producer.

156;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2010-12-02T18:45:48Z;China’s gold imports surge fivefold;;Gold imports into China have soared this year, turning the country, already the largest bullion miner, into a major overseas buyer for the first time in recent memory.The surge, which comes as Chinese investors look for insurance against rising inflation and currency appreciation, puts Beijing on track to overtake India as the world’s largest consumer of gold and a significant force in global gold prices.The size of the imports – more than 209 tonnes of gold during the first 10 months of the year, a fivefold increase from an estimate of 45 tonnes last year – was revealed on Thursday. In the past, China has kept the volume secret.“Investment is really driving demand for gold,” said Cai Minggang, at the Beijing Precious Metals Exchange. “People don’t have any better investment options. Look at the stock market, or the property market – you could make huge losses there.”Beijing has encouraged retail consumption, with an announcement in August of measures to promote and regulate the local gold market, including expanding the number of banks allowed to import bullion.Shen Xiangrong, chairman of the Shanghai Gold Exchange, who disclosed the import numbers, said uncertainties about the Chinese and global economies, and inflationary expectations, had “made gold, as a hedging tool, very popular”.The rise in Chinese demand could further inflate gold prices. Bullion hit a nominal all-time high of $1,424.10 a troy ounce last month. But adjusted for inflation, prices are far from the 1980 peak of $2,300.“The trend is undeniable – gold demand in China is rising rapidly,” said Walter de Wet, of Standard Bank in London. China surpassed South Africa three years ago as the world’s largest producer.The surge in gold imports to China bodes well for some of the world’s biggest hedge fund managers, including David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital and John Paulson of Paulson & Co, who have invested heavily in bullion, and top miners Barrick Gold of Canada, US-based Newmont Mining and AngloGold Ashanti of South Africa.The market upswing has prompted an increase in gold scams in Hong Kong, according to industry executives. The counterfeits have shocked the Chinese’ territory’s gold community not because of the amounts involved – between 200 and 2,000 ounces – but because of their sophistication.In one case, executives discovered a coating advertised as pure gold that masked a complex alloy which included rare metals such as osmium, iridium, ruthenium and rhodium.Chinese total gold demand rose last year to nearly 450 tonnes, up from about 200 tonnes a decade ago, according to the World Gold Council, the lobby group of the mining industry. Analysts anticipate a further leap this year, putting the country whiting striking distance of India’s total gold demand of 612 tonnes in 2009.Additional reporting by Javier Blas and Jack Farchy in London

The chipmaker forecast higher sales for the current quarter and said its mobile business will grow significantly in the next year, when tablets and smartphones will use its Tegra chips.“Our Tegra business should be quite large – it’ll be one of our largest businesses over time,” said Jen-hsun Huang, chief executive, who added that it would also increase the company’s gross margins.But the wider technology index continued to fall, down 1.4 per cent.Technology stocks suffered on Thursday after Cisco issued a downbeat outlook, saying that a decline in government spending, especially in US states and in Europe, was hitting sales.Walt Disney shares bounced back after falling when the company accidentally released its quarterly results late in Thursday’s session rather than after the closing bell.The earnings disappointed some investors as income from pay-TV services for ESPN, which last year was recorded in the fourth quarter, came in an earlier quarter this year.But Disney was optimistic, forecasting rising advertising sales, pricing and theme park attendance, which sent shares up 5.1 per cent to $37.75.“While the fourth quarter of 2010 was hard to dissect at best and messy at worst . . . forward trends are robust,” said analysts at RBC Capital Markets, who slightly raised their price target for the company.In retail, JC Penney fell 3.4 per cent to $31.13 after it beat expectations with its quarterly profit, but sales were hit by discounting and the chain’s decision to wind down its “Big Book” catalogue business.In contrast, shares in smaller rival Dillards jumped 9.7 per cent to $30.82 after it reported same-store sales rose 1 per cent in its third quarter.Elsewhere in the consumer discretionary sector, DR Horton, the housebuilder, reported a narrower quarterly loss than expected but said demand was soft after the homebuyer tax credit expired at the end of April. Its shares fell 5.4 per cent to $11.51."

159;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2010-10-05T20:47:21Z;US stocks rally on Bank of Japan’s QE policy;;US equities jumped to their highest since mid-May after the Bank of Japan unveiled plans to ease monetary policy and better-than-expected data on the US services sector sparked hopes of a speedier global economic recovery.The S&P 500 closed up 2.1 per cent to 1,160.73, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 1.8 per cent to close at 10,944.72 and the Nasdaq Composite was 2.4 per cent higher at 2,399.83.All 10 main sectors of the S&P 500 rallied more than 1 per cent with six soaring more than 2 per cent, led by the materials and industrials indices.The Bank of Japan said that it was considering creating a Y5,000bn ($59.7bn) fund to buy assets to increase liquidity in the financial system, and lowered its interest rate.Some investors hoped this might open the door for the Federal Reserve to extend its own programme of quantitative easing.Shares rose further after a report showed the US services sector was re-bounding faster than ex-pected.But the positive data made Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA, question whether the Fed would be prepared to intervene.“Both the headline and the details of the non-manufacturing Institute of Supply Management index came in better than expected and as a result the pressure on the Fed to execute QE2 [a second round of quantitative easing] has been reduced,” he said.“QE2 is very data dependant because the way to convince the dissenters is for the data to come in weaker than expected.”The index rose to 53.2 in September, compared with the average economist forecast of 52.Materials and industrials sectors were lifted by hopes for a faster economic recovery.The S&P 500 materials index led the risers, advancing 2.8 per cent with Dow Chemical adding 3.6 per cent to $28.47, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold gaining 4.5 per cent to $91.18 and Newmont Mining rising 1.5 per cent to $63.67.The industrials sector was up 2.7 per cent with Caterpillar climbing 2.8 per cent to $79.40 and Cummins rising 2.8 per cent to $92.24.In energy stocks, Chevron rose 2.6 per cent to $83.39 after the oil company said it plans to resume its share buy-back programme this quarter, repurchasing up to $1bn of stock.Financials also rose, up 2.4 per cent, after analysts at JPMorgan Chase said banks were likely to beat the third quarter profit estimates, even though many other analysts have recently raised concerns about their earnings.Bank of America jumped 3.1 per cent to $13.56, Citigroup gained 2.5 per cent to $4.13 and JPMorgan Chase added 1.8 per cent to $39.64.Information technology stocks added 1.9 per cent with PC maker Dell rising 3.9 per cent to $13.40 after Steve Schuckenbrock, the head of its large enterprise business, said it was seeing good demand for new personal computers in offices.Texas Instruments soared 4.1 per cent to $28.33, Google jumped 3 per cent to $538.23 and Apple rose 3.7 per cent to $288.94.Although the earnings season officially kicks off with Alcoa’s results on Thursday, some companies were already updating the market on their performance in the last quarter.Fertiliser maker Mosaic missed expectations with its first-quarter earnings in spite of tripling profits as sales of its products surged 50 per cent. Earnings were 67 cents per share, compared with the average estimate of 71 cents. But the shares still rose 3.4 per cent to $60.80.Talbots, the women’s clothing chain, sunk 14.6 per cent to $10.71 after it forecast third-quarter sales would fall. It had previously predicted a rise in sales in the third quarter, but now sees a decline, because the number of customers passing through the doors has been “inconsistent”.The company predicts earnings per share for the quarter of between 22 and 28 cents compared with the average estimate of 27 cents. But for the full year, the retailer still sees a 1 per cent rise in sales and earnings per share of between 84 and 92 cents.MaxLinear also lowered its third-quarter sales forecast to no more than $18.6m, when the average estimate was $20.3m.Shares plummeted 11.7 per cent to $10.03.
160;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2010-09-28T17:33:16Z;Gold forecast to hit $1,450 an ounce;;The price of gold will rise to a record of $1,450 a troy ounce in the next year, driven by a loss of faith in central banks’ ability to prop up the global economy, according to a closely-watched annual poll of the precious metals industry.The prediction was made by bankers, producers and analysts attending the London Bullion Market Association conference in Berlin – the biggest gathering of the gold industry. If correct, it would mean an increase of nearly 11 per cent on Tuesday’s record price of $1,307.70 an ounce, triggering big profits for the world’s largest gold miners, such as Barrick Gold, Newmont Mining and AngloGold Ashanti. The LBMA poll has proven an accurate – even conservative – forecast over the past few years even if the presence of miners and bullion investors skews the poll.“It’s very hard to be pessimistic [about the gold price] in the short term – at worst you’re neutral,” Kevin Crisp, chairman of the LBMA, told the Financial Times.The comments by Mr Crisp, who is also head of precious metals at Mitsubishi, the Japanese trading house, summarised a re-soundingly bullish atmosphere at the LBMA conference. More than a quarter of the delegates said that gold prices could hover above $1,500 an ounce in 12 months time. There was even talk of $2,000 an ounce.“The degree of uncertainty that is out there at the moment…has justified a move into gold,” said John Reade, senior vice-president at Paulson, the hedge fund that made millions during the financial crisis and is buying bullion.The faltering global economic recovery has led to a surge in gold investment, driving prices up 20 per cent so far this year. Gold is up fourfold since 2000.Most delegates dismissed the view that the gold trade was becoming overcrowded – George Soros has called bullion “the ultimate bubble” – arguing that gold’s audience has widened. Shayne McGuire, manager of the gold investments held by Teacher Retirement System of Texas, one of the largest public pension funds in the US with $95bn under management, said: “We’re at a unique moment in financial history – the world as a whole has realised it doesn’t own enough gold.”There were, however, a few wary voices warning that gold’s spectacular rally could easily suffer a correction if the global economy recovers. Tom Kendall, precious metals analyst at Credit Suisse, said: “Once we see a sustained rally in the S&P 500, I suspect we won’t be fixated about record gold prices any longer.”The LBMA delegates forecast silver would be trading at $24 an ounce in 12 months’ time, up 11 per cent from the current 30-year high of $21.65 an ounce. Platinum prices are predicted to rise to $1,857 an ounce, up from the current level of $1,614, and palladium at $702 an ounce, up from $545 currently.

The index fell from 54.3, a revised figure for June, to 50.4, below forecasts of 51.“Generally nobody wants to see a jobless recovery and the consumer confidence number indicates that there’s still uncertainty out there even though earnings numbers have been generally very very good,” said Mike Shea, managing partner in equity sales and trading at Direct Access Partners.“The everyday consumer doesn’t necessarily see all that, they see that their neighbour is unemployed.”The S&P 500 retail sector led the fallers, down by 1.9 per cent and the consumer discretionary sector fell 1.2 per cent. Best Buy was down 3.9 per cent to $35.45; Urban Outfitters lost 4.8 per cent to $32.97 and Gap fell 3.9 per cent to $18.29.Before the open, data on the housing market showed a rise in property values of 4.6 per cent in May, compared with a predicted rise of 3.9 per cent. But the S&P 500 homebuilders index fell 1.6 per cent.The S&P 500 Financials index edged up 0.1 per cent after positive earnings from European banks UBS and Deutsche Bank and news that new tighter Basel III capital rules would be delayed.

It reported better than expected second-quarter net income, which fell to 87 cents per share compared with analysts’ estimates of 93 cents per share. Shares rose 2.6 per cent to $49.10.Cummins, which makes engines and generator equipment, added to the picture of a rise in industrial activity as it reported better than expected quarterly results and raised its full-year forecast. Sales outside the US, which make up two-thirds of its revenue, rose 51 per cent in the quarter. Shares rose 2 per cent to $79.43. Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest defence group, fell a fraction to $74.87 after it posted a 12 per cent jump in profit and increased its full-year forecast.But the materials sector was pushed down by a more negative mood in steel. US Steel Corporation said it was seeing slower order rates in spite of doubling its sales to $4.68bn this quarter. It posted an unexpected second-quarter loss because of revaluing a $1.4bn loan made to a European loan unit. Shares fell 6.4 per cent to $45.76. The negative outlook pushed AK Steel Holding Corp down 4.7 per cent to $14.49 in spite of reporting better than expected earnings.Gold producers fell as the metal hit an 11-week low because of the rally in equities. Newmont Mining Corporation fell 4 per cent to $55.78. Goldcorp dropped
3.7 per cent to $38.82.US-listed shares in BP fell 1.7 per cent to $38.00 after it reported a $17bn loss for the second quarter, after making a pre-tax provision of $32.2bn for the cost of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. It plans to sell assets valued at $30bn to meet the costs."

Mergers and acquisitions, mainstays of consultancy work, are no more resistant to coronavirus than the rest of the global economy.But the decline in transactions has led businesses to focus their attention elsewhere — in particular, on how to survive and potentially thrive once the recovery comes.Worldwide volumes of M&A activity were down nearly a third in the first three months of the year compared with the same period in 2019, according to Refinitiv, the financial data provider. Asia Pacific experienced a 17 per cent drop.Emerging markets are now growing at their slowest pace since records began and experts predict flat growth at best and declines in gross domestic product in some cases. Rating agency Fitch has forecast anaemic GDP growth of 0.8 per cent for Turkey this year, while it expects South Africa’s GDP to fall by 3.8 per cent and Russia’s by 1.4 per cent.According to Fiona Czerniawska, co-founder of Source Global Research, which advises the professional services industry, the sudden fall in deals is not the prelude to a V-shaped recovery, where the economy suffers a sharp drop followed by an acute rise, but rather to a U-shaped upturn, in which activity picks up more gradually.In part that is because of the constraints imposed by social-distancing measures. “It is much harder to build trust remotely,” says Ms Czerniawska. “In a lockdown it becomes much harder to go beyond the people that you know already. Consultants need to demonstrate that they don’t just bring advice but that they have been involved in developing results in the past.”A downturn presents not only complex scenarios for companies but also opportunities for consultants in emerging markets to help them through the dark times, says Mehmet Sami, founding partner of Pretium Advisory in Istanbul.“[The drop in economic activity] leads to a polarisation in the corporate world,” Mr Sami adds. “The difference between stressed companies and resilient players will be bigger.”So what should consultants in emerging markets be advising companies to do if they are to weather the coronavirus storm?Tim Mahapatra is a London-based managing director at consultancy firm Alvarez & Marsal. He says companies are in survival mode and should be looking at ways of preserving as much cash as possible.“All the conversations with clients right now are about cash optimisation,” he says. “[The pandemic] is changing the mindset for the immediate period of the lockdown.”He says some of the key concerns business leaders face now include questions such as: “What do you do when your revenues stop but you still have to pay your suppliers? How do you take advantage of the range of support that governments are offering? How do you interact with the banks?”Mr Sami agrees that “cash control is going to be paramount” for businesses in emerging economies. He says it will be crucial for companies to make sure they have solid and easy-to-tap sources of credit.“If you don’t have a [credit] line in a bank, you’ll clearly have difficulties. But if you don’t, is a financial institution able to help?” he asks. “The banks could also be under stress as well in emerging markets because the global flows are slowing down. If banks are cautious, will they be able to provide facilities to corporates?”Companies — alongside consultants — need to start modelling various financial scenarios. Their survival may depend on their ability to respond swiftly to a wide range of possible outcomes.There are plenty of unknowns that business leaders need to be thinking about now, says Mr Sami.“What happens if the lockdown continues for the second quarter of this year?” he asks. “When do people think things will gradually improve? You need scenarios to make decisions and stress tests.”The pandemic’s global impact will be shaped, he argues, by the response of regulators and by the “behaviour” of the virus. “While the latter’s impact is unknown, the former creates [a] worldwide regulated supply shock, which results in demand shock,” he says. “In response, corporate leadership — especially boards — have enormous responsibilities and need to exhibit duty of care.”A key task is to set up robust board committees that can work through operational and financial scenarios to protect the business and satisfy regulators. Ultimately, Mr Sami thinks the health crisis will accelerate the “onboarding” of independent directors and consultants who can contribute their knowhow.Businesses need to start implementing “tracking policies” to make sure that manufacturing continues and that it is not hugely disrupted if — or when — coronavirus enters the workforce.“You have to have a good contact tracing system,” says Mr Sami. “If someone gets [coronavirus], make sure you isolate certain goods and people. You do need a lot of workforce protection, especially on the manufacturing side of things, with committees reporting on a regular basis.”The veteran consultant adds that monitoring supply chains is crucial in emerging markets such as Turkey. Where critical supply parts or raw materials are at risk, managers need to find alternative sources and new suppliers. Logistical analysis will help with developing flexible solutions.“This is the time when the effectiveness of the boards will be really questioned.”Whatever the priorities of businesses right now, executives must ensure they keep an eye on the future too, says Alvarez & Marsal’s Mr Mahapatra.Companies will see different types of restructuring depending on the sector — anything from going into administration to mere discussions about sources of credit to get through the rough patch, he says.But it is important to see beyond the immediate crisis. “What will the business look like in 12 months’ time?” he asks. “How do you maximise your chances of survival?”While survival strategies vary hugely, he says, “there are some common considerations”.One is the pivot to cash. Another is the need to secure supply chains in readiness for the rebound. “This includes accelerating payment to key suppliers to ensure they can respond and supporting smaller suppliers to make sure they can survive the next few months,” Mr Mahapatra says.“Prior to the lockdown being lifted, companies will need to ensure availability of labour, liaise with customers and suppliers, and organise inventory to prepare for an uptick in demand. For some, Covid-19 will have a long-term business impact, meaning they need to start repositioning their brands and deliver operational changes now.”With such measures in place, a rapid restart should be achievable. But he warns: “Many companies will emerge from the crisis with higher debt to repay or lower reserves. This will cause them to reprioritise their investment plans, potentially acting as a lag on recovery in the year ahead.”

165;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2010-05-04T16:59:04Z;Newcrest Mining / Lihir Gold;The deal has one extraordinary feature;Hooray Henry. Less than 48 hours have passed since Kevin Rudd’s government announced plans to tax Australian miners’ profits at 40 per cent. But Newcrest of Melbourne – with three-quarters of its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation within Australia – has dug a little deeper for Brisbane’s Lihir Gold, which generates a similar proportion outside it. The Australian super tax proposal, prompted by the landmark Henry review, may be a lot less super by the time it becomes law late next year. Still, Lihir’s sheltered income streams suddenly seem more desirable.The logic of combining Australia’s number one and two gold producers to create one of the world’s lowest-cost and longest-life portfolios was never in much doubt. From the outset, Lihir’s quibble was over price rather than strategy. Its own efforts to diversify earnings away from its prize asset in Papua New Guinea had stumbled. Arthur Hood, the former chief executive, was flayed for the 2007 acquisition of Victoria’s Ballarat Goldfields, sold in March for A$4.5m after a pre-tax impairment charge more than 120 times greater.The deal has one extraordinary feature, though. Chairmen have shaken hands, but Lihir remains free to continue negotiations with undisclosed third parties until June 8. Newmont, the biggest American gold producer, and Canada’s Barrick Gold, the world’s largest, will almost certainly want a say in the outcome. Gold is on a three-year run better than any other commodity bar cocoa and soyabeans. Last year, investment demand surpassed jewellery fabrication for the first time in 30 years, according to GFMS, a consultancy. A declining rate of new mine discoveries, meanwhile, looks set to keep the market tight. Lihir’s sheer gall in seeking a better offer – and Newcrest’s willingness to put up with it – speaks volumes for the allure of the yellow metal.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyNewcrest Mining on Tuesday launched a A$9.5bn (US$8.8bn) takeover for rival Lihir Gold in a deal that could create the world’s fourth-biggest gold company with a pro-forma market value of A$25bn.Newcrest, Australia’s biggest gold miner, sweetened its bid after Lihir last month rejected its initial A$9.2bn offer. The new cash and share proposal was supported by Lihir’s board.Lihir said it remained in discussions with a number of third parties, which it declined to name, and that those talks would continue until June 8 when Newcrest is due to complete its “confirmatory” due diligence.
166;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2010-05-04T10:31:48Z;Newcrest Mining lifts Lihir bid to A$9.5bn;;Lihir Gold on Tuesday recommended an improved A$9.5bn (US$8.8bn) takeover offer from rival Newcrest Mining, Australia’s biggest gold miner, but retained the right to continue talks with other suitors for another month.Ross Garnaut, Lihir chairman, declined to name the rival suitors or the status of the talks which he said could continue until June 8, the date when Newcrest said it would complete “confirmatory” due diligence.Reports in Australia have suggested that Lihir – which is listed on the Australian stock exchange but whose main mine is in Papua New Guinea’s Lihir island – could be in the sights of Canada’s Barrick Gold, Newmont Mining of the US or Johannesburg-listed AngloGold Ashanti.However, analysts were doubtful of a higher offer and believed it would be difficult to displace Newcrest. After being rebuffed in early April, Newcrest sweetened its shares-and-cash offer by 6.4 per cent to secure Lihir’s qualified backing.A Newcrest/Lihir combination would create a mining group with a pro-forma market value of A$25bn operating 10 mines in Asia, including Australia and Papua New Guinea, as well as West Africa. It would hold 73.4m ounces of gold reserves, 4.7m tonnes of copper reserves and 26.7m ounces of silver reserves.Based on those numbers, the groups said the combined entity would rank fourth in world equivalent gold reserves.The Newcrest bid is subject to an independent expert’s report, which will assess whether the offer is in the best interests of Lihir shareholders in light of the Australian government’s decision to impose a new 40 per cent tax on mining group profits from 2012. Lihir would largely escape any proposed tax because the bulk of its assets are outside Australia.Ian Smith, Newcrest chief executive, added that the new tax would likely be watered down before it was passed into law and that both miners had considered the impact of the tax ahead of agreeing the deal.However, the proposed tax could curtail takeovers in the Australian mining sector and undermine new projects.Cape Lambert Resources, an iron ore miner, on Tuesday said it had postponed exploration activities in the Pilbara region of Western Australia because of uncertainty created by the tax changes.Peabody Energy of the US, which is attempting to buy Macarthur Coal for A$4.1bn, has told the Australian group it is “continuing to work through” the impact of the tax proposals.Newcrest has offered one of its shares for every 8.43 Lihir shares held, plus A$0.225 in cash per share. That compares with the earlier offer of one Newcrest share for every nine Lihir shares held plus A$0.225.The offer valued Lihir at A$4.03 a share based on Monday’s closing prices. Lihir’s shares rose 12 cents to A$3.79 on Tuesday, while Newcrest closed A$1.37 lower at A$30.69.Gold miners have been buoyed by record prices as investors switched into the precious metal as a haven against turmoil in financial markets and a weakening US dollar.
167;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2010-04-01T05:24:58Z;Lihir Gold rejects A$9.2bn Newcrest bid;;Lihir Gold, the Australian miner, on Thursday rejected an A$9.2bn (US$8.4bn) takeover offer from Newcrest Mining, the country’s top gold miner, thwarting its plan to create the world’s fourth-biggest gold producer.A combination would have created an entity with a pro-forma market value of close to A$25bn and the Asia-Pacific region’s largest gold producer.Lihir, which has mines in Papua New Guinea, Australia and Africa, said although there were merits in a combination, it had rejected the offer because it was too low. The companies have been in private talks for the past six weeks following an initial approach from Newcrest.Lihir shares surged 33 per cent to A$4.04 soon after the spurned offer was announced, above the A$3.87 in cash and shares offered by Newcrest.Analysts said Newcrest was particularly interested in Lihir’s PNG assets. Lihir has its headquarters in Port Moresby but is listed on the Australian stock exchange.Gold miners have been buoyed by record prices for the metal as investors sought a haven against turmoil in financial markets and a weakening US dollar.Gold reached a new peak last December of $1,216 an ounce and traded at just under $1,115 this week.The increase in the gold price last year fuelled speculation the industry would consolidate.Newmont, the US listed-gold miner with a market value of US$25bn, was last year said to be looking at Newcrest after the group’s chief executive said he wanted to pursue growth via acquisitions. The US miner in 2009 agreed to buy out Anglogold Ashanti’s 33 per cent stake in what it forecast would become Australia’s largest gold mine, in a deal worth US$1bn.Newcrest said its offer for Lihir was “compelling… and represents full and fair value for Lihir shareholders”. In a sign of aggression, it said it would contact its target’s shareholders to hear their views on the bid.However, a hostile bid is unlikely.“This is not a ‘must do’ transaction for Newcrest, and we will only pursue it if we believe it will create value for Newcrest shareholders and is supported by Newcrest and Lihir shareholders,” said Don Mercer, Newcrest’s chairman.The offer is at a 35 per cent premium to Lihir’s closing price on February 12, the last trading day prior to Newcrest’s initial approach.Ross Garnaut, Lihir chairman, said the offer undervalued the group’s existing business and its future potential. “It also did not include a sufficient premium for control,” he said.“Directors and management made certain that Newcrest was given the opportunity to make an offer that would deliver full value for our shareholders, but the board’s assessment was that the offer received was inadequate,” he added.Lihir reported record production in each of the last four years. Output hit 1.124m ounces in 2009.Boosted by developments in PNG and west Africa, Lihir forecast an increase in annual gold production of 40 per cent to 1.45m ounces between 2012 to 2016, a similar rate of growth to Newcrest.“There is considerable option value in the huge gold resources at Lihir Island [in PNG], which increased 31 per cent to 43m ounces in 2009,” Mr Garnaut added.Newcrest has offered one of its shares for every nine Lihir shares plus 22.5 cents cash a share. Lihir shareholders would own about 35 per cent of the combined organisation based on the offer.
168;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2010-03-22T19:30:57Z;Mining fails to produce golden era for Ghana;;Kofi Gyakah’s account of the last hours of his hunting dogs, Skimpy and Don’t Forget, is all too clear and poignant: “Fishes dead . . . cyanide . . . Newmont.”The 37-year-old fisherman gestures above the tropical fronds that ring his remote hamlet towards the $700m Ahafo mine that Newmont of the US, the world’s second-biggest gold miner, completed three years ago.A spill of the diluted cyanide that separates gold from ore poisoned the fish that were the villagers’ main source of income and, so Mr Gyakah believes, did for his two dogs.The fate of Skimpy and Don’t Forget was probably not foremost in the mind of Kwabena Duffuor, the finance minister, when he announced plans last year to double the royalties mining companies pay to exploit some of the world’s richest gold reserves. More pressing was Ghana’s yawning budget deficit.Yet both the fisherman and the minister gave voice to a grievance heard across resource-dependent Africa and rankling anew in Ghana as it prepares to start pumping oil: a sense that, a century after commercial mining began in what was then the Gold Coast, the country is still getting a raw deal.In the past 18 years alone, miners have extracted 36m ounces of the yellow metal from Ghana’s seams, generating about 40 per cent of export earnings. Fewer Ghanaians live in poverty now. But a third of them still cannot read, and a quarter will not see their 40th birthday.Tax breaks and other incentives mean that of mining revenues totalling $2.1bn last year, only $146m – or 7 per cent – was paid to the state in royalties, taxes and dividends, according to the Chamber of Mines.When Ghana introduced incentives for foreign investment in mining in the country in 1986, it was leading a trend. Africa’s post-independence efforts to use state-owned mining companies to harvest mineral wealth had given way to stagnation as commodity prices tumbled. Spurred by the World Bank, governments vied for investment with ever sweeter deals.The commodity boom prompted a rethink, as African nations watched the proceeds of the good times pass them by. However, when the crash came in 2008, governments found their bargaining positions dramatically weakened. Copper-producing Zambia and metal-rich Tanzania have diluted plans to raise taxes on miners.Yet nervous investors have pushed the gold price to record highs. Ghana’s gold production increased 10 per cent last year – and the country has decided that it is not receiving its due.Companies pay royalties of 3 per cent of mining revenues. As well as doubling them to a maximum of 6 per cent, Mr Duffuor says the government will address “the whole mining sector fiscal regime”.He faces a battle. Unpublished “stabilisation agreements” with Newmont and South Africa-based Anglogold Ashanti stipulate royalties of 3 per cent. “Our investment agreement supersedes the mining law,” says Jeff Huspeni, Newmont’s senior vice-president for Africa.One industry veteran expects tough negotiations with the government – especially as Anglogold and Newmont are spending handsomely to increase their annual production by 1m ounces.The showdown raises questions about the role of the World Bank. The International Finance Corporation, its private sector arm, has made several mining investments in Ghana, most recently $125m in Newmont’s Ahafo mine.Somit Varma, the IFC’s mining director, says: “In all extractive projects we ask: is the deal fair to the government and the private sector?”He stresses the ancillary benefits of mining in Ghana, including thousands of jobs. Newmont allocates $1 per ounce of gold sold from Ahafo and 1 per cent of the mine’s net profit to community development projects.But a 2003 review of its own mining projects by the World Bank found that it was “unclear what [mining’s] true net benefits are to Ghana”.The $6.7bn that Ghana’s mining sector attracted in investment between 1994 and last year was 50 per cent more than inflows to all other sectors combined, according to official figures.The government is considering Newmont’s application to build a second mine for up to $1bn. That, too, would be covered by the stabilisation agreement, so royalties would be capped at 3 per cent.Tinkering with the terms might imperil Ghana’s reputation as a haven for investors. Preserving them, however, would leave the Treasury’s coffers unfilled, the sense of injustice undimmed and villagers such as Kofi Gyakah adamant that the riches under their soil have brought them little but dead dogs.

crisis also sent shockwaves through the casino industry.Shares in MGM Mirage dropped 4.1 per cent to $10.56. Dubai World is the casino owner’s partner in the largest development on the Las Vegas Strip but reports suggested the restructuring was unlikely to affect the $8.5bn project.Las Vegas Sands also suffered, losing 4.2 per cent to $15.79.A rebound in the dollar hit commodities hard, causing oil prices to plunge.

barrel by the close in New York. Exxon Mobil lost 2.1 per cent to $74.87 and
Chevron was down 1.9 per cent at $78.17.Lower gold prices also prompted heavy losses in the mining industry. Newmont Mining, the world’s largest producer of gold, dropped 2.8 per cent to $53.35.

The retail data that came out resonated very positively with investors who are hoping upon hope for reasons to believe that the recovery is sustainable.”Citigroup was in focus on Friday after confirming it would sell its controversial Phibro commodities business to Occidental Petroleum. Occidental said its net investment in the business would total about $250m and the deal is expected to help deflect political anger over a potential $100m pay-out for its star trader Andrew Hall. While financial stocks were broadly up, Citi shares lost 0.4 per cent to $4.63.Government-backed mortgage lenders also weighed on the sector. Edward DeMarco, the acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said late on Thursday that the mortgage groups might need further aid from the US Treasury. Fannie Mae was down 4 per cent to $1.43 and Freddie Mac lost 3.9 per cent to $1.71.Shares in both companies fell on Wednesday, in spite of a broad rally in the financial sector, after reports suggested they were working on a programme to help independent mortgage banks get access to short-term credit for home loans.Retreating commodity prices hit mining and industrial stocks in early trading on Friday.Newmont Mining suffered further after speculation that the company could be preparing a hostile bid for Australia’s Newcrest Mining.

at Channelcapitalresearch.com.“The services data came in better than expected [on Monday] and that’s been followed up by the Australia rate decision.”Gold prices also hit a new record above $1,040 an ounce on Tuesday, boosting mining stocks. Newmont Mining, which has operations in Peru, Indonesia and Ghana as well as in the US, gained 7 per cent to $46.21.As the oil price rose above $70 a barrel, energy stocks gained momentum.Chevron was up 1.7 per cent to $70.56 while Peabody Energy gained 4.5 per cent to $38.30.Reuters also reported that ExxonMobil had agreed to buy Kosmos Energy’s stake in the Jubilee field in Ghana, which analysts said could be worth up to $5bn.

173;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2009-08-17T19:25:53Z;Fresnillo;;"Hi ho, silver. Fresnillo, the London-listed Mexican miner, produced a record 18.8m ounces of the stuff in its first half, though the $13.92 an ounce it achieved was almost a quarter lower year on year. Still, it was not as bad as expected; nor was the world’s largest primary silver producer’s 14 per cent fall in profits. Though silver has retreated from its June peak of $16.22 an ounce, when inflation fears prompted investors to take refuge in the metal, both Jaime Lomelín, chief executive, and analysts expect Fresnillo to achieve much the same price in the second half as it did in the first. The company is even cautiously upbeat about the demand outlook and pressing ahead withtwo gold and silver development projects that come on stream in the next two years, including a joint venture with US miner Newmont.There are good grounds for its optimism. Industrial demand for silver, used in gizmos such as mobile telephones, is pegged to economic recovery in manufacturing economies such as Japan, the largest consumer of Mexican silver after the US. Japan emerged from recession in the second quarter. But industrial demand will not recover overnight, so exchange traded funds will keep lending support until it does. ETF demand currently accounts for almost as much (145m ounces) as jewellery (152m ounces), according to Investec Securities.Then there are Fresnillo’s own attributes. A notoriously low-cost operator, producing silver for about $3.50 an ounce, it has no debt, no looming rights issue and has even sustained capital expenditure through the downturn. Not unsurprisingly, it trades on a heady 30 times 2010 earnings. Yet few investors are taking profits: its shares fell 2 per cent to 560p yesterday, compared with the FTSE mining index’s fall of double that. Rarity and gearing to recovery count for a lot.The falling price of silver has weighed on revenues at Fresnillo, the mining group, although the lower prices were mitigated by a devaluation in the Mexican peso as the company prepares to start production at a new mine early next year. In the first six months of 2009, Fresnillo produced 18.9m ounces of silver, 8 per cent more than the same period last year. However, the average realised silver price fell 22 per cent in the period amid a global slump in commodity prices.E-mail the Lex team confidentiallyORPost public commentsThe Lex column is on Twitter"
174;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2009-08-13T21:24:52Z;Wall Street hits new highs for the year;;US stocks reluctantly joined the global equity rally on Thursday, staggering to new highs for the year after weak economic data hampered what could have been a stellar day of trade.Results from Wal-Mart added to pre-market optimism sparked by the unexpected return to growth in France and Germany.But the news that retail sales for July unexpectedly declined, while the number of people claiming jobless benefits for the first time last week rose, kept the lid on any major rally.“Retail sales were very disappointing,” said Paul Dales, US economist at Capital Economics. “Consumption makes up 60-70 per cent of GDP, so a dive in consumption is more important than growth elsewhere.”But the promise of global growth meant equities rallied towards the close, ending in positive territory after a choppy day of trade.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed up 0.7 per cent to 1,012.73, its highest close for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 9,398.19 and the Nasdaq Composite index picked up 0.5 per cent to 2,009.35.“People are desperate for the party to start again, which means that stocks are rallying even though the underlying economy is still weak,” said George Feiger, chairman of Contango Capital Advisers.“They then gather momentum as investors chase the rally.”Consumer discretionary stocks were watched closely after the sales figures and Wal-Mart’s results.The world’s biggest retailer made better profits than expected and predicted comparable sales could rise 2 per cent in the next quarter. This helped boost the shares 2.7 per cent to $51.88 in spite of disappointing quarterly revenues.Drinks group Dr Pepper Snapplealso beat earnings expectations and, after the company raised its full-year forecast, the shares climbed 6.2 per cent to $24.98.Clothing retailer Urban Outfitters also impressed with its earnings after becoming one of the few in its sector to report a quarterly rise in sales, which helped lift profit above expectations and boost its shares 3 per cent to $29.06.Ford was another stand-out performer during the day after the company said the success of the “cash-for-clunkers” programme to encourage consumers to buy new cars would mean it had to increase production over the rest of the year. The shares gained 2.6 per cent to $7.90.A late bounce saw department store Kohl’s also find gains. The company raised its full-year forecast following the quarterly results, and its shares rose 0.2 per cent to $52.39 even though that forecast remains below analyst estimates.The rest of the consumer discretionary sector did not fare so well, however, and homebuilders were particularly badly hurt both by the retail sales numbers and by analyst downgrades.The recent run-up in share prices in the sector encouraged Citigroup to recommend selling shares in DR Horton while Raymond James rated KB Home at “underperform”.DR Horton fell 3.7 per cent to $12.95 while KB Home gave up 2.5 per cent to $17.83.But strength from materials stocks bolstered the market. Metals prices were higher on the promise of improved demand from abroad and shares in miners were especially strong.Newmont Mining picked up 2.5 per cent to $41.47 while rival gold miner Freeport McMoRan gained 4.9 per cent to $66.07.Financial stocks also showed some strength with several large banks benefiting from the news that Paulson & Co, the hedge fund controlled by John Paulson, who predicted the housing crash, had taken large positions in them. Paulson became the fourth-largest shareholder in Bank of America, which rose 6.7 per cent to $17, and the second-largest at Regions Financial, which gained 7.9 per cent to $5.20.This came on a morning when trading in BofA’s shares was delayed by technical issues, the second trading problem to hit the New York Stock Exchange this week.Technology stocks were helped by positive comments from analysts. Apple’s shares climbed 1.9 per cent to $168.42 after Barclays praised its product pipeline and put a price target on the stock of $208.
175;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2009-07-15T21:32:35Z;Intel triggers Wall Street rally;;US stocks rallied on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average enjoying its best day since early April, as strong earnings from chipmaker Intel encouraged investors to buy riskier assets.Stocks in material, industrial, energy and financial companies, which are sensitive to growth, all did well.But technology kicked off the rally after Intel reported better revenues and profits than expected and its shares jumped 7.3 per cent to $18.05.The microchip sector was given a further boost by better-than-expected results from Altera, which beat revenues and profit estimates and, like Intel, said profit margins would rise this year. Its shares picked up 4.2 per cent to $17.26.Other chipmakers also felt the benefit with AMD, Intel’s main rival, gaining 8.7 per cent to $3.86.Intel’s strong sales also provided optimism over personal computer sales and PC makers rose accordingly. Hewlett-Packard gained 4.5 per cent to $38.82.The rally gathered pace during the day and an upward revision in theFederal Reserve’s unemployment forecasts failed to knock it off course, as investors took confidence in a simultaneuos upgrade in the growth predictions.“The Intel numbers are enough to fuel the rally in the short term, but eventually the US unemployment rate is going to have an effect on the rest of the world,” said Dave Rovelli, managing director of trading at Cannacord Adams.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 3 per cent up at 932.68, while the Dow rose 3.1 per cent to 8,616.21 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index gained 3.5 per cent to 1,862.90.Anu Sharma, managing director of Nasdaq’s Market Intelligence Desk, described trading as a “short squeeze”, with short sellers having to buy back stocks in the worry that they might suffer heavy losses if the market rises further.There was also a warning sign on the stability of the current rally from the Vix index, a measure of implied volatility that usually drops when the market rises. It gained 3.4 per cent to 25.87 on Wednesday, suggesting investors were betting on an imminent drop.Materials stocks were also higher as the prices of metals picked up. Freeport McMoRan, which mines copper and gold, rose 5.7 per cent to $50.91. Its rival Newmont Mining gained 3.4 per cent to $40.45.Energy stocks were higher as the price of oil jumped. Chevron rose 2.5 per cent to $64.57 and Schlumberger climbed 5.3 per cent to $54.56. Investors also bought financial stocks, with banking shares continuing to bask in the afterglow of bumper profits from Goldman Sachs.But it was credit card companies that stood out after Capital One and Discover Financial both said loan losses in June had not been as bad as expected, in spite of the rising unemployment rate. Capital One jumped 11.8 per cent to $25.84 and Discover gained 6.2 per cent to $10.85.Shares in industrial companies also took part in the rally, helped by data showing industrial production had shrunk less than expected and factory output in the New York region had dropped by the smallest amount in over a year.General Electric rose 5.2 per cent to $12.24 and Caterpillar, which manufactures equipment for the industrial sector, put on 6 per cent to $33.84.The airline sector was boosted by AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, which reported a smaller-than-expected loss, which lifted the shares 4.3 per cent to $4.36.The general market optimism was tempered, however, by disappointing profits from Abbott Labs, one of the largest US drugmakers. The company also forecast full-year profits at the lower end of analysts’ expectations and the shares fell 2.6 per cent to $45.28.There were also worrying signs on consumer spending from Yum Brands, which operates the Pizza Hut and KFC fast-food franchises.It reported better earnings than expected but warned the rise in its same-store sales this year would disappoint. The stock lost 5.5 per cent to $34.05.Results from Gannett, which publishes USA Today, were more encouraging. It saw better-than-expected profit, powered by its online businesses. The shares soared 28.9 per cent to $4.50.
176;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2009-07-02T20:44:48Z;Wall Street slides on jobs report;;"US stocks took a pounding on Thursday, with the benchmark S&P 500 index turning negative for the year as investors reacted to data showing many more people lost their jobs in June than expected.Analysts had far underestimated the number of new non-farm employees who would lose their jobs during the month, and even though the unemployment rate and the number of people claiming jobless benefits on a weekly basis were both better than expected, the market sold off heavily.Consumer stocks were directly hit by concerns over joblessness, and retailers felt some of the worst effects. Macy’s gave up 6.3 per cent to $11, while Best Buy dropped 5.3 per cent to $32.08 and Nordstrom, the clothing retailer, declined 7.1 per cent to $18.63.“The jobless figures were abysmal,” said John Brady, senior vice-president at MF Global.“We’re now in a malevolent cycle and the risk is that the government will have to issue even more debt. This could lead to higher interest rates, which would undermine the whole V-shaped recovery.”But Burt White, chief investment officer for LPL Financial, disagreed. “The market is over-reacting,” he said. “The combined loss of jobs for the last two months is only just more than that seen in January. These are the beginning stages of the stabilisation of the unemployment rate.”The S&P 500 closed 2.9 per cent down at 896.42 while the Dow Jones was 2.6 per cent per cent lower at 8,280.74. This was after trading on the New York Stock Exchange was extended for 15 minutes after a technical glitch.The Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.7 per cent to 1,796.52.That left the markets between 1.8 and 2.5 per cent lower for the week, which was cut short because of the Independence Day
holiday.Thursday’s selling knocked the markets out of the narrow trading range they had been in all week, which saw the close of the best quarter for the S&P since December 1998.Equities rose and fell with the price of commodities throughout the week, with oil climbing above $72 a barrel only to fall back below $68.But in a week which saw the release of several important pieces of economic data, trading volumes remained thin, with much of Wall Street taking an early break ahead of the long weekend.There was further volatility in commodities on Thursday, and energy producers fell as the price of oil continued the previous sessions’ declines.Schlumberger gave up 3.2 per cent to $52.55 and ConocoPhillips lost 2.6 per cent to $40.96.Elsewhere in the sector, NRG gave up its pre-market gains, which had been made on an increased bid from Exelon after a fall in Exelon’s share price meant there would be less of a premium attached for NRG shareholders.The bid is now $7.45bn, but NRG’s shares fell with the price of oil, dropping 4.8 per cent to $24.80. Exelon lost 4.3 per cent to $49.37.Materials companies also suffered and Freeport McMoRan the copper and gold miner, gave up 1.7 per cent to $49.72. Newmont Mining dropped 4.6 per cent to $40.26.Airlines fluctuated as Morgan Stanley reviewed its ratings on some of the biggest US carriers. The bank started coverage on Delta Air Lines, the world’s largest, recommending a price target of $9 after recent selling pressure.The shares climbed 0.5 per cent to $5.88.Morgan Stanley also upgraded shares in Continental Airlines, saying it was a likely survivor from the fall-out in the industry.There was some pressure on the stock from news on Wednesday evening that its revenue per seat may have fallen more than 20 per cent in June compared with a year earlier. But the shares still managed to gain 6.2 per cent to $9.79.Southwest Airlines fell 4.4 per cent to $6.50, however, after the bank downgraded its shares, saying higher oil prices would take a toll on profit margins.Meanwhile Illumina, which makes equipment to analyse DNA, dropped after reporting lower revenues than expected as cash-strapped researchers delayed orders. The shares lost 12.3 per cent to $33.46."
177;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2009-05-20T20:30:06Z;Fed forecast sours Wall Street mood;;"US stocks suffered a late sell-off on Wednesday as a downward revision to growth figures and the progress of a bill to overhaul credit card lending helped tip the markets into negative territory.Banks led the selling after the Fed’s open market committee released the minutes from its last meeting, in which it lowered its predictions for GDP and raised those for unemployement.They saw another dip on reports that President Barack Obama was ready to sign the credit card bill, which would limit fees and impose new restrictions on when lenders can raise interest rates for risky customers.American Express lost 3.3 per cent to $23.98, while JPMorgan, which also has a sizeable credit card lending arm, gave up 3.5 per cent to $34.55.Oher banks also fell back after participating in the early rally.Regions Financial said it wanted to raise $1.25bn by offering new stock in order to make up its shortfall following the government’s stress tests on banks.Investors worried about stock dilution and its shares fell 6.7 per cent to $4.89.PNC, meanwhile, fell 2.8 per cent to $42.06 after saying it would not rush to repay government bail-out money but do so “over the next couple of years”.This contrasted with statements from Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan in recent days that they would pay back the government as soon as possible.The falls reversed earlier earlier gains after the market took confidence from higher commodities prices and Bank of America’s success in raising capital.Bank of America’s shares rose after the company said it had sold a total of 1.25bn shares at an average price of $10.77 since last
Friday. The stock closed up 2.1 per cent at $11.49.“Bank of America’s rise is a kneejerk reaction and we are not seeing that replicated across the banking sector,” said Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global.The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 0.5 per cent to 903.47, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average list 0.6 per cent to 8,422.04. The Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.4 per cent to 1,727.84.Broader support came from energy stocks after the price of oil rose back over $60 a barrel following Department of Energy figures showing US oil inventories fell last week.Schlumberger gained 1.9 per cent to $55.04, while rival ConocoPhillips picked up
0.6 per cent to $46.19.A rise in general commodity prices and the falling dollar also boosted materials companies. Newmont Mining, which produces gold, gained 4.5 per cent to $45.55, while Freeport McMoRan, which mines gold and copper, rose 1 per cent to $50.Hewlett-Packard proved a drag on the Dow as it gave back the gains made during Tuesday’s trade after reporting earnings in line with analysts’ estimates.Its shares fell 5.2 per cent to $34.67 after the company said sales in the third quarter would be below current consensus predictions.Its rival, Dell, also suffered from the negative outlook for the computer sales industry and its shares dropped 3.3 per cent to $11.18.But chip manufacturers lent strength to the technology sector after Analog Devices’ profits beat Wall Street’s estimates and the company said it would earn more for the full year than currently predicted.The company said there had been strength in sales to telecommunications infrastructure customers and
its shares jumped 15.7 per cent to $23.80.Rivals National Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices also found gains on the positive comments from Analog, rising 6.6 per cent to $13.23 and 2.5 per cent to $4.50, respectively.Investors also watched for signs on consumer activity as budget retailers Target and BJâ€™s both beat analysts’ expectations with their quarterly profits. Target’s shares gained 2.4 per cent to $42.94 after it beat expectations on the back of tight cost controls and a profitable credit card business.BJ’s also beat predictions as consumers looked to buy staples at wholesale prices. But its shares slipped 4.4 per cent to $36.37 after the company said it expected second-quarter sales to decline.On a quiet day with low volumes, however, most investors were not overly worried by the losses.“It looks like there has been a continual but moderate consolidation of the big gains on Monday,” said Scott Marcouiller, senior equity market strategist at Wells Fargo advisers."
178;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;US banks rise on accounting changes;;US stocks surged above last month’s highs to take the Dow Jones Industrial Average beyond 8,000 on Thursday after the Financial Accounting Standards Board relaxed mark-to-market accounting, which has been blamed for exacerbating banks’ capital problems.The changes mean banks can mark toxic assets by their own models rather than what they would fetch on the open market. Some analysts have calculated the change could boost quarterly profits at some banks by up to 20 per cent.The move sparked a flurry of buying in the banking sector, with Citigroup rising 4.1 per cent to $2.79, Bank of America gaining 4.7 per cent to $7.38 and Wells Fargo picking up 6.5 per cent to $15.42.“This move will mean there is more confidence in the banks when they report their earnings, which will encourage individuals and companies to start spending,” said Roy Williams, senior partner at Prestige Wealth Management Group.There was more good news for the banking sector after Credit Suisse said Goldman Sachs had a “strong” position in the market and raised its rating on the company to “outperform”.Barclays was also positive about Goldman, raising its first-quarter earnings outlook from $0.80 to $1.70 per share. Goldman’s shares rose 3.8 per cent to $114.44.The market was also helped by signs of unity at the end of the G20 meeting in London, with leaders trebling the resources available to the International Monetary Fund to $750bn, and by hopes that the global economy was stabilising.Although the display helped bolster confidence in stock markets around the world, the lack of agreement on any fresh round of global stimulus limited its effect.“When we went to bed last night we were not thinking that events in Connecticut [where the FASB is based] would move the markets more than those in London, but that is what has happened,” said Wasif Latif, assistant vice-president at USAA Investment Management.The benchmark S&P 500 index was up 3.6 per cent to 840.05 points by midday, while the Dow picked up 3.4 per cent to 8,023.32 points and the Nasdaq rose 3.9 per cent to 1,612.77.The S&P is now trading above its 100-day moving average for the first time in more than nine months, and the Nasdaq has entered positive territory for the year.The gains came in spite of jobless figures for last week, which showed the number of people claiming unemployment benefits for the first time rose unexpectedly to 669,000, a 26-year high.There was some rare good news for the automotive sector, after US carmakers said on Wednesday night that their sales of new vehicles had fallen less than expected, with demand improving noticeably in the final week of March.The battered stocks of both General Motorsand Ford made headway, with GM gaining 10.9 per cent to $2.14 and Ford picking up 6.2 per cent to $2.91.Johnson Controls, which makes fittings for cars, also rose on the news, lifting 16.4 per cent to $15.38. But AutoZone, the carparts retailer, fell 1.6 per cent to $164.08 after Citigroup said its stock was overvalued.Monsanto, the agricultural products company, rose after reporting earnings of $2.16, ahead of analysts’ estimates of $2.07. The company also raised its guidance for full year earnings per share from $4.23 to $4.33, and its shares rose 1.5 per cent to $82.98.Dow Chemical was another gainer, climbing 11.2 per cent to $9.80 after it sold its Morton Salt unit to K&S, Europe’s largest salt maker, for $1.7bn to help complete its purchase of Rohm & Haas, the materials company.Energy stocks followed the price of oil, which gained sharply overnight in New York, and was trading above $50 a barrel by midday. Chevron rose 3.4 per cent to $70.62 and ExxonMobiladvanced 1.9 per cent to $70.57.Commodities stocks were also buoyed by higher commodities prices, with steel companies enjoying a second consecutive positive session. AK Steellifted 16.1 per cent to $9.02 and US Steel advanced 8.7 per cent to $24.59.Newmont Mining was one of the few fallers in the sector after an executive said the company was looking at a number of acquisitions. Its shares lost 2.8 per cent to $46.07.
179;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Newmont and Sumitomo told to divest shares;;"By John Aglionby in JakartaInternational arbitrators have ruled that Newmont Mining of the US and Sumitomo of Japan must divest 17 per cent of Indonesian subsidiary Newmont Nusa Tenggara within 180 days or be found in default of their contract with the south-east Asian government, both sides in the dispute announced on Wednesday.Jakarta’s request for Newmont Nusa Tenggara’s contract to be revoked was rejected, as were two of Newmont’s key requests to the arbitrators; that it be allowed to finance parties wanting to buy the shares and that the divested shares need not be free of pledge agreements to international lenders. Newmont must also pay all the arbitration costs.The dispute, which dates back to 2007, is being closely watched as a barometer of how Jakarta treats foreign investors seeking to exploit the country’s extensive natural resources.Purnomo Yusgiantoro, the energy and mineral resources minister, said 10 per cent of the shares must initially be offered to the local governments around NNT’s Batu Hijau mine on Sumbawa island and 7 per cent to the central government.Three crucial issues remain unclear; the price at which the shares will be divested, how long the central and local governments have to decide whether and how to buy the shares before Newmont can offer the shares to private companies and how NNT will free the shares of the loan pledges.Bambang Setiawan, the ministry’s director-general for mineral resources, said the central government would soon meet their provincial and district counterparts from Sumbawa to decide their stance on the divestment.He said prices agreed for some 3 per cent of the shares that should have been divested in 2006 and 7 per cent in 2007, $109m and $282m respectively, should be “reassessed”.Newmont and Sumitomo have to divest 51 per cent of the shares by 2010 in proportions stipulated by the ruling. They have already sold 20 per cent to Pukuafu Indah, a company controlled by Indonesian businessman Yusuf Merukh. Newmont currently owns 45 per cent of NNT and Sumitomo 35 per cent.Richard O’Brien, Newmont’s president and chief executive, said the company was committed to completing the divestment as ordered. “We are currently reviewing the decision and look forward to outlining a path forward with the government to implement the arbitration panel’s decision,” he said.Both sides filed for arbitration in March 2008 after NNT failed to divest its 2006 and 2007 obligations. The arbitration proceedings were extended to include the 2008 divestment in July.Local miner Bumi Resources said it was probably not interested in the shares.NNT expects the Batu Hijau mine to produce 207m kilos of copper concentrate this year, up from 129m kilos in 2008, and 486,000 troy ounces of gold this year compared to 269,000 ounces in 2008.Additional reporting by Taufan Hidayat in Jakarta"
180;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2009-04-01T17:55:42Z;Gold mine dispute seen as test case for Indonesia;;"Around Indonesia in 180 Days would be a suitable title for the latest foreign investor soap opera to emerge from south-east Asia’s largest economy. That is how long international arbitrators have given Newmont Mining of the US and Sumitomo of Japan to divest 17 per cent of a subsidiary that owns a major gold mine on the remote island of Sumbawa.After years of largely ignoring Indonesia, global miners are considering it again since a new mining law was passed in December. Critical regulations that will implement the legislation are still awaited, but the handling of the Newmont Nusa Tenggara share divestment will also sway investors.With legislative elections taking place next week and a presidential election in July, there is a possibility that this two-year-old dispute between the companies and the government could become a political football; there were highly charged exchanges over the issue last year.Several key government officials have changed since, but the dispute is being monitored closely as an indication of how Jakarta plans to deal with foreign investors. If opaque political and business interests are allowed to meddle, it will send a signal that Indonesia is not really open to foreign business. Jakarta can avoid that risk by being openly transparent and professional in the resolution of this dispute.Setting a precedentSir Tom McKillop, ex-chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, won’t get many thanks for doing the honourable thing and retiring as a non-executive director at BP.It looks as though it sets a precedent for other ex-directors of the bank, such as Bob Scott, still chairman of Yell, the directories group, and Janis Kong and Sir Steve Robson, who hold non-executive roles at, respectively, Kingfisher, the retailer, and Xstrata, the miner. BP’s board can’t be too happy, either. That’s not just because Sir Tom was, in chairman Peter Sutherland’s words, an “outstanding director”, but because his departure is a reminder that
Mr Sutherland (also a former RBS director) and his deputy Sir Ian Prosser are both overdue for replacement.Sir Tom faced specific obstacles to continuing as a director of BP. As chairman of RBS – a pharmaceuticals expert overseeing a global bank – he shoulders a large part of the blame for not keeping Sir Fred Goodwin, the former chief executive, on a tight leash. Sir Tom is still embroiled in an awkward spat with Lord Myners, the City minister, over who said what to whom about Sir Fred’s politically embarrassing pension entitlement. And the fact that he and Mr Sutherland sat together on the RBS and BP boards is precisely the kind of cosy boardroom linkage that can give corporate governance a bad name.But still, Sir Tom took the right decision. To assume that non-executive directors’ work at different companies should be judged in isolation makes no sense, particularly as the clients – institutional shareholders – are often the same.Musical chairsUBS and Credit Suisse, the two giants of Swiss banking, have long been the best of enemies. It was rare, virtually unheard of, for a UBS banker to switch sides to Credit Suisse and vice-versa.In recent years, however, this tradition has been steadily eroded – at least at lower management levels. Last year, perhaps as a result of the mounting problems at UBS, the tempo intensified in the Swiss game of musical chairs, with two senior UBS executives moving to Credit Suisse.First to go was Paul Arni, former UBS head of private banking for Switzerland, to take charge of Credit Suisse’s Zurich region. A week later, Hans-Ulrich Meister, a UBS veteran who headed its Swiss business banking division, was put in charge of Credit Suisse’s domestic banking activities.The irony is that Mr Meister replaced Ulrich Körner at Credit Suisse, who was appointed Wednesday the new UBS chief operating officer by Oswald Grübel, the bank’s chief executive. Mr Grübel is a former Credit Suisse chief executive recently dragged out of retirement to try to sort out the mess at UBS.Mr Grübel’s move to UBS is by far the most spectacular example of how things are changing in the Swiss banking industry. He clearly intends to bring a new broom to UBS and seems to have little hesitation to recruit some of his veteran Credit Suisse lieutenants to assist him in this task.Whether he will be able to attract other Credit Suisse bankers to jump ship is another question. Swapping a good job at Credit Suisse to join the beleaguered UBS seems pretty risky, especially since UBS is hardly in a position to splash out with the sort of politically incorrect money necessary to lure talent. The tempo is likely to become more adagio than allegro in the Credit Suisse-UBS musical chairs.world.view@ft.com"
181;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2009-03-27T20:35:22Z;Flagging financial stocks a drag on Wall Street;;US stocks dropped on Friday after a third consecutive positive week put the benchmark S&P 500 index on course for its highest monthly rise since 1991.Financial stocks were the heaviest fallers, with banks slumping after Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan and Ken Lewis, head of Bank of America said results had deteriorated in March.Mr Dimon also said he had no timetable for repaying money taken from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (Tarp).He was talking after a meeting between bank bosses and President Barack Obama. All parties said it had been a constructive meeting, but Mr Dimon’s comments caused JPMorgan’s shares to fall nearly 4 per cent in two minutes.JPMorgan’s shares closed 5.8 per cent down at $27.40, while Citigroup ended 6.8 per cent lower at $2.62 and Bank of America fell 3.2 per cent to $7.34.Tech stocks also gave up some of their gains after a strong week. Intelregistered $1bn of stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission late on Thursday for potential use in acquisitions.Although it did not name a specific target, its shares fell on the news, losing 2.5 per cent to $15.42 in morning trade.Other technology companies also looked set to pare recent gains. Apple lost 2.8 per cent to $106.85. Microsoftfell 3.7 per cent to $18.13 and IBM gave up 4.7 per cent to $94.15.The S&P 500 lost 2 per cent to 815.94 points while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 1.9 per cent to 7,776.18 points and the Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.6 per cent to 1,545.20 points.But the three indices are now up between 6 and 7 per cent for the week, holding on to gains made on the back of US Treasury secretary Tim Geithner’s plan to clear banks’ balance sheets.Some analysts warned that the recent rally, which has taken the S&P up 11.1 per cent for the month to date, is not based on any fundamental improvement to the outlook for companies.Noting that the market was adopting a wait-and-see approach, Jerry Webman, chief economist at Oppenheimer Funds, said: “If we see an improvement in earnings when they are reported, we should see a lot of people enter the market but I think the big name companies will struggle to do that.”Data showing that personal spending rose 0.2 per cent for February failed to lift stocks, with most analysts having predicted similar figures.Homebuilder KB Homereported a loss for the first quarter before the market opened but this was narrower than analysts had predicted.The US Department of Commerce said this week that purchases of new homes had unexpectedly risen for February and KB’s results reflected some of that strength. Its shares gained 6.3 per cent to $15.05.General Motors also performed well, gaining 6.2 per cent to $3.62 after the FT reported that it was creating a third version of its viability plan to take account of continued weakness from new vehicle sales.It was also helped by Bloomberg reports that the company might sell a stake in its European operation, Opel, as part of plans to raise €3.3bn.Commodity prices fell however, having hit highs for the year on Thursday. Metals prices fell and Newmont Mining, the gold miner, lost 2.7 per cent to $45.65. Freeport McMoRan, which also mines gold, lost 2.2 per cent to $42.12. Alcoa, the aluminium manufacturer, gave up 3.9 per cent to $7.80.Oil prices fell, having hit highs for the year earlier in the week, and shares in energy companies followed them downwards. Chevron dropped 1.8 per cent to $68.90 and ExxonMobil fell 1.8 per cent to $69.98.But there was good news for JC Penney after JPMorgan upgraded the company, saying it was close to renegotiating its debt, which has been a weight on the share price. Its shares rose 6.7 per cent to $21.49.
182;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2009-03-26T20:41:02Z;Wall Street rallies despite falling financials;;"US stocks rallied strongly on Thursday to put the benchmark S&P 500 index on course for its biggest monthly gain since 1974.Strength in the cash-rich technology sector, meanwhile, meant the Nasdaq Composite index is now in positive territory for the year.The S&P 500 rose 2.3 per cent to 832.86 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.3 per cent to 7,924.56. The Nasdaq Composite index surged 3.8 per cent to 1,587, putting it 0.6 per cent up for 2009.Technology stocks continued their good performance for the year. Apple gained 3.2 per cent to $109.87 and Hewlett Packard rose 7.1 per cent to $33.20.Paychex, the payroll services company, was the biggest gainer on the index, up 9.6 per cent to $25.88 after it reported better results than expected.This came despite weakness in the banking sector after Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, said there would be “new rules of the game” for financial regulation.Confidence in the sector was already fragile after Moody’s, the credit ratings agency, downgraded Bank of America’s debt and investors took the opportunity to take profits after a month’s strong gains.Bank of America fell 1.6 per cent to $7.58, Citigroup dropped 4.8 per cent to $2.81 and Wells Fargo lost 2.9 per cent to $15.95.“Any time there is any dose of uncertainty addedto the landscape, investors are going to take profits,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at
The Hartford.The market also continued to adjust to Mr Geithner’s plan to clear the banks of their toxic assets, with some analysts warning it might be bad for banks’ shareholders in the long run.“It might save the banks, but that doesn’t mean it will save their shareholders,” he said. “They might be left with something that’s not particularly profitable,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channelcapitalresearch.com.The banking falls were exacerbated by figures showing that the US economy continues to deteriorate, with the number of people continuing to claim jobless benefits hitting record highs.Gross domestic product, meanwhile, fell 6.3 per cent on an annualised basis in the last three months of 2008, although this was better than analysts expected.But banks failed to drag down the market as better- than-expected company results and rising commodity prices counteracted negative economic data.Shares also rallied strongly in the afternoon after a successful auction of seven-year Treasury notes raised hopes the government would be able to fund its stimulus plans.Strong commodities helped industrial companies perform better than any other sector. As metals prices rose, mining companies saw the benefit. Newmont Mining gained 2.3 per cent to $46.90 and Freeport McMoRan picked up 5.9 per cent to $43.05. Caterpillar, which makes mining machinery, rose 6.5 per cent to $30.78.Consumer companies also performed well after positive results showed consumer spending had not collapsed as badly as feared.In the food and drinks sector, Conagra and Dr Pepper Snapple exceeded expectations.Conagra, the frozen food maker, rose 9.2 per cent to $16.99 after it said it expected its consumer foods business, which accounts for the majority of its sales, to improve in the second half of the fiscal year.Dr Pepper Snapple gained 15.2 per cent to $17.87, having made 39 cents in earnings per share excluding certain items.Best Buy, the electronics retailer, provided further evidence that consumer spending remained more resilient than estimated as it reported better revenues and earnings than expected.The company forecast that it would beat analysts’ predictions for its 2010 profits. It was one of the highest risers in the S&P, jumping 12.6 per cent to $37.67.The figures helped lift other consumer companies including Wal-Mart, which rose 2.1 per cent to $52.76.General Motors surged after reports said the company had agreed plans
with 6,000 of its staff who belong to the United Auto Workers union to take buy-out offers. This was more than analysts had expected, and GM’s stock rose 14.1 per cent to $3.41."
183;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Gold rises while oil rebounds;;Gold extended its push above the $900-an-ounce level on Thursday amid fears that the global financial crisis could deteriorate into an aggressive currency war.Meanwhile oil prices staged a rebound as traders looked forward to an Opec meeting this weekend.Gold rose 2 per cent to $925 a troy ounce, moving between a low of $906.95 and a high of $930.45, as bullion’s appeal as a store of value in times of financial instability was underlined by talk of a currency war after the Swiss National Bank said it had intervened to weaken the franc.Also supporting gold prices were signs of a revival in investor inflows into gold exchange-traded funds after a pause since late February.The SPDR Gold Trust, the largest physically backed ETF, recorded its first inflow since February 26 with holdings rising 9.18 tonnes to 1,038.17 tonnes, a record high.Gold production trends in South Africa and China continued to diverge at the start of 2009. South Africa’s gold output dropped 8.7 per cent year-on-year in January with production affected by interruptions to power supplies.China’s gold output in the first two months of 2009 was up 14.3 per cent year-on-year.Richard O’Brien, chief executive of Newmont Mining, the world’s second-largest gold producer, said on Wednesday that gold prices would trade between $900 and $1,200 an ounce over the next few years, supported by lower industry output and inflation concerns.US natural gas prices rose after a larger-than-expected drop in winter stocks, which fell 112bn cu ft – above the consensus forecast for a decline of 98bn cu ft.Nymex April Henry Hub rose 10.1 cents, or 2.6 per cent, to $3.897 per million Btu.Oil prices rebounded after a sharp fall in the previous session with ICE April Brent up $2.90 at $44.30 a barrel while Nymex April West Texas Intermediate gained $3.12 at $45.45 a barrel.Ahead of Opec’s meeting this weekend to discuss possible supply cuts, traders deciphered mixed signals from various members of the oil producers’ group.Qatar said full compliance by Opec’s members with previous supply cuts was needed before a further reduction in output should be considered. However, officials in Kuwait called for another production cut of a million barrels a day to push oil prices back towards $75 a barrel.Traders were also asking if Russia, now the world’s largest oil producer, might cut supplies as the Kremlin has expressed formal interest in co-operating with Opec.“Co-operation [with Opec] would also further underscore the re-emergence of Russia as an important power, particularly in a move that would be perceived by Washington as undermining US influence in both the Middle East and the global economy,” said Walter de Wet, of Standard Bank.Base metals were mixed after China released weaker-than-expected industrial production data for January-February with year-on-year growth slowing to 3.8 per cent, down from 5.7 per cent in December.Copper rose 0.5 per cent to $3,605 a tonne while aluminium added 0.7 per cent at $1,340 a tonne.Alcoa, the US aluminium producer, said it expected global aluminium consumption to drop by 6-7 per cent this year.Nickel fell 1.7 per cent to $9,580 a tonne amid concerns about continued weakness in global steel production.
184;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2009-03-11T20:38:34Z;Financials continue gains on Wall Street;;US stocks held on to modest gains on Wednesday in a choppy session as equity markets closed up for their second consecutive session for the first time in a month.Banks had surged during early trade on the back of comments from Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, that he would “do what is necessary” to stem the recession. He also said the government would use the promise of federal loans to entice investors to buy distressed assets from banks, while offering sellers capital injections.Financial shares received another boost late in the day when Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan, told CNBC that his bank had been profitable for the first two months of the year. JPMorgan gained 4.6 per cent to $20.40, while Citigroup closed 6.2 per cent up to $1.54 and Bank of America rose 2.9 per cent to $4.93.Confidence in banking stocks was also given a lift by figures showing that mortgage applications had risen 11.3 per cent for the week ending March 6.But the Mortgage Bankers Association was careful to say that this was largely fuelled by existing homeowners refinancing rather than new buyers entering the market.Sentiment was further helped when Goldman Sachs said it believed a number of financial institutions would be able to pay back money received under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (Tarp) over the next year. They included Morgan Stanley and US Bancorp, which rose 8 per cent to $22.51 and 9 per cent to $12.42 respectively.But American Express fell after being downgraded by Goldman Sachs from “neutral” to “conviction sell”. Fears over bad debts in the credit card industry have increased recently, and the company’s stock fell 2 per cent to $11.93.The gains made by financial companies were largely cancelled out by falls in the energy sector as the oil price plunged by around three dollars in late trade. Chevron’s shares lost 0.9 per cent to $61.22, while Exxon Mobilfell 2.4 per cent to $65.77.There were also significant falls for healthcare companies. McKesson the largest US drug distributor, dropped 17.1 per cent to $34.77 after Deutsche Bank said its earning might suffer as a result of drug store bankruptcies.Fellow drug distributors Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen also lost out. They fell 9.8 per cent to $28.59 and 9.7 per cent to $28.19 respectively. The sector as a whole, which has taken a a battering since President Obama said subsidies to healthcare companies would be cut to pay for his administration’s reforms, fell 2 per cent.Overall the benchmark S&P 500 index gained 0.2 per cent to 721.36 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average picked up 0.1 per cent to 6,930.40.But Nick Kalivas, an analyst at MF Global, warned: “With restrictions on short-selling about to be reinstated, this is the market repositioning itself. But those things do not solve the problem. No major policy change has come out of Washington, which is a headwind to a lasting rally.”The Nasdaq Composite index outperformed the other two measures, however, boosted by strong performance from technology stocks. It rose 1 per cent to 1,371.64.Hewlett Packard rose 5.8 per cent to $28.61 after UBS upgraded the company to “buy”. UBS said market sentiment on the company was overly bearish, and this helped push shares in Appleup 4.6 per cent to $92.68 and in IBM up 1.6 per cent to $88.62.But National Semiconductor, the chip manufacturer, fared badly after reporting earnings of 9 cents a share, which was below analysts’ forecasts. Its shares fell 2.7 per cent to $11.38.Mining companies also did well on the back of a rise in the price of precious metals. Newmont , the gold miner, picked up 4.7 per cent to $36.66. Freeport McMoRan, the copper miner, rose 4.1 per cent to $35.56.“I think gold is in a great bull market at the moment,” said Rob Lutts, chief investment officer at Cabot Money Management. “As currencies continue to lose ground, we will see many further upward movements in gold.”But the fragility of consumer confidence and spending was highlighted by worse results than expected from Staples the office supplies store, as weak revenues took their toll. The company’s shares fell 1.7 per cent to $15.47.
185;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2009-02-17T21:41:00Z;Banks drive Wall St to new low for year;;Financial stocks were the hardest hit in a broad-based sell-off on Wall Street on Tuesday that pushed the market to its lowest level of the year.Big-name banks did particularly badly as the S&P 500 slumped beneath the psychologically significant 800 level for the first time since November, which prompted concerns among technical analysts that the benchmark index would test an 11-year low.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, closed on Tuesday within a hairsbreadth of a fresh low for the financial crisis.JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America lost 12.3 per cent to $21.65, 13.1 per cent to $13.69 and 12 per cent to $4.90, respectively, as fears of outright nationalisation of a key institution persisted and investors continued to seek clarity over the Obama administration’s plans to shore up the sector.“All eyes are on Washington,” said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford.Credit card stocks came under heavy selling pressure after American Express, down 11.3 per cent to $13.96, warned that credit card delinquencies rose last month.Meanwhile, Capital One also warned defaults on its US-issued cards rose last month, prompting fears that the bank’s dividend was at risk. The shares dropped 16.4 per cent to $10.13, which Friedman, Billings, Ramsey analyst Scott Valentin said was “driven by misplaced chatter over a debt covenant breach.”Regional banks did badly, down 8.7 per cent overall, while the financial sector shed 9.8 per cent.The consumer staples sector failed to find positive territory in spite of better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings from Wal-Mart, which were helped by strong sales.The world’s largest retailer was one of only eight stocks in the S&P 500 to find positive territory, up 3.7 per cent to $48.24.Although the best performing of the main sectors, consumer staples nevertheless shed 1.8 per cent overall as all 10 industry groups finished sharply in the red.Meanwhile, investors remained concerned that Washington’s $787bn economic stimulus package – which President Obama signed into law on Tuesday– may not be enough to stave-off a deepening recession.“They don’t think the stimulus, the way it’s been presented, is going to do much to the economy in the short term,” Pran Tiku, president of Peak Financial Management, said of the market’s participants. “They have nothing to hang their hat on.”The S&P closed down 4.6 per cent at 789.17, less than 5 per cent away from an 11-year low hit last autumn. The index began the year more than 20 per cent above that nadir.The Dow finished down 3.8 per cent to 7,552.60 and the Nasdaq Composite Index down 4.2 per cent at 1,470.66. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, a measure of anxiety known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, leapt 12.9 per cent to 48.5.Concerns over the Obama administration’s ability to support the banking sector had pushed financial shares lower in recent sessions.The industrial sector also came under heavy selling pressure after data from the New York Federal Reserve showed manufacturing production in the state fell to its lowest level of the recession so far.Also weighing on the market, General Motors and Chrysler were expected to make clear that they need more government support than the $17.4bn already approved. GM shares were off 12.8 per cent to $2.18 while Ford, which has not yet received any bail-out funds, fell 4 per cent to $1.69.Commodity stocks also did badly. Freeport-Mcmoran dropped 11.1 per cent to $27.12 while energy stocks such as Exxon Mobil, off 4.4 per cent to $71.28, did badly as oil prices fell sharply.However, Newmont Mining jumped 3.4 per cent to $12.49 as gold prices rallied.Elsewhere, Coca-Cola gave back 2.9 per cent to $42.60 following a reasonable performance last week on the back of well-received results. Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling, its second-biggest bottler, disclosed an unexpected fourth-quarter loss and warned it could not provide a forecast for the year.The US markets were closed in the previous session due to the President’s Day holiday.
186;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2009-01-28T11:50:53Z;Anglogold sells stake in Australian mine for $1bn;;Newmont Mining, the world’s second-biggest gold miner, is paying $1bn to buy out Anglogold Ashanti’s minority share in what is set to become Australia’s biggest gold mine.The transaction will give Colorado-based Newmont 100 per cent control of Boddington Gold Mine in Western Australia, an asset it believes will be relatively cheap to mine.For Anglogold, formerly the gold arm of mining giant Anglo American and the world’s third-largest producer of the yellow metal, the bulk of the cash will be used to pay down a ”substantial” part of the $1bn bridging loan it agreed with a syndicate of banks late last year.The Johannesburg-based company is also looking to divest what it sees as non-core assets, focusing on operations in Africa and elsewhere. It says it needs to ensure ”financial flexibility” during a stormy time for commodity companies.“This transaction leaves the company positioned extremely well to take advantage of any new opportunities in the current economic and financing environment,” said Mark Cutifani, Anglogold’s chief executive.The deal increases Newmont’s share of proven and probable gold reserves at Boddington by 6.6m ounces to 20.1m ounces . At Wednesday’s gold price of nearly $887 an ounce, the additional reserves would have a gross value of $5.9bn.Newmont expects the nearly completed mine, located 130km outside Perth, to yield about 1m ounces a year once it is fully operational at costs of some $300 an ounce, making extraction there relatively cheap compared with deeper or wetter mines elsewhere.Anglogold will be able to use $750m of the proceeds to cut its net debt from $1.3bn as of September to $550m with immediate effect and the balance will follow either in cash or Newmont shares in December.The ratio of Anglogold’s net debt to earnings before interest, tax, amortisation and depreciation would be reduced from 1.13:1 to 0.5:1.The company is still wrestling with a large hedge book of unattractive forward sales contracts it acquired along with the purchase of Ashanti in 2004. The improved ratio will, the company hopes, allow it to reduce its cost of capital should it need to borrow more to reduce the hedge book or invest elsewhere.Anglogold’s Johannesburg-listed shares were up fractionally despite a fall in the gold price on Wednesday.
187;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-09T15:05:26Z;Lockdown life puts a strain on lawyers’ mental health;Homeworkers look to video apps and virtual tools to replace human interaction with colleagues and clients;Lawyers’ mental health is taking a hit as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with studies finding partners and associates feeling stressed and isolated.Covid-19 has triggered global lockdowns and forced the legal industry to adapt to suddenly ubiquitous technologies such as videoconferencing platforms Zoom and Google Hangouts.Use of these tools has ensured the smooth running of much of the lawyers’ output but they have reported a toll on their mental health, which they blame on the lack of face-to-face interaction with colleagues and others.According to LawCare, a UK legal mental health charity, calls about the effects of coronavirus accounted for half of its helpline traffic since March 10. Lawyers reported feeling lonely and anxious about their health and job security.“The main thing people are calling about is pressure to go into work and not being allowed to work from home,” says Elizabeth Rimmer, LawCare chief executive. “We had one call very recently from someone with a family member with [Covid-19] symptoms who was not allowed to work from home.”Others are dealing with anxiety connected to homeworking, she says. “Particularly younger lawyers are feeling that they are on their own and haven’t got someone they can easily ask about things.”Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videocon drinks as a way of retaining a sense of team bonding, or offering courses such as meditation onlineA worldwide survey of 108 lawyers and law firm staff at all levels of seniority by RSG Consulting, the FT’s Innovative Lawyers research partner, also found isolation and lack of interaction constituted one of the main challenges of remote working, Women were twice as likely as men to report being affected by this.Most solicitors — and particularly more junior lawyers — are used to working closely within a team, often under high-pressure and close knit conditions that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual world.According to RSG, some 14 per cent of associates surveyed cited isolation and lack of personal interaction as the main challenge of working from home, compared to just 6 per cent of equity partners.“We are trying to keep morale up but it’s worse for the younger lawyers who are often alone in flats in London and feel more alone than the lawyers with families,” says one senior lawyer at a US firm based in the capital.Firms are instigating virtual hang-outs including Friday night videoconference drinks as a way of boosting morale and retaining a sense of team bonding. Other offerings include online courses in mindfulness and meditation.Some firms have devised similar systems to mirror human interaction via a screen. Linklaters’ corporate team, for example, has set up a “virtual coffee room” that remains open 24 hours a day.“The idea is that if people want to go and have a cup of coffee and a chat they can go in and see who’s around. I got five associates the other day and we had a coffee together on the videocon line,” says James Inglis, corporate partner at Linklaters.Meanwhile teams are having to grapple with new ways of communicating, via Zoom, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or WhatsApp, which brings unique challenges.“We did have someone message our team WhatsApp group accidentally, inviting their friends round for dinner. Someone in our team responded asking if their friends could bring round some loo roll,” says one corporate partner.Some law firms, such as Mayer Brown, already had the infrastructure in place for employees to work from home, making the move to doing so full time during the pandemic more straightforward. Sally Davies, the senior partner in the London office of the international firm, says communication is critical, both internally and with clients.“We asked partners to set up regular calls with teams to listen and assess how people were coping,” she says.Often, the best technology is developed in times of crisisThe firm created an internal communications portal and a global messaging tool, and encouraged one-to-one virtual coffees particularly with new starters and trainees. It also set up response teams to act as central co-ordinators for client communications, though there is an expectation that every lawyer will reach out to their clients.Long-term positive changes may come from this: “We introduced [the online conferencing tool] Webex for all in a matter of a couple of weeks,” says Ms Davies. “Use the opportunity to develop new ways of working, a bit like [how] often the best technology is developed in times of crisis.”The fact that lawyers are used to working on deals and cases that cross jurisdictions and time zones means that most are used to handling matters remotely.“I have been practising law for 30 years in the City and in that time it has changed dramatically from requiring a physical presence for huge numbers of hours in the office, towards things like electronic data rooms where you don’t have to go anywhere to inspect documents,” says Simon Beddow, corporate partner at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.Transactional lawyers use “virtual deal rooms” in which document drafts are exchanged and questions answered in an entirely virtual world, sometimes without parties ever having to meet.However, not everything can be done in a virtual world. Site visits for due diligence purposes have been put on hold, which means that deals are paused, while company meetings that must take place in a certain physical location for tax reasons are kiboshed.Remote working has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with itCriminal lawyers are hampered too, in their inability to attend court. Jury trials were suspended in the UK last month in an attempt to safeguard those attending court, though some hearings can take place remotely.For others, however, the biggest change has been working-from-home attire and glimpses of each other’s home life.Charles Thomson, a litigator at global firm Baker McKenzie, says his team have been bringing pets to team Skype sessions and even showing up in their nightclothes to morning video calls.“We have been having daily videoconference catch-ups where some people are still in their pyjamas,” he says. “[Remote working] has been quite good for team morale so far because we’ve been having a bit of a laugh with it.”

Richard O’Reilly, Standard & Poor’s analyst, maintaining his “hold” recommendation on Dow’s target, said the Kuwait cancellation “calls into question” the planned $78-a-share acquisition.Citigroup warned that the move had “negative implications for [the] industry”, as it was a sign that North American ethylene assets were “less attractive” to Middle East suitors.Nova Chemicals, which Citi analyst PJ Juvekar highlighted as an example of the above, shed 3.3 per cent to $4.36.DuPont was one of the biggest losers on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, down 2 per cent to $24.49.“The biggest worry in the world today is the drying up in credit markets,” said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at Wachovia Securities. “It’s ‘when is it going to end?’ type of thinking.”Still, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average finished off their lows, each down 0.4 per cent at 869.42 and 8,483.93, respectively, in holiday-thinned trading. The Nasdaq Composite index closed down 1.3 per cent at 1,510.32.The energy sector provided support as escalating violence in the Middle East prompted a jump in oil prices. It was the only sector to find positive territory, up 1.9 per cent overall, as Israeli war planes continued their attacks on the Gaza Strip for a third day.Hess, Murphy Oil and Baker Hughes were the best-performing stocks on the S&P 500, up 6.5 per cent to $52.25, 6 per cent to $44.24 and 5.3 per cent to $31.18, respectively.Although the materials sector was the worst-performing, off 2.1 per cent, some stocks in the sector enjoyed reasonable gains.Newmont Mining was up 4.8 per cent to $40.70 as gold rallied.Elsewhere, Ford dropped 3.1 per cent to $2.22 on reports that Kirk Kerkorian, the billionaire investor who had invested about $1bn in the motor group, had sold his remaining stake.Real estate investment trusts, which have recently rallied from their lows, were among the biggest losers after SL Green Realty cut its quarterly dividend by more than half to 37.5 cents a share. Its shares tumbled 10.3 per cent to $24.42.Financials finished 1 per cent lower. Some observers said the sector, down 60 per cent overall in 2008, was particularly hard hit by year-end tax loss selling.The higher oil price put retailers under pressure, also pushed down amid concerns over the extent of poor sales performances. Gamestop and JC Penney were the hardest hit, down 5.1 per cent to $21.95 and 4.6 per cent to $17.84, respectively.Analysts continued to debate the outlook for US stocks, set for their worst annual performance since the Great Depression.Todd Salamone, of Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said technical indicators were a sign “that this is not a prudent time to be overly bullish”.The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility index, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, rose 1.1 per cent to 43.87 on Monday, which indicated heightened levels of distress. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell by 2.2 per cent to 466.15.“We have seen earnings for the small caps and the mid caps hold up better than the large caps, but it looks as if the fourth quarter might be a turning point,” wrote Merrill Lynch analysts in a small-cap strategy note to clients.The analysts, who forecast a drop of 14.6 per cent in fourth quarter earnings for small-cap stocks, added: “If the numbers come in as anticipated, it would mark the first time since the second quarter [of] 2007 in which the large caps’ earnings held up the best.”
189;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2008-08-15T20:50:21Z;Retailer strength helps lift Wall Street;;"US stocks climbed modestly on Friday in a quiet session of trading, and made slight gains for the week, as oil prices dropped back and investors digested some positive results from retailers.Kohl’s kicked off the day in positive fashion, reporting second-quarter profit that fell less than expected. The company also forecast full-year profit ahead of previous expectations and the shares rose 7.1 per cent to $51.70.JC Penney also cheered investors with a smaller- than-expected decline in
second-quarter profit. JC Penney shares rose 8.4 per cent to $39.94.Meanwhile, Abercrombie & Fitch, the teen-focused clothing retailer, and Nordstrom, the department store chain, posted less impressive results but investors were resilient. Abercrombie held steady at $52.59 while Nordstrom rose 4.4 per cent to $31.54.The consumer discretionary sector added 1 per cent. Retailers have outperformed this earnings season, with S&P 500 constituents posting profit declines of about 5 per cent on average. That compares with an average drop of 23 per cent for S&P 500 companies.The leading equity indices received a boost from a sharp fall in commodity prices. Oil fell as much as $3 while gold dropped well below $800.Bijal Shah, global chief economist at Société Générale, said: “US consumer firepower, which had been decimated by the sharp rise in energy prices into the summer months . . . is likely to recover over the coming months.”In consumer staples, Wal-Mart Stores added 2.2 per cent to $59.37 and Procter & Gambleclimbed 2.7 per cent to $71.60, helping the sector to advance 1 per cent.Reports showing a small uptick in consumer confidence and a bump in manufacturing activity in New York state in August also lifted sentiment.General Electric shares rose 1 per cent to $29.80 while Manitowoc added 4.5 per cent to $24.96 and Paccar climbed 4.8 per cent to $44.81.Eight of the 10 leading industry groups gained ground, helping the benchmark S&P 500 advance 0.4 per cent to 1,298.2.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4 per cent to 11,659.9 and the Nasdaq Composite edged down 0.1 per cent to 2,452.52.Over another volatile week in which oil prices ticked higher before resuming their retreat, the S&P 500 fought its way to a 0.1 per cent gain – its third in a row. The Dow fell 0.7 per cent while the Nasdaq added 1.4 per cent.Consumer discretionary stocks were the best performers this week, adding 2.4 per cent, thanks to some solid earnings reports from the likes of Estée Lauder.Financials were the biggest losers after another round of writedowns and analyst downgrades and further developments in the auction rate securities fiasco.Goldman Sachs fell 7.5 per cent to $163.18 over the week while JPMorgan lost 8.2 per cent to $38.07 and Bank of America slid 5.6 per cent to $30.70.On Friday, banks fared better after S&P affirmed the credit ratings of the two largest bond insurers. MBIA and Ambac added 8.7 per cent to $11.22 and 24.6 per cent to $5.68, respectively, while the sector added 1.1 per cent.Jim Smigiel, head of investment strategy at SEI, said: “The Ambacs and MBIAs of the world are going to survive - that is how low the bar is at this point. Valuations are such that you don’t have to paint the rosiest picture to make gains in this market.”The pullback in commodities was less kind to energy and materials stocks.On Friday, Newmont Mining slid 3.2 per cent to $41.51, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold dropped 2.8 per cent to $84.39 while US Steel fell 3 per cent to $130.88.The energy sector fell back 1.8 per cent and has now lost ground in seven of the past eight sessions. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips gave up 0.5 per cent to $77.07 and 2.2 per cent to $77.66, respectively."
190;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2008-07-24T20:44:53Z;Sharp fall in financials hurts Wall Street;;Wall Street stocks fell on Thursday as concerns about further losses on mortgage-related assets and the prospect of increased regulation sent financial stocks to their biggest one-day falls since the start of the credit crisis.Since July 15, the S&P 500 has rallied more than 3.1 per cent, triggered by falling oil prices and a 21.5 per cent gain for financial shares after surprisingly solid results from JPMorgan and Wells Fargo.Financials gave up a chunk of those gains on Thursday after Bill Gross, who manages Pimco, the world’s largest bond fund, said in a letter to clients that the housing crisis could force financial firms to take $1,000bn in writedowns.As if to underline that possibility the National Association of Realtors said sales in June of existing homes fell to the lowest level in a decade, knocking an index of homebuilder stocks down 15.2 per cent.Brian Gendreau, an investment strategist at ING Investment Management, said: “About two thirds of US bank loans are real estate related and with that much exposure it is hard to think that we are going to get a sustained turnaround in the financial sector until the housing market stabilises.”At the same time Christopher Cox, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, asked lawmakers to compel investment banks to submit to SEC oversight and mooted forcing short-sellers to reveal any “substantial” holdings.Citigroup fell 9.8 per cent to $19.06, Bank of America slipped 8.4 per cent to $30.64 and JPMorgan lost 6.7 per cent to $39.14. The S&P 500 financials index gave back 6.7 per cent.Some of the most volatile stocks of recent weeks also came under pressure. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac slid 19.9 per cent to $12.02 and 18.4 per cent to $8.81 while Merrill Lynch lost 14.1 per cent to $29.04 and Lehman Brothers dropped 12.2 per cent to $18.52.National City, the Ohio-based bank, reported a $1.76bn second-quarter loss – far more than expected and set aside more money to cover bad loans.The shares limited their losses to 0.9 per cent at $4.67 after Peter Raskind, chief executive, said the bank had sufficient capital.New data, showing that initial jobless claims jumped last week to the highest level in almost four months, did little to improve the mood.All 10 leading industry groups were in the red, knocking the benchmark S&P 500 down 2.3 per cent to 1,252.54 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2.4 per cent to 11,349.28 points, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 2 per cent to 2,280.11 points.In the background, crude oil prices popped above $125 a barrel, putting pressure on consumer-facing stocks.In the consumer discretionary sector, Jones Apparel lost 6.3 per cent to $15.25 and Dillard’s dipped 10.3 per cent to $10.49 while the sector lost 2.8 per cent.Carmakers and hotels were particularly hard hit after disappointing second-quarter results and full-year profit forecasts from Ford and Starwood Hotels respectively. Ford fell 15.3 per cent to $5.11 while Starwood slid 11.5 per cent to $35.26.There were some bright spots. Amazon and Radio Shack both reported estimate-beating second-quarter results. The shares rose 11.6 per cent to $78.72 and 13.8 per cent to $15.95 respectively.In the industrial sector, better than expected earnings from industrial bellwether 3M, Cooper Industries and Union Pacific could do little to spark buying interest.Shares in 3M rose 0.4 per cent to $71.05, Cooper added 2 per cent to $44.35 while Union dipped 0.2 per cent to $77.18, however the sector dropped 2.5 per cent.Healthcare was the only sector in positive territory for much of the day but it too gave up gains at the close in spite of upbeat results news from Eli Lilly and Bristol-Myers Squibb. The pair received a boost from sales of psychiatric drugs and a weak dollar and their shares rose 0,8 per cent to $48 and 1.1 per cent to $22.12 respectively. Higher commodity prices did little for energy and materials stocks and the sectors lost 0.6 per cent and 2.2 per cent respectively.Newmont Mining was an exception rising 3.9 per cent to $48.77, aided by its estimate-beating second-quarter profits.
191;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2008-07-10T20:39:13Z;Wall St shrugs off sell-off in financials;;Wall Street stocks shrugged off a run on Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae shares and a spike in oil prices on Thursday to rally modestly as deal news cheered investors.Speculation that the government-sponsored mortgage giants might need to raise more capital and could have trouble doing so led to a steep sector sell-off on Wednesday that dragged the S&P 500 into a bear market for the first time since 2002.The slide continued on Thursday after analysts at UBS cut their 2008 and 2009 operating earnings estimates for Freddie and slashed their price target for the shares from $28 to $10.“We remain cautious on the shares, given continued credit deterioration and the challenges of raising capital,” the analysts said.But comments from Hank Paulson, US Treasury secretary, that regulators felt the mortgage finance giants were “adequately capitalised” in the face of a “challenging period” helped limit the decline.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lost as much as 24 per cent and 34 per cent, respectively, before recovering slightly. The pair closed down 13.8 per cent to $13.20 and 22 per cent to $8 respectively while the financials sector as a whole lost 0.9 per cent.Lehman Brothers shares also came under pressure. Bond manager Pimco denied it was scaling down business with the brokerage but the shares slumped 12.4 per cent to $17.30 on the rumours.Matthew Albrecht, an analyst at S&P Equity Research, said: “Lehman is seen as the most vulnerable of the big investment banks, and the shares have reacted accordingly.”Deal news provided some added consolation for battered investors.Dow Chemical agreed to buy smaller rival Rohm & Haas for about $18.8bn. Rohm shares surged 64 per cent to $73.62 while Dow slipped 4.2 per cent to $32.52.Rebounding metals stocks also helped the sector and, by midday, it was the leading gainer, adding 2.5 per cent.US Steel, Alcoa and Newmont Mining rose 4.6 per cent to $165.39, 9.7 per cent to $34.60 and 3.5 per cent to $49.18, respectively.Meanwhile, General Electric shares advanced after the company said it would spin off its entire consumer and industrial segment to existing shareholders. GE shares rose 1.7 per cent to $27.64, helping the industrials to advance 1.2 per cent.After a choppy day of trading, the benchmark S&P 500 closed up 0.7 per cent at 1,253.40. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose 0.7 per cent to 11,229.02 while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1 per cent to 2,257.85.“It seems nothing short of a small miracle to see major indices trading modestly in positive territory, given scuttle out of the financial space that on another day might spark an across-the-board panic,” analysts at Interactive Brokers said.But that resilience could prove shortlived as concerns about the financial sector remain pressing.Morgan Stanley expects more weakness at large-cap US banks. The brokerage cut its 2008 earnings estimates for non-processor banks by about 37 per cent and about 37 per cent in 2009. It expects expects that cumulative loans losses of $314bn, of which only $49bn have been taken so far, and as much as $51bn in additional capital-raisings.In the background, the housing crisis rumbled on. According to RealtyTrac, the default data provider, foreclosure filings rose 53 per cent in June compared with a year earlier while bank repossessions almost tripled.The S&P 500 homebuilder index fell to its lowest level in almost seven years.A $5 spike in crude oil prices helped the energy sector snap a five-session losing streak and add 2.7 per cent. Higher oil prices were less positive for consumer-facing stocks, overshadowing better-than-expected June same-stores sales data.JC Penney fell 10.1 per cent to $31.93 while Macy’s lost 9.2 per cent to $16.39. The consumer discretionary sector fell 1.7 per cent.Earnings news was mixed. Marriott International, the hotel chain, said profit fell in the second quarter as surging oil prices dented consumer and corporate appetites for travel. Its shares slipped 7.2 per cent to $24.07.Ruby Tuesday, however, jumped 18 per cent to $6.24 after the restaurant chain owner forecast annual profit that was higher than analysts expected.
192;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2008-07-02T20:38:07Z;US blue chips buckle under latest oil blow;;Surging oil prices sent US stocks into a tailspin on Wednesday, knocking the S&P 500 below its March lows for the first time and sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average scuttling into bear market territory - down 20 per cent from its recent peak.The benchmark S&P 500 wobbled between gains and losses but closed the day 1.8 per cent lower at 1,261.53 points - its lowest level since July 2006.Technical analysts have warned that a break through the ‘Bear Stearns’ bottom could lead to further sustained weakness with the index retesting its 2002 lows.The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.8 per cent to 11,215.51 while the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.5 per cent to 2,292.94. Both are now down more than 20 per cent from their recent peaks.Oil prices smashed through $143 a barrel after a government inventory report showed a sharp drop in crude oil supplies, knocking all ten leading industry groups on the S&P500 into the red.Rising oil prices have been a constant scourge for equity markets in recent months, raising the spectre of spiralling input costs and tumbling corporate profits.The biggest faller on Wednesday was the material sector, which lost 5.3 per cent - its biggest one day fall since March.Energy intensive steel producers fell for a third day. US Steel lost 12.5 per cent to $153.40 and Nucor dropped 14.2 per cent to $61.94.Gold miners also fell back as gold prices dropped. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold dropped 6.9 per cent to $107.57 while Newmont Mining lost 4.5 per cent to $50.99.The energy sector also dragged. Coal stocks were the weak link, tumbling as European prices fell the most since 2005. Massey Energy and Consol Energy fell 18.9 per cent to $74.87 and 14.6 per cent to $95.57 respectively.In industrials, transport-related stocks suffered. CSX fell 6.4 per cent to $57.06 while Paccar lost 7 per cent to $39.86.The day began in a positive fashion after European banks dismissed speculation that they would have to raise more cash, bolstering their US peers.But gains were erased after another rash of analyst downgrades while comments by Hank Paulson also took their toll. The Treasury secretary proposed the president should have to approve any use of taxpayer funds to aid a financial company in trouble.Citigroup fell 1.7 per cent to $16.84 while Merrill lost 3.4 per cent to $31.15. The financial sector as a whole slipped 1.4 per cent.Macroeconomic news did little to improve the mood. New data from the Commerce Department showed US factory orders climbed a faster-than-expected 0.6 per cent in May for a third monthly increase.Any positive momentum was curtailed by the ADP Employer Services report, which showed private companies cut jobs at four times the expected rate in June.Carmakers came under renewed pressure after analysts at Merrill Lynch punctured the euphoria surrounding General Motors sales figures, which were released on Tuesday.The brokerage downgraded GM from “buy” to “underperform” and cut its 2008 and 2009 earnings estimates, citing lower forecasts for US car sales and noting that “bankruptcy is not impossible.”GM fell 15.1 per cent to $9.98 while Ford dipped 7.4 per cent to $4.36.The consumer discretionary sector also slipped back 1.7 per cent as oil prices rose. Liz Claibornlost 6.6 per cent to $13.08 while Staplesfell 4.9 per cent to $23.12.Starbucks clung to a 0.4 per cent gain at $15.68, buoyed by plans to cut 7 per cent of its workforce and close 600 stores as part of efforts to revitalise the coffee chain.Blockbuster rose 5.8 per cent to $2.65 after it dropped a $1.35bn bid for Circuit City Stores the lossmaking electronics retailer. Circuit City shares slumped 9 per cent to $2.32.The technology sector was volatile. Semiconductors were the worst performing subsector, while software and services companies followed close behind.But there were exceptions. Yahoo climbed 3.4 per cent to $20.88 after the Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft had approached media companies about teaming up for a break-up deal. Microsoft fell 3.7 per cent to $25.88.Meanwhile, Dell shares rallied 2. per cent to $23.70 after chief executive Michael Dell revealed he had bought 4.5m shares in the company at between $21.89 and $22.39 since June 27.
193;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2008-05-20T20:51:07Z;Wall St hit by fears of prolonged credit crisis;;Wall Street stock markets were knocked off four-month highs on Tuesday after a rise in core inflation and record high oil prices threatened to trim corporate profits and a leading banking analyst said the credit crisis could extend well beyond 2009.The latest inflation figures gave a mixed picture of the price pressures on US businesses. Prices paid to producers in April, excluding food and fuel, rose twice as fast as forecast but a surprise decline in gasoline prices restrained overall increases to 0.2 per cent.Still, analysts said the trend was clear. “Inflation pressures are mounting and that is spooking the market,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners. “And of course record oil prices aren’t helping.”Crude prices pushed above $129 for the first time after billionaire investor T. Boone Pickens predicted oil could hit $150 and a number of analysts raised their price targets for 2008.The strains on the consumer of high fuel prices appear to be limited – so far. Home Depot joined the group of retailers who have posted first-quarter results that were not as bad as feared.The numbers were poor nonetheless. The home-improvement retailer said on Monday that net income slumped 66 per cent to $356m on revenue down 3.4 per cent to $17.9bn.Home Depot shares, which have lost about a quarter of their value in the last year, fell another 5.2 per cent to $27.37.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed the day down 0.9 per cent at 1,413.42 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.5 per cent lower at 12,828.68. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1 per cent to 2,492.26.On Monday US stocks pared gains in late trading but held on to close at their highest levels since early January after new data suggested that the US economy may skirt outright recession.Significant drag factors remain, foremost among which are the cascading effects of the credit crisis.According to Meredith Whitney and a team of analysts from Oppenheimer, the extended credit crisis will result in further multi-billion dollar revenue reversals at the major banks.“We believe the real harrowing days of the credit crisis are still in front of us and will prove more widespread in effect than anything yet seen,” Ms Whitney said.The culprit is less the writedowns themselves than the “shut-down” in the securitisation market which at its height provided 66 per cent of household borrowings in the first quarter of 2007.Without that market, consumer credit losses may be “far worse than what is currently estimated, even by the most draconian of investors”. Ms Whitney and her colleagues also slashed their 2008 earnings estimates for the large-cap banking stocks they cover by an average of 17 per cent.Financial stocks were among the leading fallers in the S&P 500, dropping 2.2 per cent while an index of investment banking shares also slumped 2.2 per cent.Morgan Stanley fell 3 per cent to $44.80, JPMorgan lost 5 per cent to $43.70 and Citigroup slipped 3.8 per cent to $22.11.Elsewhere, AIG, the insurer hit by massive subprime-related losses, said it would raise about 60 per cent more capital than it originally indicated in order to strengthen its balance sheet, knocking its share price 2.1 per cent to $38.12.On Tuesday, concerns about rising input costs, as well as a credit rating downgrade for a leading homebuilder, hurt the consumer discretionary sector in particular. The sector fell 1.6 per cent, led down by Centex and KB Home which lost 5.5 per cent to $21.81 and 5.5 per cent to $23.15 respectively.Amid the broader market malaise, energy was one of the few sectors to find any positive momentum. ConocoPhillips rose 0.9 per cent to $93.55, Chevron added 0.9 per cent to $103.09 and the broader sector climbed 0.8 per cent.After a strong run last week materials were largely flat on Tuesday, as rising gold prices weighed against analysts’ comments that weaker demand from China might result in soft metal prices. Newmont Mining rose 1.7 per cent to $49.88 but Alcoa fell 3.1 per cent to $43.23.Packaging stocks were also hit by a number of analyst downgrades. Sealed Air deflated, falling 4.4 per cent to $23.96 while Bemis dropped 4.1 per cent to $26.45.
194;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2008-05-05T20:30:26Z;Wall Street stocks lower as Yahoo slides;;Wall Street stocks slipped from recent highs on Monday, as oil broke through $120 a barrel and Yahoo tumbled after Microsoft withdrew its improved $46.5bn bid for the internet search company.Over the weekend Steve Ballmer, Microsoft chief executive, said the two companies had been unable to agree a price. The software giant had offered as much as $33 a share but Yahoo held out for $37 a share.The deal’s collapse brings to an end a series of long and at times bad-tempered negotiations. A combination of Microsoft and Yahoo could have transformed the technology sphere, creating an internet search company with the clout to take on Google’s overwhelming lead.Yahoo shares fell 15 per cent to $24.37 while Microsoft shares lost 0.6 per cent to $29.08.Markets briefly pared early losses after a report from the Institute for Supply Management showed that service industries in the US unexpectedly grew in April.But record high oil prices undercut positive sentiment, knocking 1.3 per cent off an index of consumer discretionary stocks. Limited Brands dropped 4.5 per cent to $17.82 while Macy’s fell 4.6 per cent to $25.09.Analysts at Wachovia estimate that consumers now spend 57 cents out of every dollar on core needs, such as food and transportation, eroding their ability to buy other items.The benchmark S&P 500 closed down for the first time in three sessions, dropping 0.5 per cent to 1,407.48 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7 per cent to 12,969.54 while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.5 per cent to 2,464.12 points.Last week, the leading indices hit their highest levels since early January. The S&P 500 rose above 1,400 points and the Dow Jones settled above 13,000.Economists gave credit for the improved tone to the Fed’s measures to pump liquidity into financial markets, better-than-expected macro-economic data and optimism about the upcoming fiscal stimulus package.Company results during the first quarter earnings season also avoided the blood-bath many had feared.With the peak reporting weeks over, 63 per cent of companies had revealed earnings above analysts’ reduced expectations, 11 per cent had met expectations and 26 per cent had missed expectations – a fairly typical distribution.But experts worry the equity market rally and resilient corporate profits will prove to be short-lived.Analysts at Goldman Sachs said: “This relaxation is unlikely to mark the start of a sustainable recovery. The main reason is that the gaping hole in the side of the US economy – namely the drop in house prices from their over-inflated levels – shows no signs of abating any time soon”.The woes of financials continue to make headlines and drag on equity markets. Countrywide Financial led the sector lower after analysts at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co said Bank of America should reduce or ditch its $4bn takeover of the embattled US mortgage lender. If the deal proceeds it could lead to writedowns of as much as $30bn, the analysts said. Countrywide fell 10.4 per cent to $5.36, Bank of America dipped 2.1 per cent to $38.97 while an index of financials lost 1.5 per cent.Unusually, Berkshire Hathaway, the company of investment guru Warren Buffett, was in the losers column on Monday. Berkshire shares dropped 2.7 per cent to $130,000 after it reported a fall in profits because of falling insurance rates and a hit from derivative contracts.In other deal news, Sprint Nextel shares climbed 10.5 per cent to $8.72 after reports that Deutsche Telekom was considering a bid for the struggling US company.The news was not enough to push the telecoms sector into the black as dismal results from Citizensweighed on sentiment. Citizens shares fell 6.8 per cent to $10.53, while an index of telecoms stocks dropped 0.5 per cent.Only materials and energy stocks were able to find any positive momentum as they followed commodity prices higher.Gold miners Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold and Newmont Mining climbed 5.2 per cent to $115.99 and 1.9 per cent to $45.35, respectively. Oil services companies Smith International and BJ Services added 3.5 per cent to $78.10 and 2.9 per cent to $28.36, respectively.
195;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2008-04-24T20:48:38Z;Wall Street rally led by financials;;Wall Street stocks rallied for a second day on Thursday as financials led markets higher and investors picked out the positive in a mixed batch of earnings reports.The day began in gloomy fashion as cautious outlook statements from several corporations, including Apple and Amazon, stirred fears of a consumer-spending slowdown.Materials and energy stocks, which have supported equity markets for much of the past few weeks, had their worst day in over a month, following commodity prices lower in spite of strong results from industry leaders.But an unexpected rally in financials helped wipe out those declines thanks to upgrades and strong results at a handful of insurance companies.Homebuilders contributed to the turn in sentiment after the National Association of Home Builders said the US housing market would begin to recover in the third quarter, brushing aside new data showing sales of new homes slumped in March.The benchmark S&P 500 erased losses of as much as 0.6 per cent to close up 0.6 per cent at 1,388.82 while the Nasdaq Composite ended 1 per cent higher at 2,428.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.7 per cent to 12,848.95.Financials advanced 3.8 per cent on Thursday, their biggest gain since the start of the month, as investors looking for a bottom to the market rotated out of energy stocks and into the downtrodden sector. T Rowe Price, the fund manager, led the gainers adding 11.8 per cent to $60.24 after posting its 20th straight quarterly increase in earnings.Insurers Travelers and Aflac added to that revival, climbing 4 per cent to $50.23 and 4.1 per cent to $67.76, respectively, after both beat first-quarter estimates and raised their full-year forecasts.Investment banks also made ground after the chief executive of Merrill Lynch said the firm would maintain its dividend. Merrill Lynch added 7.1 per cent to $48.09 while Lehman Brothers rose 6.2 per cent to $46.38.James McGlynn, portfolio manager of the Summit Everest Fund, said: “There was so much uncertainty going into the earnings season, people thought financials were going to drop another shoe, so the stocks have perhaps been overly discounted.”Mike Mayo, an analyst with Deutsche Bank, said: “The crises now seems closer to the end, albeit with lingering uncertainty related to monoline insurers, CDO dispositions and short-term money markets.”As oil slipped off its highs and the dollar rallied, giving consumers more wiggle room, JC Penney climbed 3.5 per cent to $41.97 while Macy’s added 5 per cent to $24.36.Ford led the consumer sector higher after the car group unexpectedly swung into profit in the first quarter as reduced costs offset weak US sales. Ford jumped 11.7 per cent to $8.40 while rival General Motors added 5.6 per cent to $22.11.Companies reliant on discretionary spending had initially found it hard going after several bellwethers cut forecasts and were sold by anxious investors.Starbucks tumbled 10.4 per cent to $15.99, Whirlpool, the appliance maker, slid 10.1 per cent to $73.89 and 3M lost 1.7 per cent to $79.25.Homebuilders helped the advance. Lennar added 7.9 per cent to $18.38 while Pulte Homes rose 5.4 per cent to $13.81.In technology, too, early despair gave way to enthusiasm. Better-than-expected results and forecasts from LSI pushed the sector into the black. The maker of storage chips advanced 20.8 per cent to $5.99.By the close, Apple, which added 15 per cent in the month running up to the results, was 3.7 per cent higher at $168.94. Amazon fell 4.1 per cent at $77.69.Energy and materials stocks were a drag on indices. Gold producer Newmont Mining said first-quarter profit rose fivefold thanks to record prices for bullion but its shares fell 2.1 per cent to $42.94, mimicking the pattern of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold on Wednesday. Freeport shares fell 3 per cent to $112.61 while energy groups Chevron and ConocoPhillips dropped 2.2 per cent to $92.40 and 1.8 per cent to $82.96.Industrials rose after Northrop Grumman, the shipbuilder, and Goodrich, the aerospace components maker, posted better-than-expected results. Goodrich shares jumped 9.7 per cent to $67.66 while Northrop climbed 4.4 per cent $72.55.
196;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2008-04-23T20:42:20Z;Wall St edges up amid positive results;;Wall Street stocks wobbled back into the black on Wednesday as positive earnings news from technology companies and Boeing helped offset weak results and forecasts from Ambac and UPS.A round of decent quarterly earnings helped make the technology sector one of the leading gainers in the S&P 500.Any momentum for the broader indices, however, was undercut by a pull-back in commodities prices, which encouraged investors to sell related stocks.Dismal results from Ambac, the punch-drunk bond insurer, dragged down financials although acquisitions news helped limit the declines.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 0.3 per cent higher at 1,379.98 while the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.2 per cent at 2,405.21. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.3 per cent to 12,763.22.Wednesday’s hesitant advance broke a two-day losing streak triggered by a batch of below-par reports but analysts are beginning to suggest that the worst fears for first-quarter earnings season were unfounded.Doug Peta, market strategist at J&W Seligman, said: “Earnings have been a pleasant surprise since we got past GE’s results …Markets always overshoot at the top and bottom and perhaps pessimism got overdone.”In technology, Molex, the electrical parts maker, surged 15.2 per cent to $28.56, VMware, the software company, gained 4.9 per cent to $60.84 and Broadcom, which makes chips for Nintendo’s Wii video-game console, jumped 16.3 per cent to $27.39.Meanwhile, Apple shares hit $162.70, adding 1.6 per cent to to its recent run after the company confirmed it had bought PA Semi, a microprocessor designer, for $278m in cash.After the close, the positive trend moderated somewhat as Amazon beat first-quarter earnings forecasts but said full-year operating income may be less than earlier predicted. Its shares fell 6.9 per cent to $75.40 in after- hours trading.In materials, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, the second-largest copper producer, said first-quarter profit more than doubled but still dropped 2.2 per cent to $116.08 as gold prices fell back. Peers Newmont Mining and Barrick Gold, also lost 1.8 per cent to $43.85 and 4.5 per cent to $40.78, respectively.Aircraft maker Boeing advanced after it said profit rose 38 per cent to $1.2bn in the first quarter as its backlog of orders grew to a record $346bn. Revenue rose 4 per cent to $16bn and the shares added 4.6 per cent to $82.19.Leading the negative surprises on Wednesday was Ambac Financial.The company undershot Wall Street’s worst expectations, posting a net loss of $1.7bn after a $3.1bn charge for subprime mortgage securities.Ambac shares, which have lost 93 per cent of their value in the past year, plunged 41.8 per cent to $3.51. Peer MBIA dived 33.6 per cent to $8.82.However, news that Liberty Mutual Group, the property and casualty insurer, had agreed to buy Safeco, a home and automobile insurer on the West Coast, for about $6.2bn in cash, helped limit the downside in the financial sector. Safeco shares jumped 45.8 per cent to $65.94.Better-than-expected results from Moody’s, the credit rating company, also helped steady the sector. Moody’s shares gained 2.6 per cent to $37.46 while McGraw-Hill, owner of rival Standard & Poor’s, added 3.3 per cent to $39.41.Downbeat results and comments on the US economy from UPS, the industrial bellwether, left investors largely unmoved. Its shares fell just 0.3 per cent to $71.67.The healthcare sector was in focus after results from WellPoint, the health insurer, and drugmaker Schering-Plough.WellPoint climbed 7.3 per cent to $49.94 after it said it would take aggressive remedial action to address a decline in first-quarter profit due to higher claims.Schering-Plough said profit declined 48 per cent to $291m because of costs associated with buying Organon Biosciences for $16bn in November – but the figure was ahead of most analysts’ estimates. Schering gained 6.6 per cent to $18.27.The day’s biggest gainer was the telecommunications sector, which added 2.2 per cent led by Sprint Nextel. Sprint climbed 8.8 per cent to $7.67 in what some analysts called a relief rally after AT&T’s solid results on Tuesday.
197;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2008-04-02T20:51:33Z;Wall St eases back in choppy session;;Wall Street stocks eased back in choppy session on Wednesday as investors took profits after Tuesday’s rally and digested a cautious view of the US economy from the Federal Reserve’s chairman.In testimony before congress Ben Bernanke alternately spooked and soothed, noting that the economy may contract in the first half but saying that it was unlikely that any other investment bank would require a Bear Stearns-like rescue. Still, traders and analysts noted that the market reaction was relatively muted after significant advances a day earlier and before crucial employment data due on Friday.Tom Schrader, managing director of US equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets, said: “We had a huge run Tuesday and I think it is a normal to retrace some of the gains we saw.” He added that surging oil prices late in the day had also dented equities.But fuel and commodity concerns were both the villain and the hero of the piece, knocking the broader markets but boosting energy and basic materials stocks.Exxon Mobil rose 1.7 per cent to $88.52 while ConocoPhillips climbed 1.4 per cent to $78.77.Gold producers Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold and Newmont Mining also rallied, adding 2.2 per cent to $99.73 and 3.3 per cent to $46.25 respectively.In New York the benchmark S&P 500 closed down for the first time in three days, dropping 0.2 per cent to 1,367.53 while the Nasdaq Composite was 0.1 per cent lower at 2,361.40. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent to 12,608.92.On Tuesday stock markets around the world bounced back from a dismal first quarter on news that several banks had taken further big writedowns on risky assets and were moving to recapitalise.That momentum stalled early on Wednesday during Mr Bernanke’s testimony to Congress on US economic growth and amid a welter of poor economic current and predictive data.The International Monetary Fund slashed its forecasts for growth in the US, adding that there was a 25 per cent chance of a global recession, while the Commerce Department released data showing further weakness in manufacturing.Financials ended down for the day. An index of investment banks fell 0.3 per cent while the broader S&P500 index of financial stocks lost 0.7 per cent. But there were pockets of resilience. Citigroup added 0.8 per cent to $24.02 while Morgan Stanley rose 0.5 per cent to $49.09.Consumer discretionary stocks also found some unexpected impetus, led by department store chain Dillards, after it made a deal with a group of shareholders that would allow it to avoid a proxy fight. Dillards shares, which have lost 38 per cent of their value over the last year, climbed 14.5 per cent, to $21.08. Family Dollar Stores, another retail chain, rose 2.3 per cent to $21.40 while JC Penney gained for a third day – 2 per cent to $40.91.Homebuilders were also boosted after top US Senators agreed on Tuesday to try to pass legislation that could help some homeowners avoid foreclosure. Centex added 0.8 per cent to $26.01, KB Home gained 4 per cent to $28 and DR Horton rose 0.5 per cent to $17.16.Mr Bernanke’s statements also overshadowed better than forecast results from Best Buy and news that private sector jobs increased unexpectedly in March.Best Buy, the consumer electronics and entertainment software retailer, said profits fell 3 per cent to $737m in the fourth quarter.However analysts had been expecting greater declines and revenues proved resilient, climbing 4 per cent to $13.42bn.Best Buy shares rose 1.8 per cent to $44.24, while smaller rival Circuit City, gained 5.7 per cent to $4.65.A report by ADP, the payroll services firm, also cushioned falls after it suggested private sector jobs had climbed in March .But the decline in factory orders hit consumer staple and industrial stocks in spite of some positive news.Caterpillar lost 1.8 per cent to $78.51 despite of announcing that it would increase prices for its machinery by up to 5 per cent, while General Electric dropped 1.1 per cent to $38.02.Walgreen, the retail drugstore chain, fell 2 per cent to $38.14 despite revealing that total sales rose 10.6 per cent to $5.11bn in March, compared to last year.
198;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2008-04-01T16:26:05Z;Newmont offers Jakarta 7% stake;;An Indonesian subsidiary of Newmont Mining has begun the latest phase of its divestment programme with an offer to sell 7 per cent of its shares in the Batu Hijau copper and gold mine to the government for $426m, officials said.The latest offer follows a long-running dispute between Newmont and the Indonesian government over the ownership of the mine on Sumbawa island. The offer would value Batu Hijau at $6.1bn, 30 per cent more than in 2007 and 67 per cent more than in 2006.Under the contract of work signed in 1986, Newmont and its Japanese partner Sumitomo Mining are contractually obliged to divest 51 per cent of their shares in Newmont Nusa Tenggara, their joint venture company, to local entities by 2010.They divested 20 per cent to Pukuasu Indah, an Indonesian company, in 1986. Efforts to sell a further 10 per cent collapsed last month and both sides have filed for international arbitration to resolve the matter.Jakarta said Newmont defaulted on its contract while Newmont said two of the three local governments in Sumbawa were being insufficiently transparent over their financing sources for purchasing the shares.US-based Newmont declined to discuss the price for the shares in Newmont Nusa Tenggara because it is still subject to negotiation with the Indonesian government.But Simon Sembiring, the director-general of mineral resources at the ministry of mines and energy, said that at $426m the price was “pretty expensive”.
199;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2008-03-27T19:53:53Z;India’s love affair with gold tarnishing;;"As India’s voracious appetite for gold wanes, producers of the precious metal are taking heed.Indian consumers buy about 25 per cent of the world’s gold, the vast majority of which is imported, making the country the largest market for the metal.Globally, investors have poured into gold, seeking refuge from the deflating dollar, which has hit record lows against the euro. Fears of an economic slowdown in the US, sky-high oil prices, and fallout from the subprime crisis have driven demand for gold as a safe haven.But with the recent volatility in gold prices, which have hit more than $1,000 per troy ounce, investors have become nervous and sales of gold in India have fallen sharply. Demand for gold in India plummeted 64 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter after growing 40 per cent in the first three quarters of last year.According to James Burton, chief executive of the World Gold Council, the global miners’ group, in the first half of 2007 India was on track to buy more than 1,000 tonnes of gold for the year, but demand “tailed off at the end of the year”, as gold prices rose. Jewellers in India have been particularly hard hit and tell of subdued sales as consumers baulk at high prices. Even families of marrying couples, traditionally obliged to drape newlyweds in the precious metal, are passing on family heirlooms instead of buying new gold.The slowdown has added urgency to talks in New Delhi this month between Indian officials and the heads of the world’s largest gold producers, including Barrick Gold, AngloGold Ashanti, and Goldfields and Newmont, about exploration of India’s untapped domestic resources.The country has been unable to attract enough investment to survey, explore and mine for gold because of unattractive policies, such as the requirement of separate licences for each step of the process and uncertainty about procedures for transferring mining rights.Miners of precious metals and stones are permitted foreign direct investment of 100 per cent under Indian law. But layers of red tape and ambiguous policies have deterred foreign interest.That could be about to change.Subbarami Reddy, India’s mining minister, is spearheading policy efforts to attract more foreign gold miners. This month, Mr Reddy presented a new mining policy to parliament intended to reduce bureaucracy and safeguard investor interests. It would “encourage investing heavy capital in exploration for gold and diamonds,” he said.The new guidelines aim to shorten the time it takes for mining leases to be granted to between six and 12 months; the current process can take years. Investment would be made easier, paperwork reduced and prospecting companies would automatically get a mining licence. “Prospecting and mining shall be recognised as independent activities with transferability of concessions playing a key role in mineral sector development,” a document presenting the new policy to parliament said.India’s handful of gold mines produce about 2.5 tonnes of the metal each year, a fraction of the country’s annual consumption of about 800 tonnes. It is unclear how much gold India could yield, although Mr Reddy has alluded to possible domestic reserves of 25,000 tonnes.Gregory Wilkins, chief executive of Canada’s Barrick, the world’s largest gold producer, agrees that the new policies outlined are a step in the right direction. “The government is doing a good job of creating a favourable investment climate,” he said.However, the guidelines failed to address the issue of royalties. State governments are demanding a move to value-based royalties on minerals from a flat rate, potentially eroding miners’ margins. Officials from New Delhi and the states have yet to agree on how royalties would be charged. Parliamentary approval could come quickly, says Ajay Mitra, India managing director for the World Gold Council. But how the mining policy would be implemented remains unclear.www.ft.com/gold"
200;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2008-03-26T21:07:05Z;US shares fall as recession fears reinforced;;Wall Street stocks fell on Wednesday, snapping a three session winning streak after new data suggested the broader US economy faces a downturn and concerns about banks’ earnings weighed on sentiment.Durable goods orders in February unexpectedly dropped 1.7 per cent - and by 2.6 per cent excluding volatile orders for transport equipment - according to the Commerce Department.John Ryding, chief US economist at Bear Stearns, said: ”This weaker than expected report points to declining capital spending in the first quarter, falling orders, and a significant pickup in inventories in relation to sales. This is another report that has a strong recessionary feel about it.”The numbers for machinery orders were notably anaemic and the news hit shares in General Electric and United Technologies.GE fell 0.3 per cent to $37.15 while United Technologies dropped 0.8 per cent to $69.61.The series comes after another batch of economic indicators on Tuesday highlighted plummeting confidence among consumers in the US and further pain in the housing sector.Richard Parower, managing director at J&W Seligman, said: “Now that we have moved past the euphoria about Bear Stearns being bought out and the steps that central banks are taking, we are back to thinking about micro-economics and about consumer confidence and the like.”The benchmark S&P 500 index - which fell as much as 1.2 per cent - closed down 0.9 per cent at 1,341.13 points, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 0.7 per cent to 2,324.36 points.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.9 per cent to 12,422.86.Separately, the Commerce Department reported that new home sales in February fell less than expected but still at the slowest sales pace since February 1995.Analysts at Morgan Stanley said the data, in addition to other recent reports, suggested home sales could be approaching a bottom but shares in house builders tumbled nonetheless.Centex fell 8 per cent to $23.73 while Lennar lost 6.8 per cent to $17.59.Hovnanian fell 9.4 per cent to $11.05 after Moody’s cuts its rating, citing losses, high debt and a weak macro environment for the economy and for housebuilders.Moody’s said the ratings outlook for the company was negative.The banking sector was also in sharp focus again after Germany’s Deutsche Bank warned that disruptions to revenues and writedowns relating to the global credit crisis could threaten its annual profit targets.On Tuesday a number of banking analysts cut their estimates for the sector, pushing financials into the red.That trend continued after Oppenheimer analyst Meredith Whitney slashed her forecasts for earnings in fiscal 2008 by 84 per cent on average and said further downgrades were likely.Ms Whitney sharply cut her estimates for Citigroup by 309 per cent to reflect possible writedowns of $13.1bn in the first quarter of 2008, on mortgage backed securities and other assets.Citigroup shares fell 5.9 per cent to $22.05 and an index of investment banking shares fell 4.1 per cent.Bank of America, the second-biggest US bank by assets, dropped for a second day, falling 2.8 per cent to $39.84, while Wachovia lost 6.7 per cent to $28.02.Fresh doubts emerged about the Clear Channel takeover. The two private equity firms leading a $19bn buyout of the largest US radio operator are at odds with banks financing the deal, increasing speculation that the deal could collapse.Clear Channel shares plunged 17.3 per cent to $26.93 in morning trading.Technology stocks too were sold off as investors worried about what third quarter results from Oracle, after the close, might contain.Oracle, often seen as a bellwether of the US technology sector, was down 0.7 per cent at $20.94 at the close.Microsoft fell 2 per cent to $28.57 and Novell also dropped 0.6 per cent to $6.52.Commodity-related stocks were the exception to the bearish mood, climbing for a third straight day as oil prices rose and further dollar weakness sustained the recovery in gold, base metals and agricultural commodities after last week’s sell-off.Gold miners Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold and Newmont Mining added 5.4 per cent to $97.44 and 1.3 per cent to $47.44 respectively.Shares in oil companies rose after analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein said crude oil will average $92.30 a barrel this year, up 27 percent from last year as declining reserves increase extraction costs.The New York-based investment firm also raised its price targets for related companies including Apache, which was among the biggest gainers on the S&P 500, up 6 per cent to $119.75.But higher oil prices hit airline stocks. American Airlines shares slid 10.6 per cent to $8.61 and Delta shares fell 12.3 per cent to $8.74.
201;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2008-03-25T20:55:02Z;Wall Street shrugs off weak economic data;;A rally in commodity-related stocks helped Wall Street to its third session of gains despite new data showing plummeting consumer confidence and further weakness in the housing sector in mid-afternoon trading on Tuesday.Statistics from the Conference Board suggested that consumer confidence in the US fell to its lowest since March 2003, when the Iraq invasion was under way.Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said: “This is very grim news indeed. If sustained at this level, consumer spending should be expected to drop to a year-on-year rate of about minus 2 per cent in the near future, a pace last seen in late 1974, and then only very briefly.“If spending does weaken to that degree, an outright recession will be unavoidable and a severe recession will be very likely. In short, this is one of the most alarming economic reports we have seen in this cycle so far.”The news hit the stocks of retailers such as Sears and Macy’s, which fell 3.4 per cent to $107.82 and 3.1 per cent to $25.52 respectively.But improved earnings forecasts from Monsanto, the agricultural products firm, and a bounce in commodity prices pushed the broader indices to return to positive territory.Monsanto shares were the biggest gainers on the S&P 500 index jumping 9.9 per cent to $114.54 after the company said earnings for the 2008 fiscal year would be stronger than initially suggested.Gold miners Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold and Newmont Mining climbed after gold rallied and copper advanced for a second day.Freeport-McMoRan rose 4.1 per cent to $92.41, while Newmont climbed 3 per cent to $46.82. Gold miners were heavily sold last week as gold prices tumbled from record highs.Brian Gendreau, an investment strategist at ING Investment Management, said: “There has been a change in sentiment this week. Last week rumours were flying and people were selling everything. Now it seems investors are more discriminating.”The benchmark S&P500 index fell as much as 0.6 per cent after the consumer data was released, but by the close it had recovered and was up 0.2 per cent at 1,352.96 points. The Nasdaq composite index was 0.6 per cent higher at 2,341.05 points.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.1 per cent to 12,532.60.Separate data released Tuesday morning also painted a bleak picture of the housing sector, as prices for existing single-family homes in 20 metropolitan areas in the US showed dramatic year-on-year declines.“Unfortunately it does not look like early 2008 is marking any turnround in the housing market, after the declining year recorded throughout 2007,” said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at Standard & Poor’s. “Home prices continue to fall, decelerate and reach record lows across the nation.”Housebuilders and related companies fell back on the news. DR Horton gave up some of Monday’s gains, dropping 2.7 per cent to $16.25, and Pulte Homes fell 2.8 per cent to $15.05.Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, lost 1.7 per cent to $28.76, while rival Lowe’s fell 2.5 per cent to $23.68.One exception was Thornburg Mortgage, the embattled “jumbo” mortgage specialist, whose shares surged after the company said it would raise up to $1.35bn as part of ongoing efforts to stave off bankruptcy.Thornburg shares, which have lost over 90 per cent of their value in the last year, rose 36.4 per cent to $1.73.The new data damped optimism triggered on Monday by numbers showing a surprise increase in existing home sales in February. That news, and a raised offer from JPMorgan for Bear Stearns, had pushed US stocks to their highest close in a month on Monday.However, Bear Stearns shares fell back 2.8 per cent to $10.94 on Tuesday, moving closer to the revised $10-a-share bid price, and JPMorgan dropped 1.1 per cent to $46.06.Financials sold off more broadly amid a welter of analyst downgrades.Bank of America, the second biggest US bank by assets, fell 3.5 per cent to $40.97 after analysts at Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock from “neutral” to “sell”.
202;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2008-03-20T21:14:55Z;Wall Street up as financials sought;;Wall Street stocks ended an abbreviated week higher on Thursday for the first time in a month as investors found renewed confidence and bought into financial stocks.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed at 1,329.51 points, up 3.2 per cent on the day and 2.9 per cent on the week.The Nasdaq composite index ended Thursday 2.2 per cent higher at 2,258.11 points while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.2 per cent to 12,361.32.Markets are closed on Friday for the Good Friday holiday.Financial stocks made up ground lost before a jittery close on Wednesday, carried by growing confidence in the Fed’s drastic measures to ease liquidity constraints through interest rate cuts and other extraordinary interventions, earlier in the week.The surge in financials stock prices takes them close to their levels before the late-in-the-day rescue of investment bank Bear Stearns last week.Analysts at Deutsche Bank said: “The Fed’s recent policy actions, in particular the decision to open the discount window to non-bank primary dealers, appear to be alleviating some financial market strains.“This is certainly positive news for the economy. However, even if the markets stabilize in the relatively near term—a big ‘if’ to be sure—the economic fallout will continue to weigh on the medium-term growth outlook.”An index of investment banks surged 11.2 per cent while the broader S&P financials index rose 6.9 per cent.Citigroup, the biggest U.S. bank, led the gainers on the Dow, surging 10.2 per cent to $22.50. Earlier in the day it said it would cut 2,000 more trading and investment-banking jobs in an effort to respond to subprime-related losses.Merrill Lynch shares rose 13 per cent to $46.85 on rumors the brokerage could sell off assets in order to shore up its balance sheet.Merrill shares were heavily sold on Wednesday over concerns that it could be forced to take further writedowns after suing to prevent a counterparty from backing out of credit guarantee contracts.Lehman Brothers, which was the subject of rumor fuelled panic-selling after the near collapse of Bear Stearns earlier in the week, rose 15.2 per cent to $48.65 while shares in Morgan Stanley climbed 14.3 per cent to $49.67.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac both rose for a third day, adding 11.7 per cent to $34.30 and 9 per cent to $32.58, respectively after analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods upgraded the companies to “outperform”.Frederick Cannon, a KBW analyst, said: “Recent government actions have increased our expectations for Fannie Mae [and Freddie Mac] to be an active participant in stabilizing the mortgage markets.”KBW also increased its price target for the two government-chartered mortgage companies to $48 and to $46 respectively.The pair were the biggest gainers over the foreshortened week, rising by more than 53 per cent each after regulators reduced their surplus capital requirements, freeing them to pump as much as $200bn of liquidity into the beleaguered US mortgage market.Still, shares in the two companies have fallen by more than 45 per cent over the last six months.Bucking the trend was CIT Group, the largest independent commercial finance company in the U.S, whose shares plummeted after it said it had tapped its $7.3bn emergency credit lines to repay debt and finance its commercial lending.CIT shares, which have lost more than 80 per cent of their value in the last six months, tumbled 17.3 per cent to $9.63.Earnings news combined with the rally in financial stocks to push markets into positive territory, offsetting weakness in the energy and mining sectors hit by a second day of falling commodity prices.Estimate-topping results from Nike after trading closed on Wednesday helped lift sentiment in midday trading, providing further evidence that a still strong global growth may help US multinationals weather a weakening economy at home.Nike shares added 8.8 per cent to $67.27.In other earnings news, Borders, the bookseller, released dramatic results, suspending its quarterly dividend and saying it could put itself up for sale pending a strategic review, despite returning to profit.Borders shares were up as much as 68 per cent in pre-market trade, but dropped 28.6 per cent to $5.07 by the close.Meanwhile, rival Barnes & Noble said fourth-quarter profit fell less than analysts estimated, adding that it may consider buying Borders.The company’s shares rose 8.1 per cent to $30.27 in New York trading.Analysts at Stifel Nicolaus recently downgraded both Borders and rival Barnes and Noble, from “buy” to “hold” citing concerns about falling foot traffic and competition from Amazon, the online bookseller.Markets had received a boost earlier in the day with the release of the latest Philly Fed index numbers on manufacturing, which suggested factory activity in the industrial heartland of America shrank for a fourth consecutive month in March, but by less than expected.Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said: “The key message from this survey is that things are quite bad, but that sentiment has, so far, weakened further than hard activity. Manufacturing growth is slow but the sector is not in meltdown.”Less positive also were the latest round of data released on Thursday in which initial jobless claims rose from 356,000 to 378,000, well above consensus expectations of 360,000.Gold miners, Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining dropped 7.2 per cent to $42 and 5.6 per cent to $45.97.
203;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2008-03-19T20:43:04Z;Wall St falls as oil and gold prices drop;;US stocks gave back much of their recent gains towards the end of the session on Wednesday as markets were dragged down by energy and mining stocks amid tumbling commodity prices.Some of the largest US oil companies were among the fallers after oil experienced its biggest one-day drop since 1991.Exxon Mobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips fell 4.6 per cent to $84.43, 4.9 per cent to $81.89 and 6 per cent to $73.61 respectively.With gold prices also off recent highs, Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining, two of the top US gold producers, dropped 7.2 per cent to $46.03 and 3.6 per cent to $49.06.The benchmark S&P 500 index – which recorded its biggest one day gain in five years on Tuesday – closed down 2.4 per cent at 1,298.42 points, while the Nasdaq composite index was down 2.6 per cent at 2,209.96 points.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.4 per cent to 12,099.66. Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management, said: “We had a pretty good start to the day and were holding yesterday’s [Tuesday’s] levels for most of the morning but as time ticks on people get a little nervous and they think ‘I want to lock in some profit now’.”Indeed, falling oil and mining stocks wiped out early gains sparked by reassuring results from Morgan Stanley and news that regulators had cleared Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to pump money into the embattled US mortgage market.Morgan Stanley shares rose as high as $47.07 in early trading before dropping back to $43.45, up 1.4 per at the close.The broader financial sector, which helped drive the benchmark S&P 500 index up 4.2 per cent on Tuesday, fell back amid renewed concerns about the fragility of the banking sector.An index of investment bank stocks, which had rallied in recent days, fell back 5.4 per cent, while the broader index of S&P 500 financials fell 2 per cent.At the epicentre of the sell off was Merrill Lynch, with shares falling 11.11 per cent to $42.52, after the bank sued XL Capital Assurance to prevent the bond insurer from canceling $3.1bn of credit default swaps on collateralized debt obligations.Lehman Brothers also gave back some of its gains on Tuesday, dropping 9.2 per cent to $42.23 after analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein said the bank could be exposed to further writedowns.Investors in Clear Channel, the largest US radio company, were spooked by reports that its buy-out by two private equity firms may be delayed due to difficulties in financing the $21bn in loans needed to complete the deal.Clear Channel shares were among the leading fallers in the S&P, dropping 8.9 per cent to $32.60.Rebecca Engmann Darst, an equity options analyst at Interactive Brokers, said the sell-off in financials could be due to news that brokerages were selling leveraged buy-out debt at reduced prices and “underlying skittishness” in the market.However, falls were cushioned somewhat by news that regulators have allowed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to inject $200 billion into the struggling housing market. The government-chartered mortgage company’s shares surged 8.8 per cent to $30.71 and 14.9 per cent to $29.90.Elsewhere in the mortgage market, shares in Thornburg, a specialist in “Jumbo” mortgages which is struggling to meet margin calls, plummeted 49.66 per cent to $1.50.On Tuesday the shares spiked on news that Thornburg’s lenders had agreed to freeze demands for more collateral until 2009, but on Wednesday the company revealed the tough terms of the deal.Thornburg agreed to give five lenders warrants equivalent to about a 27 per cent stake in the company and committed to raise at least $948m within seven days by issuing senior notes.In corporate news, Visa, the world’s largest credit card network, began trading on Wednesday and its shares soared as high as $69 before falling back to close at $56.50, up 28.4 per cent.On Wednesday the San Francisco-based company raised more than $17.9bn after selling 406m shares for $44 each – $2 higher than top estimates in the prospectus.In technology, Adobe Systems, the maker of design software, led the sector higher after first-quarter profit beat consensus estimates.The shares rose 9 per cent to $34.75
204;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2008-03-13T20:44:28Z;US equities rally in afternoon trade;;US equity markets staged an impressive afternoon rally on Thursday, shaking off earlier weakness after Standard & Poor’s said that the end was in sight for subprime writedowns.The benchmark S&P 500 index closed 0.5 per cent higher at 1,315.48 after earlier falling as much as 2 per cent. Nine of the 10 industry groups in the index advanced, after all 10 opened the day lower.The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.3 per cent, to 12,145.74, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 0.9 per cent to 2,263.61.Financial shares erased a decline of as much as 4 per cent after S&P said banks have already disclosed the majority of their writedowns.S&P said it expected the bulk of future writedowns to come from “hedge funds, monoline insurers, other insurers, and other financial institutions”.Stocks had slumped early in the trading day after the highly leveraged mortgage bond fund Carlyle Capital said it had defaulted on $16.6bn in debt.Thornburg Mortgage, the exotic mortgage lender which has lost 75 per cent of its value this year, fell 20.7 per cent to $2.26.Countrywide, the largest US mortgage lender, fell 0.4 per cent to $4.77. The lender said late payments on home loans declined in February and foreclosures increased. Bank of America, which has agreed to buy Countrywide, rose 0.3 per cent to $37.14.Washington Mutual, the largest US savings and loan, rose 4.2 per cent to $12.13. WaMu, which has been battered by losses linked to subprime loans, has been approached by Toscafund Asset Management, the UK hedge fund, with an offer to invest its own money in the company.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government sponsored mortgage entities, rallied strongly. Fannie rose 9.2 per cent to $22.97, while Freddie added 7.6 per cent to $21.30.Citigroup fell 0.7 per cent to $21.07 and JPMorgan fell 1.3 per cent to $38.11. Lehman Brothers rose 2.3 per cent to $45.99. Wachovia, the fourth-largest US bank by assets, fell 2.9 per cent to $27.24.Bear Stearns fell 7.4 per cent to $57 The Wall Street Journal said hedge funds using Bear as a prime broker have been shifting portions of their business to other firms in recent weeks amid widespread speculation the company is facing liquidity problems. Company executives continued to dismiss such suggestions. Alan Schwartz, president and chief executive, said this week that Bear’s “balance sheet, liquidity and capital remain strong”.AIG fell 2.7 per cent to $42.48 after Morgan Stanley said the world’s largest insurer could be hit by as much as $3bn in losses related to credit default swaps. The brokerage cut its recommendation on the stock to “equal-weight’’ from “overweight” and said that if the fixed income crisis deepens the losses could cause a capital shortfall.Gold’s surge above $1,000 triggered a rally among gold miners.Newmont Mining, the world’s second-largest gold producer, climbed to its highest since January after both futures and spot gold hit records. Shares rose 4.7 per cent to $53.78, while Toronto-based miner Iamgold rose 6.5 per cent to $8.31.Retail stocks weakened after economic data showed a larger-than-expected fall in sales.

205;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2008-03-02T20:42:41Z;Newmont eyes IPO to fend off Bumi;;"Newmont Mining may list $400m worth of shares in its Indonesian gold and copper mine in an attempt to protect the operations from aggressive local rival Bumi Resources.Indonesia has threatened to end Newmont’s contract and take control of the $4.7bn Batu Hijau mine on the eastern Sumbawa island if Newmont does not sell a 10 per cent stake to regional governments by Monday.However, the Financial Times last week uncovered a plan by Bumi to finance share purchases by three local governments and allow the company eventually to take control of the shares.Bumi is controlled by the family of Aburizal Bakrie, Indonesia’s powerful welfare minister.In light of these developments, Russell Ball, Newmont’s chief financial officer, said on Sunday the US group needed to look at alternatives.“Maybe the time has come for us to look at other Indonesian companies that might be interested in buying the shares including through an IPO,” he said.Newmont raised the possibility of selling an additional 5 per cent stake to the Sumbawa local government, which has already agreed to buy 2 per cent.The Indonesian Mining Association, which includes both local and international companies, said on Friday the government should allow companies involved
in compulsory divestment schemes, such as Newmont, to sell their shares via public offerings to improve transparency.The lobby group is concerned that regulatory uncertainty is hurting foreign investment in the sector.A recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers ranked Indonesia third in the world behind Chile and Peru in terms of the potential of its mining resources. On investment conditions, however, it ranked last.Mr Ball hopes the government will agree to extend the deadline for negotiations on the 10 per cent sale or withdraw its threat to terminate Newmont’s contract.Simon Sembiring, director general of mineral resources at the energy ministry, declined to comment.Newmont and Sumitomo, its partner in the Batu Hijau mine, are required to complete a 51 per cent sell down to local investors by 2010.They have already sold a 20 per cent stake to a local company."
206;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2008-02-28T22:57:22Z;Newmont accuses Bumi of secret plan over shares;;Newmont Mining of the US on Thursday accused Bumi Resources, Indonesia’s largest coal miner, of putting at risk its contract to operate a $4.7bn gold and copper mine by secretly plotting to undermine the share divestment process.Bumi has been orchestrating a confidential campaign to finance local governments around the Batu Hijau mine on Sumbawa island in eastern Indonesia to purchase shares and then take control of them, documents obtained by the Financial Times and people involved in the deal have revealed.Jakarta has been threatening to terminate Newmont’s contract and retake control of the mine if a 10 per cent stake is not sold to regional governments by March 3.Foreign businesspeople say the argument highlights the problems of investing in Indonesia. US energy group Exxon Mobil and Temasek Holdings, the Singaporean government investment arm, are among foreign companies contesting opaque institutional decisions in south-east Asia’s largest economy.Bumi told the FT it had signed confidential non-binding memoranda of understanding with the governor of West Nusa Tenggara province and heads of Sumbawa and West Sumbawa districts in March and August last year to buy not only the 10 per cent stake that Newmont and Sumitomo, its partner in the mine, must divest, but the remaining 21 per cent that must be sold by 2010.Bumi and the local governments agreed to buy the shares through a joint venture of which Bumi would control 85 per cent, the MOUs say. In return Bumi would pay each local administration at least $1m a year until all the shares were acquired. Under the contract of work the shares are meant to be bought and controlled by the local governments, or a private company of Newmont’s choosing.Russell Ball, Newmont’s chief financial officer, told the FT Newmont was “deeply disturbed” by Bumi’s actions. “We had believed we were negotiating in good faith . . . to divest shares that would benefit the people of the local communities,” he said.Newmont is trying to divest the shares to the local governments through its own financing mechanisms. The Sumbawa district chief has agreed to Newmont’s terms to buy 2 per cent.Dileep Srivastava, Bumi’s corporate secretary, said yesterday Bumi had decided to stop pursuing the Newmont shares “because of its [new] strategic position requiring a holding of, at least, a majority in its mining interests in Indonesia”, but was interested in “operating and marketing and funding” the mine.This appears to be contradicted by Zulkifli Muhadli, the West Sumbawa district chief, who told the FT he had discussed with Bumi its latest offer “within the last week”. Furthermore, Lalu Serinata, West Nusa Tenggara governor, wrote a letter three weeks ago to various officials, indicating he regarded the March MOU as still being adhered to.Bumi is controlled by the family of Aburizal Bakrie, Indonesia powerful welfare minister.
207;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2008-02-21T21:44:23Z;Energy sector leads sell-off on Wall Street;;"Wall Street stocks retreated on Thursday after an index of factory activity worsened unexpectedly, adding to concerns that the US economy is falling into a recession.The major indices rose in early trade but energy companies later led a sell-off as crude oil prices declined from recent highs. Banking stocks also came under pressure on worries about earnings prospects.An analyst upgrade of Cisco and a higher subscriber forecast from Research In Motion initially boosted optimism in the technology sector but this rally also fell victim to waning confidence.The S&P 500 closed down 1.3 per cent lower at 1,342.51 points, having climbed 0.6 per cent when the market opened. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 1.2 per cent to 12,284.30 as General Motors’ shares slumped 4.9 per cent amid the growing economic malaise. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.2 per cent to 2,299.78.Equities reversed course after the Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s February manufacturing index deteriorated unexpectedly from minus 20.9 to minus 24. The reading was the worst contraction in factory activity since February 2001 and came as an unpleasant surprise for analysts who had forecast an improvement.The report dampened nascent hopes that if a US recession occurred this year it would likely be short-lived.David Rosenberg, North American economist at Merrill Lynch, said the “shockingly weak Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey tells us [a recession] likely will be much worse than 2001 and more like the 1990-style”.The negative tone of the report seemed to confirm that US manufacturers are struggling. Many investors hoped manufacturers would avoid the worst effects of a domestic economic slowdown by growing revenues overseas, helped by a weak US dollar.An example of this trend is Terex, a construction equipment maker, which said non-US sales accounted for 70 per cent of 2007 sales, abetting a 72 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings. The stock was the best performing on the S&P, rising 7.3 per cent to $66.73.Separately, an index of leading economic indicators fell 0.1 per cent, marking a fourth consecutive drop, in line with expectations. Weekly jobless numbers also offered little by way of consolation, falling only 9,000 to 349,000 after the previous week’s figures were revised higher.Although equities slumped on Thursday, the overall trend has been tentatively higher in spite of acute turmoil in credit markets. Some analysts have argued that stocks probably reached a bottom in January, but others remain far less sanguine.“There’s going to be a more significant downturn than people are willing to admit at this point,” Jeff Buetow, chief investment officer at XTF Global Asset Management, said.One problem is that many strategist think earnings estimates are too optimistic. Tobias Levkovitch, chief US equity strategist at Citi Investment Research, said sell-side analysts’ bottom-up numbers imply 16 per cent earnings growth in 2008 while Citi’s top-down 2008 earnings per share estimates reckon on a near 2 per cent decline in S&P 500 earnings.Citi believes estimates are likely to be cut, which could restrain markets this year.Investors took profits in the materials sector, even as a host of commodities, including gold and platinum, soared to new highs.The big move in gold was a boon for Newmont Mining, the world’s largest gold producer. The shares fell 1 per cent to $50.64 after Newmont swung to a $289m net loss in the fourth quarter as it took a $1.1bn non-cash charge related to reserve replacement results.Retailers were broadly weaker with Safeway among the leading fallers after fourth-quarter earnings fell from a year ago when results benefited from tax adjustments. The group’s same-store revenue growth slowed and shares fell
7.1 per cent to $29.66.JC Penney rose 0.2 per cent to $48.03 after the department store operator said fourth-quarter earnings fell less than expected.Technology stocks outperformed on Thursday after Citi Investment Research up-
graded Cisco from “hold” to “buy” because it said the sector would be less affected by a consumer-led economic downturn than in 2001-02. Cisco’s shares were flat at $23.19."
208;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Indonesia mine dispute escalates;;Indonesia on Tuesday threatened to terminate the multi-billion-dollar mining contract of a local subsidiary of Newmont Mining, claiming that the US company and its Japanese partner had reneged on a plan to hand over shares to local organisations.Simon Sembiring, Indonesia’s director-general of mineral resources, said Newmont and Sumitomo Mining had until February 22 to divest 10 per cent of their shares in the Batu Hijau copper and gold mine on Sumbawa island in West Nusa Tenggara province.Muhammad Lutfi, head of the investment co-ordinating agency, also suggested that the two foreign companies, along with Trakindo, the Indonesian agent for Caterpillar, the heavy industry equipment supplier, may have violated the US Foreign Corrupt Practices act with their approach to the divestment process. However, no details were put forward.The move is the latest blow in a long-running dispute between Newmont and the Indonesian government over the ownership of the Batu Hijau mine, which is managed by Newmont Nusa Tenggara, a joint venture between the US company and Sumitomo Mining.Under the contract of work signed in 1986, Newmont and Sumitomo were required to divest 51 per cent of Newmont Nusa Tenggara to local entities within 10 years of production, in agreed instalments. Production began in 2000.The companies sold 20 per cent immediately to Pukuasu Indah, controlled by businessman Yusuf Meruk. And in 2006 the company offered 3 per cent, valued at $109m, followed by another 7 per cent, valued at $282m, to local investors last year.These stakes were not taken up and an affiliate of Trakindo has since been in talks with Newmont over the 3 per cent stake. Newmont on Tuesday said it had sold 2 per cent of the shares to the Sumbawa district government for $72.67m, a figure agreed via an independent valuation in 2006, adding that this demonstrated its commitment to divestment.The sale price valued the mine at $3.6bn in 2006. Newmont was unwilling to say how much the mine is worth now. However, the price of gold has risen some 45 per cent in price since the end of 2006. The mine’s proven and probable reserves were estimated at 493m tonnes of gold and 1.9m tonnes of copper at the end of 2007.Mr Sembiring told the Financial Times that Newmont and Sumitomo had violated the contract of work by not divesting 3 per cent of their shares in 2006 and 7 per cent in 2007.“They’ve been hesitating, wasting time and not acting in good faith,” he said. “So I’ve given them until February 22 to complete the divestment or else I will exercise Indonesia’s right to cancel the contract.”Newmont, speaking on behalf of itself and Sumitomo, insisted neither had done anything wrong. Newmont said it would take whatever steps necessary to protect its shareholders’ interests, including going to international arbitration.Mr Lutfi, who has to approve the divestment, accused Newmont of “pursuing its own agenda” to retain ownership of the shares even though that would violate the contract of work.“There are indications that several foreign companies have undertaken activities that violate the good corporate governance guidelines issued by the American government,” he said. “May I remind and warn Newmont, Sumitomo and Caterpillar’s Indonesian agent, namely Trakindo, to obey the articles of [America’s] Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.”Trakindo on Tuesday said neither Caterpillar nor Trakindo were involved in attempting to purchase a stake in the mine, adding that it was an affiliate of the Indonesian company that had been in discussions.Russell Ball, Newmont’s chief financial officer, said the company was committed to the divestment programme, even though it had taken longer than expected. He said he was “disappointed” by the default letter because “the government knew [the Sumbawa district deal] was in the works and imminent to be released”.“It seems to be counter to the good faith of the negotiations that have been ongoing,” he said.He added that if Jakarta cancelled the contract, Newmont would almost certainly pursue international arbitration.Mr Ball rejected the suggestion that Newmont had violated the foreign corrupt practices act.Additional reporting by Taufan Hidayat
209;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2008-01-04T22:49:16Z;US stocks fall sharply on recession fears;;Wall Street stocks fell sharply on Friday after weak employment data raised fears that the US economy could tip into recession, capping a torrid start to 2008 for US equities.Traders expecting a New Year bounce were sorely disappointed and instead investors this week geared up for an economic downturn by selling stocks exposed to the US consumer.A spike in commodity prices encouraged traders to seek refuge in energy and some mining stocks but industrial and transport companies were punished amid the threat of higher costs. Technology firms, financials and homebuilders were also pummelled as confidence in the outlook for the US economy subsided.The S&P 500 fell 2.5 per cent to 1,411.63 on Friday, marking a decline of 3.9 per cent for the first three days of the trading year.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.5 per cent to 12,800.18 for the first three trading days of January. US blue-chips on Wednesday posted their worst start to the year since 1983.The Nasdaq Composite fared particularly poorly, sliding 3.8 per cent to 2,504.65 on Friday and down 5.6 per cent since the New Year. Hardware companies were sold amid concerns about corporate tech spending and chipmakers fell following brokerage downgrades.The Nasdaq has fallen more than 10 per cent from its October high, a “market correction” in trader parlance. Small-cap stocks also had a poor run with the Russell 2000 falling 5.8 per cent since the New Year to hit a 15-month low.Stocks ended the the week on a sour note after unemployment jumped to 5 per cent, its highest since November 2005. Meanwhile non-farm payrolls rose much less than expected.Traders were wary of a weak jobs number as many analysts consider falling employment a leading indicator of an economic downturn.“If you start to have an uptick in unemployment it can cause a domino effect and the Fed has to deal with that aggressively,” Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research, said.However, the prospect of more rate cuts failed to stem the sell-off as fears of a recession caused stocks sensitive to the US consumer to plunge.Consumer discretionary stocks, which include leading US retailers, hoteliers, homebuilders and restaurant chains, have suffered a miserable start to 2008.The sector officially entered a “bear market” this week having fallen more than 20 per cent below its previous market peak. Leading the rout were retailers including Macy’s and JC Penney, the department store operators, which fell 13.4 per cent to $22.40 and 14 per cent to $37.64 respectively. Fastfood chains were hit after Wendy’s, the burger chain said December same-store sales declined. Its shares have fallen 9.7 per cent to $23.34 in 2008.Transport stocks, another bellwether of economic sentiment, were sold as crude oil prices surged, threatening to hamper profitability.YRC Worldwide, a trucking company, fell 26.2 per cent to $12.62 over the period after Fitch Ratings cut its debt to junk. Goodyear Tire & Rubber, a company reliant on the transport sector, fell 12.9 per cent to $24.58.Industrials came under pressure after an index of December manufacturing activity contracted unexpectedly this week. Caterpillar, the heavy equipment maker, has fallen 5.6 per cent to $68.53 since the New Year.Ford hit a 22-year low, falling 8.9 per cent to $6.13, after Toyota overtook the vehicle manufacturer to claim the number two spot in the US market amid some disappointing December sales from US carmakers.Technology stocks were another disappointment with chipmakers particularly weak. Intel fell 15 per cent to $22.67 over the period after JPMorgan downgraded the stock on concerns about slowing orders. Investors seeking respite from the downward trend looked to large-cap multinationals with a high proportion of international sales. Coca-Cola has risen 0.8 per cent to $61.85 since the new year.Traders also bought shares in the agribusiness sector. Monsanto has put on 7.1 per cent to $119.63 for 2008 after it almost trebled first quarter net income and raised its full-year earnings guidance.Energy companies also outperformed as oil prices boosted earnings expectations.

Technology stocks were particularly weak after an analyst downgraded several semiconductor companies.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.7 per cent to 13,043.96 points, its worst percentage decline on the first trading day of a year since 1983. The S&P 500 closed 1.4 per cent lower at 1,447.16 and the Nasdaq Composite shed 1.6 per cent to 2,609.63.The Institute for Supply Management’s survey showed that manufacturing weakened unexpectedly in December. The ISM index fell 3.1 percentage points to 47.7 last month, against expectations it would be little changed. A reading of 50 marks the line between growth and contraction.“Clearly the worries that we finished 2007 with are continuing into 2008, with these ISM numbers coming out so weak,” Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management, said. “The Fed is caught between a rock and a hard place trying to fight inflation while dealing with the slowdown in US growth.”Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s December meeting emphasised the difficulty of “unusually uncertain” economic conditions and indicated the Fed remained “exceptionally alert” to the possible need for further rate cuts.The futures market fully priced in the likelihood of at least a 25 basis point cut at the end of this month compared with a 68 per cent chance a week ago.Semiconductor stocks were sold after Banc of America Securities downgraded eight companies – three of them to “sell” – saying a cyclical recovery had run its course, while inventories had risen above equilibrium levels.BofA analyst Sumit Dhanda cut Intel to “neutral” and told investors to sell shares in Advanced Micro Devices.

The shares gained 3.9 per cent to $96.25.Transport groups struggled as oil prices soared and after JPMorgan downgraded FedEx from “overweight” to “neutral” because of weak freight demand and higher fuel costs. The shares fell 3.9 per cent to $86.16.YRC Worldwide, the trucking company, fell 9.7 per cent to $15.43 after warning it expected to incur charges in the fourth quarter related to previous acquisitions. Goodyear Tire & Rubber fell 5 per cent to $26.82 after Goldman Sachs said that cost inflation was acting as a large offset to cost savings activity.Investors also sold restaurant chains after Bear Stearns downgraded the sector to “underweight”. Analyst Joseph Buckley cut Starbucks to “peer perform” from “outperform” because he expects less affluent consumers will start to feel economic pressures.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was a fraction higher at 13,551.69 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 per cent to 2,724.41, as technology once again outperformed the broader market.The retail sector declined after a report by MasterCard Advisors said consumer spending climbed only 3.6 per cent between Thanksgiving and Christmas, adding to concerns that US consumers, hit by the housing market slump, are shying away from the shops. Excluding petrol and car sales, spending increased only 2.4 per cent.Among the leading fallers were Macy’s and Dillard’s, the department store operators, which fell 3.9 per cent to $25.95 and 5.5 per cent to $19.19 respectively.Shares in Target, the discount retailer, fell 2.5 per cent to $51.16 after it warned that sales may decline this month.The company set guidance for December same-store sales of between a 1 per cent decrease and 1 per cent increase, compared to previous expectations of 3-5 per cent growth.Adrianne Shapira, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said Target’s guidance “stokes the fears of disappointing December sales.”Economic news was dominated by a record decline in US house prices. The average price of single-family homes in 10 metropolitan areas covered by the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller home price index fell 6.7 per cent in October compared with a year earlier.The S&P homebuilder index fell 1.9 per cent after the report was released but recovered later to trade 0.6 per cent higher at 377.61.Elsewhere on Wall Street, Merrill Lynch also fell in early trade before rallying 1.2 per cent to end at $54.54.

Davis Selected Advisers, also moved shares in MBIA on Wednesday after it disclosed a 6.4 per cent stake in the bond insurer. MBIA’s shares rose 11 per cent to $22.33.There was also good news for investors looking for a pick-up in dealmaking activity after Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, said it planned to buy a 60 per cent stake in Marmon Holdings.Berkshire Hathway will pay $4.5bn for its stake in the family-controlled manufacturing and services group and will acquire the remaining 40 per cent over the next five to six years.Commodity prices rose on Wednesday, providing a boost to energy and mining stocks. Hess, the oil producer and refiner, rose 2.2 per cent to $104.63 while Newmont Mining, the world’s largest gold producer, climbed 1.4 per cent to $49.11.Supply concerns drove the price of crude oil to a one-month high of $96.54 while gold climbed 2 per cent to $824.60 an ounce.Bond prices edged lower on Wednesday.

212;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2007-11-06T21:49:24Z;Wall St rebounds amid record oil and gold;;Wall Street shares rebounded on Tuesday as commodity prices hit new highs, providing a boon to energy and materials stocks.Financial stocks recovered some of their recent heavy losses amid lingering concerns about banks’ exposure to credit and mortgage market losses. However some mixed corporate earnings continued to weigh on sentiment.Writedowns from financial companies and disappointing results from energy groups have caused estimates of earnings growth on an annual basis for S&P 500 companies to slip to 6.9 per cent in the fourth quarter from 11.9 per cent, according to Thomson Financial.Blended earnings, including actual and estimated results, for the S&P 500 are down 1.7 per cent for the third quarter, the first drop since 2002.A late rally helped the S&P 500 close 1.2 per cent higher at 1,520.27 points,. The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.1 per cent at 2,825.18 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.9 per cent to 13,660.94.Energy stocks had the best of the gains after crude oil futures hit $97 a barrel for the first time.

The S&P materials index gained 2.5 per cent at 268.17. Alcoa rose 1.8 per cent at $38.57 while Newmont Mining rose 4.1 per cent at $54.50.Financial stocks hit back as investors tentatively put aside worries about potential credit market losses. Citigroup’s disclosure this week that it would make up to $11bn in further mortgage-related writedowns sparked concern that other banks and financial institutions will follow suit.Rumours that banks will have to writedown “level 3 assets” – assets that are so illiquid they are difficult to value – continued to unsettle the market. Goldman Sachs rose 2.2 per cent at $223.16 after it said persistent rumours that it would make mortgage-related writedowns were “still untrue”.Bear Stearns gained 2.1 per cent at $102 and Merrill Lynch rose 0.9 per cent at $56.37. But Citigroup fell 2.3 per cent at $35.08 while Morgan Stanley shed 1.9 per cent at $54.51.The S&P financial index gained 1.7 per cent at 425.46, helped by MasterCard, which soared 7.2 per cent at $199.40 after Deutsche Bank raised its rating to “buy” and set a $250 target.Christopher Flanagan, JPMorgan analyst, said total losses stemming from mortgage linked securities could reach $200bn, against only $30bn-$40bn in losses reported so far.“Banks, brokers, mortgage and monoline insurers will bear the brunt of this loss recognition,” he said. But credit insurers, which have suffered some of the worst share price falls, rallied.Ambac Financial, the bond insurer, gained 13.8 per cent at $27.99 after it disputed a Morgan Stanley report that the industry’s losses would worsen.Ambac said Morgan’s estimates “do not accurately reflect the composition of our underlying mortgage portfolio and the structure of our deals”. MBIA, another bond insurer, gained 7.3 per cent at $35.65.Among homebuilders Hovnanian Enterprises fell 0.7 per cent at $10.04 after home deliveries fell 19 per cent in the fourth quarter, while cancellations reached 40 per cent. Beazer Homes suspended its dividend, cut 25 per cent of its staff and took $230m in pre-tax charges. Shares rose 10 per cent at $10.47 after an adviser to union pension funds called for the board to oust Ian McCarthy, chief executive.In technology, Sun Microsystems fell 9.6 per cent to $5.16 after revenues missed analysts’ expectations. Google gained 2.2 per cent at $741.79 after Sanford C Bernstein raised its price target to $850. Microsoft fell 0.9 per cent at $36.41 after it was dropped from a Goldman Sachs buy list.Alibaba.com, the Chinese e-commerce portal, almost tripled in price on its Hong Kong debut.But Yahoo, a 39 per cent stakeholder in Alibaba’s parent, fell 4.6 per cent to $29.93.
213;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2007-10-31T20:33:09Z;Wall Street buoyed by Fed rate decision;;US shares surged higher on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter point.The Federal Open Market Committee’s decision to cut both the fed funds rate and the discount rate by 25 basis appeared to satisfy the market. Shares fell into negative territory immediately after the decision but then soared above previous highs for the day as traders received the news most had expected.Stocks surged even as the language used in the statement accompanying the FOMC’s decision seemed to play down the likelihood of another rate cut.The FOMC said it judged that ”the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth.” One member of the Federal Open Market Committee dissented, voting to keep the fed funds rate on hold at 4.75 per cent.However, the statement also cautioned that “economic expansion will likely slow in the near-term.”Thomas Nyheim, vice president and portfolio manager at Christiana Bank & Trust said: “I think it’s pretty much what was expected. But the language of the Fed’s statement looks like this might be the last cut.”Before the publication of the FOMC decision the S&P 500 was trading as much as 0.8 per cent higher. Shares wobbled after the decision, but then rebounded.The S&P 500 closed 1.2 per cent higher at 1549.36. The Nasdaq Composite was 1.5 per cent higher at 2,859.12 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1 per cent at 13930.01.Volatility, as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange Vix index, de­clined 11.6 per cent to 18.62.Brokerage stocks reacted positively to the Fed’s decision while energy and materials stocks also surged higher.The S&P investment bank index gained 2.3 per cent at 211.51.

But excluding the gain, Kraft beat estimates. The shares rose 2.5 per cent at $33.41.Alcatel-Lucent, the telecoms equipment maker, reported a loss of some $373m for the third quarter, slightly larger than analysts’ expectations. But news of 4,000 more job cuts lifted the stock 3.2 per cent to $9.69.Weyerhaeuser was also higher in spite of a 55 per cent fall in net income as the US housing slump hit demand for its timber products. The shares were up 2.2 per cent to $75.91.Third-quarter profit at Newmont Mining doubled to $397m. The shares gained 9.6 cent to $50.90 Its results provided support to the S&P materials index, which closed 2.5 per cent higher at 271.42Energy stocks also made strong gains as crude oil surged to a new record close of $94.30 a barrel. The S&P energy index rose 1.9 per cent at 585.43.ExxonMobil, due to report third-quarter results on Thursday, gained 0.9 per cent to $91.93.

Microsoft hit a six-year high, gaining 3.5 per cent at $36.81.But Garmin declined 10.9 per cent at $107.40. The navigation device maker made an unsolicited $3.3bn bid for Tele Atlas, the digital map company, which has already agreed to be acquired by TomTom, Garmin’s rival.Investors were earlier cheered by some positive employment news. ADP Employer Services estimated companies hired 106,000 employees in October, well above economists’ forecast gain of 58,000.Meanwhile gross domestic product rose 3.9 per cent during the third quarter, more than an expected rise of 3.1 per cent. It was the strongest quarter for growth since the economy expanded by 4.8 per cent during the first quarter of 2006.There was mixed news on the inflation front, as the price index for personal consumption expenditures rose 1.7 per cent in the third quarter after a rise of 4.3 per cent in the preceding quarter. The core PCE reading, which excludes food and energy, rose 1.8 per cent.
214;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2007-04-24T07:24:37Z;Indonesia acquits Newmont of pollution;;An Indonesian court on Tuesday acquitted the local subsidiary of America’s Newmont Mining and its American president of polluting a bay near its mine on Sulawesi island and causing local people to fall sick.Lawyers said the verdict, which went against the majority of public opinion, was a sign of slowly increasing certainty in Indonesia’s much-maligned legal system.Ridwan Damanik, the presiding judge, told the Manado District Court that the two-and-a-half-year-long case should not have been brought to court since investigators had not followed proper procedures in determining whether Newmont Minahasa Raya had dumped toxic tailings into Buyat Bay near its mine in North Sulawesi or if the tailings were the cause of local people’s illnesses.He said the prosecutors’ arguments, based on Buyat Bay water samples gathered by the police, were “weak”.Eleven other studies, conducted by foreign and domestic institutions, concluded Newmont had not polluted the waters. Furthermore, the person who raised the initial allegations withdrew all accusations during the trial.Some 100 anti-Newmont protesters demonstrating outside the court vociferously rejected the verdict. Prosecutors said they would probably appeal but Hoetomo, the deputy environment minister, said he would have to study the verdict before making a decision.“Of course I’m disappointed but I respect the decision,” he said. “The people will say that the environment is not protected.”Richard Ness, the head of Newmont’s Indonesia operations who was facing 10 years imprisonment, said he was “impressed and surprised by the strength of the judges conclusions”. “It was much more professional that I expected,” he said. “It shows that the judicial system can work, although it also shows the investigation process is still flawed.”Wayne Murdy, Newmont’s chairman and chief executive, said the acquittal was the only logical outcome based on the evidence. “It is the correct decision, and there is no factual or legal basis upon which to reasonably dispute this outcome,” he said.Last year Newmont agreed to pay $30m over 10 years to fund a new foundation to oversee community development near the Sulawesi mine in return for the government dropping a $135m civil suit over alleged pollution in Buyat Bay.Newmont’s mine in North Sulawesi is now shut but Mr Ness said the positive outcome would have an impact on the company’s on-going debate whether to expand its other Indonesian mine in Batu Hijau on Sumbawa island.Todung Mulya Lubis, a leading lawyer, described the verdict as “a milestone for Indonesian legal history”. “This is the first time an environmental case of this magnitude has been tried in an Indonesian court,” he said. “One decision doesn’t change a whole system but it will serve as evidence for foreign investors that there’s increasing certainty of the law in Indonesia.”James Castle, former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia, said: “If they had been convicted and it had looked like there had been other cases against foreign president directors then it would have had a very chilling effect,” he said. “It would be better if the government doesn’t pursue an appeal but it would take political courage.”Mr Castle also rejected arguments that this case was the environment versus investment. “This was a victory for the environment because it highlighted the importance of the environment and what investors should do to protect the environment,” he said.
215;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2006-10-04T12:32:27Z;Dow closes at all-time high;;"The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at an all-time high on Tuesday as stocks rallied on steep falls in commodity prices.Shares in retailers benefited the most from the rally as investors hoped that lower petrol prices would lead to higher consumer spending.Staples, the office-supply group, added 5.4 per cent to $25.58, and Limited Brands, owner of the Bath and Body Works and Victoria’s Secret chains, ticked up 3.3 per cent to $27.65.

The S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent or 2.79 points at 1,334.11; the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.3 per cent, or 6.05 points, at 2,243.65.Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at AG Edwards was cautious about the importance of the Dow’s milestone. “It’s probably of more significance to the retail investment community than it is to the professionals,” he said.“But I do think its a psychological plus and one that could spark some interest and maybe bring a little bit of sideline money into the market.”A slump in crude oil prices was the catalyst for the equity market gains. Nymex crude futures dipped below $59 a barrel – theirlowest level for eight months – triggering a sell-off of energy stocks. ConocoPhillips fell 4.3 per cent to $56.03, while oil services group Diamond Offshore Drilling lost 6.7 per cent to $63.90.The Dow Jones Oil Equipment and Services Index is now in negative territory for the year, having gained as much as 34 per cent from January to May.Copper and gold prices also slid further, dragging down mining stocks.

Cisco Systems, maker of networking equipment added 1.9 per cent to $23.41, and Ebay gained 2.6 per cent to $28.18.Medical equipment maker St Jude Medical rose 3.4 per cent to $36.59, after Merrill Lynch raised its rating on the stock from “neutral” to “buy”, saying St Jude would continue to take market share from rival Boston Scientific.Chipmaker Marvell Technology was a rare loser, tumbling 12 per cent to $16.80, its lowest level in a year and a half, after it cut its revenue outlook for 2007. Marvell said it would restate financial results because of the way it had accounted for stock options. Its rival Broadcom followed it lower, losing 3.1 per cent to $29.91."

Goldman Sachs gained 8.6 per cent to $162.71, and Legg Mason climbed 13.3 per cent to $102.20.

Retail sales unexpectedly rose 0.2 per cent in August, compared with most analysts’ expectation of a 0.1 per cent decline in sales.Hugh Johnson, chairman and chief investment officer at Johnson Illington Advisors, said the retail sales news was still not enough to change investors’ mindsets.“Today, I don’t think we had news that was surprising enough to get the fence-sitters off the fence,” he said. “That big question of whether we are heading towards a hard or soft landing is still very much unanswered.

220;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2006-08-31T23:00:19Z;Gold fever spurs frenzy of mining acquisitions;;Mining companies are generating so much cash at the moment due to high metals prices that it sometimes appears hard for them to know how to spend it.Several large groups, such as Anglo American, Antofagasta and BHP Billiton, have unveiled special dividends and share buy-back plans in recent months as a way to give that cash back to shareholders. And some are beefing up their pipeline of projects.But, on the strength of the frenzied activity seen in the industry this year, it seems that much of the cash is being channelled into mergers and acquisitions.Thursday’s news that Goldcorp of Canada was buying Glamis Gold of the US for about $7.8bn in stock is the latest example of the wave of consolidation currently affecting the mining industry.Whether the acquisitions are paid for with cash or shares, mining executives have been given the confidence to strike ambitious deals by the fact that they are in the middle of the strongest commodities boom for several decades, and are making record profits. “There are more deals going on as mining companies have more cash, and less to spend it on,” says one London-based mining analyst.There is also pressure on mining groups, especially gold companies, to secure new reserves of metal, to replace what they mine and preserve the value of their asset base. Large new discoveries have been thin on the ground in the last decade and executives seem to think it is easier to buy new projects than find them through exploration.Last year BHP Billiton, the world’s largest mining company, bought WMC Resources of Australia for A$9.2bn (US$7bn), beating a rival offer from Xstrata. At the time, analysts said BHP was paying a very high price for the Australian business but, 18 months later, metal prices have surpassed expectations and the deal looks like a bargain.Since then there have been several large deals and several aborted takeovers. In the gold sector, Barrick Gold of Canada took over fellow Canadian group Placer Dome in a deal worth US$10.4bn in January. The acquisition made Barrick the world’s biggest gold miner, overtaking Newmont of the US. Gold analysts are now watching whether Newmont will buy up assets in order to regain its number one spot.Xstrata had its confidence boosted last month by the successful takeover of Falconbridge, the Canadian copper and nickel miner. Xstrata beat a rival bid from Inco of Canada with a C$18bn all-cash offer for Falconbridge, following a lengthy struggle. Trevor Reid, finance director of Xstrata, said last month that his group’s balance sheet would be in good shape again by next year and that Xstrata could do another big deal relatively soon. Analysts have said that ultimately Xstrata would like to take over Anglo American, its larger rival.As a result of Xstrata’s victory in Canada, Inco itself has become a takeover target. Inco is recommending shareholders accept a friendly cash-and-shares offer worth about C$16bn (US$14.4bn) from Phelps Dodge of the US but analysts predict that a hostile all-cash offer of about the same value from CVRD, the Brazilian iron ore miner, will come out on top. Teck Cominco of Canada also made a bid for Inco and it could decide to buy something else instead.AngloGold Ashanti, the South African gold group, has been seen as a potential acquirer since it was cut loose from parent company Anglo American this year.Anglo American cut its stake in AngloGold from 51 per cent to 41 per cent as part of a decision to focus on its core businesses. Bobby Godsell, chief executive, has stated that AngloGold was now free to pursue deals, and rumours suggest that the group could strike a deal with Gold Fields of South Africa.The mining takeover rush is unlikely to end in the next 12 months. Although some industry-watchers worry that metal prices, especially copper and nickel, have peaked, the more bullish executives and investors argue that the mining industry has entered a “super-cycle”.This is a multi-decade period of higher metals prices, driven primarily by strong demand from China and India, they say and, although commodity prices might come down from the current peaks, they will remain above historical averages.
221;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2006-08-31T19:24:48Z;Increasing pressure to produce for gold miners;;The gold sector is once again host to merger activity as investors seek gold miners with scale in an industry that is a minnow in the investment world.The combined market value of a merged Goldcorp-Glamis Gold is an estimated $21bn, putting it behind the world’s largest listed gold miners Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining.Even if you added together the world’s largest gold miners listed in the FT Gold Mines Index, which also includes Anglogold Ashanti, they would only equate to the $120bn market value of BHP Billiton, the world’s largest mining group.Graham Birch, head of investment at Merrill Lynch Gold and General Fund, said there would be further consolidation in the gold sector as there were many mid-tier companies that would be under pressure to merge in an effort to keep up with the larger gold miners.Another factor driving consolidation is the high premium attached to gold mining shares.Mr Birch estimates that the average share price to earnings ratio is about 25 times, while investors value base metal miners on an earnings multiple of only half this rate. “With their share prices trading at such high premiums, gold miners can afford to make all-share offers, in contrast to the base metals sector where cash is important to any bid,” said Mr Birch.Gold shares still attain high multiples, in spite of the recent drop in the gold price. The precious metal has dropped from its 26-year high of $730 a troy ounce struck in May, to $623.30 on Thursday, which is still more than 40 per cent above its level a year ago.Gold investors tend to be more optimistic than investors in copper or aluminium, as they are factoring in a rising gold price in futures markets, whereas base metal prices are quoted at lower levels in financial markets.Mr Birch said this price difference was the scarcity premium as gold was harder to find than copper, zinc or nickel, and this was why gold companies preferred to buy one another instead of spending more money on exploring for new resources. “Companies prefer to buy resources that are clearly defined in the ground, rather than speculating on looking for new discoveries,” he said.
222;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2006-08-24T19:35:34Z;Steps that can make mining a global force for good;;"There has never been a more critical time to ensure that mining contributes to long-lasting development. Soaring metals and minerals prices are bringing billions of dollars in tax revenues to mineral-endowed countries throughout the developing world, enhancing prospects for economic growth. It is essential that these windfall funds are used effectively for community development. This challenge is global.International mining companies, including state-owned companies from emerging economies, are increasing their investment in poor countries as mines in richer regions approach the end of their useful lives and China and India search for new sources of energy and minerals to fuel their growth. Equally, popular pressure is mounting in poor mineral states that have yet to demonstrate to their citizens that foreign direct investment can generate economic and social benefits.The international mining industry recognises that secure access to natural resources depends on environmentally and socially sustainable business practices. However, these are not solely under the control of mining companies. Enhancing the impact of mining on development requires joint action and new forms of partnership between governments, companies, civil society and international development agencies.Whether natural resource endowments are a curse or a blessing is a matter of intense debate. The development performance of mineral-rich countries has been mixed. In conflict zones, warlords have captured mining resources. In weak governance environments, royalties and taxes have fed corruption. Where economic management has faltered, Dutch disease (an uncompetitive trading sector) has set in.However, mining development opened up a path to prosperity for Australia, Canada and the US. When the right policies and institutions have emerged, mining has translated into long-term development. In Chile and Botswana, mining-oriented economies, appropriate use of mining revenues reduced poverty and generated economic growth. Ghana, Peru and Tanzania have also reaped economic benefits from mining. This confirms that, for developing countries, mining can provide a kick-start when foreign investment is hard to attract in other sectors.But what are the conditions needed to ensure such an outcome? The macro-level policies required to encourage investment and exorcise the “resource curse” include: competitive exchange rate and tax regimes; deficit and inflation control; fiscal stabilisation funds to cope with fluctuating prices; anti-corruption and transparency measures; and (relevant in Democratic Republic of Congo’s case) avoiding the use of revenues to fund conflict. An effective legal framework is also necessary: reliable property and mineral titles, contract security and procedural clarity. The real challenge lies in implementing these governance reforms.Research by the International Council on Mining and Metals, the World Bank and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development highlight the critical need for improved governance within mining regions. While many countries have instituted macro-level reforms that have helped attract mining investment, central governments have failed to use tax revenues from mining companies effectively to fund basic public services and empower local governments. This in turn can give rise to social tensions.The need to strengthen local governance capacity in mining areas underlines the importance of a partnership approach. Local agencies are the best means of improving the services and facilities available to affected communities but they cannot be expected suddenly to have the capacity to plan and implement large community development programmes. Host national governments must take the lead in supporting these bodies and be assisted by international donor organisations and companies. The companies can also help by planning their own projects: infrastructure and social investments, as part of a regional development plan. This can raise the chances that prosperity will flow to the whole region and also avoid a cycle of local dependence on companies’ social programmes.Companies have other key roles to play: in training local people; supporting more concerted joint action in fostering a competitive domestic supply chain for the mining industry; and encouraging the growth of small enterprises more generally. Such an approach is one of the main reasons why Chile has been so successful.Companies can also play an important part at the national level – by participating in national development dialogues to better understand poverty in mining areas. The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative is an encouraging example of what a global alliance can do. The EITI publishes government and company data on revenue flows, helping empower civil society to hold governments to account. By enhancing mining’s economic impact at national and local levels, such partnerships can create a favourable climate for investment and encourage positive attitudes among local people. For companies, maximising local benefits and reducing poverty is simply a matter of enlightened self-interest.The writer, chairman of the International Council on Mining and Metals, is chairman and CEO of Newmont Mining"

224;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2006-08-10T21:14:36Z;García takes softer line on Peruvian resources;;"Alan García, Peru’s new president, is treading more lightly in his relations with natural resources companies operating in the country than his colleagues in neighbouring Bolivia and Ecuador.Despite campaign pledges to impose a windfall profits tax on mining firms and reduce prices of natural gas-based fuels, Mr Garcia’s administration is instead asking them for a voluntary contribution towards social projects.Meanwhile, the government and shareholders of the Camisea natural gas project are reviewing possible changes in a pricing formula that could hold natural gas prices at their current level.“We are doing this in a friendly environment. It’s not a confrontation. It’s not a negotiation with pistols on the table,” Prime Minister Jorge del Castillo said on August 1.In Bolivia, by contrast, President Evo Morales is facing resistance from Brazil’s Petrobras as he tries to move ahead with plans to nationalise the country’s gas reserves. And in Ecuador, oil sector investment has slowed after Congress approved changes to the Hydrocarbons Law in March that will oblige foreign oil firms to hand over 60 per cent of excess earnings to the government.Mr García, who became president for the second time on July 28, said that new taxes could lead to lawsuits against the Peruvian state. Around a dozen mining companies, including units of BHP Billiton, Falconbridge, Newmont Mining Corp and Phelps Dodge, have signed stability contracts with the government, thus exempting them from new taxes or royalties.But perhaps more important are the billions of dollars in pending investment in the mining, hydrocarbons and electricity sectors. The private National Mining, Petroleum and Energy Society (SNMPE) calculates that figure at $10bn. Peru is one of the world’s major producers of copper, gold, silver, zinc, lead and tin and its exports this year are expected to reach $22bn, about 60 per cent of which are minerals.“The government clearly understands that changing the rules will affect investment and wants to avoid this,” Carlos del Solar, president of the SNMPE, told the Financial Times.He said, however, that it will not be easy for the mining companies in the SNMPE, about 30 in all, to come up with a formula with which they can all be happy for making their voluntary contribution. Each firm has its own reality – different operating costs, different prices depending on the metal and some are already paying royalties on sales.“The companies still have to agree and this has not happened. What we have to try to avoid is the tax,” he said.On the Camisea project, Mr del Solar said he expects the negotiations to go more smoothly. The main issue is the formula by which natural gas prices are determined. Currently, it is linked to the price of residual fuel, whose price has almost tripled since the contracts were signed in late 2000. Norberto Benito, general manager of the local unit of Argentina’s Pluspetrol which leads Camisea’s upstream consortium, said the talks will not lead to lower natural gas prices; they will only help avoid rises in the future.Still, some Peruvians have voiced dissent about Mr Garcia’s back-pedalling.“Part of the environmental conflicts [with mining companies], have to do with the fact that the people feel that natural resources are being extracted and that not everyone is benefiting from this wealth,” said Marco Arana, a Jesuit priest who runs Grufides, an non-governmental organisation in Cajamarca, home to Latin America’s largest gold producer Minera Yanacocha."
225;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2006-08-07T16:58:10Z;Brent crude hits record above $78 a barrel;;European crude prices soared to record levels yesterday after a pipeline leak forced BP to shutdown the giant Prudhoe Bay oilfield in Alaska.Prudhoe Bay, the largest oilfield in North America, produces 400,000 barrels of crude a day, equivalent to 8 per cent of US domestic production. BP was unable to estimate when output would be fully restored.By midday in New York, ICE September Brent hit a record $78.40 a barrel, up $2.23. Nymex September West Texas Intermediate hit $77.10 up $2.34 a barrel, below the record $78.40 reached in July.BP has been undertaking pipeline tests after 267,000 gallons of oil leaked in March, the largest spill since production began at Prudhoe Bay in 1977.Traders fear that this second leak could regulatory approval to restart production for several months.“The big question is the duration of the outage which nobody knows, not even BP,” said Mike Wittner, global head of energy markt research at Calyon.“Although it could take months before production is restored, crude and product supplies on the west coast of America are comfortable and Saudia Arabia produces crude of a similar quality which provides some spare capacity for the market.”Prices were further buoyed by a warning from Iran that it was prepared to employ a ban on crude exports if the UN Security Council imposed sanctions in response to its nuclear enrichment programme.Ali Larijani, Iran’s chief nuclear negotiator, warned of a “painful” reaction if sanctions were imposed on the world’s fourth largest exporter of crude oil by the UN Security Council.Iran had previously said that it would not use oil as a weapon in pursuit of a nuclear enrichment programme, but Mr Larijani appeared to be signalling a shift in Tehran’s stance.“We do not want to use the oil weapon, it is they who would impose it upon us. Iran should be allowed to defend its rights in proportion to their stance,” he said.With no end in sight to the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and continuing disruptions to output from Nigeria, fears are growing that oil prices could spike to $100 a barrel.Gold was a beneficiary of increased geopolitical uncertainty, firming 0.8 per cent at $651.00 a troy ounce.Newmont Mining, the world’s second largest gold producer, said it expected gold to trade between $600 and $650 for the rest of the year.Newmont also said strong demand and a lack of new mine development would underpin a further rise for gold prices in 2007.

228;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-25T00:30:02+0000;Gold miners discuss green code;;The gold mining sector has started talks with social and environmental activists on a “green” code for an industry that has for decades been one of their prime targets.The two sides have fiercely opposed each other, with miners arguing that they are injecting money into relatively poor communities where unemployment is high and welfare is low.In turn, environmentalists claim miners are doing this by adhering to minimal environmental standards, which has resulted in some cases in the pollution of local water supplies.Lobbyists also claim miners only reinvest a tiny amount of the money they make from exploiting the gold resource.“We are keen to work with the non-government organisations to find a solution to these issues, and if we come up with an agreement it is going to be better for everybody,” said Pierre Lassonde, president of Newmont Mining, one of the world’s largest gold mining companies.“We will have gold that is certified by the NGOs, and they will be happy that we are working to standards that they have help set.”Mr Lassonde said gold miners and NGOs had a first meeting on the prospect of “green” gold in Vancouver earlier this month. The mining industry is conducting the talks through the International Council for Mining and Metals, an industry group.The Newmont president said the goal was to have each gold mine certified if it adhered to the standards set between the NGOs and the miners. This in turn could by used by the gold jewellery sector to market gold that came from environmentally friendly mines. Newmont has been subject to protests by environmentalists, especially at its gold mine in Indonesia.Mr Lassonde said similar schemes have been achieved in the forestry and fishing industries. In the mining sector, diamond miners have worked with NGOs on “conflict diamonds”.However, any agreement between gold miners and NGOs will take years to achieve. “I can’t see any agreement for at least two or three years. There are a lot of issues to discuss, and we are far apart with some people on certain matters,” said Mr Lassonde.Environmentalists are concerned about the use of mercury in alluvial gold mining, which represents about 5 per cent of annual gold output and is concentrated mainly in Latin America where there are cases of mercury poisoning in rivers.The use of cyanide is also a contentious issue for NGOs, as the chemical is widely used by the industry to strip gold from rock. Cyanide also pollutes local water tables.

230;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2006-06-09T20:55:12Z;Wall Street falls back after heavy sell-off;;Wall Street fell back this week as three days of heavy selling dragged down the main stock indices.During the week, the S&P 500 briefly dipped into negative territory for the year.At one stage the Nasdaq Composite had fallen more than 10 per cent from its high in May, the scale of decline that many market watchers define as a correction. And the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell back below 11,000.Chipmakers trailed the market, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropping 6.4 per cent. On Wednesday, Citigroup re-vised down its sales forecasts for Intel and Advanced Micro Devices citing the possibility of a price war be-tween the chipmakers.Intel subsequently raised the possibility of just such a price war when it announced late on Thursday that it would cut prices by 60 per cent to gain market share.

The stock gained 6.7 per cent to $31.96. Also bucking the trend in the S&P 500 was BMC Software, which rose after reporting increased profits for the fourth quarter, aided by higher sales and cost-cutting. The shares received a further fillip from upgrades from Piper Jaffray and Goldman Sachs. BMC was up 6.3 per cent for the week at $22.02.At the close on Friday, the S&P 500 was down 0.5 per cent, or 5.63 points, for the day at 1,252.30, a loss of 2.8 per cent for the week.The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.5 per cent, or 10.26 points, for the day at 2,135.06, a weekly decline of 3.8 per cent. The Dow was down 0.4 per cent, or 46.90 points, for the day to 10,891.92, a loss for the week of 3.2 per cent, its worst week in a year. “We had a choir of Fed members singing to the same tune, that basically interest rates needed to go higher because of oil prices beginning to impact on inflation,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach.“That weighed on stocks and the correction continued. I suspect that the market was discounting higher rates of inflation and higher interest rates.”As the sell-off gathered pace, fears about inflation and interest rate rises – for a long time the dominant concern on Wall Street – were joined by broader fears about the health of the economy. This pushed up traditionally defensive consumer staple stocks such as Procter & Gamble and Molson Coors, while cyclical stocks suffered. Consumer staples groups Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson were rare gainers in the Dow.P&G added 0.9 per cent to $54.45, posting its biggest one day gain in over a year on Thursday. J&J was up 1.1 per cent to $61.38.Also attractive to skittish investors was brewer Molson Coors, which jumped 2.6 per cent to $67.96. Molson has gained 7 per cent in the past two weeks. “Defensive issues have become more fashion-able,” said Mr Cardillo.Slowdown fears meant investors shied away from cyclical and durable goods stocks. Monster Worldwide, the advertising and recruitment company, fell 11.7 per cent to $42.00, while construction equipment maker Caterpillar fell 7.3 per cent to $67.52.General Motors fell 4.3 per cent to $25.35.Exchange consolidation remained in focus as the NYSE Group’s agreed tie-up with Euronext ran into political opposition. Jacques Chirac, the French president, said he preferred a Deutsche Börse-Euronext combination, sending NYSE Group down 12.7 per cent to $57.15. Nasdaq fell 8.7 per cent to $27.41.
231;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2006-06-08T21:00:57Z;Wall Street flat after volatile session;;Wall Street ended flat on Thursday after a session of exceptional volatility sparked by growing investor concern about the US economy and interest rates. A late afternoon bounce pulled stocks back from an aggressive sell-off that for several hours had the S&P in negative territory for the year.“Some buyers jumped back in, but it was definitely a round trip,” said Brian Williamson, equity trader at Boston Company Asset Management.“There was a little bit of bottom fishing, and it’s definitely encouraging that the market held just below major support levels. It’s a positive sign that it bounced back like this.”At the close, the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent, or 1.78 points, to 1,257.93, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.3 per cent, or 6.48 points, to 2,145.32 – at one point falling more than 10 per cent from its May high, the threshold many analysts believe constitutes a market correction.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat, up 7.92 points at 10,938.82.Reports of the killing of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, al-Qaeda’s leader in Iraq, helped crude prices drop, but they recovered most of their fall later in the day, paring the losses made by energy stocks.Tribune jumped 4.2 per cent to $31.58 after the newspaper group said it was proceeding with its $2bn share buyback offer. There were reports it might also spin off its broadcasting group.Procter & Gamble proved attractive for investors skittish about a slowing economy. The world’s biggest consumer goods maker rose 2.8 per cent to $54.74, its best day in more than a year.Consumer goods and food retailers, both defensive plays, were the best performing sectors in the S&P.Fears of a slowing economy also fed through to advertising and recruitment company Monster Worldwide, which tumbled 4.9 per cent to $42.45.Novellus Systems, the manufacturer of semiconductor-making equipment, added 7.6 per cent to $24.16 after it raised its revenue and earnings forecasts. But other chipmakers suffered. Citigroup cut its price target on both Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, citing the risk of a price war between the two. Intel fell 1.6 per cent to $17.11 and AMD dipped 3.5 per cent to $27.03.Apple Computer rose 3.8 per cent to $60.76 on reports that the company might escape antitrust fines from the European Commission. Other technology stocks to gain included Electronic Arts, which added 2.7 per cent to $42.38.Allergan added 3.9 per cent to $102.27 after announcing that it had won FDA approval for a new drug to treat facial wrinkles.Gold continued to fall, dragging materials stocks down with it. Barrick Gold dropped 2.2 per cent to $28.17 and Freeport McMoran shed 2.6 per cent to $49.93. Newmont Mining fell 1.4 per cent to $49.77.

Shares in Yahoo and Ebay also rallied after the two internet companies announced a strategic tie-up.Investors cheered first-quarter GDP growth and slowing home sales data, which both slightly reduced pressure for further interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve. At 5.3 per cent, first-quarter GDP growth was short of forecasts.“The GDP number was very satisfying,” said Barry Hyman, equity market strategist at Ehrenkrantz, King Nussbaum.“There’s a building faith that the Fed is not going to raise interest rates. I think we’ve turned the corner in terms of the sell-off.”At the close, the S&P 500 was up 1.1 per cent, or 14.31 points, at 1,272.88, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.3 per cent, or 29.07 points, to 2,198.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which celebrated its 110th anniversary yesterday, rose 0.8 per cent, or 93.73 points, to 11,211.05.Investors paid special attention to MasterCard’s debut.

An unexpectedly big drop in durable goods orders for April provided some relief for the market?s fears of higher interest rates. Data on new home sales were stronger than expected.?Durables are too volatile for it to be much of an influence,? said Marc Pado, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. ?I think the housing number is more important since even though there was a revision, that pace of new home sales is still very healthy, which is reassuring.?At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2 per cent, or 18.97 points, at 11,117.32. The broader-based S&P 500 was up 0.2 per cent, or 1.99 points, at 1,258.57, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5 per cent, or 10.41 points, to 2,169.17.Nymex crude fell $1.90 to $69.86, dragging down ConocoPhillips 2.5 per cent to $61.15, and Chevron down 0.9 per cent to $57.60.?There was a lot of volatility, and all of a sudden, crude just tumbled,? said Mr Pado.Gold dropped 4.3 per cent, denting mining stocks with Barrick Gold losing 3.4 per cent to $30.06, and Newmont Mining down 3.2 per cent to $49.53.Trading was, however, dominated by the poor market debut for Vonage, the internet telephony provider, after its initial public offering was priced on Tuesday night. Volume in the stock was close to double that of any other on the New York Stock Exchange. By the close, it was down 12.7 per cent at $14.85.Mastercard was still scheduled to make its stock market debut on Thursday in what would be the biggest US initial public offering in two years.Technology stocks were led higher by Microsoft, which gained 3.1 per cent to $23.50.

Merrill Lynch upgraded the stock from ?neutral? to ?buy?.The weak durable goods order might have eased interest rate fears, but it made investors uncomfortable over Boeing which lost 3.3 per cent to $82.38.Medtronic, the medical devices manufacturer, was up 4.6 per cent at $50.17, thanks to an earnings report.Selling of exchange stocks continued, with the worst fall suffered by the InterContinental Exchange, which dropped 7.9 per cent to $53.87.

234;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2006-05-09T20:41:57Z;Wall Street flat as investors await Fed decision;;US stocks were flat on Tuesday as investors kept their powder dry ahead of Wednesday’s meeting of the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee.Analyst upgrades on Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and General Motors were offset by falls in the tech sector after a surprise profit warning from Dell.At the close, the S&P 500 was flat, up 0.48 points at 1,325.14, with the Nasdaq Composite down 0.3 per cent or 6.74 points at 2,338.25. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent, or 55.23 points, at 11,639.77.“The market’s less flat than it was [on Monday], and I don’t think we should expect more than that,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies and Co.“Historically, we don’t get much action before a Fed decision.”After the close of trade on Monday computer maker Dell said that its quarterly profits would fall short of its own forecasts, due to price cuts aimed at increasing market share and revenue. Dell, which had gained 2.9 per cent on Monday, tumbled 4.7 per cent to $25.20. Bank of America, UBS and Credit Suisse reduced their price targets for the stock.The car sector was the day’s best performer on the S&P 500, as General Motors bounced 9.6 per cent higher to $25.80 after a revision to its first-quarter results, which now exclude a charge related to retiree healthcare.The revision meant GM swung from loss to profit for the first quarter. Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock from “sell” to “hold”. Ford also did well, adding 2.9 per cent to $7.17.Mortgage providers Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae gained after ratings upgrades from Bank of America. Freddie Mac was raised from “neutral” to “buy”, helping the shares rise 1.2 per cent to $62.97.News of fresh accounting irregularities at Fannie Mae was overshadowed by BoA’s upgrade from “sell” to “neutral”.

Newmont, based in Denver, rose 4 per cent to $57.93, and Barrick added 2.7 per cent to $34.87.McDonald’s reported a 6 per cent rise in same store sales in April, ahead of analysts’ expectations, sending shares in the fast-food chain up 1.2 per cent to $35.83.Archer Daniels Midland gained 4.6 per cent to $45.22. The company, which is the largest producer of ethanol in the US, has seen its shares gain 13 per cent since Thursday and 50 per cent since February on the back of new regulations mandating the use of ethanol as a fuel additive, which came into force last week.The healthcare sector was one of the worst performers on the S&P 500, with United Healthcare falling 2.8 per cent to $43.80, and Cigna down 4.6 per cent to $88.73. Cigna has lost a third of its value since March.
235;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2006-04-21T21:33:46Z;Wall Street higher despite crude shock;;Wall Street raced ahead this week. Despite another surge in crude oil prices, the main indices were buoyed by solid corporate earnings, and by encouraging comments on interest rates from the Federal Reserve.With the quarterly earnings season shifting up a gear, the week started with robust results from the likes of Merck, Apple Computers and United Technology.This was followed on Friday by record earnings from Google and better-than-expected figures from 3M.Google jumped $35, or 8.7 per cent, to $437.10 over the week, after the internet search company delivered a strong set of quarterly earnings. Revenues doubled, easily topping market consensus. Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse all raised their price targets on the stock, while Merrill Lynch upped its rating from “neutral” to “buy”, citing among other things expectations that Google’s share of the online advertising market would continue to grow.3M, the Minnesota-based maker of Post-It Notes, gained 5.1 per cent to $85.06 for the week.However, wider market concerns were never far from the surface as continued concerns over supply disruption in Iran and Nigeria sent Nymex oil futures above $75 a barrel in Friday’s trading.In spite of the fresh spike in energy prices, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the week 1.9 per cent higher at 11,347.45 - its highest level in more than six years. The S&P 500 pocketed a weekly advance of 1.7 per cent to 1,311.28, while the Nasdaq Composite, which bore the brunt of Friday’s sell-off, rose 0.7 per cent over the five sessions to 2,342.86.Helping to keep buyers in the market was the publication of the minutes of the March meeting of the Federal Reserve’s open market committee. Traders reacted emphatically to the remarks, which were interpreted as a signal that the central bank could be closer than some had expected to the end of its tightening cycle.Although Wall Street held its ground this week, Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst at SW Bach, warned that high energy prices would remain a barrier to further advances. “We’re on a collision course, and somewhere along the way something has to give,” he said.Energy stocks were the best performing industry group on the S&P, rising 6.8 per cent, with sector bellwether ExxonMobil gaining 5.6 per cent to $65. Materials-related stocks such as gold miners and metal producers followed closely, gaining 4.2 per cent. Newmont Mining rose 8.9 per cent to $57.55 while US Steel jumped 6.5 per cent to $67.15.Along with Google, shares in Yahoo soared following the release of its quarterly figures. Although earnings fell from a year ago due to stock option costs, its shares advanced 5.7 per cent to $32.89 this week because revenues and adjusted earnings met forecasts. UBS raised its price estimates on the stock from $39 to $42, saying Yahoo’s earnings results were solid across the board.By contrast, Ebay endured losses after the online auctioneer failed to raise its 2006 forecast. Its shares slumped 9.1 per cent to $35.09.Dell shares skidded more than 4 per cent on Friday after Citigroup abruptly downgraded the computer maker two notches from “buy” to “sell”. Analyst Richard Gardner said Dell’s price advantage was being eroded by competitors. Over the week, the stock lost 8 per cent to $27.01.General Motors climbed 6.8 per cent to $21.79 as the carmaker showed signs of progress after losses narrowed from a year ago. The $323m first-quarter shortfall recorded by GM was better than Wall Street had forecast. But analysts said the improved quarterly results were partly down to increased production, which came as market share was falling.“Cost-cutting efforts, healthcare concessions, and restructuring should help GM narrow losses in 2006, but they will remain substantial,” said John Murphy, analyst at Merrill Lynch.More sobering was news of Ford Motor first-quarter loss of $1.2bn. Ford shares fell 7.9 per cent on Friday and ended the week down 0.4 per cent at $7.32.Interest in exchange stocks continued after International Securities Exchange, the options exchange, announced plans to launch its own stock exchange. The move helped ISE shares rise 7.3 per cent to $42.93 over the five sessions.
236;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2006-04-20T21:01:37Z;Dow hits best level in six years;;Blue chip stocks rode on a wave of strong earnings reports on Thursday as solid results from General Motors, Intel and Merck helped lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its best level in more than six years.General Motors was the top performer on the Dow, jumping 10.1 per cent to $22.64 as the troubled carmaker showed signs of progress in its recovery efforts after it sharply narrowed its losses from a year ago.The $323m first-quarter loss recorded by GM was better than Wall Street had forecast. Chris Ceraso, motor analyst at Credit Suisse, pointed out that excluding special items and healthcare charges, the company would have made a small profit in the quarter.Ford Motor, which will report its quarterly results on Friday, rode on GM’s coat-tails, rising 4.6 per cent to $7.95. Meanwhile, drugmaker Merck and tobacco giant Altria added further steam to the Dow’s rally, rising 1.7 per cent to $35 and 1.6 per cent to $70.04, respectively, after delivering double-digit rises in their quarterly profits.The Dow ended the session 0.6 per cent higher at 11,342.89 – its highest level since January 2000.The index’s all-time high was 11,722.98, which was set also in 2000.In the wider market, the other indices did less well. The S&P 500, checked by a sell-off in energy stocks, rose only 0.1 per cent to 1,311.46, while the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.4 per cent to 2,362.55 despite positive earnings from Apple.Instead the technology-heavy index was dragged lower by a sell-off in Ebay.The internet auction group sustained heavy losses after it announced lower-than-expected sales and profitsfor 2006.The stocks fell 8.9 per cent to $36.77 and the loss accounted for most of the Nasdaq’s 8-point drop.Losses on the Nasdaq were limited by Apple Computer, which rose 3 per cent to $67.63 after announcing second-quarter revenue rose by 41 per cent to $410m.Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co, said the fall in technology stocks was caused by investors cashing in after a strong run earlier in the week. “We’ve had a very good week and there’s been some profit-taking,” he said.“It’s nothing to be concerned about.”Gold miners and metal producers also fell to profit-taking, with Newmont Mining down 5.2 per cent at $55.42 and US Steel down 4.1 per cent at $66.18.Elsewhere, energy stocks pulled back following a dip in crude prices.The Amex oil index fell 0.9 per cent, led by Chevron, down 1.6 per cent at $60.03.Elsewhere, Bank of New York added to gains seen by the financial services sector in recent days as it delivered an 11 per cent increase in first-quarter net income, although its shares fell 2.2 per cent to $34.77.
237;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2006-04-10T20:47:15Z;Wall Street’s blue chips hold their ground;;"Blue chip stocks held their ground on Wall Street on Monday despite being knocked back by another surge in oil prices, which topped $68 on fresh fears over supply disruption as unrest in Nigeria and tensions with Iran intensified.Strong demand for the first ever US-listed oil exchange traded fund also contributed to the price spike.The Amex oil index jumped 1.5 per cent, with refiners and oilfield service providers benefiting most.Chevron rose 1.8 per cent to $59.72, Halliburton gained 2.4 per cent to $79.13 while Occidental Petroleum added 1.4 per cent to $96.50 and Baker Hughes climbed
4.4 per cent to $72.54.Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Co, said optimism over strong first-quarter earnings helped keep buyers in the market. At least 12 companies in the S&P 500 are set to release results this week, and earnings growth is expected to exceed 10 per cent for an eleventh consecutive quarter, according to analyst forecasts.“The fact that technology stocks haven’t suffered any serious setback in light of the spike in crude means that investors are not convinced that the higher oil prices are here to stay,” Mr Hogan said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the session 0.2 per cent higher at 11,141.33, the S&P 500 edged up 0.1 per cent to 1,296.62, while the Nasdaq Composite retreated 0.3 per cent to 2,333.27.A continued upswing in commodity prices lifted gold miners and metal producers. Newmont Mining, which rose 1.6 per cent last week, nudged up another 0.3 per cent to $52.90 after gold futures approached $600 an ounce. Alcan, the aluminium maker, gained 1.9 per cent to $50.49, while Alcoa added 1 per cent to $32.83 ahead of its earnings report, due after the close.By contrast, computer memory chipmaker Micron Technology, also due to report earnings after the close, fell 2.2 per cent to $14.91.The Dow was supported by Walt Disney, which rose 0.9 per cent to $27.79 after the entertainment conglomerate unveiled plans to make its top TV television programmes available free on the internet in a two-month trial.Shares in JPMorgan Chase and Bank of New York were active after the two banks announced plans for a $3bn asset swap. JPMorgan rose 0.4 per cent to $41.88 but BoNY slipped 4.9 per cent to $35.04 as investors appeared to take the view that the valuation of the deal with JPMorgan was too low.Blockbuster, the video rental chain, jumped 7.4 per cent to $4.50 after analysts at Citigroup upped their rating on the stock from “hold” to “buy”, citing improving rental trends.“Investors are overly discounting Blockbuster’s online business and long-term perpetuity value,” said analyst Tony Wible in a research note. Rival Netflix rode on the note’s coat-tails, gaining 1.1 per cent to $28.25."
238;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2006-04-07T20:39:21Z;Wall St succumbs to profit-taking;;"The old market adage “buy the rumour, sell the news” was in evidence yesterday as investors took profits after Wall Street’s run up this week in anticipation that the March employment report would come in stronger than expected.Nervousness about a sharp rise in long-dated bond yields provided traders with a further reason to sell. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.9 per cent at 11.120.04, the S&P 500 lost 1 per cent to 1,295.50 and the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.9 per cent to 2,339.02.The broad-based sell-off capped a week of volatile trading that left the Dow and the S&P 0.1 per cent higher over the five sessions, and the Nasdaq almost unchanged.Christopher Johnson, director of quantitative analysis at Schaeffer’s investment research, said the
wild intraday swings were due to a tug of war between bulls betting on a strong move higher as the earnings season gets underway on Monday, and bears who believed high interest rates and crude prices and record commodity prices would hurt earnings growth later in the year.“At the moment, I think the bulls have a slight edge over the bears,” he said, citing the absence of negative earnings pre-announcements as a cause for optimism.Energy, material and information technology were the top performing S&P industry groups this week. Shares of mining companies surged as metal prices such as copper and gold hit new highs. Copper producer Phelps Dodge advanced 4.3 per cent to $83.96, gold producer Newmont Miningadded 1.6 per cent to $52.74 and aluminium maker Alcoa jumped 6.3 per cent to $32.50.Energy stocks climbed alongside crude prices. The Amex Oil index rose 2.5 per cent, led by ConocoPhillips, up 4.4 per cent at $65.96.General Motors, which agreed to sell a controlling stake in GMAC, its finance arm, for $7.4bn this week, led the decliners on the Dow.It fell 8.3 per cent to $19.51 as sentiment was undermined by its ongoing dispute with Delphi and news that first-quarter sales fell by 14 per cent. Ford Motor, which reported lower sales, lost 4.5 per cent to $7.60.Merck weighed on the blue-chip index. Shares in the pharmaceutical group lost 2.2 per cent to $34.47 after it was ordered to pay at least $4.5m in compensation to a man who blamed Merck, the maker of Vioxx, for his heart attack.Analysts said the decision could potentially open the door for a new wave of litigation that could result in Merck paying billions of dollars in compensation.Supporting the Dow was 3M, which surged 7.1 per cent to $81.03 after raising its profit outlook for the first quarter. The Post-it Note maker said first-quarter revenue growth was expected to be as much as twice previous estimates while earnings could grow by up to 5.5 per cent.Technology stocks continued to make headway, with Apple Computer leading the way with a 11.3 per cent advance to $69.79.Apple shares soared after it unveiled new software allowing users to run Microsoft’s Windows operating system on its Intel-based Macintosh computers.Analysts said the move was likely to open the door to new Mac converts, although some warned that the gains would not be as swift and dramatic as some expected.“We would not expect any meaningful impact on Mac sales or earnings in the near or intermediate term,” said Rick Sherlund at Goldman Sachs.Google, up 4.1 per cent on the week to $406.16, saw its shares climb back above $400 for the first time since early February as index funds
continued to buy the stock following its inclusion in the S&P 500 index last week.Shares in Intercontinental Exchange, the electronic energy exchange, slumped 23.2 per cent this week to $53 after New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) announced plans to list its benchmark energy products on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).Morgan Stanley cut its rating on the stock, saying the CME-Nymex team-up
“creates a potentially formidable combination that could alter the competitive landscape for the ICE”.“While we continue to believe in the ICE’s solid position in the energy derivatives market, the CME/Nymex partnership may limit further upside in the stock price,” said analyst Camron Ghaffari."
239;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-24T22:03:09+0000;Peru nationalist targets global mining groups;;Ollanta Humala, the frontrunner in Peru’s presidential elections, has vowed to alter contracts with foreign investors that are currently exempt from paying royalties, a move that would affect global miners such as Newmont, BHP Billiton, Phelps Dodge, Falconbridge and Barrick.In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Humala also pledged to introduce “21st-century nationalisation” and said he would refuse to sign the trade deal Peru has agreed with Washington. In addition, he promised to restrict imports from China, limit Chilean investment in Peru and end US-sponsored eradication of coca, the raw material for cocaine.“We won’t revise all contracts but we will certainly change those with companies that aren’t paying taxes and royalties,” Mr Humala said. He added that he was thinking of projects such as Yanacocha in northern Peru, the most productive gold mine in the world, controlled by Newmont of the US.Mr Humala, a radical nationalist, regularly attacks foreign investors in his campaign speeches but has been vague about which contracts he would seek to revise. Although he did not say whether the changes would be negotiated or imposed, he stressed that “we will not act outside the law”.Peru has a sliding scale of royalties of up to 3 per cent of gross sales, but companies that bought privatised state-owned mines and deposits in the 1990s are exempt. Their contracts contain tax-stability agreements designed to attract long-term foreign investment in Peru after the economic crises of the late 1980s and early 1990s.The former army officer also proposes to introduce a “windfall tax” on international mining companies, which have invested $9bn (€7.5bn, £5.2bn) in Peru over the past decade.Mr Humala has 33 per cent support and a six-point lead over Lourdes Flores, his pro-free-market rival, according to Apoyo, the country’s leading pollster. However, internal government polling is thought to show his support as high as 42 per cent and some analysts even speculate that he may win the more than 50 per cent necessary to win outright in the first round of elections on April 9.His views on trade and coca will worry the Bush administration. On the trade agreement with Washington, agreed last December and yet to be ratified, Mr Humala said he would refuse to sign it. “We want a trade deal but it has to represent our national interests. This one does not, and it needs to be changed.”He also promised to end coca eradication, for which Peru receives some $100m a year in US aid. “The US strategy hasn’t made any progress against narco­trafficking,” Mr Humala said. “We need to work together – to tackle demand and to change international conventions that prevent us from industrialising and exporting legitimate coca products.”In another sideswipe at Washington, Mr Humala said he would “not tolerate a foreign military presence in Peru”, signalling that he would not accept a Colombia-style arrangement with the US in the “war on drugs”.Mr Humala said he wanted to change the constitution, which prevents the state from taking more than a subsidiary role in the economy. “The current constitution gave a lot of power to foreign companies,” he said. “It created economic growth but not development.” He said the state could buy shares in companies or set up joint ventures.“We want to nationalise strategic sectors of the economy. For example, LAN Chile has a monopoly on air travel in Peru. We need to set up a national airline – either publicly owned or as a public-private partnership – to break LAN’s monopoly. That is what is meant by 21st-century nationalisation.”The candidate repeatedly struck a protectionist note, warning of the need to “protect internal markets and aid economic development”. He warned that “imports of cheap textiles from China are wrecking our textiles industry”.“Small productive companies that provide employment are being destroyed. We should restrict those imports,” he said.Acknowledging the importance of China as a buyer of mining exports, Mr Humala said limiting textile imports would not damage relations. “China knows better than to let the issue affect our relationship. For them, it’s not as strategic a sector as it is for us.”He also said he would block investors from Chile, Peru’s historic rival, from bidding in port concessions.Despite the new details of his economic thinking, there were signs that much still remained to be hammered out. Asked whether he considered mining to be a strategic sector in which the state needed to be involved, Mr Humala was evasive: “I’ll tell you when I take office on July 28.”
240;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2006-03-22T22:00:22Z;Peru’s Humala vows heavy mining taxes;;International mining companies would face aggressive tax hikes under a government run by Ollanta Humala, the radical nationalist former officer who is the frontrunner in Peru’s presidential race.The increases would be used to fund a large expansion in public spending, with an emphasis on building roads, bridges and other infrastructure, according to senior economic advisers.“The extraordinary profits mining [companies] are currently enjoying must be taxed,” said Félix Jiménez, Mr Humala’s top economic aide. “The situation is like in 1973 when oil prices spiked.”Peru is the world’s third biggest copper producer, the fifth most important gold miner and a significant producer of zinc, lead and molybdenum. Prices for such commodities have risen sharply in recent years on the back of demand increases from Asia. Newmont Mining, BHP Billiton, Southern Copper and Barrick all have significant operations in Peru.Lima’s stock market and Peru’s dollar bonds fell further this week as polls showed Mr Humala taking a four percentage point lead over Lourdes Flores, the market-friendly candidate who is his main rival in the run-up to presidential elections on April 9.Gonzalo García, one of Mr Humala’s two vice-presidential running-mates, played down the market reaction. He said Mr Humala enjoys good relations with local business groups and would implement an orthodox fiscal policy.“If anyone is frightened, they should knock on the door and talk to the candidate,” the former central bank director told the FT.Mr Humala has unsettled investors by calling for the nationalisation of “strategic sectors” of the economy such as mining, hydrocarbons and utilities.At a campaign rally in La Victoria, a poor area of Lima, on Wednesday night, Mr Humala told a crowd of 20,000 that “foreign companies continue to enter our country and destroy our industries” and pledged to “rescind contracts that are against the national interest”.Mr García said the emphasis would be on promoting local Peruvian investment in industry rather than creating new state companies. “Peru’s government often operates as though its main priority is to defend the interests of private companies,” he said. “We have to nationalise the state, so it defends national interests.”Under Alejandro Toledo, the current president, Peru has been one of the most open economies in the region. Gross domestic product grew 6.7 per cent last year and the economy has expanded for 55 consecutive months.Mr Jiménez defended his party’s proposed tax increases, which would raise the burden from 13.8 per cent to 18 per cent of gross domestic product. “Peru has one of the lowest tax rates in the world,” he said.Over three years a Humala government would double infrastructure spending, from 2.5 to 5 per cent of GDP, but Mr Jiménez said the deficit would be kept below one per cent of GDP.The Humala aide said the government would maintain inflation at its current low level, with prices targeted to rise no more than 2.5 per cent a year.
241;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2006-02-17T22:02:43Z;Gold Fields playing catalyst to precious metals fusion;;The prospect of a merger between UK-listed Lonmin and Gold Fields of South Africa is likely to yield mixed opinions among investors and analysts in the precious metals mining sector.For the last few years, the trend in the mining sector has been for gold and platinum companies to keep their distance.Investors like to buy a stock that gives them direct exposure to gold or platinum prices and these companies’ shares command a premium over those of diversified mining companies such as Rio Tinto or BHP Billiton.Brad Mills, Lonmin’s chief executive who has a background in base metals, tried to move into other types of mining after he was appointed in 2004 but was given a stern rebuke from shareholders who wanted him to stick with platinum.But the gold and platinum industries have been intertwined before. Lonmin rose from the ashes of Tiny Rowland’s Lonrho empire, which included gold mining interests in Ghana.Until 2004, Lonmin owned a sizeable stake in Ashanti Goldfields of Ghana.Lonmin sold this stake to Anglo Gold of South Africa as part of its takeover of the Ghanaian group. And Gold Fields has shown interest in the platinum market over the last few years. In 2003, it bought into a platinum exploration project in Finland called Arctic Platinum.Lonmin is the world’s third-largest producer of platinum after South Africa’s Anglo Platinum and Impala Platinum.Gold Fields, meanwhile, is the fourth-largest gold producer after Barrick of Canada, Newmont of the US and AngloGold Ashanti.Gold Fields and Lonmin have a significant presence in South Africa. Until 2001, Gold Fields produced all of its gold from South African mines. It has since diversified into Australia and Ghana and recently made an offer for Bolivar Gold, a Venezuelan gold miner, for $360m (£207m).All of Lonmin’s mines are in South Africa, the source of more than three-quarters of the world’s supply of platinum. The mines are located in the Bushveld region, home to a large and unique deposit of rich platinum ore.The Bushveld has been thoroughly explored and new opportunities are thin on the ground, however, so Lonmin is funding exploration elsewhere.Although the gold price has performed well in the last few months, breaking through the psychological barrier of $500 an ounce, South African gold companies have seen their profit hit by rising costs and declining production.It is not surprising that Gold Fields has been looking at wider options. The platinum price has also had a phenomenal run, supported by strong demand from jewellery customers and the automotive industry, where the metal is used in catalytic converters.Gold Fields has so far not taken part in the recent wave of consolidation in the gold industry.In October 2004, Harmony Gold of South Africa made an audacious hostile bid for its larger rival and won the support of Norilsk Nickel of Russia, Gold Fields’ largest shareholder.But Gold Fields successfully fought off the bid.While it is not yet clear whether the talks between Lonmin and Gold Fields will result in a deal, it is certain that the Russian group will have a large role to play.
242;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2006-02-16T05:17:48Z;Newmont and Jakarta settle pollution dispute;;Newmont, the world’s largest gold producer, signed a deal with the Indonesian government on Thursday in which the company would pay $30m over the next 10 years to partially resolve a bitter 18-month-old environmental dispute.The “goodwill agreement” is meant to bring an end to a $135m civil suit filed by Jakarta over alleged pollution at Newmont’s now-shut Minahasa Raya mine in North Sulawesi.The Denver-based miner and a senior executive still face criminal charges in a trial now underway that is expected to drag on until June or July.Under the terms of the agreement signed on Thursday, Newmont will pay the equivalent of $3m a year to fund a new foundation to oversee community development projects around the Minahasa mine site. The money will also go to funding a six-person scientific panel that will monitor both the environment and the health of villagers around the mine site.But Wayne Murdy, Newmont’s chairman and chief executive, said the signing of the agreement on Thursday, was a “positive step” for the company.“It’s time that this be over,” he said. “We have felt very strongly about the science here. The fact that we are willing to subject ourselves to 10 years of scrutiny whereas the closure plan [for the mine, which was shut in August 2004] called for two [means] we’re just trying to display that we feel absolutely confident about the science.”The agreement signed on Thursday is likely to be seen as a significant win for President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and his efforts to bring foreign investment back to south-east Asia’s largest economy. According to data released on Wednesday, Indonesia’s GDP grew by an annualised 4.9 per cent - its slowest growth in six quarters - in the final three months of 2005.The deal is also expected to ease some of the pressure that US-based Newmont has felt over its environmental practices as part of a mounting global campaign against the gold industry.The agreement calls for Jakarta to abandon efforts to revive the $135m civil suit it filed against Newmont last year and withdraw an appeal to Indonesia’s Supreme Court against a lower-court ruling that threw out the case.Mr Murdy said on Thursday that Newmont remained “very confident” that it would prevail in the ongoing criminal trial.According to people close to both sides, the agreement signed on Thursday contains wording that would help partially exonerate Newmont by pointing to conflicting evidence over whether any arsenic, mercury or other heavy-metal pollution occurred near the Minahasa Raya mine.The agreement would not exonerate the mining company wholly, and the company is understood to have sought a stronger wording.However, the formation of the scientific team, a senior Newmont official said, would provide a “strong scientific underpinning that will confirm that there is no pollution”.Mahendra Siregar, spokesman for Indonesia’s chief economics minister, said the government’s position remainted that there had been pollution at Newmont’s operations. But he said Jakarta had decided to set aside the issue. “We don’t want to pursue this in court. We don’t think that is the right way.”Mr Yudhoyono’s government has been trying to re-energise a stalled economic reform programme. The government is due on Thursday to brief key donors on a new investment package that would involve the revamping of a controversial draft tax law and the introduction of new investment and labour laws.Jakarta is also understood to be a step closer to resolving a long-running dispute with ExxonMobil over control of a $2bn oilfield in Java.
243;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2006-02-15T22:02:35Z;Indonesia raises hopes for outside investors;;Indonesia has never been an easy place to do business and, in recent years, high-profile disputes between Jakarta and foreign investors such as ExxonMobil, Cemex and Newmont have stood as stark evidence of that.The result, in a world where investors are able to shift foreign capital across borders quickly, is easy to identify. Eight years on, Indonesia’s economy continues to struggle to recover from the Asian financial crisis and rid itself of the structural legacies of 32 years of crony capitalism.The 2004 election of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, a former Suharto-era general who has positioned himself as an economic reformer, raised hopes among foreign investors.But while Mr Yudhoyono’s government has launched an unprecedented war against Indonesia’s endemic corruption, the consensus remains that it has been slow to deliver on other investment climate reforms.That may be about to change.Jakarta is expected to sign an agreement on Thursday that will take its environmental dispute with Newmont, the world’s largest gold producer, over the Minahasa Raya mine in North Sulawesi a step closer to resolution – albeit one that will require the US miner to pay $30m over the next 10 years.Economic ministers are also scheduled on Thursday to quietly brief an investment climate working group made up of key bilateral and multilateral donors on plans for what is touted as a re-energised reform agenda.The policy package, work on which began last year, is built around revisions to a controversial draft tax law as well as new labour and investment laws.On top of that is an infrastructure-related policy package designed to resuscitate a stalled $150bn infrastructure investment programme that Mr Yudhoyono’s government launched early last year.According to Indonesian officials and others who work closely with the government, there are also hopeful signs that a final resolution to the longstanding dispute with Exxon-Mobil over the operatorship of the Cepu field in central Java may be moving closer.Officials say it is now in the hands of Boediono, the respected academic who took over as chief economic minister last December.He has been consulting with the president on how to break a deadlock between Pertamina, the state oil company, and ExxonMobil over who should operate the Cepu field.People close to the negotiations say progress has been made in drafting the other components of a joint operating agreement, which could see a deal signed within days.Mr Yudhoyono’s government still faces obstacles to needed reforms. Plans for an electricity tariff increase – something that investors say is badly needed to help attract foreign investment to Indonesia’s ailing power generation sector – face significant political opposition.But analysts say the Newmont settlement, due to be unveiled on Thursday, is at least one concrete example that Jakarta has not lost sight of what it needs to do to lure foreign investors back.“In the end what matters is the direction. Is the government moving in the right direction? And the speed. Is the government moving in that direction fast enough?” said Fauzi Ichsan, Standard Chartered’s chief economist in Jakarta.“There will be different perspectives on the speed. But in the end, everyone agrees the direction is good.”Analysts argue that a partial resolution to the Newmont saga is unlikely to carry the same weight as Jakarta finally resolving the fate of the $2bn Cepu field.The field is expected to add about 170,000 barrels per day to Indonesia’s current production of just under 1m bpd.“Cepu would be a milestone,” said Mr Ichsan.Meanwhile, Newmont still faces a criminal trial over alleged pollution at the Minahasa Raya gold mine that is expected to drag on until June or July.One of the company’s top executives faces a lengthy jail term if he is convicted.The “goodwill agreement” to be signed today also contains a bitter pill – Newmont will pay $30m over 10 years to fund a new community development foundation and monitor both the environment and health of people around the former mine site for a decade.Even Newmont officials, though, say that after months of negotiations and plenty of bad press they see a victory for Mr Yudhoyono’s government in its struggle to convince foreign investors to brave what remains a fraught investment climate.“It’s a great outcome,” one senior Newmont official insisted on Tuesday.“The government is reaffirming its commitment to a climate that is conducive to investment and a climate that is fair to investors. It’s very good for the government.”

The agreement could also help the company’s defence in that case.According to people close to both sides, the agreement contains wording that would help partially exonerate Newmont by pointing to conflicting evidence over whether any arsenic, mercury or other heavy-metal pollution occurred near the Minahasa Raya mine.The agreement would not exonerate the miner wholly, and the company is understood to have sought a stronger wording.However, the deal calls for an independent six-person scientific team to be set up to determine whether pollution occurred and to monitor conditions around the site for the next 10 years.

245;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2006-02-10T17:24:01Z;Decent earnings help to shrug off commodities dip;;Wall Street put in a resilient performance this week as a number of impressive earnings offset the impact of falling commodity prices which hit energy and mining stocks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to hold on to gains, adding 1.2 per cent over the week to 10,919.05 with the broader S&P 500 edging up 0.2 per cent to 1,266.99 while the Nasdaq eased back a fraction of a point to 2,261.88.Energy stocks slumped along with crude prices after an increase in US stockpiles offset supply concerns from key producers Iran, Nigeria and Venezuela.The S&P energy index was the worst performing industry group, down 4.5 per cent. EGO Resources, the oil and gas exploration company, led the decline, dropping 12.3 per cent over the five sessions to $69.37, while oil majors ExxonMobil and Chevron fell 3.2 per cent to $59.43 and 1.5 per cent to $56.27 respectively.Metal producers and gold miners were not immune to falling commodity prices. With both gold and base metal prices heading south this week, US Steel saw its shares give up 2.8 per cent to $54.80 and gold miner Newmont Mining shed 8.1 per cent to $54.80.Woes were further compounded by losses in the housing sector, following a bearish forecast from luxury housebuilder Toll Brothers.In the latest sign that the US housing market – a principal driver of the US economy in the past couple of years – may have peaked, the company said first quarter sales fell 29 per cent and cut its sales guidance for the full year.Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock from “buy” to “neutral”, while Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, called the housebuilder’s performance a “seriously startling plunge in activity”.Toll Brothers’ shares fell 7.3 per cent on the week to $29.82, taking their slide since the start of the year to 18.2 per cent.Although not a particularly good week for techs, Cisco Systems, the world’s biggest maker of networking equipment, was a strong performer in the second half of the week after the company’s chief executive delivered an upbeat outlook statement to complement fiscal second-quarter profits which avoided any shocks. Cisco shares were up 8.9 per cent on the week to $19.76.Electronic Data Systems, the computer services company, unveiled fourth-quarter net profit which more than doubled that of the previous year. The company picked up some positive broker comment in spite of falling revenues from General Motors, its biggest customer. EDS shares were up 1.3 per cent on the week to $25.72.Completing a trio of technology movers, software maker Oracle offered guidance on Friday that met with modest approval. The company said that following its merger with Siebel Systems it planned 2,000 job cuts across the combined company. Its shares were little changed on Friday, but rose 3.9 per cent to $12.69 on the week.The Dow was propped up by Walt Disney, which gained after the media conglomerate delivered an unexpected gain in first-quarter profit. News that it had sold off its radio assets to Citadel Broadcasting for $2.7bn further boosted sentiment for the stock, helping it finish the week up 6.7 per cent at $26.68.The blue chip index also found support in Pfizer. Shares in the drugmaker peaked on Wednesday after it said it was considering the sale of its consumer products division, home to well known brands like Listerine and Sudafed. Analysts said the unit might be worth more than $10bn, enabling the company to concentrate more of its energies on pharmaceuticals development and a return to earnings growth in 2006.The company disappointed on Friday however, when it said sales and adjusted earnings for 2006 would only be in line with those of last year as patents expired and generic competition bit. The shares slid 2.5 per cent on Friday, but were up 1.6 per cent on the week to $25.68.General Motors, the troubled carmaker, was once again the worst performer on the Dow this week. Promises of dividend cuts and slashing executive salaries failed to convince investors that unionised workers would accept cuts in wages, benefits and jobs. “There appears to be an ever increasing probability of confrontation with unions,” said Deutsche Bank, which downgraded GM to “sell” from “hold”. The shares fell 5.5 per cent to $21.87.Aon, the world’s second- biggest insurance broker and Spanish-language broadcaster Univision Communications were the top gainers this week on the S&P.Aon jumped 13.1 per cent to $38.11 after it reported that fourth-quarter net income almost tripled while Univision surged 11.1 percent to $34.70 after the company said it was considering a possible sale. CBS and News Corp both expressed interest while Time Warner and Walt Disney were also cited as possible bidders.

Aluminium maker Alcoa lost 3.6 per cent to $30.87, while shares in gold miner Newmont Mining gave up 6.8 per cent to $56.39.The losses weighed on the S&P 500, which closed down 0.8 per cent at 1,254.78. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.5 per cent to 10,749.76 while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.6 per cent to 2,244.96.The indices’ woes were compounded by weaknesses in the housing sector, which came following a bearish forecast from luxury builder Toll Brothers.In the latest sign that the US housing market was cooling, Toll Brothers said its first-quarter sales had plunged 29 per cent and cut its sales guidance for the full year.

247;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Mining counts the cost of cleaning up its image;;"Mining has an image problem. In developing and developed countries alike, the public tends to regard the industry as dirty, dangerous and disruptive – and those who stand to profit from it as greedy despoilers.But as gold, copper and other metals hit their highest prices for many years, and the power generation industry is poised for a big shift from gas to coal, the imperative to challenge that caricature is becoming more urgent.While mine companies are making record profits, and mining stocks are attracting swaths of new investors, the risk of reputational damage is also rising as easy-to-reach deposits of metals, coal and diamonds in locations such as Australia and Canada are exhausted, forcing mining companies to expand into more remote areas of Africa, Asia and Latin America.The critical voices are loud and well organised. But the industry is fighting back – admitting to past failings but trumpeting the message that, at a time when many fund managers use corporate social responsibility as an important criterion for investment, it has cleaned up its act.Fierce criticism of the environmental and social impact of mining is nothing new. The industry has long had a reputation for making large profits in poor countries and leaving nothing but environmental and social havoc in its wake.Typical of the protest movement is Earthworks, a US-based non-governmental organisation that since 2004 has been running a campaign called No Dirty Gold. It accuses gold producers of using cyanide to recover greater amounts of metal and of wrecking traditional ways of life. Like many NGOs, it argues that poor but mineral-rich countries are held back by the “resource curse”: profits from mining enrich foreign companies and a small, corrupt elite in government but not local communities.Bobby Godsell, chief executive of AngloGold Ashanti of South Africa, one of the world’s largest gold producers, argues that mining is no more inherently harmful than any other form of economic activity. But he admits that not all companies are responsible corporate citizens. “There is the possibility of ‘good mining’ – and you can find good projects all over the world. But there are also bad projects,” he acknowledges.In the 1960s, the mining industry pursued growth at all costs. The result was accidents and environmental damage. But in the 1970s the strategy began to be questioned. Mr Godsell says pressure from governments, NGOs and shareholders was pivotal although he argues that executives’ consciences also played a part.But far from abating, protest movements have grown, in part because the internet has opened avenues of complaint to once-disenfranchised communities. Recent examples of anti-mining protests include objections to the Rio Blanco copper project in Peru, owned by Monterrico Metals of London, and hostility encountered by Newmont, the US gold producer, in Indonesia. In 2001, several big mining companies decided that action was needed to tackle their industry’s poor image. They formed the International Council on Mining and Metals, a grouping that styles itself as “the responsible face of mining”.This made good business sense, companies say. As graduates increasingly shun “old” industries, the mining sector is facing a shortage of new talent and companies hope a rehabilitation of the industry’s reputation could help attract young blood.In its first five years the ICMM has had plenty to keep it busy. While accidents are less frequent than they used to be, issues of waste disposal and the use of toxic chemicals remain. Newmont is currently locked in a battle with local people, NGOs and politicians in Indonesia over whether the gold company dumped toxic waste into Buyat Bay, near its now-closed Minahasa Raya mine, and consequently poisoned villagers. Newmont admits to dumping the waste but insists it had been treated and was harmless. Wayne Murdy, chief executive of Newmont, has since said the dispute was more to do with a breakdown in relations with the local community than the environment itself.An example of ICMM’s proactive approach concerns cyanide – which, though highly toxic, is widely used in the recovery of gold because it allows metal to be retrieved from low-grade ore. In an attempt to ease criticism of the chemical, the ICMM has developed the “Cyanide Code”, a voluntary list of guidelines for the safe application of the poison in gold mining.It is not simply reputations that are at stake. The World Bank, through its International Finance Corporation arm, controversially helps finance mining and oil and gas projects around the world. But access to the funding depends on companies’ capacity to make a convincing case that their approach to the environment and affected communities is “sustainable”, in the jargon.In 2004, the Extractive Industries Review, an independent report commissioned by the World Bank, recommended a halt to this funding, because of the industries’ negative side-effects. The bank rejected this recommendation and pledged to fund more projects than ever. But it undertook to get involved with projects earlier, so its standards on the environment and community engagement were met.Rashad Kaldany, director of oil, gas, mining and chemicals at the World Bank/IFC, insists past problems have been resolved, maintaining: “The use of cyanide should not be an issue in a well-run mine today.” But he says communities near to mines “have legitimate worries” based on past pollution incidents. Again, the problem often boils down to a lack of communication between mining companies and local people. If mining companies go against their natural instinct to keep a low profile, and try to engage local communities, protests can be avoided, says the World Bank.There are some signs that companies’ claims to have got to grips with the environmental side-effects of what they do in recent years are well-founded. They are making more efforts to study the ecosystem in an area before they start work and to limit the damage that mining does to plant and animal life. Generally, the industry is starting to compile better environmental data – on water quality, for example – before mines are built. The World Bank is encouraging this, in part so they can counter any subsequent accusations of pollution.Perhaps the most striking example of a company that has sought to shed a reputation for environmental irresponsibility is Rio Tinto of the UK. It spent several years working on the preservation of biodiversity before proceeding with its controversial ilmenite project in Fort-Dauphin, Madagascar.This represents a big cultural shift. As one of the first large diversified mining companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, Rio Tinto was for many years the bête-noire of environmental groups, who used regularly to picket its annual shareholder meetings. “It is ridiculous to say that mining is not intrusive for the environment – but we can minimise the intrusiveness,” says Andrew Vickerman, Rio Tinto’s head of communication and sustainable development. The company has got better at explaining itself, he says, and he talks to a full range of NGOs, from well-established organisations such as Oxfam and Greenpeace to more radical groups. “Our approach to engagement changed about a decade ago. There was a realisation that reputation is hugely important.” There is a clear commercial pay-off, he acknowledges. “If we prove we can mine responsibly, it will get us access to new resources.”Mr Kaldany at the World Bank says that “many of the most important players in the industry take the issue of sustainable development very seriously” but smaller mining companies do not always adhere to the new standards. Mr Vickerman at Rio Tinto accepts that this is a problem for the sector. “The mining industry is judged by its worst performers and there are some real cowboys out there.”Now a new front is opening up for the industry: the need to tackle the social fall-out from its activities. That can range from the spread of HIV/Aids by migrant workers to increased government corruption and broader questions about whether indigenous populations are reaping an appropriate share of the spoils.Critics point out that examples of communities made rich by mining are sparse. Botswana’s economy has grown fast as a result of revenues from diamond mining but, even there, people are worried about what will happen to the economy after the mines are closed. The World Bank is encouraging the development of other types of economic activity in mining regions, so that people are not so dependent on finite mineral resources.But investors may query whether a need to appease environmental and social campaigners is leading companies to assume a role that more properly belongs to governments.In the poorest countries, mining companies often find themselves building infrastructure such as roads, schools and hospitals. Not surprisingly, these companies are sometimes attacked as proxies for the government. In such cases, the World Bank is pursuing a policy of “capacity building”, a mixture of education, training and anti-corruption measures. Although it is not mining companies’ responsibility to ensure governments function properly, it is in their interests, the bank argues.Mr Kaldany says mining companies should focus on winning local support. For example, jobs should go to local, rather than imported workers. “If local communities do not feel they are benefiting from mining, I don’t think the image of the industry will change.”There are signs that investors agree. Todd Warren, who manages mining and energy stocks for First State Investments, says he would avoid investing in a company that had put aside insufficient money to cover environmental issues, especially for the clean-up of the site after closure. “The mining industry can no longer operate without taking environmental issues into consideration. If they do, these issues will come back and hurt them.”Although an eye should be kept on corporate costs, Mr Warren says, the increasing amount devoted to the environmental and social side of mining is money well spent. It protects both against accidents and community protests.“Bad publicity has a huge cost,” he says.RIO TINTO’S TORTUOUS PATH TO TREAD ON LEMUR ISLANDBy John ReedOn a strip of rainforest in southern Madagascar, women pluck and repot seedlings destined to revive ravaged surrounding woodland. The variety of seed shapes, sizes and colours attests to the diversity of local flora. About 85 per cent of Madagascar’s plants are unique to the east African island; many exist on just one scrap of land.“There are only nine trees like this left,” says Manon Vincelette, holding up a palmful of knobbly seeds from the genus Eligmocarpus. While studying the forest near the port city of Fort-Dauphin, her team discovered about 10 plant species, a gecko and a snake that were unknown before.The Canadian is the environmental manager for Rio Tinto’s QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM) project, which will soon begin mining ilmenite, used to whiten paint, plastics and paper. Ms Vincelette has been helping lay the groundwork for a decade and commands a staff of 60. She receives advice from a 10-member biodiversity committee that includes a representative of London’s Kew Gardens and an expert in lemurs, the primates unique to Madagascar.“Without the company, this forest probably wouldn’t be here,” she says of the 230 hectare (568 acre) forest. The claim is credible: local residents are felling other forests for charcoal or slash-and-burn agriculture.Rio Tinto plans to invest $585m (£331m, €483m) in the mining project, Madagascar’s biggest inward investment. Due to yield the business-friendly government about $20m a year in royalties, it will also bequeath a port capable of handling other exports and cruise ships.But because of the risks to the island’s biodiversity, QMM’s history has been tortuous and Rio Tinto has been under severe criticism from environmental campaigning groups. The company hired Ms Vincelette from Conservation International and Lisa Dean, a former country director for the charity Care, to examine the project’s social impact. It has studied everything from butterflies to local demand for charcoal and the potential spread of HIV brought by workers who will build the port, and helped start an organisation for Fort-Dauphin’s sex workers.The project illustrates the lengths to which mining companies need to go to minimise the impact of their fundamentally “dirty” business. Rio Tinto has in the past faced warranted criticism for despoiling regions where it mined. But QMM’s relationship with non-governmental organisations has gone from antagonistic to largely co-operative. Taking on board criticism from the NGOs and local communities, the company moved the location of the port and pledged not to mine on the endangered piece of forest where Ms Vincelette’s team runs the nursery, equivalent to about 10 per cent of the mining deposit.“The main turning point in our environmental partnership with NGOs came when we said, ‘We’ll set aside 10 per cent of this valuable mineral – and reduce our return – to protect the forest’,” says Guy Larin, QMM’s director-general. The project sets a precedent, he adds, “we hope not just in economics but in environmental and social responsibility”.Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, still claims it will damage biodiversity and bring local people little benefit. But WWF, the environmental charity, after a critical view in 2001 now supports the project, with qualifications. “On balance, it’s very favourable to the region and favourable to Madagascar in general,” says Martin Nicoll, senior conservation adviser for WWF in Madagascar. He retains concerns about dust, chemical and noise pollution but says the project will “create huge opportunities for direct employment and associated services”.Assessments and consultations resulted in the signing of a dina, a traditional social contract binding the company and local communities to meet certain obligations. Building the port is due to start this year andQMM will employ up to 1,000 foreign workers at a time as the project reaches its peak over the next three years. They will be confined largely to a purpose-built village and held to a code of conduct. “We can’t stop all fraternisation but we can put all the firewalls in place,” says Ms Dean.The company has linked with donors on HIV programmes. Ms Dean admits that some preparations may be insufficient – or beyond the call of duty. “There’s really no benchmark as to what’s enough.”ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN■ 2006: A shaft collapse this month at the Sago coal mine in West Virginia, owned by International Coal Group, killed 12. The mine had previous alleged safety breaches.■ 2000: A truck transporting mercury from Newmont’s Yanacocha gold mine spilled its cargo over a road in Peru. People who scooped up the poisonous liquid later had problems from blindness to memory loss.■ 1998: A break in the wall of a waste dam at the Los Frailes zinc/copper/lead/silver mine in Spain sent contaminated water into the Rio Agrio and the Guadiamar river near Seville. The clean-up took seven months and cost more than $100m.■ Early 1990s: At the Summitville gold mine in Colorado a cyanide leaching facility started leaking soon after operations started. The US Environmental Protection Agency had to foot the clean-up bill after Galactic Resources of Canada, the mine’s owner, went bankrupt."
248;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2005-12-28T21:41:28Z;Wall St rallies on consumer confidence;;Wall Street staged a gentle rally on Wednesday, lifted by news of higher-than-expected improvement in consumer confidence in December and a late surge in holiday spending.The signs of strength in the US economy trumped concern among investors about an inversion of the treasury yield curve.For a second consecutive day, yields on 10-year US Treasury briefly dipped below those on two-year paper. The inversion has historically heralded the start of a slowdown in the US economy. But in contrast to Tuesday’s frenzied sell-off, investors appeared unfazed by the renewed convergence.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the session 0.2 per cent higher at 10,796.26, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both ticked up 1 per cent to 1,258.17 and 2,228.94 respectively.Energy stocks, which rebounded along with crude prices, helped keep the Dow afloat. The Amex oil index gained 1.6 per cent, while the energy-price-sensitive Amex airline index dropped 2.4 per cent.Gold companies also advanced after the price of bullion hit a two-week high. Newmont Mining, the world’s biggest gold producer, climbed 3.5 per cent to $53.40 while Freeport-McMoRan Cooper & Gold, owner of the world’s biggest gold mine, rose 2.6 per cent to $54.88.On the Nasdaq, gains in eBay, up 1.4 per cent at $44.37, helped offset losses in Apple Computers. Shares in the iPod maker, which have seen intense demand this year, pulled back 0.9 per cent to $73.57 on valuation concerns. Elsewhere, retailers were in focus after the International Council of Shopping Centers said US retail chains’ same-store sales rose 2.8 per cent last week.However, Target dashed shareholders’ hopes for a robust holiday sales season after it said December same-store sales only rose in line with previous guidance. Its shares dipped 0.1 per cent to $55.55. Meanwhile, rival Wal-Mart advanced 0.2 per cent to $47.84.By contrast, Linens ’n Things, the home furnishing retailer, surged 10.9 per cent to $26.52 on news that the private equity firm Apollo Capital Management was preparing to complete its acquisition of the company.Albertson’s, the grocery chain, climbed 1.3 per cent to $21.10 after JPMorgan upgraded its rating on the stock. The broker said that the collapse of takeover talks last week would open the door for shareholder activists.Drugmaker Celgene jumped 5.9 per cent to $60.85 after the Food and Drug Administration approved its anaemia drug Revlimid.AstraZeneca, the UK’s second largest drugmaker, traded up 0.9 per cent to $48.85 after it signed a $300m research and licensing agreement with Targacept to develop and market an experimental treatment for Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia.
249;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2005-12-22T19:33:04Z;Barrick agrees to buy Placer Dome for $10.4bn;;Vancouver-based Placer Dome has agreed a sweetened $10.4bn cash-and-shares takeover bid by Barrick Gold of Toronto, setting the stage for Barrick to overtake Newmont Mining as the world's biggest gold producer.Peter Tomsett, Placer's chief executive, said on Thursday that the improved bid “addresses the inadequacies” of Barrick's initial $9.2bn offer, which it made in late October.Placer has agreed to pay Barrick a break-up fee of up to $260m if a superior bid emerges. Mr Tomsett said that Placer had held talks with a number of other prospective bidders.The deal underlines the snowballing rate of consolidation in the global mining industry. Barrick's chief executive Greg Wilkins said that “we didn't do this just to be the biggest. We did it to be more competitive in the industry.”Terms have also been improved of a side deal to spin off some Placer assets, mainly in northern Ontario, to Goldcorp, a smaller Toronto-based gold producer. Goldcorp will now pay $1.49bn, up from $1.35bn.Barrick and Placer are expected to produce a combined 8.3m-8.4m ounces of gold this year, with reserves totalling 150m ounces.Newmont's 2005 output is estimated at about 7.4m ounces.Barrick and Placer own several mines and exploration properties close to one another in Nevada, western Australia, Chile and Tanzania. Total cost savings from joint management of these properties were estimated at $240m a year when Barrick made its initial offer.Mr Wilkins said on Thursday that additional synergies had been found since then, but he declined to be specific.According to Mr Wilkins, Barrick intends to keep Placer's portfolio of mines intact.But he added that Barrick had “an open mind” about the future of Placer's 50 per cent stake in the big South Deep mine in South Africa, which has been dogged by high costs and low production.South Deep would be Barrick's first foray into South Africa. “We intend to spend some time fully understanding the asset and its opportunities”, Mr Wilkins said.Placer earlier criticised Barrick's relatively large hedged position and long delays in developing the Pascua-Lama project on the Argentina-Chile border.But Mr Tomsett said on Thursday that the Vancouver company “now understands Barrick's perspective” on these issues. Placer has been considered a takeover target for some time.A sharp rise in operating costs at some of its mines has more than offset the recent jump in the gold price, leading to a drop in earnings and a lower share price. Placer's third-quarter earnings shrank by 77 per cent.Barrick shares ended the day off by 0.3 per cent, and Placer's stock lost 1.3 per cent following the wake of Thursday's announcement.
250;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2005-12-12T21:10:50Z;Observer - US;;On the sidelines of the gold boomThe top brass at Barrick Gold should have been laughing all the way to the bank on Monday as the gold price shot to $540 an ounce, its highest level in a quarter century. The Toronto-based gold producer’s shares climbed above $28, about a third higher than they were six months ago.Instead, long faces abounded at Barrick’s head office. Senior officers are barred from exercising their stock options pending the outcome of Barrick’s $9.2bn hostile bid for Placer Dome of Vancouver. “Just when one would probably have exercised some, we are blacked-out,” grumbled one manager.The Barrick folks have the consolation that two of their counterparts at Placer may be feeling even more sore. Jim Cooney, Placer’s vice president for international government affairs, and John Loney, vice president for risk management, each cashed in a chunk of their options a day or two after Barrick announced its bid on October 31.They both sold at under $20. Placer’s shares were trading on Monday at more than $23, with rumours rampant that Barrick will jack up its offer or that Newmont Mining of Denver is about to join the fray.Having played down expectations that this week’s meeting in Hong Kong will make any big breakthroughs in the stalled Doha round talks, World Trade Organisation members have been casting around for something to keep them busy and to show that their journeys were not entirely unnecessary.Their big idea is a package of measures intended to benefit poor countries and persuade them that this really is a “development round”.How much good it will do is uncertain. But at least Hong Kong’s economy stands to gain. Its government is budgeting US$33m for the meeting, and local businesses are chipping in a further $7m towards the cost. The tourist board says that on average, visitors attending conferences spend $284 a day each. If all 11,000 registered participants show up and stay the full six days, that should see $19m rolling in.Then, of course, there are the bills for air travel. Assuming average fares of $2,000 each, that will add a further $22m. By Observer’s tally, that makes a grand total of more than $80m, almost as much as the WTO’s annual budget.For that sort of money, the meeting had better come up with something that makes a real dent in global poverty.One conspicuous absentee from this week’s meeting will be Mogens Peter Carl, veteran European Commission trade warrior and long a thorn in the side of Brussels’ WTO partners. Dubbed Darth Vader by US trade diplomats, the imperious Dane is legendary for his aggressive negotiating methods and ability to rub people up the wrong way.Carl even managed to antagonise his own side. At the WTO’s last ministerial meeting, in Cancún two years ago, several EU ministers grumbled that he had failed to consult them properly, brushing aside their advice and insisting on taking a hard line in the talks.When developing countries walked out of the talks, causing them to collapse, some European officials blamed the debacle partly on Carl’s intransigence.Peter Mandelson, trade commissioner and Carl’s boss, lost patience with him soon after taking office a year ago. After dropping veiled public hints that the great Dane had got too big for his boots, not least after a leaked letter from Carl accusing Mandy of being swayed by celebrity trade justice campaigners such as Bono, Mandelson succeeded in drafting in David O’Sullivan, a less abrasive Irishman.Carl was shuffled off to a lesser job as head of the environment directorate. That may mean stormy weather ahead for international climate change talks. But it should improve the atmosphere at the talks.There is not much any delegate can do about the atmosphere outside the conference centre.A poisonous smog – coyly referred to as “haze” by politically correct weather forecasters and Cathay Pacific airline pilots – often blankets the city at this time of year, when the wind blows in from the tens of thousands of factories in the Chinese province of Guangdong to the north.In the city centre on Monday, airborne particles – soot and dust, that is – and nitrogen dioxide each hit the level described by Hong Kong’s Environmental Protection Department as “very high”. That means those with heart or breathing problems are advised to stay inside.It must be comforting for WTO negotiators to know that they are no worse off in smoke-filled discussion rooms than they would be outside in the open air.Hong Kong’s government has gone to enormous lengths to ensure security. The police will deploy one third of the 27,000-strong force, and the government has been busy drawing up multiple scenarios for dealing with violent protests.Office buildings near the convention centre in Wanchai are wrapped in protective wire netting, some companies have stocked up on instant noodles for hungry staff who might get trapped in the building, and others have set up facilities for staff to work from home or elsewhere if necessary. Banks and government offices plan to shorten their hours, many shops will close, and even the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has moved more than 100 dogs and cats out of its local office.Some people are staying put, though. One plucky local is flying a flag in the city centre saying “Hong Kong loves capitalism”. As a local restaurant owner put it: “Protesters need to eat too”.
251;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2005-11-23T22:00:15Z;Placer Dome calls Barrick offer too low;;Placer Dome of Canada on Wednesday rejected a US$9.2bn hostile bid from Barrick Gold, its larger domestic rival, saying the offer was too low and carried too many risks for investors. Placer said it was now talking to other groups about a deal, rumoured to include Newmont of the US.Toronto-based Barrick, the world’s third-largest gold producer after Newmont and AngloGold Ashanti of South Africa, made its unsolicited cash and shares bid for Vancouver-based Placer on October 31.Robert Franklin, Placer’s chairman, said on Wednesday that his group’s board had taken “a long, hard look at Barrick’s bid and found it lacking many respects”. He said the board was unanimous in its decision to reject the bid, which undervalued Placer and was made opportunistically at a time when Placer’s shares were underperforming Barrick stock.Peter Tomsett, Placer’s chief executive, said: “It is clear why Barrick would want to buy Placer Dome, but why would Placer want to do a deal with Barrick?”Placer had a strong pipeline of mine development projects and was increasing its gold production, while Barrick was finding it hard to replace its gold reserves, he added.Barrick said on Wednesday it did not intend to increase its offer, which it described as “full and fair”.Barrick needs to receive acceptances from 66.66 per cent of Placer’s shareholders by December 20 for its bid to be successful.If the deal goes ahead, Placer’s shareholders would be left with about 35 per cent of the merged entity. Mr Tomsett said this was risky for Placer investors, and would leave them exposed to future drops in Barrick’s share price. He said there was uncertainty surrounding Barrick’s gold hedging policy, and also on the viability of certain Barrick projects, such as the Pascua-Lama deposit on the border of Chile and Argentina. Placer’s management will be visiting shareholders over the next few weeks in an effort to discourage them from tendering their shares to Barrick.Placer is the fifth-biggest gold producer in the world and a combination of the two companies would form the world’s largest gold company, overtaking Newmont.The group has for some time been considered a takeover target, and a sharp rise in operating costs has more than offset the recent jump in the gold price, leading to a drop in earnings.Barrick has said its offer would produce cost savings of about $240m a year because of synergies between the companies’ mines and exploration properties, located close to one another in Nevada, West Australia, Chile and Tanzania.Mr Tomsett said that Placer had opened a data room for other potential bidders, and that there was “significant interest”. It has been reported that Newmont was one of the companies weighing up a bid. The US company declined to comment.
252;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2005-11-15T12:05:07Z;Indonesian court dismisses suit against Newmont;;An Indonesian court on Tuesday threw out a $133m suit brought against the world’s largest gold miner Newmont in what is likely to be seen as a significant victory for foreign investors in south-east asia’s largest economy.The lawsuit was brought by the government of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono earlier this year as a result of a dispute over alleged pollution at a now-shut Newmont mine in Sulawesi Province.But its dismissal on technical grounds by a Jakarta court is a victory for Newmont as well as foreign investors who complain that Indonesia’s courts often disregard internationally binding contracts. The court ruled that the government had erred by filing a lawsuit rather than going to arbitration as called for in Jakarta’s contract with Newmont.Newmont still faces criminal proceedings against it and Richard Ness, a senior executive, in connection with its Minahasa Raya gold mine in Sulawesi.Newmont has been accused of contaminating with heavy metals a bay near the mine into which it disposed of treated mining waste while it was in operation. But Newmont argues that studies by bodies such as the World Health Organisation show no pollution occurred.Newmont has come under attack from environmentalists for its practices in Indonesia, Peru and elsewhere.In Indonesia the case has also been watched closely by foreign investors amid promises from Mr Yudhoyono and his government that they want to improve what is seen as a sometimes hostile environment for foreign capital.Jakarta and Newmont have been in negotiations over the civil lawsuit for months. A potential agreement is understood to hinge on the company establishing a fund to help villagers and extend environmental monitoring in the area.The company on Tuesday welcomed the ruling. “It’s a real positive,” said Bob Gallagher, Newmont’s vice president in charge of Indonesian operations.Mr Gallagher said negotiations with the government would continue despite Tuesday’s ruling. “The dispute does still exist,” he said after the verdict. “The Ministry of Environment thinks we polluted and we believe that we didn’t.”The environment ministry said Tuesday it might appeal or take its case to another forum.“It’s very clear that [the other mining companies] were all watching this trial,” said a western observer.“If Richard Ness gets convicted – even if he doesn’t serve a day in prison – that will have a very chilling effect on foreign willingness to do business here,” he said.
253;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2005-10-31T20:51:37Z;Barrick Gold offers $9.2bn for Placer Dome;;The consolidation of the global mining industry accelerated on Monday when Barrick Gold launched an unsolicited $9.2bn cash-and-stock bid for Placer Dome, its Canadian rival.A deal would make Toronto-based Barrick the world’s biggest gold producer. However, Placer is widely expected to seek improved terms for a deal by looking for a white knight.Placer, based in Vancouver, has for some time been considered a takeover target. A sharp rise in operating costs has more than offset the recent jump in the gold price, leading to a drop in earnings and a lower share price. Placer’s third quarter earnings shrank 77 per cent.Greg Wilkins, Barrick’s chief executive, on Monday said the two companies had held “a number of conversations over the years and never had much traction from them”.The combined company would produce 8.3m-8.4m ounces of gold and 370m pounds of copper a year. Newmont Mining, the biggest producer, has projected 2005 output of 7.4m ounces.Mr Wilkins said Barrick would benefit from synergies between the companies’ mines and exploration properties. Cost savings are estimated at $240m a year.The deal would give Barrick its first foothold in South Africa, where Placer has a 50 per cent stake in the South Deep mine.Mr Wilkins said Barrick wanted to “revisit” the Cerro Casale deposit in Chile, which Placer said recently was not viable. Placer announced a deal last week to sell its stake in Cerro Casale.Barrick has struck a separate deal to spin off some Placer assets, mainly in northern Ontario, to Goldcorp, a smaller Toronto-based gold producer, for about $1.35bn in cash. The Placer and Goldcorp properties in Ontario are often mentioned as obvious candidates for consolidation.Placer shareholders can choose to receive $20.50 in cash or 0.7518 of a Barrick common share plus 5 cents in cash for each Placer share. Barrick has limited the cash portion of its bid to $1.22bn. The bid requires approval by holders of two-thirds of Placer’s shares.Barrick shares were down 5.7 per cent to $25.65 in afternoon trading in New York on Monday. Placer shares jumped 19.9 per cent to $19.79.
254;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2005-10-31T20:45:49Z;Barrick makes a bid for supremacy;;"One analyst on Monday described Barrick’s hostile $9.2bn bid for compatriot rival Placer Dome as “a bid for supremacy in the gold industry”.If successful, Barrick would leap frog its main rival, Newmont of the US, and would become the world’s largest producer of gold.Greg Wilkins, Barrick’s chief executive, on Monday appealed to Placer Dome shareholders’ patriotic instincts. “This deal will take Barrick to the next level and will form a leading Canadian gold company, best able to compete on the world stage.”Placer Dome’s acquisition could revive the process of consolidation in the gold sector, following several false starts in the last 18 months.Last May, Iamgold of Canada failed to merge with Wheaton River, also of
Canada, after the hostile intervention of Golden Star of the US.Iamgold went on to agree a deal with Gold Fields of South Africa. But this was foiled by a hostile bid for Gold Fields from Harmony Gold of South Africa.
Harmony’s audacious attempt to buy its larger compatriot failed earlier this year after a bruising and lengthy battle.The combination of the two South African companies would have created
the world’s largest gold group.Barrick and Newmont have long vied for the top position in the gold industry, and analysts said Barrick’s surprise bid for Placer Dome could spur Newmont to launch a rival offer.The larger gold companies are finding its increasingly difficult to expand their gold reserves, and to replace the gold being dug from the ground each year. A lack of spending on gold exploration between 1997 and 2002, because of the low gold price, meant that few new discoveries were made.Although Barrick has a strong project pipeline covering the next few years, one reason for its interest in Placer Dome is to get access to deposits and exploration projects that can be turned into mines in the longer term, from 2009 onwards. “One of the most exciting aspects of this deal is the pipeline of projects,” said Mr Wilkins.The combined exploration talent of the two companies would be “a juggernaut of an exploration team”, according to Alex Davidson, Barrick’s head of exploration.Another possible white knight for Placer Dome is AngloGold Ashanti of South Africa. AngloGold is 51 per cent owned by Anglo American, the diversified mining group, but its parent said last week that it was retreating from the gold business and would reduce its stake in the company.This gives AngloGold more freedom to pursue mergers and acquisitions, as it does not need permission from Anglo American. A deal with Placer Dome would give Anglo American a good opportunity to exit its investment in AngloGold, and there may be some synergies between Placer’s South Deep mine in South Africa and AngloGold’s operations nearby.However, analysts said on Monday that AngloGold might not have a strong enough balance sheet to pursue a deal this year.One of Barrick’s main arguments for a combination with Placer is that both companies operate in similar parts of the world, and
synergies in transport, procurement and management could save $240m a year from 2007.The assets of both companies are concentrated in North America, mainly in Nevada; in Australia, centred around Kalgoorlie; in Tanzania, and in South America, on the Chile-Argentina border.Mr Wilkins said on Monday that Barrick is the lowest cost gold producer among the larger companies, with costs of around $210 per ounce of metal.Placer has been less successful at cutting costs, and the average cost for the combined group would be between $245 and $250 per ounce, but synergies would reduce this over time, he said.As well as having the largest reserves of gold in the world, a combined
Barrick and Placer Dome would also have the largest hedgebook.GFMS, the London-based metals consultancy, said Barrick was already the largest hedger in the gold market, with almost 14m ounces of forward sales.Placer Dome has a hedge book of around 8m ounces. Gold companies are generally reducing their amount of hedging so they can take advantage of the rising gold price.Mr Wilkins said on Monday he would “continue to work to bring the hedge position down and simplify it”."
255;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2005-08-11T19:42:05Z;Peru's mining areas haunted by the spectre of violence;;President Alejandro Toledo and his Peruvian cabinet gathered for a gala lunch last month for a bout of back-slapping. The administration was celebrating an achievement: annual exports had doubled to more than $14bn since it took office in July 2001.The economy has been carefully managed by a team of technocrats, but the export boom may have less to do with policy than with the high price of minerals, driven by China's hunger. As a producer of copper, gold, silver, zinc and molybdenum, Peru has benefited: the mining sector accounts for half of the country's exports.But the figures hide a trend for the industry in Peru: rising violence directed at mining and exploration companies that threatens to alienate the foreign investors whose input is needed to fuel growth.The latest target is Monterrico Metals, a British resource development company that is developing Rio Blanco, 550 miles north-west of Lima in a farming region on the Ecuadorean border. The project is expected to become Peru's second biggest copper mine when it opens in 2008.In recent weeks the site has come under attack from protesters who say mining will contaminate water supplies to local farms. One demonstrator died in clashes with police last week. Farmers kidnapped three of Monterrico's Peruvian employees in the area last weekend, one of whom has still not been released.The conflict at Rio Blanco follows several similar confrontations. In May, BHP Billiton, the world's biggest diversified miner, suspended operations for a month at its Tintaya mine in southern Peru when protestors raided the site, demanding the company spend more on improving local roads.Last September, Newmont, the US miner, scrapped a planned expansion of Yanacocha, the world's most productive gold mine, in the northern highlands, after demonstrators alleging water contamination besieged the site for two weeks, forcing Newmont to helicopter in shift workers.There have been lower-profile stand-offs: the government reported 12 serious conflicts between mining companies and local communities last month alone.The government says activists in the communist Patria Roja party, radical local clerics and leftwing campaigning groups have whipped up sentiment against Rio Blanco.The police say opium producers in the region encourage violence to prevent the state taking a more active role there. The area is thought to be a centre of poppy cultivation. Many in the industry blame the government for failing to provide security at mines or the infrastructure necessary for development. Andrew Bristow, Monterrico's operations manager, says that the authorities have been helpful since the conflict began, but that the government has a “very poor presence” in the region. “It's almost a forgotten corner of Peru,” he says.José de Echave, of CooperAcción, a Peruvian sustainable development organisation supported by Christian Aid, points to communities' lack of confidence both in mining companies and in the government's ability to oversee their activity.“The ministry of mining is responsible for regulating the environmental impact of the industry, but it also has to attract foreign investment,” he says. “We need a more independent body, like the Environmental Protection Agency in the US.”Part of the problem is big mining's record. “There is a history of poorly run operations in Peru,” says Mr Bristow. Monterrico may be suffering from being near Tambogrande, a project aborted by Manhattan Minerals, a Canadian company that suffered from poor community relations.Peru is witnessing rising social unrest in the run-up to elections next year, much of it directed against local governments or, where government is absent, against companies.In highland areas, where poverty and illiteracy are high, imagined grievances can take root. Some local farmers say Rio Blanco has polluted their water. That is almost certainly untrue, as the project is at the feasibility stage.Some in the industry want it to be more active in countering misinformation.“Most Peruvians don't appreciate what a large role mining plays in the economy,” says Mr Bristow. “We need to do a lot more to defend ourselves.”
256;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2005-06-03T18:00:33Z;Mining groups struggle to operate in Peru;;Julia Guarniz, a street vendor in the Peruvian highland village of Choropampa, watches blankly as a seven-vehicle convoy thunders past. “They scare me,” she says, pointing at the “hazardous materials” signs on the sides of the juggernauts. “When I see them, I worry that it might happen again.”Similar convoys carry toxic material through the town several times a day on the degraded highway that runs some 600km from Yanacocha, the world's most productive gold mine, to the port of Callao in Lima.Five years ago this week, one truck spilled 330lb of liquid mercury over more than 20km of the road. Attracted to what looked “like a liquid mirror”, the residents of Choropampa collected the mercury and took it home, unknowingly exposing themselves to the highly toxic substance.What has happened since depends on who is telling the story. Newmont, the world's biggest gold miner and Yanacocha's owner, says it has faced up to its responsibility, pumped millions of dollars into clean-up and compensation, and put in place fail-safe safety standards.The villagers do not deny the pay-outs, but say they are still suffering from Newmont's negligence. Thousands complain of neurological and skin conditions, and they say the medical insurance they have been given does not cover the cost of their prescriptions. That insurance runs out this year.Hatred for the mine runs deep. It is difficult to find a resident who will acknowledge having received compensation.The facts may be settled in Denver, Colorado, Newmont's hometown, where 1,100 Choropampa villagers are pursuing the miner through the courts.Ken Crowder, a lawyer representing the victims, says the first cases may be heard this year, potentially providing the basis for a group settlement.What is indisputable is that for many, Choropampa remains a symbol of a perceived environmental and social myopia among international mining companies operating in Peru and their failure to secure a “social licence” from local communities.This was powerfully illustrated last September, when a proposed expansion of Yanacocha met such fierce opposition that the project was abandoned. Local residents claimed that mining Cerro Quilish, a mountain overlooking the town of Cajamarca, would have contaminated their drinking water. Newmont disputes this.But that misses the totemic importance of the battle, fuelled by a feeling among some locals that the company has not given enough to the community.“Quilish became an icon,” says Emilio Horna, mayor of Cajamarca. “Newmont didn't explain enough what they wanted to do.” Guy Landsdown, Yanacocha's operations manager, says the miner “has got a lot of work to do on the social front”. Newmont has joined several local “dialogue roundtables”. In Minas Conga, a new project, it has managed to develop good community relations.Even Yanacocha's opponents concede it has improved environmental standards. Last year it spent $50m (€40.9m, £27.5m) on a reverse osmosis plant to clean discharged water, $20m on dams to prevent sediment seeping into rivers, and $6.5m on other environmental programmes.The company has also created about 4,500 jobs in Cajamarca, one of Peru's poorest regions. It estimates that another 24,000 local jobs depend on the mine. The investment is welcomed by many: Ama Cajamarca, a group funded by the local chamber of commerce, attracted 10,000 locals to a recent demonstration in support of Yanacocha.But it has also spawned deep resentment. This is due in part to the phenomenal growth of Yanacocha, from producing 81,000oz of gold in 1993 to 3,017,000oz last year. The town of Cajamarca has swelled from a population of 40,000 in 1990 to 240,000. House prices are soaring, traffic is heavy and there are problems with delinquency and prostitution.Yanacocha's story is far from unique. In February, Manhattan Minerals of Canada ditched plans for a $400m polymetallic mine at Tambogrande in the north, saying it could not find a senior partner because of protests against the project. Industry insiders say Tambogrande was poorly handled by an inexperienced company, but the most recent confrontation came at a project widely seen as a paradigm of best practice: BHP Billiton's Tintaya copper mine.The Anglo-Australian group won praise in December 2003 from both industry and such activist groups as Oxfam by signing an agreement with 37 local organisations, committing itself to give 3 per cent of its annual operating profits to the local community.But last week BHP was forced to suspend operations at Tintaya, Peru's third biggest copper mine, after protesters raided the site, demanding the company spend more on improving local roads. A government-led negotiating team is now trying to mediate.In Cajamarca, all sides agree that the tension can be resolved. Marco Arana, a Catholic priest and one of the leaders of the protests against Cerro Quilish, says the mercury spill need not leave an indelible mark on Yanacocha's record.“We could turn Choropampa into a model of environmental care, with a proper clean-up and good healthcare,” he says. “But if Newmont doesn't change, I fear there may be violence here.”
257;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2005-02-22T18:39:32Z;Mines dig deep for decent legacy;;"The controversy that for many years surrounded an Indonesian gold and copper mine operated by Freeport-McMoRan highlights many of the thorny issues faced by the mining industry. With millions of tons of debris generated by the Papua mine, Freeport has frequently been criticised by environmental campaigners.But another aspect of the mine - the fate of local communities after its eventual closure - is also proving hard for many mining companies to resolve. Not far from Freeport's Papua pits, for example, the once tiny village of Timika is now a small city.""The problem is that companies don't get to choose where projects are, and they tend to be in the most depressed parts of the poorest countries,"" says Tim Mclaughlin, a consultant who has worked with both Freeport and Denver-based Newmont Mining. ""And when you become the economic and social engine in an area, you attract people.""The question for companies is how to ensure people attracted to the area continue to have livelihoods after mining operations have ceased. Shaun Stewart, international and government affairs adviser at Rio Tinto, the mining group, says: ""We see it as a responsibility of ours that, when the mine closes down, we don't just leave a big hole in the ground - we leave a community that can sustain itself.""One way in which the economic benefits of the mining business could be spread is through infrastructure development. The idea, says Mark Moody Stuart, chairman of Anglo American, is that when a mining company is developing the roads or ports associated with its business, its contractors could also develop infrastructure with wider use.Another answer is to foster businesses that can continue after mining operations have disappeared. This means sourcing locally wherever possible.Sir Mark cites the example of Anglo's operations in South Africa. ""We have in the mines a company that started off by maintaining in-mine rail equipment,"" he says. ""And they grow and go out and get non-mining business, so you're building capacity that originates in mining, but then is applicable to other areas of the economy.""To encourage these businesses, the Anglo Zimele initiative - established by Anglo American in South Africa - provides loans to small businesses.Such approaches are not limited to the developing world. At Rio Tinto's Flambeau copper mine in Wisconsin, local businesses hoping to provide goods and services to the company were asked to produce a business plan demonstrating their sustainability beyond the life of the mine.Elsewhere, a research project by the International Council on Mining and Metals, which represents mining companies and associations, is examining how mineral wealth could be harnessed to reduce poverty and spread economic growth in developing countries. Focusing on Ghana and Peru, the project will identify ""success factors"" and highlight lessons for companies, non- governmental organisations, governments and others.Yet some NGOs suggest that companies should not meddle in such areas at all. Others point to the danger that such initiatives create yet another layer of dependence for communities.However, Mr Stewart believes such concerns can be addressed by consulting communities before starting development projects and by forming partnerships with local authorities and NGOs. ""What we're always trying to do is hook the provincial government in,"" he says. Rio Tinto, he adds, might pay for the construction and equipping of a clinic and fund training for nurses, ""but their salaries are paid by the government"".However, some critics still believe corporate initiatives do not go far enough. ""Mining companies have to be more transparent about the long-term impact of their operations,"" says Keith Slack, a senior policy adviser at Oxfam America. ""They also have to build relations with the communities or they're going to have problems down the road - and that will start to impact the bottom line.""For the previous article in this series click here"
258;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2004-11-30T21:33:53Z;Wall Street lower as economy worries persist;;"Wall Street retreated on Tuesday amid signs of declining consumer confidence, worries about the rising price of oil and the sliding dollar's impact on economic growth.As news of slightly higher third-quarter economic growth was shrugged off, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.4 per cent off at 10,428.02 by the close, while the S&P 500 shed 0.4 per cent to 1,173.82 and the Nasdaq Composite gave up 0.5 per cent at 2,096.81.The indices gave ground throughout the day and attempts at gaining it back failed as some traders warned the markets were at a vital juncture that would decide the fate of the current rally. Arthur Cashin, managing director at UBS, said it was ""time to put up or shut up, resume the rally by starting a new up-leg or risk rolling over and giving back all the gains"".The two sides of a ""major battle"" that Mr Cashin predicted consist of bullish traders pinning hopes on historical trends supporting a year-end rally, while on the other side less-sanguine voices noted that history and the calendar had not been reliable recently and that the outlook for markets remained clouded by uncertainties.In a heavy week for economic data the US government reported that third-quarter GDP grew 3.9 per cent, slightly higher than the earlier estimate of 3.7 per cent. The data failed to boost the fortunes of the dollar, which touched a new record low against the euro amid concern about Tuesday's other significant data report, on consumer confidence.The index of consumer confidence fell to 90.5 in November from 92.9 in October, well below expectations. The Conference Board, a business research group that compiles the index, said the data reflected that ""[US] consumers do not feel the economy is likely to gain major momentum in early 2005"". Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said the data were ""not great"" but cautioned against using them to forecast US consumption in the Christmas shopping season, which was vital for retailers. ""As always [it is] better to watch what people do than what they say.""Retailers continued to be in focus as the Christmas shopping season got under way. Hot Topic shares fell 13.1 per cent to $16.37 after the clothing retailer trimmed its fourth-quarter guidance.Wal-Mart shares were down 2.1 per cent to $52.06 after reports that the world's biggest retailer, which cut its November sales forecast, had not implemented as aggressive discounts as its rivals.Away from retail, manufacturing activity in the US midwest appeared to be on the increase after the Chicago purchasing managers' index rose. Meanwhile, Nymex crude futures rose above $50 per barrel amid concern about supplies of petroleum products in the US.In corporate news, the shares of Google were up 0.5 per cent to $181.98 after the internet search company said it would buy back 23.4m shares from its employees.Also among technology stocks, Micromuse shares added 5.2 per cent to $5.25 after the software company reported one of its products had been chosen by Japan's NTT Communications.Loudeye, a digital media company, saw its shares add 16.4 per cent to $1.92 after it announced a deal with a partnership of several technology and cable television companies.Sybase, meanwhile, saw shares ease 1.3 per cent to $17.23 after the company announced a partnership with International Business Machines. IBM shares edged off 1.3 per cent to $94.24.Among commodity-related stocks, Newmont Mining shares lost 3.8 per cent to $47.35 after Indonesian prosecutors announced they would press charges against six executives at the company due to a pollution case.Syneron Medical shares lost 27.3 per cent to $27.05 by the close after the company's cellulite treatment was denied approval for marketing by US regulators.In the medical devices sector, Given Imaging shares rose 2.5 per cent to $33.31 after regulators approved its pill-shaped camera that provides images of the intestine in a less invasive manner than current procedures.Taser International shares charged 7.8 per cent higher to $27.08 following a third stock split this year by the maker of stun guns used by law enforcement agencies. Sales of the guns have risen sharply, even as their safety has come under scrutiny, most recently by Amnesty International."
259;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2004-10-18T19:47:11Z;Gold Fields bid may pave the way for consolidation;;When South African gold producer Harmony announced its surprise plan to take over bigger rival Gold Fields in Johannesburg on Monday, Bernard Swanepoel, Harmony's chief executive, was asked a question about one of Goldfield's mines. Mr Swanepoel shot back: “Look, I'm not buying a room - I'm buying the hotel.”Mr Swanepoel's swagger is par for the course in an industry known for macho deal-makers. Over the nine years that Mr Swanepoel has been chief executive of South Africa's biggest domestic gold producer, the 43-year-old has gained recognition for his company's flair for extracting value from distressed mines.But Harmony's bid for Gold Fields, the world's fourth largest gold producer, surprised the markets with its boldness. Harmony, which built its reputation on turing round marginal South African mines, is smaller than Gold Fields, with few international operations.If accepted by Gold Fields' shareholders, the merger would create the world's largest gold producer by production, and the second-largest by market capitalisation, just behind Newmont of the US. It could also spark a round of mergers and acquisitions in an industry where analysts say there is room for more consolidation. “The other gold miners are not going to be happy to see this happen, as size is everything in this industry,” says John Meyer, mining analyst at Numis Securities in London.At the weekend Harmony firmed up its proposal by enlisting disgruntled Gold Fields shareholder Norilsk Nickel, Russia's largest nickel and palladium producer, controlled by Vladimir Potanin, the Russian oligarch. The offer to swap Harmony's shares for Gold Fields', if accepted by both company's shareholders, would torpedo a plan by Gold Fields' management to merge with mid-sized Canadian producer Iamgold.But Harmony's proposal may have a powerful opponent in Gold Fields' board, led by Ian Cockerill, its chief executive. Mr Cockerill on Monday called Harmony's overture a plan “that purports to be a merger when in fact it's a hostile takeover”. If Gold Fields' board, which was set to decide on the merger late on Monday, follows Mr Cockerill's lead in opposing the deal, Harmony's offer to shareholders can officially be termed hostile.Mr Swanepoel's aggressive move on another company's shareholders is reminiscent of tactics pioneered by the “Randlords” - the free-wheeling capitalists who built South Africa's mining industry a century ago, among them Cecil Rhodes, Gold Fields' founder. It may mark the beginning of a rare hostile takeover attempt of a leading company in the gold market. When talking to analysts, shareholders and journalists on Monday, Mr Swanepoel derided Gold Fields' proposed merger with Iamgold as “value leakage”. His offer, he said, was “good for Gold Fields and better than the current amount on the table for the Iamgold transaction”.The adage that “bigger is better” can arguably be applied to gold. The gold market is still fragmented, especially when compared with the iron ore industry where three companies control 80 per cent of seaborne trade. There has been some consolidation in the gold industry in recent years - such as AngloGold's purchase of Ashanti earlier this year and Newmont's acquisition of Australia's Normandy in early 2002 - but analysts expect to see many more mergers and acquisitions.New gold companies are forming all the time, attracted by rising precious-metals prices. But many of these junior names are speculators and are years away from dig a mine. Aim, London's stock market for small companies, has been a particular beneficiary of this modern-day gold rush, and has seen a stream of new listings and companies tapping the markets for funds. Investment bankers have been pitching M&A ideas to mining executives since early last year, when it became clear that commodities prices, after several years in the doldrums, were on the rise again. Harmony's attempt to secure Gold Fields may mean that the bankers' suggestions are being taken seriously by executives who are concerned about being left behind in the latest round of M&A activity. Canada's Placer Dome and Australia's Newcrest are among the gold producing companies on many bankers' lips as possible M&A targets.A successful Harmony/Gold Fields merger could widen the gap in the gold sector between the large and smaller companies with Harmony/Goldfields, Newmont and AngloGold Ashanti as industry leaders while former big hitters such as Barrick of Canada would be relegated to the middle, along with Placer Dome of Canada and Newcrest of Australia.Among the companies often cited as a potential takeover target is Newcrest, which market rumours have linked to Harmony and AngloGold Ashanti. Buyers had been put off the Australian group by its messy hedging strategy, but the imminent opening of its Telfer gold and copper mine in Western Australia is expected to attract renewed interest from potential suitors. The company's shares rose on Monday, on news of the possible Harmony/Gold Fields tie-up.Harmony had had its eye on Gold Fields for some time. But rumours last week - which later proved false - that Norilsk was planning its own bid for Gold Fields, pushed Mr Swanepoel to act. Harmony is offering Gold Fields' shareholders its shares at a 1:1.275 ratio. The proposed deal values Gold Fields at $8.1bn and would give shareholders a 29 per cent premium over Gold Fields' weighted average share price over the past month.The transaction has the blessing of Norilsk Nickel, which bought 20 per cent of Gold Fields in March and on Saturday formally committed itself to Harmony's offer. A condition of the bid going ahead is for Gold Fields to scrap a $2.1bn merger plan with mid-sized Canadian producer Iamgold.Norilsk on Monday confirmed publicly for the first time that it was backing Harmony in its bid. “Having studied the deal between Gold Fields and Iamgold, announced in August, and the proposal from Harmony, the management of Norilsk Nickel decided that it would vote against the deal with Iamgold and in favour of Harmony's proposals,” Mikhail Prokhorov, the company's chief executive said.Over the past two years Norilsk has been accumulating Russian gold assets, becoming the country's biggest gold producer, producing some 1m troy ounces a year. With gold assets worth $2.4bn, its Russian subsidiary Polyus alone last year made a net profit of $120m. But despite its expansion, Norilsk is still known for nickel and palladium. Its interest in Gold Fields is partly because the Russian company's market valuations remain much lower than those of gold producers.Norilsk picked up its 20 per cent stake in Gold Fields for R7.63bn ($1.2bn) in March in a surprise purchase from Anglo American. But its relationship with Gold Fields' management cooled after the South African company announced a proposal to merge with Iamgold. The proposal would see Gold Fields' international assets spun off into a separate listed company 30 per cent owned by Iamgold, effectively diluting Norilsk's exposure to the assets and leaving it with a stake in a smaller South African parent company. Norilsk had not been consulted about that possible deal.The proposed merger with Iamgold also angered some of Gold Fields' South African shareholders. Local investors, including groups representing black investors as part of South Africa's black empowerment drive and who increasingly own stakes in the mining industry, felt that the deal would amount to moving assets offshore, and that Gold Fields was offering too much for Iamgold. Harmony may be better able to appeal to the South African government, which is sensitive about capital flight, by saying the deal will keep assets within the country.Analysts say that Harmony's bid is also positive for Norilsk because it would re-open the opportunity for the Russian company to swap its gold assets for liquid shares in an international company. “As far as the market is concerned, the rationale for buying a 20 per cent stake in Gold Fields in the first place was to allow Interros - the holding company that controls Norilsk - to gain liquid shares in a foreign company by rolling Norilsk's gold assets into it,” says Al Breach, chief strategist at Moscow's Brunswick UBS. This would have been hard to achieve under the proposed merger with Iamgold.Harmony's move would also give Mr Potanin exposure to a bigger foreign company amid growing state intervention in Russia's economy. As Andrei Illarionov, Russian president Vladimir Putin's economic adviser, recently told the FT: “Over the past several years, a near-consensus has emerged that natural resources should belong to the state - not to private citizens and private companies, but the state.”Mr Potanin cannot sell his metals and mining assets to a foreign company. Swapping them for a larger stake in Gold Fields, however, may be more palatable to the Kremlin. “Anglo American and Rio Tinto have been acquiring assets all over the world,” says Alexander Pukhaev, metals and mining analyst at Moscow-based United Financial Group. “Just because companies like Norilsk Nickel are in Russia does not mean that they are not going to be doing the same.”With Norilsk on board, Harmony must now sell its vision to the company's other shareholders, most of whom are in Britain and the US. Company executives, including Mr Swanepoel, are due to take the proposal directly to them in what the chief executive calls “an intense marketing campaign”. Harmony has a proven record of turning around mature mining assets. Mr Swanepoel has led the company on an expansion drive, buying marginal mines from bigger rivals such as AngloGold and Gold Fields.However, this approach, which Mr Swanepoel calls “the Harmony Way”, has come under pressure over the past year. With about 90 per cent of its assets in South Africa, the company has suffered more than most South African mining companies due to the strong rand. Harmony's less profitable mines have suffered the most, and over the past several months the company has reported weak earnings and had to cut thousands of jobs.Gold Fields, by contrast, has a third of its production outside South Africa but derives two-thirds of its operating profit from foreign operations, mostly in Australia and Ghana, and has exploration and development projects around the world. The profile makes Gold Fields an alluring target.Industry insiders were uncertain on Monday whether Harmony would succeed in winning control of Gold Fields. “At first we thought it was laughable, with similarities to Randgold's bid for Ashanti last year,” said one London-based mining analyst. “But the more we look at it the more we think it has legs and is credible,” he added. Working against Harmony's bid, analysts said, are the fact that its mines are lower quality than Gold Fields'.Gold Fields' shareholders have 30 days to respond to Harmony's offer. Mr Swanepoel is hoping to shore up support from the majority of shareholders before a December shareholders' meeting at which Mr Cockerill had planned to win endorsement for the Iamgold deal. Harmony will ask its own shareholders to approve its rival merger proposal at an extraordinary general meeting on November 12.Harmony calculates that it needs a 15 per cent cost reduction on Gold Fields' South African assets to justify the premium it is offering shareholders. “Gold Fields is ripe for some cost-cutting and Harmony is well-known for its cost-cutting abilities,” says Mr Meyer of Numis Securities in London. As Mr Swanepoel's takes his offer on the road, Mr Cockerill and Gold Fields' other managers may have to watch their backs. Harmony's chief executive has mentioned “management overheads” as a potential source of cost cutting.Golden days are here again, for nowUnderlying current investment activity in the gold industry is the solid rise in gold prices over the past three years, and the belief among executives and shareholders that the good times will continue.Back in 2001, the low gold price kept many gold projects languishing. Geologists knew where the gold was, but miners knew it was not worth digging it up. Spending by the large miners on exploration and development of new projects had been slashed, and mining entrepreneurs - the industry’s backbone - could not get financial backing for their ventures. Investors were still concentrating on “new economy” growth stocks, despite the dotcom bust, and the commodity markets were considered passé.On top of investor indifference, central bank sales of gold reserves had also undermined the gold price. Uncertainty over central bank strategy and widespread forward selling by gold producers discouraged fund managers from looking at gold, which reached its lowest point in April 2001.While productivity of gold mines and demand for jewellery are the main factors governing the physical supply of and demand for gold, they have relatively little influence on its price, say analysts. “Supply and demand move too slowly. It is changes at the margins, such as investment and central bank sales, that really move the market,” says Neil Meader, senior analyst at precious metals consultancy GFMS.Since 2001, these factors have swung back into gold’s favour. Central banks have finished selling gold and gold producers are no longer selling forward or hedging. The weakening of the dollar also helped the gold price as the metal has traditionally traded in the opposite direction to the US currency. Cyclical investments have come back into fashion over the last three years and commodities have been among the best performers, buoyed by demand for precious and base metals from growing economies such as China and India.Hedge funds and other speculators were quick to spot the recovery in the commodities market, particularly in gold. These funds were blamed when the gold price fell dramatically earlier this year, from a peak of around $428 an ounce in April to around $375 an ounce in May. It was widely assumed that speculators were taking some of their profits following a good run in the gold price. Volatility in energy prices had also distracted speculators, who saw a better opportunity for making a quick buck. Analysts expect the gold price to suffer whenever there are large movements in the oil price.The gold price is now trading close to $420 an ounce, having regained much of the ground lost in May. But crucially, the mood in the gold industry remains more positive than it has been for years. Predictions that the gold price will stay above $400 for some time are encouraging companies such as Norilsk, already doing well in nickel and platinum, to expand into gold. New junior mining companies, many of them years away from actually producing gold, have raised money on London’s alternative stock market, Aim, as well as in Australia and Canada.This year the fixtures on the mining industry’s conference circuit reflected this optimism. At a major annual gold industry gathering in Toronto in March, exhibitors had to set up in the corridors of an over-crowded conference centre. At the MinExpo mining equipment jamboree in Las Vegas last month, suppliers of drills and diggers, such as Caterpillar, were rubbing their hands at the thought of rising orders from prospectors. All involved know that the market is cyclical and that lean times are never that far away, but for now they are happy to join the gold rush.
260;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;Study to clear Newmont of pollution charges;;Levels of mercury and arsenic in an Indonesian bay into which Newmont, the world?s largest gold producer, dumped waste until the end of August fall within internationally acceptable levels, according to a new government study due to be released on Tuesday.However, Indonesian police said Monday they planned to continue pursuing environmental charges against six Newmont managers, five of whom have been detained for almost a month in connection with the case.The finding marks a significant step in the controversy surrounding Newmont?s Minahasa Raya mine in North Sulawesi, which has been at the centre of pollution allegations for years.Newmont said Monday night that the report ?represents complete vindication? for its practices in Buyat Bay, where residents claim waste from the mine caused health problems and the depletion of local fisheries.?We strongly believe the information contained in this report - verified by six government and private accredited laboratories - should put to rest the controversy regarding Buyat Bay,? said Tom Enos, Newmont?s vice president of international operations.But Indonesian police said they are standing by laboratory tests showing elevated levels of both arsenic and mercury in the bay, despite widespread criticism that the test was flawed.The case against Newmont has become the latest example of Indonesia?s often fraught climate for foreign investors.It has also become a key test for the mining industry and the way it disposes of its treated waste mining material.According to the new report by a joint government team working under Indonesia?s environment ministry the levels of arsenic and mercury in both Buyat Bay?s water and its fish fell within internationally acceptable levels - despite 2,000 tonnes a day of treated waste being poured into the bay for the past eight years.The study did find elevated concentrations of arsenic in the sediment at the end of a pipe via which Newmont dumped its tailings. However, the report said, ?it appears that the arsenic in the sediment is in a stable form?.Other problems were also found in the area that did not appear to be the result of Newmont?s operations, including a ?high? concentration of mercury in the sediment of Ratatotok Bay, the bay next to Buyat Bay.The ?most likely source? for that mercury pollution, the report?s authors said, was ?small scale? or illegal gold mining operations in the area.Additional reporting by Taufan Hidayat
261;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2004-10-06T12:28:20Z;Indonesia to pass Newmont case to prosecutors;;Indonesian police are expected to pass a controversial pollution case against executives of US-based Newmont, the world?s largest gold producer, to prosecutors on Thursday, setting the stage for a possible criminal trial.The six Newmont managers - including two Americans and an Australian - were detained earlier this month as suspects.Police plan to hand the case to prosecutors in North Sulawesi, the location of Newmont?s Minahasa Raya mine, a move that in the Indonesian justice system equates to laying charges against a suspect.Lawsuits against foreign companies are common in Indonesia but it is rare for overseas executives to be detained for extended periods or charged.The case against Newmont - which hinges on claims that tailings from the Minahasa Raya mine caused chronic illness among villagers living in the area, has become a litmus test for Indonesia?s troubled investment climate.Key evidence in the case is in dispute - independent experts from groups including the World Health Organisation argue there is little evidence of pollution in the bay into which Newmont dumped tailings until August.But police claim their tests show that the bay?s waters contain unhealthy levels of mercury and arsenic.?Those six suspects have committed a corporate crime,? Brigadier General Suharto, the investigator in charge of the case said.The company?s local chief executive and the five other managers face up to 10 years in prison if convicted, he said.Newmont has claimed throughout that it has done nothing wrong.The miner argues it never used mercury in its extraction process at Minahasa Raya. Any elevated levels of naturally-occurring arsenic and mercury in the tailings were reduced to acceptable levels by special ?scrubbers? before the slurry was released into the bay almost a kilometre from shore, company officials claim.In an August 26 report prepared for the World Health Organisation, Japanese mercury poisoning experts said levels of the metal in the bay were within acceptable international guidelines.Tests also indicated the villagers had normal levels of mercury in their blood for populations that eat a lot of fish.In fact, the bigger environmental issue in the area of the mine, the WHO experts concluded, was in the bay next door where they conducted tests as a control. There, mercury levels were ?much higher? thanks to hundreds of small-scale illegal gold miners who for decades have used mercury to extract gold and dumped their waste into a river that flows into the bay, they said.Additional reporting by Taufan Hidayat
262;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-17T03:30:43Z;NMC scandal proves a boon for global advisers;The UAE-based healthcare group’s troubles have amplified concerns about local regulators;It took four decades for NMC Health to ascend from its humble origins as a small clinic founded by Indian entrepreneur BR Shetty to its pinnacle as a FTSE 100 favourite.It took less than four months for the success story of the largest private healthcare provider in the United Arab Emirates to sour after short-sellers questioned NMC’s debt and cash position last December. Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
263;NEM;Newmont Mining Corp;2020-04-24T23:51:20+0000;US protests Jakarta?s action on Newmont;;The US government on Friday protested the detention in Jakarta of six executives from Newmont Mining on environmental charges, saying the move could ?only harm? an already fragile investment climate for foreign investors in Indonesia.A dispute between Newmont of the US and environmental groups over the state of the water in a bay near its Minahasa Raya mine in northern Sulawesi and what is responsible for health problems amongst local villagers has escalated in recent days.Police late on Thursday released Richard Ness, the gold miner?s local chief executive, after detaining him for three hours. But they brought Mr Ness, an American, in for further questioning on Friday.Five other Newmont managers - three Indonesians, an Australian, and a US citizen remained in police detention Friday night, charged with environmental crimes.Indonesian police claim their tests and other evidence given to them by experts show the waters in the bay near the mine have elevated levels of arsenic and mercury and that Newmont is responsible.The executives each face up to five years in prison if they are convicted of the charges being levelled against them.But Newmont says its tests of samples taken at the same time as by the police show nothing of the sort.Other independent tests also indicate no pollution has taken place in the bay, the company claims.The US embassy in Jakarta said Friday night the detention of the Newmont staff was ?inappropriate? as Newmont had ?fully cooperated? with Indonesian authorities and ?guaranteed their continued cooperation?.?The detention of Newmont employees under these circumstances can only harm the investment climate in Indonesia,? the embassy said.Indonesia has suffered a dearth of foreign direct investment in sectors such as mining in recent years causing the economy to lag its Asian neighbours.
