0;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2019-12-04T14:20:25Z;US private sector employment at six-month low in November;Weaker than forecast reading arrives days ahead of official jobs report;"US private sector employment slowed sharply in November marking the weakest growth in six months and signalling weakness in the labour market ahead of Friday’s official non-farm payrolls report.Non-farm private employers added just 67,000 jobs last month, according to payroll processor ADP on Wednesday, undershooting economists’ expectations for a gain of 140,000, according to a Reuters poll.That marked the lowest monthly gain since May and followed a downward revision to the previous month’s reading that showed 121,000 jobs created in October — 4,000 fewer than before.The report showed manufacturers shed jobs for the fourth time over the past five months, while the vast services sector added 85,000 jobs, though that was the fewest since May.Midsized companies created the most jobs at 29,000 the report showed. Meanwhile larger companies that employ 500 or more workers and small companies with under 50 employees created 27,000 jobs and 11,000 jobs respectively.“One bad month is not a trend, but the forward-looking surveys signal no relief over the next couple of months, at least,” said Ian Shepherdson, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “This is not about supply-side constraints, with firms unable to find all the people they want; labour demand clearly has weakened as the trade war has damped activity, both directly via the cost of the tariffs and indirectly by creating great uncertainty for businesses.”The data comes ahead of Friday’s non-farm payroll figures that are expected to show hiring picked up in November, though economists note this could reflect the return to work of about 46,000 workers at General Motors following their strike. Mr Shepherdson notes this would not be reflected in the ADP report as the automaker doesn’t use ADP’s services."

Dan Loeb’s Third Point hedge fund had also objected to the deal.In an email at the time to Gregory Hayes, UTC’s chief executive, Mr Ackman said he could not “comprehend the strategic logic” behind the deal. The hedge fund had built a 0.7 per cent stake in the company in early 2018.While the shares have been mostly flat since then, Mr Ackman did not like the deal and felt that his urgings were unlikely to change the outcome, a person familiar said.His fortunes were better at ADP, where the fund’s investment generated a return of 51 per cent over the past two years, for a $1.2bn profit.Mr Ackman launched an unsuccessful proxy fight for board seats at the human resources outsourcer in late 2017, then continued to lobby the company privately.In a letter to investors today, Mr Ackman said that although he expects the company to continue to do well, “we view the prospective returns from today as substantially more modest because the market is now more accurately pricing in ADP’s prospects for success”.Pershing Square Holdings, the firm’s publicly traded hedge fund vehicle, has had its best start to the year ever, returning 49.4 per cent through the end of July.The firm has built a stake in another company that has yet to be disclosed.

That put the stock on track for a record closing high and a market capitalisation of about $39bn.It was seen as a less favourable development for rival payments services providers, with PayChex down 1.3 per cent and Automatic Data Processing down 0.2 per cent.
3;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2017-11-10T22:02:26Z;Week in Review, November 11;"Snap problems; Dick Fuld, Burberry, Bill Ackman and M&S also in the news";"A round up of some of the week’s most significant corporate events and news stories.Snap sees earnings vanish despite Tencent cash boostThe company behind vanishing messaging app Snapchat ended a rollercoaster week trading close to its lowest level since its initial public offering in March, writes Tim Bradshaw in Los Angeles.The sell-off continued after Tuesday’s disappointing earnings report despite new investment from Tencent, one of the world’s largest internet companies and creator of China’s WeChat app.For Los Angeles-based Snap, it was a third successive set of quarterly results to miss Wall Street’s forecasts.Net losses more than tripled to $443m as it said Snapchat gained an average of just 4.5m new daily active users in the three months to September, taking its total to 178m. Revenues of $208m, while growing at a rapid rate of 126 per cent year on year, missed analysts’ estimates.Executives blamed a shift in Snap’s advertising sales model for the shortfall, but co-founder and chief executive Evan Spiegel admitted that Snapchat was too difficult for many people to use. A redesign is under way, even though the company retains a loyal following among the under-30s, who on average open the picture-messaging app 25 times every day.Snap has continued to push new features, from augmented-reality art installations from artist Jeff Koons to a map showing photos and videos posted from around the world, to try to deal with copycatting from Facebook and its Instagram app.The Snap Map has proven its value as extreme weather swept the US recently, with more than 3,500 hours of storm-related posts providing what Mr Spiegel called an “intimate and near real-time perspective”.“We heard that many users that had evacuated the area were able to keep an eye on their neighbourhoods using Snap Maps,” he said.Despite these innovations, Mr Spiegel admitted Snapchat was attracting new users at a “lower rate than we would have liked” and is approaching saturation point of the 13 to 34-year-old demographic in the US, UK, France and Australia.Tencent, which first invested in Snap in 2013, now owns just over 12 per cent of its basic stock.Former Lehman chief’s comeback raises eyebrows“Reminder: Dick Fuld was a terrible CEO,” wrote Barry Ritholtz, co-founder and chief investment officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management, after news this week that the former Lehman Brothers chief was back trying to build a business on Wall Street, writes Ben McLannahan in New York.Almost a decade after the most intense phase of the financial crisis, there is not much obvious goodwill toward Mr Fuld, who spent 42 years at Lehman before leading it into the biggest corporate collapse in history.In an opinion article, Mr Ritholtz spelt out some of the duff decisions the former chairman and chief executive took, such as spurning a bailout offer from Warren Buffett and allowing the infamous “Repo 105,” an accounting gimmick that masked the true extent of Lehman’s indebtedness.“Were there others who made such awful business decisions in the run-up to the financial crisis? No doubt,” wrote Mr Ritholtz. “But few were as prominent as Fuld or as lacking in contrition.”Shrugging off that reputation will be the big challenge for Mr Fuld, 71, as he looks to build Matrix Private Capital Group.For now, the dimensions are modest; he is surrounded by a few former associates from Neuberger Berman, an asset manager formerly in the Lehman stable, and manages about $100m in liquid assets.“We’ve assembled a team whose members share longstanding professional and personal ties that embody the tight-knit, team-oriented culture we are proud to bring to our clients,” Mr Fuld said in a statement.Burberry to invest £50m a year and be ‘firmly in luxury’Burberry, the British maker of £1,400 trenchcoats and £500 bandannas, said it would plough an extra £50m a year into glitzier stores and better technology to establish itself “firmly in luxury”— a plan that sent its shares down 10 per cent on Thursday, writes Mark Vandevelde in London.Marco Gobbetti, who took over as chief executive in July, replacing Christopher Bailey, promised to accelerate and deepen a cost-cutting plan that is in its second year, and is now aiming to save £120m annually by 2020.But he will spend that much, and more, on an investment programme that will refurbish most of the label’s stores within five years. Capital expenditure could be £160m in 2019, increasing to £210m a year over the “medium term” — much higher than investors had previously pencilled in.Mr Bailey, once combined chief executive and creative head, will leave Burberry altogether next year.Mr Gobbetti said. “We are a go-to brand for outerwear, for some shirting. But we are not a go-to brand to say, ‘I’m dressed in Burberry’. That is very important: the brand becomes you and you become the brand.”Analysts said it was not unusual for incoming chief executives to seek to lower investors’ financial expectations, and that Burberry was delivering solid results.Pre-tax profits hit £127m in the first half, a 24 per cent increase on last year, propelled by same-store growth of 4 per cent.Rogerio Fujimori of RBC Capital Markets said of the lowering of expectations: “In terms of magnitude and duration, it was a surprise.”Struggling Ackman loses ADP boardroom battleAnother week, another setback in an activist campaign for Bill Ackman. The founder of Pershing Square lost his bid on Tuesday for three board seats, including one for himself, at the US human resources and payroll outsourcing provider ADP, writes Lindsay Fortado in New York.Mr Ackman’s fund, which is mostly flat this year after two down years, has suffered a series of setbacks, from his disastrous investment in Valeant Pharmaceuticals to his money-losing short position in Herbalife. One of his current holdings, Chipotle, has seen its share price fall around 28 per cent this year.ADP’s chief executive Carlos Rodriguez called the outcome of the shareholder vote an “ass-whooping” for Mr Ackman. ADP said the trio received support from less than 20 per cent of the outstanding shares and under a quarter of the shares that were voted at the meeting.Mr Ackman argued after the vote that despite not making it on to the board, it had still been a victory because it delivered “a wake-up call” to management, who made a series of commitments to shareholders to help win the fight. He also said he received 31 per cent of the votes cast for him and the ADP-nominated director, Eric Fast, who received the fewest votes.The campaign was acrimonious even for a proxy fight. Mr Rodriguez dubbed the activist a “spoiled brat” for allegedly asking ADP’s board to delay the nominating deadline because he was going on holiday and needed more time to prepare. Both sides complained to the US Securities and Exchange Commission about data disclosed during the battle.M&S on turnround mission as food sales growth stuttersThe new chairman of Marks and Spencer has delivered a stark assessment of the challenges facing the company, after it announced the departure of its chief financial officer and surprised investors with a slowdown in its crucial food business, writes Mark Vandevelde in London.“I wouldn’t say there is harmony,” said turnround veteran Archie Norman of relations among the retailer’s top team, while insisting that M&S had “a good board” of people who “share a sense that we’re all on the mission”.Mr Norman, who made his name rescuing supermarket group Asda from bankruptcy and entered parliament as a Conservative MP in 1997, on Wednesday said he had spent his first two months as chairman of the UK’s biggest clothing chain “opening the cupboards and pulling the skeletons out”.Steve Rowe, chief executive, said the retailer’s food business, which had for years been a bulwark for a business battered by cut-price competition in clothing, was making only “mixed” progress and conceded that “execution needs to improve”.British grocers are wary of increasing prices, despite higher input costs, for fear of driving customers towards cut-price competitors such as Aldi and Lidl.J Sainsbury also reported flagging sales growth this week. The supermarket chain announced 2,000 job cuts last month, and said cost savings were running ahead of target, although that has not led to an upgrade in profit expectations.“August was a bit of a wipeout as far as trading was concerned,” said Mike Coupe, chief executive. He attributed the setback to wet weather."
4;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2017-10-22T11:53:52Z;ADP’s Rodriguez squares up to activist investor Bill Ackman;Proxy battle with Pershing Square to secure board seats reveals culture differences;As ADP chief executive Carlos Rodriguez recalls it, activist investor Bill Ackman told him he should step down the first time he spoke to him. The second time, he warned him there would be a public fight. “He said: I know you don’t like the media, but I do and I’m really good at it,” Mr Rodriguez said. “And if this gets into a public battle, it’s going to be bad for you personally, it’s going to be bad for the company, but I’m fine with it because — and he said this — I’m told that I’m only second to Donald Trump in terms of number of clicks on the internet, and hence you will lose if there’s a public relations battle.” Mr Rodriguez, who had never dealt with an activist campaign before Mr Ackman launched a proxy fight to win three seats on the board of the US HR and payroll processing company he runs, recounted in an interview the conversations that began in August this year, calling them “surreal”.The proxy battle between Mr Ackman’s Pershing Square hedge fund and ADP has been one of the bigger shareholder activist disputes of the year. The largest, where Nelson Peltz sought a board seat at Procter & Gamble, went down to the wire in a vote earlier this month. In the end, Mr Peltz lost by a tiny margin.While industry insiders say they expect ADP to win this fight, some analysts say that shareholders are receptive to Pershing Square’s ideas. Mr Ackman’s bid for the board seats will go to a vote at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on November 7.Mr Rodriguez, a 53-year-old Cuban immigrant, has been chief executive of the largest HR and payroll provider in the US since 2011, while billionaire Mr Ackman is one of the best-known activists after years of high-profile investments including Valeant Pharmaceuticals, JC Penney and Chipotle.Mr Ackman disputes Mr Rodriguez’s recollection of their conversations, and has publicly said he is willing to work with the ADP chief executive.“It’s disappointing that ADP continues to attack the messenger instead of addressing the important questions we have raised about ADP’s operational underperformance and its deteriorating competitive position,” Mr Ackman said. Pershing Square has invested about 25 per cent of its funds in ADP, making the company its largest investment. The fund says that ADP can boost its profit margins by improving software and services, reducing operating costs and becoming more efficient.ADP has outperformed the US stock market over the past five years, generating total returns of 152.4 per cent, compared with 98.7 per cent for the S&P 500, according to FactSet data. However, this year, returns of 13.4 per cent have fallen short of the 16.3 per cent posted by the US equities barometer.The ADP chief executive said he has “no disagreement with the themes” that Mr Ackman has raised, but that the company is already making large investments in technology and is focusing on data analytics and opportunities from changes to the way people are employed and paid. “We have become a much broader human resources provider besides just the original payroll things that we have done traditionally,” Mr Rodriguez said. A Sanford Bernstein report published this month that surveyed some of ADP’s shareholders found support for Mr Ackman’s ideas, but also for the company’s management.Why would we grant an extension? He’s had plenty of time. He’s had a whole yearWhile the support for Pershing Square’s ideas “may not translate to votes” and the majority are sceptical of the fund’s nominees for the board, which include Mr Ackman, its involvement and its focus on higher margins should be a win-win for shareholders, they said.The results of the shareholder survey “increase the likelihood that Pershing will win meaningful support in the Nov 7 shareholder vote, although we still consider it unlikely the activist wins seats,” Bernstein analysts Lisa Ellis and Harshita Rawat wrote. Mr Rodriguez, who is one of just a few Latinos at the helm of a major US company, was born in Camagüey, Cuba in 1964, just five years after the revolution ousted President Fulgencio Batista and Fidel Castro seized power. At the age of three, his family fled the country, landing in West Palm Beach, Florida with a suitcase. Mr Rodriguez joined ADP in 1999 through an acquisition and ran various business units before he became chief executive. ADP has a market capitalisation of about $50bn, and more than 700,000 clients.Mr Rodriguez, who attended Harvard at the same time as Mr Ackman, said the two first spoke on August 1.Pershing Square, which had built an 8 per cent stake in ADP in stock and derivatives, was supportive of the company’s progress but thought it needed to adapt faster, to replace as many as five directors, and to oust Mr Rodriguez, he recalled Mr Ackman telling him.The fund manager also sought an extension of time from the board to nominate directors because he was going on holiday and needed more time to finish his presentation. It’s disappointing that ADP continues to attack the messenger instead of addressing the important questions we have raised …According to Mr Rodriguez, Mr Ackman told him: “I can’t change my vacation plans. And by the way, even if I wasn’t going on vacation, my presentation isn’t ready. I haven’t finished the work,” he recalled. “And I’m like: Well, OK. I’ll relay that back to the board.”“The board had a discussion. The board said: Why in the world . . . and everyone’s scratching their heads like: Why would we grant an extension?” Mr Rodriguez said. “He’s had plenty of time. He’s had a whole year.” ADP’s board rejected the request, and Mr Ackman launched a proxy fight to win three board seats. The contest has grown testy, with Mr Rodriguez dubbing his rival a “spoiled brat” in a television interview. Mr Ackman has responded with a series of webcasts targeting ADP retail shareholders — who historically vote alongside the company in a proxy fight and make up about 28 per cent of ADP’s investor base. Pershing Square has said the company is “underperforming its potential” and needs to answer why its productivity is below competitors. But Mr Rodriguez said Mr Ackman has been unprepared on how to help improve ADP, and does not fully understand the company. “Everybody understands the message, which is margins should be double what they are . . . but there is no plan to do that,” he said. Mr Rodriguez is also critical of Mr Ackman’s record: after finishing 2016 down 9.6 per cent and 2015 down 16.2 per cent, his main fund is flat this year, though in 2014, he was up 36.9 per cent. In March this year, he apologised to investors over his disastrous investment in Valeant, which lost his funds about $4bn. “Unfortunately, what he has left is destruction and chaos in his wake on a number of other companies that did not work out,” Mr Rodriguez said. “We have a strategy, and we have a board of directors that tests our strategy . . . We do not have any strategy from him.”Additional reporting by Adam Samson
5;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2017-08-25T12:39:21Z;Chief executives are outsourcing their responsibilities to activists;Handing out treats to grasping hedge funds is a grubby business;Long before they found fame as everyone’s favourite TV patrician and fictional TV physician, Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie performed a sketch show challenging modern social mores. In one scene, they expressed distaste for the presumptuous demands of US-style trick or treaters, telling them in no uncertain terms where to get off.So, this week, it was amusing to see a chief executive adopt a similar approach to the grown-up version of trick or treaters: US-style activist investors. Carlos Rodriguez of Automatic Data Processing told Bill Ackman of Pershing Square where he could stick his demands for board representation, comparing him to a “spoiled brat”.Like Stephen Fry’s brusquer response, it wasn’t big, it wasn’t clever, but it was refreshing. Because, these days, many companies acquiesce to activists’ demands — to dictate strategy, appoint board members or make deals — at the sound of the very first knock.This week, BHP Billiton bowed to calls from Paul Singer’s Elliott Advisors to sell its US shale oil business. BHP suggested it was doing so of its own volition — and the move does make strategic sense. But its decision came straight after Elliott started banging on about holding more BHP shares — enough to call a general meeting and stage a shareholder vote. This appeared to have the desired effect on new chairman Ken MacKenzie, who has only recently moved into the sector.BHP is not alone. Last week, Akzo Nobel, the Dutch paintmaker, agreed a truce with Elliott over demands for a new chairman, after the incumbent turned down a possible €27bn takeover. Danone is another European company with a US activist on its doorstep: Keith Meister’s Corvex Management has just built up a stake in the French food group, which some believe could offer its investors more value. In the UK, ValueAct took a seat on the board of Rolls-Royce last year.But it would be wrong to characterise this as a transatlantic culture clash. Cevian Capital of Sweden has asked for board seats at Switzerland’s ABB. And, if anything, US activists are more demanding of US companies. Nelson Peltz’s Trian fund has just asked for a board seat at Procter & Gamble in return for his $3bn stake. He says a “motivated” outsider could help shake up the company.Even the most powerful can seem powerless to resist. In 2013, David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital demanded that Apple hand out preference shares. It refused but suddenly found $55bn in cash to return to investors.Some companies think it better to invite activists in, before they come knocking: Mondelez, General Electric and Britain’s Premier Foods have all done so. It is easy to see why: AlixPartners found that 80 per cent of changes put forward by activists are approved by shareholders.So why the thrill when Mr Rodriguez told Mr Ackman to sling his hook, pointedly remarking that ADP’s returns were bigger than Pershing’s? Perhaps because it was a CEO standing up for his own strategy, and actually earning his money.Sometimes complying with activists can seem no different to using management consultants. But if CEOs simply let activists call the shots, what are we paying them millions for? This only puts shareholders in the position of besieged householders on Halloween: doling out treats to the greedy but undeserving.matthew.vincent@ft.com
6;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2017-08-21T16:44:56Z;ADP sends Bill Ackman packing over bid to join its board;Hedge fund chief among three Pershing candidates given short shrift by payroll group;Automatic Data Processing has rejected an attempt by Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management to install a trio of candidates on its board, marking the second time this month that the US payroll processor has rebuffed the hedge fund manager’s advances.The New Jersey-based company said that after conducting an extensive review, including interviews with each candidate, it determined that “none of the Pershing Square nominees bring additive skills or experience”. Pershing had put up three director candidates, including Mr Ackman. The hedge fund owns an 8.3 per cent stake in ADP and suggested this month that chief executive Carlos Rodriguez should step down — something ADP’s board swiftly rejected. The news on Monday represents the latest setback for Mr Ackman, the billionaire investor, whose London-listed hedge fund Pershing Square Holdings disclosed last week that it had lost 1.7 per cent in the year to date, hurt by a soured bet on Herbalife. That contrasts with the 7 per cent average return logged by other equity hedge funds over the same period, according to Goldman Sachs data. In a three-and-a-half hour presentation last week, Mr Ackman said that ADP was “materially underperforming its potential”, adding that its profit margins were “vastly below what they should be” at a time when it was “losing ground against competitors”. Mr Ackman also criticised ADP’s executive compensation policies, saying they were geared to generate a “steady upward march in earnings”, causing the group to miss the “big picture”. ADP said on Monday that it planned to re-nominate its 10 existing directors, saying that “unlike Mr Ackman’s nominees, ADP’s directors have a deep understanding and appreciation of the current state of ADP’s business and its clients”. “ADP has taken a number of important steps to thoughtfully and prudently transform our organisation and culture to drive global growth,” the company said. Mr Ackman declined to comment. ADP has outperformed the US stock market over the past five years, generating total returns of 129.8 per cent, compared with 90.4 per cent for the S&P 500, according to Bloomberg data. However, this year, returns of 2.1 per cent have fallen short of the 9.5 per cent posted by the US equities barometer. The almost 70-year old group derives more than three-quarters of its sales through its employer services division that allows companies to outsource human resources functions such as payroll and benefits.
7;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2017-08-17T17:16:56Z;ADP/Pershing: misguided missile;Activist cases still centre on the activist;A catastrophic trade trails an investor like a lost puppy. Bill Ackman has been candid about his disastrous bet on Valeant Pharmaceuticals, a drug company resembling a hedge fund that has been beset by scandal. His billions in losses there have maimed his Pershing Square Capital Management, a portion of which is listed. Such calamity is particularly tricky for a man who, as activist investor, challenges chief executives that he believes are under-achievers.His latest target is Automatic Data Processing. Pershing Square owns nearly a tenth of the hulking payroll processing and human resources outsourcer whose market value is $50bn. Mr Ackman seeks three board seats in a proxy fight. ADP’s CEO has, however, already thrown cold water on the ideas of Mr Ackman, noting that his company’s total shareholder return of 200 per cent in the last six years has beaten Pershing Square by nearly seven timesMr Ackman set out his case in a dense, near 200-page report released on Thursday. Whatever ADP’s shareholder returns, its operating margin of 20 per cent is half that of closest rival, PayChex.Defenders of management say structural differences account for much of that gap. ADP has a low-margin international business and its base of very large clients are fundamentally less profitable that Paychex’s small company base. ADP also has an HR outsourcing unit where much of the costs and revenues are “pass-through” so little margin is associated with them.Mr Ackman goes into great detail to show how he believes ADP’s financials obscure a business whose cost structure is bloated and stagnant and about to be overtaken by tech start-ups.But ADP already trades at nearly 30 times forward earnings. That suggests investors are happy. Mr Ackman needed to make a strong case for change at ADP to counteract the scepticism inspired by his mis-steps over Valeant. Like the returns from Pershing, he has fallen short.Join Lex for a live Facebook discussion on Trump, robot surgeons and activists on Friday (3pm BST, 10am EDT) at: https://www.facebook.com/financialtimes/
8;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2017-08-04T18:03:24Z;Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square rebuffed by ADP over changing chief;HR software group refuses request to extend deadline for nomination of directors;Billionaire activist Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square is seeking “effective control” of Automatic Data Processing by attempting to take five board seats and installing a new chief executive, the payrolls processor said on Friday.Mr Ackman had contacted the New Jersey-based human resources software company at the start of the month to extend an August 10 deadline for nomination of directors to put forward five new directors, including himself, to its 10-member board, ADP said.Mr Ackman also pitched for a change in leadership, asking ADP to replace chief executive Carlos Rodriguez, who has been at the helm since 2011.Pershing, which owns 8 per cent of ADP, largely in derivatives, has had its request rebuffed by the company. ADP noted that it was “open to constructive input” from shareholders but that it had a “clearly defined board nomination process” and the deadline for nominations had been public for nearly a year.ADP added: “We believe our current board has an effective balance of leadership continuity and fresh perspectives that will help us to continue this strong record of delivering value to shareholders.”The company also argued that, since Mr Rodriguez became chief executive, ADP shares had rallied 202 per cent — “many multiples of Pershing’s total shareholder return of 29 per cent”.ADP’s shares had surged 9 per cent when Pershing’s interest in the company was first reported last week, with the news overshadowing disappointing second-quarter earnings.Pershing said later on Friday that it was “disappointed” that ADP had denied its request for an extension and that it would nominate a minority slate to the board.Jeffrey Silber, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said many of the investors with whom he had spoken thought that Mr Ackman’s intent would be to improve margins — given ADP’s were well below that of rival PayChex — split up the company, push for a more aggressive use of the company’s cash and float, make acquisitions or seek an outright sale.“Few (actually none) had speculated he would attempt to take full control of the company,” he added.The clash between ADP and Pershing is just the latest in a slew of such moves by activist investors. This year, Nelson Peltz and his hedge fund Trian Fund Management set up a proxy campaign against consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble, while Elliott Advisors targeted Dutch printmaker Akzo Nobel.ADP shares, which are up more than 8 per cent so far this year, rose 0.6 per cent to $112.35 in afternoon trade in New York.
9;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Crisis of a lifetime shakes up risk tactics for financial advisers;Strategies to deal with investment dangers now take centre stage;For 11 years, US investors could mostly treat “risk” as an abstract concept that could be easily traded in for ever-higher returns. The coronavirus pandemic changed that, ending the longest US stock market bull run in history and replacing it with a bear market that throws investment danger into sharp relief.Some investors reacted early to the market volatility by moving assets into relatively safe investments: the first half of March saw large net outflows of dollars from US stock and bond mutual funds and net inflows into money market funds.Financial advisers typically caution that such sudden shifts in portfolios may be short-sighted and prefer that their clients focus on the long run.Even an unprecedented market crash is no reason to toss out one’s entire investing strategy. Advisers note that careful deliberation is vital. For instance, some investors should trim their exposure to stocks, but others should sit tight and wait for markets to recover.The first step is accepting that some risk is necessary to produce returns. For example, US stocks had an excellent 2019, resulting in a total return of 31.5 per cent for the benchmark S&P 500 — but that included sharp reversals in January, May and August.“How we talk about risk has some bearing,” says Chris Cooke, principal at Cooke Financial Group, an advisory firm in Indianapolis, Indiana. “These are really difficult discussions. Because the investments that offer decent returns in the long run may offer volatility in the short term.”That is why a basic tenet of investing is to spread risk among different asset classes that do not typically move in tandem, such as stocks, bonds and cash (also usually diversified among US and non-US holdings). Accredited investors with a net worth of $1m or annual income of at least $200,000 can add “alternative” assets such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities to their mix.Advisers believe that most investors can embrace the concept of asset allocation. “In theory, investors understand not putting all your eggs in one basket,” says Jan Spielman, an adviser with Quest Wealth Management of Storm Lake, Iowa.There are myriad ways to allocate assets, however, and they can be combined. Among FT 400 advisers, the most popular method is to build a “core” of lower-risk, passive investments that track market indices, complemented by riskier “satellite” investments. Some portfolios diversify across different types of risk, including volatility and correlation, rather than among asset classes.And many advisers favour allocating tactically in reaction to market developments, while others use computer-aided “model portfolios” designed for different risk levels.FT 400 advisers typically use an average of three different portfolio-building methods, including those described and others. Retirement investing can be its own category, where the long timelines lead some advisers to prefer a gradual reduction in equity exposure as a planned retirement date approaches, to reduce volatility as the investor increasingly relies on investment income.To tailor for risk, advisers sometimes deploy several techniques for different parts of one client’s account. That is important because many investors like to divide investors’ accounts into easily identified “buckets” that represent, say, different levels of risk. Tactical allocation might be right for a “high risk” bucket, but not for a retiree’s “income” bucket.This kind of compartmentalisation can ease investors’ minds if they know most of their money is in their “low risk” bucket.Ms Spielman uses buckets based on time horizon, so assets aimed at short-term use are put into shorter-term investments, as an example. “I don’t know if I have any client who can tell you how many large capitalisation stocks they own, but they can tell you how much they have invested for different timeframes,” she says.These buckets can make the various investment risks more tangible for investors. Traci Richmond, an adviser and co-founder of the Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland, finds that most investors worry about the risk of investment losses but not about other risks such as the risk of outliving one’s savings or the risk of inflation sapping their purchasing power.Like many advisers, Ms Richmond recommends investors keep enough emergency cash to cover at least one year of expenses. Many clients have found that approach helpful this year, she says, knowing that they do not have to sell assets at a loss to access cash.Even though having a “cash” bucket is a good general principle, the specific risk level in every portfolio has to be customised to the individual. That is why new clients at many brokerages are given questionnaires asking how they would feel about a large loss, what their investment goals are, and other ways to assess how much risk they can stand.Unfortunately, the extreme test of recent weeks could reveal that some people are poor judges of their risk tolerance.Of course, the recent market crash is the sort of event that provokes investors to rethink how much risk they want to build into their investment portfolios. But reassessing risk tolerance while markets are plunging may not be a wise long-term move.“People tend to think very short-term, but investing is about managing long-term risk,” says Dan Egan, managing director of behavioural finance and investing at Betterment, a wealth manager. “Investors should only reassess risk with a cool mind. Don’t deceive yourself into believing that panic is going to be useful.”If the coronavirus bear market teaches investors anything about risk, it might be that some people overestimated how much risk they are comfortable with in their portfolios. “If investors can’t sleep, that’s stress that we can’t just ignore,” says Ms Richmond. “But people should wait until things normalise before making any big changes.”
10;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;ADP says Ackman’s Pershing seeks ‘effective’ board control;;Billionaire activist Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square is seeking “effective control” of Automatic Data Processing through five board seats and a new chief executive, the payrolls processor said on Friday.Mr Ackman had first contacted the firm on August 1 and asked the New Jersey-based company to extend its August 10 deadline by 30 to 45 days, to nominate five new directors, including himself, to its 10-member board, ADP said. Mr Ackman also pitched for a change in leadership asking ADP to replace chief executive Carlos Rodriguez, who took the helm in 2011.Pershing, which owns 8 per cent of ADP, largely in derivatives, had its request rebuffed.“We believe our current Board has an effective balance of leadership continuity and fresh perspectives that will help us to continue this strong track record of delivering value to shareholders,” ADP said.The company also argued that since Mr Rordiguez became CEO ADP shares had rallied 202 per cent – “many multiples of Pershing’s total shareholder return of 29 per cent”. However, ADP’s shares had surged 9 per cent when Pershing’s interest in the company was first reported last week, with the news overshadowing disappointing second quarter earnings.ADP shares, which are up nearly 9 per cent so far this year, rose 2.4 per cent in early trade.
11;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2014-04-30T13:33:32Z;US growth weakens, S Korea output rises;;In an otherwise sunny day for economic data, US growth weakened sharply in the first quarter, while Spain’s recovery continued to accelerate and consumer confidence in the UK also improved further.AmericasUS: Growth in the world’s largest economy slowed to a 0.1 per cent annualised pace in the first quarter from 2.6 per cent in the final quarter of 2013, the Commerce Department said. Economists had forecast growth would slow to 1.2 per cent pace.The quarter was hit by a sharp drop in exports, which sliced almost a percentage point from growth. Business investment fell and companies cut back on stockpiling, which had buoyed growth in the second half of 2013. Slower inventory building knocked another 0.6 of a percentage point from GDP.The latest weekly figures from the Mortgage Bankers Association show that the volume of applications for both new purchases and to refinance existing mortgages resumed their decline.Overall, an index of purchases fell 5.9 per cent from a week earlier, with a 7 per cent drop in the refinancing index leading the way. A gauge of applications for new purchases dropped 4 per cent.The figures point to a slowdown in housing activity that some economists believe can’t simply be put down to the cold winter the US had.The US economy created 220,000 jobs in April from a revised 209,000 in March, a survey from ADP Research said on Wednesday.Economists had forecast the jobs tally would accelerate to 210,000.Despite a patchy record as a predictor of the official monthly figures, the ADP survey is garnering more attention as the Federal Reserve keeps its focus on the health of the labour market.April’s non-farm payroll report, which is due for release on Friday, is expected to show that jobs growth quickened to 215,000 and that the unemployment rate dipped to 6.6 per cent from 6.7 per cent.Eurozone: Inflation his risen from its four-year low, but not by as much as most economists had expected, raising the chances of European Central Bank action in the months ahead.Figures from Eurostat, the European Commission’s statistics bureau, showed inflation rose to 0.7 per cent in the year to this month, up from March’s low of 0.5 per cent owing to this year’s later Easter.Despite the rise, the figure disappointed economists that had forecast an increase to 0.8 per cent and the April figure leaves inflation at just over a third of the ECB’s target of below but close to 2 per cent.The euro see-sawed after the data, reaching a day-low of $1.3775, before rebounding to $1.3815.The central bank’s policy makers decamp to Brussels next week for one of their twice yearly policy votes held outside its Frankfurt base.A policy move as early as next Thursday cannot be ruled out. But the central bank’s June meeting, which will coincide with the publication of a fresh round of forecasts for inflation and growth, is a more likely option for further monetary easing.But even if the ECB does act, further rate cuts are considered a more likely first option than quantitative easing.Spain: The economy grew by 0.4 per cent quarter-on-quarter in the first three months of 2014, in line with forecasts and the strongest growth rate for six years.Preliminary data from the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica put the year-on-year rise at 0.6 per cent, up from a decline of 0.2 per cent. That’s stronger than forecasts of 0.5 per cent polled by Reuters.UK: Consumer confidence improved in April to reach the highest level since 2007, a poll has suggested.An index based on the survey, carried out by GfK for the EU, has seen a 24-point swing upwards over the past year as the economic recovery has strengthened.The index is based on a survey in which 2,000 people are asked about their personal financial situation, the general economic picture and the climate for making large purchases.The UK housing market will see the strongest price gains in Europe for the next two years, according to Standard & Poor’s, climbing another 7 per cent this year even as some parts of Europe remain in the doldrums.The US rating agency expects UK housing to continue its “impressive upturn” this year, before cooling somewhat once the Bank of England starts to raise interest rates – perhaps as early as the start of 2015, S&P’s said. That will moderate house price gains to 4.5 per cent next year.The 7 per cent price gain forecast for this year is the highest in Europe, ahead of Germany (4.5 per cent), Ireland (3.5 per cent), and Switzerland (2.5 per cent). Next year’s forecast is also the highest for the region.South Korea: Factories started humming again in March, following two months when production fell and in the latest set of positive data for the East Asian export powerhouse.Industrial production rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.9 per cent in March from the previous month.This followed two months of data showing production fell.The won touched a six-year high of 1030.6 per dollar on Tuesday after South Korea reported a robust export performance in March.The nation’s current account surplus reached a five-month high of $7.35bn, thanks to brisk overseas sales of mobile phone handsets, cars and semiconductor chips, with exports driven by recovering demand from the US and Europe.
12;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;US growth slows sharply to 0.1% in first quarter;;The US economy came near to stalling in the first quarter after one of the coldest winters on record, raising doubts over whether output will meet the US Federal Reserve’s expectations for 2014.A surge in healthcare spending was all that kept the economy afloat in the first three months of the year, when annualised growth came in at a miserable 0.1 per cent – well below the 1.1 per cent economists were predicting.The Fed shrugged off the dismal figures, saying growth had accelerated since the first quarter. It reduced or “tapered” its asset purchases by a further $10bn to $45bn a month, underlining its belief that the underlying economy is still on track despite the spell of weakness.However, the data raise doubts about the Fed’s 2.9 per cent growth forecast for the whole of 2014.Exports and investment both fell heavily and the economy would have shrunk if President Barack Obama’s healthcare reform had not led to a record increase in healthcare spending.“Disappointing news on first-quarter GDP growth, but it was principally due to the weather,” said Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics in Toronto. “We anticipate that second-quarter GDP growth will rebound to 3.5 per cent”The S&P slipped 0.2 per cent at the start of the day, with technology shares under pressure, but by lunchtime it was slightly higher as markets digested the reasons for the gross domestic product figure. Treasury yields were steady while the dollar remained on the defensive.Consumption grew at a robust annualised pace of 3 per cent in the first quarter – well ahead of market expectations – and contributed 2 percentage points to overall growth.But that was offset by a 6.1 per cent annualised fall in investment and a 7.6 per cent fall in exports. Together, they knocked 2 percentage points off total growth so the size of the economy was flat overall.The main reason for stronger consumption was an unprecedented increase in medical spending – adding 1.1 percentage points to growth – as the expansion of health coverage under the Affordable Care Act began to take effect.The combination of weather effects and the healthcare changes mean that the initial GDP estimate may be prone to revisions, which often result in big swings in the growth numbers.On a day packed with economic data, the private payrolls processor ADP said the US economy had added 220,000 private sector jobs in April, ahead of forecasts of 210,000.The ADP figures will fuel expectations of an acceleration in the official jobs number, due on Friday, which is expected to show total jobs growth of 215,000. The jobs data provide strong evidence that weak GDP in the first quarter did not lead to a total collapse in growth.Separately, the Bureau of Labour Statistics released its quarterly employment cost index, which showed a rise in wages of just 1.8 per cent in the year to March 2014.Wage rises are expected to be the first signal of inflation that would force the Fed to raise interest rates, so the subdued reading will encourage the central bank to keep monetary policy looser for longer.The Fed will not publish economic forecasts this month and there is no press conference from chairwoman Janet Yellen.Additional reporting by Michael MacKenzie in New York
13;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Moody’s rejects concerns over jobs data;;The compiler of ADP’s monthly employment data has rebuffed complaints that it tracks the official US jobs numbers too closely and released statistics defending the closely watched indicator.Mark Zandi of Moody’s Analytics, which compiles the numbers on behalf of payrolls processor ADP, told the Financial Times that 96 per cent of the variation in its monthly jobs report was attributable to ADP’s own data.Mr Zandi’s comments may help to soothe rising market doubts about the ADP data after it sometimes appeared to follow the official Bureau of Labour Statistics numbers from the previous month.“The vast majority of the explanatory power is the underlying ADP data,” said Mr Zandi.ADP’s figures are released on a Wednesday, and give an early estimate of the crucial BLS jobs report, which is released two days later. Analysts predict the official data will show jobs growth of 215,000 for April when it is released this Friday.But doubts about the ADP estimate have grown since a revamp eighteen months ago, because of a seeming tendency for the figures to lag the official numbers.For example, the official estimate of jobs growth plunged to 84,000 last December, while the ADP estimate fell much less. A month later the ADP estimate fell to 122,000, while the official number picked up again.That has led to concerns that the statistical model used to calculate the ADP estimate may rely heavily on past BLS numbers, making it of little value as an independent data release.“Over the last few months the credibility of ADP in the market has been shot to bits,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, and one of a number of critics.Mr Zandi released to the FT the results of a “variance decomposition” for ADP’s estimate of the payroll numbers. This is a standard way to report which factors are driving a result in the kind of model used to derive the ADP data.It shows that 96 per cent of the variation in the ADP estimate comes from ADP’s own data. Another 2 per cent comes from a business conditions index and the remaining 2 per cent from past values of the official payrolls data.Over the last few months the credibility of ADP in the market has been shot to bitsThe FT did not examine the raw ADP data nor audit the calculation. The official payrolls data are included in ADP’s model to help keep it in line with changes in the sample of businesses used by the BLS.“I haven’t seen this analysis but will remain profoundly sceptical until they publish their raw data,” said Mr Shepherdson. He questioned why ADP would not drop the official data from their model given the cost to its credibility for a small improvement in accuracy.Mr Zandi said that there was an internal debate about what to do with the numbers and releasing raw data was a possibility. “I’m inclined to release it but the concern is that doing so reduces the value of it [to ADP],” he said. There is little merit to ADP in being an unpaid supplier of raw data that is processed by others.He also raised an intriguing possibility for the future. “We get the ADP data every week,” he said. “I could construct a weekly series.”
14;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2014-04-10T16:52:52Z;HP rises on PC market share progress;;Hewlett-Packard shares continued their year-long ascent, touching the highest level since 2011 after figures from Gartner showed the computer maker gaining market share and a broker initiated coverage of the company with a ‘buy’ rating.First-quarter data from the analytics company indicated the severity of declines in the PC market had eased with global shipments of HP computers rising 4 per cent from a year earlier to 12.2m.Gartner pointed to the end of support of Microsoft XP for a rise in corporate spending for desktop computers.“While the PC market remains weak, it is showing signs of improvement compared with last year,” Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa said. “The PC professional market generally improved in regions such as EMEA.”Analysts at Deutsche Bank also initiated coverage on HP with a ‘buy’ rating and $40 price target as the company made progress in its turnround.“While the company does have a higher mix of declining segments like PCs and printers, we believe HP’s IT hardware portfolio is well positioned for the next phase of IT, with strength in converged infrastructure and Big Data,” analyst Sherri Scribner said.After early gains, shares in HP slipped back in afternoon trade, ending 0.21 per cent higher at $32.79.Bed Bath & Beyond led the benchmark S&P 500 lower after it reported declines in fourth-quarter sales and profits that were steeper than Wall Street analysts predicted.Bed Bath & Beyond’s net income fell 11 per cent to $333m, or $1.60 per diluted share, as revenues declined 6 per cent year-on-year to $3.2bn.The company has been under pressure from discount, dollar stores and the likes of Walmart and Costco as consumers continue to hunt for bargains.“Bottom-line, growth pre-buybacks is slower than we hoped, but considering the stage Bed Bath & Beyond is in, not surprising,” Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said. “While it implies effectively a dead stock near term, it does not point to this story not working again.”Shares of Bed Bath & Beyond fell 6.17 per cent to close at $63.72ADP, the US company best known for its eponymous monthly jobs survey, is shrinking.The New Jersey-based company said on Thursday that it will spin off its dealer services business, which sells digital marketing tools to car dealers, as part of a plan to sharpen its focus on processing payrolls and providing human resources services.ADP said it would use the returns from the spin-off – which are expected to exceed $700m – to buy back shares.The announcement initially sent ADP shares as much as 3 per cent higher before they fell back to close up 0.87 per cent at $75.22.Shares in Ally Financial, the former financing arm of General Motors that took $17.2bn from US taxpayers, fell in their debut in New York on Thursday after pricing at the low end of expectations on Wednesday evening.The sale by Treasury, which offered 95m shares at $25 apiece, reduced its holdings to roughly 17 per cent and raised some $2.4bn. That leaves the government in profit on the bail-out so far.Ally had sought to sell shares between $25 and $28 but was met with lacklustre interest. Shares declined more than 4 per cent to close at $23.90.Rite Aid, the third-largest US drugstore chain, rallied after the company forecast robust sales over the coming year.The company said it expected revenues in fiscal 2015 to range from $26bn to $26.5bn as same-store sales climb as much as 4 per cent. The guidance was ahead of Wall Street forecasts for $25.8bn.Rite Aid shares climbed 8.44 per cent to $6.94.Overall, US equities slid as technology stocks sold off and momentum from the release of Federal Reserve minutes on Wednesday faded.The S&P 500 fell 2.09 per cent to 1,833.09 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.62 per cent to close at 16,170.22. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite dipped more than 3 per cent to finish at 4,054.11.
15;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;US feels the chill of more weak jobs data;;Fears are rising of another weak payrolls report this Friday as the long, cold winter in parts of the country puts a freeze on the US economy.Data from payrolls processor ADP showed the creation of just 139,000 private sector jobs in February, and there was a nasty surprise from the services industry, where employment activity plunged to its lowest level in nearly four years.Most economists still think the weak data reflect an unusually cold and snowy winter, with strong growth set to resume in the spring, but as the soft patch enters its third month their jitters are growing.“I think to blame the weather for 100 per cent of the slowdown is an overstatement,” said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research in New York.The market consensus is for official jobs numbers due on Friday to show an increase of 150,000 with the unemployment rate holding steady at 6.6 per cent. Analysts expect a modest rebound after jobs growth of just 75,000 and 113,000 in December and January.At the end of 2013 the economy seemed poised to accelerate, with a run of monthly jobs growth above 200,000, but that wave of optimism has subsided after the first months of 2014 delivered only a familiar pattern of mediocre economic expansion and downward revisions to the economic data.The purchasing managers’ index for the services sector fell from 54 in January to 51.6 in February, where a reading of 50 separates expansion from contraction. But a sub-index on hiring activity fell from 56.4 to 47.5 – the first contraction in employment after 25 months of growth.“The weather is likely at least a partial culprit: February was much colder and snowier than usual . . . but even allowing for that, this is a deeply disconcerting number,” said Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macroeconomics.“A sharp contraction in the hiring subcomponent is particularly concerning,” said Ksenia Bushmeneva, an economist at TD Bank. “The magnitude of the decline suggests the possibility of another disappointing payroll report on Friday.”The weather is likely at least a partial culprit: February was much colder and snowier than usual . . . but even allowing for that, this is a deeply disconcerting numberSome details of the Institute of Supply Management’s services report suggest the weather is to blame, with construction and wholesale companies explicitly citing the cold and snow, and forecasting a return to stronger activity in April.But there were also companies in industries such as finance and technical services, which are less likely to be affected by weather, that said the economy is trending slightly lower or growing very slowly.Meanwhile, the ADP data not only came in below expectations of a 155,000 increase, but there was also a large downward revision to January’s figure from growth of 175,000 jobs to 127,000.The data pose a conundrum for the US Federal Reserve because the weather effect makes it hard to get a clear reading on the underlying health of the economy. Most Fed officials have argued that weather is the main reason for recent weakness.As a result, the Fed is likely to taper its monthly asset purchases by another $10bn to $55bn on March 19, even if there is another weak payrolls report on Friday. The March meeting will be the first at which new chairwoman Janet Yellen is in charge.
16;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;Fed views economic growth as ‘modest’;Assessment may affect timing of bond buying slowdown;The US Federal Reserve downgraded its assessment of the economy on Wednesday but made no changes to policy after second-quarter growth came in at an unexpectedly strong annualised rate of 1.7 per cent.Rather than the “moderate” expansion it reported in June, the Fed said that growth in the first half of the year had been “modest”, a nod to weak recent data but still leaving every chance of a September reduction or “tapering” in asset purchases.The largely unchanged statement suggests the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee is comfortable with its plan to slow asset purchases this year, as long as growth is reasonable, and is just acknowledging the softer figures on trade, consumption and business activity in the past few weeks.The Fed said it would keep purchasing assets at a pace of $85bn-a-month for now and expected to keep interest rates on hold at least until the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 per cent.In a new line about inflation, the FOMC said it recognised “inflation persistently below its 2 per cent objective could pose risks to economic performance” but qualified that by predicting “inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium-term”.The Fed noted “higher mortgage rates” as a restraint on growth and pointedly “reaffirmed its view” that rates would need to stay low for a considerable time after it stops buying assets.The FOMC vote was 11 to 1 in favour. James Bullard, who dissented from the June decision because it was not tough enough on low inflation, returned to the majority while Esther George of Kansas City voted against.Earlier in the day, GDP data came in stronger than the 1 per cent growth rate forecast by analysts, as robust consumption and investment offset the drag from public spending cuts and a slowing global economy.That positive picture was reinforced when the payrolls processor ADP said the US had created 200,000 jobs in July. Its June figure was also revised higher. The Fed has tied its policy closely to the jobs numbers and the strength of the ADP numbers will raise expectations for the official payrolls report on Friday.“The economy is improving and the ADP report is emblematic of a pattern of growth that will continue to tilt to the upside,” said Eric Green, chief economist at TD Securities in New York. “The tapering ship has sailed and only nasty weather would force a return to port.”Key changes and their implications for the US economyAs part of a complicated pattern of revisions, gross domestic product growth for the first quarter was revised down from 1.8 per cent to 1.1 per cent, so the overall size of the economy looked similar but there was more short-term momentum.“Real GDP is up 1.4 per cent in the last four quarters, which still looks very weak compared with the employment data – they look consistent with at least a 3 per cent pace,” said Jim O’Sullivan at High-Frequency Economics in New York. “We still expect GDP to pick up in Q3 and Q4 as fiscal drag fades.”Consumption added 1.2 percentage points to growth in the second quarter, business investment contributed 0.6 percentage points, and the continued rally in housing was worth 0.4 percentage points on the total.That was offset by a subtraction of 0.8 percentage points from trade, with a particularly strong rise in imports, and a small decline in government spending as across-the-board cuts under sequestration continue to bite.The second quarter figures were overshadowed somewhat by comprehensive revisions to GDP data that added a larger-than-expected 3.6 per cent to the size of the economy in 2012. The Bureau of Economic Analysis has started to count research and development as investment, along with copyrights for films and music, and is also including pension promises by companies as income.The revisions revealed that the Great Recession was not as deep as previously thought, with the size of the slump in 2009 moderated from -3.1 per cent to -2.8 per cent, and the recovery last year sharply upgraded to growth of 2.8 per cent rather than 2.2 per cent.Among other changes, the revisions completely recast the US savings rate and investment data, so they will keep economists busy for years to come as they revisit all of their economic models.
17;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2013-07-03T16:11:40Z;Euro falls against yen amid political turmoil;Sterling gains on strong service sector data;The euro fell against haven currencies on Wednesday amid political turmoil in Portugal, with the yen making particularly strong gains.A rise in Portuguese borrowing costs after the resignation of two ministers saw the single currency fall against the pound, the yen and the Swiss franc.The euro dipped 0.6 per cent against sterling to £0.8521 and fell 0.6 per cent against the yen to Y129.88. The single currency was also 0.1 per cent weaker against the Swiss franc at SFr1.2328.But the euro rose against the US dollar, which was weaker against other major currencies after mixed data on the US economy. The dollar pared some losses after initial jobless claims showed new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected in the previous week to 343,000.Figures from the ADP national employment report showing a larger than expected rise in private sector employment last month with 188,000 new jobs added also gave the dollar a temporary boost.But figures showing that the US services sector grew less than expected in June put fresh downward pressure on the dollar, which fell 0.9 per cent against the yen to Y99.75. The euro was later 0.2 per cent higher at $1.3006.The pound was one of the stronger performing currencies after figures showed the UK services sector expanded at a faster rate than expected in June.Data from Markit showed that the services industry grew at its strongest rate in more than two years, with a recording of 56.9, up from 54.9 in May.Sterling rose 0.8 per cent against the dollar to $1.5302.The Swedish krona was stronger after Sweden’s central bank held interest rates at 1 per cent and made no changes to its interest rate guidance.Some investors had thought the Riksbank would take a more dovish approach, but the central bank repeated its message that it planned to raise interest rates in the second half of 2014. The dollar fell 0.5 per cent to SKr6.6930.
18;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2013-06-05T17:51:12Z;Signs of torpor in US labour market;Fed’s Beige Book reports ‘modest to moderate’ growth;A rise in service sector activity calmed jitters about the health of the US economy but there were further signs of torpor in the labour market ahead of Friday’s crucial non-farm payrolls report.The Institute for Supply Management said its services index edged up to 53.7 last month from 53.1 in April, beating expectations for a level of 53.5. A reading above 50 means activity is growing.Solid activity in the services sector suggests that there is still robust demand growth in the US economy and a weak reading for manufacturing this week – just 49.5 – reflects slower expansion in emerging markets.That picture was confirmed by a firmer tone to the Fed’s Beige Book report on business conditions, with “modest to moderate” growth across most of the country, and “strong” growth in the Dallas district. All twelve districts reported a moderate to strong expansion in the housing sector.That implies that the underlying recovery of the US economy is on track. But weaker data on employment – with businesses adding just 135,000 jobs in May according to ADP, the private payrolls processor, compared with market forecasts of 171,000 – means the US Federal Reserve is unlikely to slow its $85bn-a-month, QE3 programme of asset purchases at its meeting next week.Fed chairman Ben Bernanke has said the central bank could slow the pace of purchases at one of its next few meetings. But the programme is supposed to continue until there is a “significant improvement” in the outlook for the labour market. That condition is unlikely to be triggered unless the official payrolls data on Friday show exceptional strength.The ADP report also contained a downward revision to April’s numbers from 119,000 to 113,000. The official data showed jobs growth of 165,000 in April and economists estimate a figure of 167,000 for May.Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, which jointly produces the monthly report with ADP, said: “The job market continues to expand, but growth has slowed since the beginning of the year. The slowdown is evident across all industries and all but the largest companies. Manufacturers are reducing payrolls.”Tax rises and across-the-board federal spending cuts have hampered both consumers and businesses since March. A number of Fed officials have said they want to see how the economy develops over the next few months before making a decision on tapering QE3.Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “The odds of a strong report on Friday have just gone down considerably.”“We have been expecting payroll gains to soften in the wake of weak . . . hiring data, and the apparent end to the drop in jobless claims, but we were much more concerned about June-July than May. If ADP is right, talk of near-term Fed tapering is on a short lease.”Within the ISM report, the forward-looking new orders gauge rose to 56 in May from 54.5 the previous month, but the employment measure slipped to the lowest level since last July at 50.1, compared with 52 in April.“While the manufacturing index has a much longer record, the non-manufacturing index covers more of the economy: about 88 per cent of gross domestic product versus 12 per cent,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research in New York, said that the combination of data with this week’s ISM reports suggests that services will now be the main engine of growth for the US. “Between the slowdown in global demand and defence spending, the recovery has been handed off to the service sector,” he said.Adding to the gloomier picture on manufacturing, the commerce department published figures showing weaker than expected factory orders, with bookings up by 1 per cent in April.That was better than the revised 4.7 per cent decline in orders the previous month but economists surveyed by Bloomberg had forecast a 1.5 per cent uptick.Demand for durable goods, those meant to last at least three years, rose 3.5 per cent, while that for non-durables decreased 1 per cent.

Only half of all 10 main sectors were trading in positive territory with materials and financials leading the gains.“After yesterday’s impressive gains, we see markets pause and a little consolidation taking place,” said Paul Zemsky, CIO of multi-asset strategies at ING US Investment Management.“Recent gains can be explained by several factors – fears about sequestration, Italian political outcome and growth in China subsided and seem manageable. And in light of better economic data from the US as well as ultra-low bond yields, stocks are very attractive at the moment,” he added.The Dow continued to climb and finished at a new record high after adding 0.3 per cent to 14,296.66.Hewlett-Packard shares climbed 3 per cent to $20.98 after the Institutional Shareholder Services, an influential proxy advisory firm, urged shareholders to reject re-election of Ray Lane, chairman, and two other directors over their handling of the Autonomy purchase.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed marginally lower at 3,222.37.Microsoft shares fell 0.9 per cent to $28.09 after it was fined $732m by European Union regulators for failing to offer customers the choice of rival browsers on its Windows operating system in breach of a high-profile agreement.Shares in BlackBerry rose sharply after chief executive Thorsten Heins told the Spanish newspaper that its new Z10 phones attracted a lot of interest from consumers who currently use smartphones operating on other platforms. Its stock gained 6.2 per cent to $13.36.Harris Corporation shares were hit after analysts at Oppenheimer cut their rating to “underperform”.Shares in the information technology company, which provides services to the Department of Defense, fell 3.2 per cent to $45.74.Among banking stocks Bank of America and Citigroup shares rallied, adding 3.2 per cent to $11.92 and 2.3 per cent to $44.60 respectively.
20;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T20:08:49+0000;US jobs gains calm investor nerves;;Friday 21:15 GMT. Solid US jobs figures calmed investors unsettled by hawkish talk from US Federal Reserve policy makers, swinging global stocks back into positive territory and trimming gains for the dollar.A non-farm payrolls figure of 155,000 that came in slightly above expectations represented a “sweet spot” for sentiment – good enough to lift risky assets but not so good that it fanned fears about the early withdrawal of extra central bank liquidity.“The very solid US employment data will, if anything, push out the date for an end to quantitative easing and represents solidly risk-positive numbers,” said Alan Ruskin of Deutsche Bank.Prior to the US jobs numbers, a resurgent dollar had hit 2½-year highs against the yen while gold had sold off with bullion prices particularly vulnerable to expectations of waning central bank liquidity.The S&P 500 index closed 0.5 per cent higher in New York at 1,466.47 points, its highest close since December 2007. For the week, it gained 4.6 per cent.The broad measure of US stocks was lifted not only by non-farm payrolls but also by ISM services data reaching 10-month highs, while many European stock markets erased early losses and closed higher in the wake of the US jobs report.London’s FTSE 100 gained 0.5 per cent as global stocks on the FTSE All World index gained 0.4 per cent, overcoming earlier losses of 0.2 per cent.The dollar triumphed over the yen in the battle of the haven currencies as the change in tone of minutes from the last Fed meeting was priced in alongside growing pressure in Tokyo for more dovish policies.Japanese shares surged in a post-holiday catch-up rally after the Fed minutes showed some members of its policy committee favoured ending their $85bn monthly bond-buying programme much earlier than expected this year.Japan’s Nikkei 225 Average climbed 2.8 per cent to levels last reached in March 2011, with a weaker yen boosting shares of exporters, although the move was consistent with the same fiscal cliff deal bounce enjoyed by Swiss stocks on Thursday when they resumed trading after the holiday.The yen depreciated above the Y88 per US dollar mark compared with Y86 a week ago, standing 1 per cent lower at Y88.10.The dollar index touched seven-week highs with US currency strength earlier weighing on the euro, which teetered closer to $1.30 before recovering to stand slightly higher $1.3075. The index also pared some of its gains and closed 0.1 per cent higher.The Fed minutes showed a divide among committee members on when bond purchases should end, as concern was expressed about the size of the central bank’s balance sheet.“The minutes have added a fresh degree of uncertainty into the investment climate, which is likely to mean a steeper yield curve,” said Andrew Wilkinson of Miller Tabak. “But equity investors should take heart from the fact that the Fed’s perception is qualified on an improving economy.”Other analysts cautioned that, despite the tone of the Fed minutes, the doves still remained in the driver’s seat of Fed policy.“The key issue here is whether this is the usual hawkish/dovish struggle that we see in the Fed where the doves, led by [Ben] Bernanke, win the day,” said Steven Barrow, of Standard Bank.“We will have to await future speeches to see if any of the doves are becoming more concerned about the consequences of the Fed’s balance sheet expansion,” he added. “We doubt that they are and hence we are sceptical that the markets should get all worked up by yesterday’s minutes.”How the world’s central banks are addressing global economic uncertaintyThe prospect of an early end to Fed purchases of US government debt had weighed on Treasuries prices with 10-year yields climbing to their highest level for eight months to 1.96 per cent. But the US jobs numbers saw yields move back down to 1.90 per cent, 1 basis point lower on the session.A risk-averse mood was evident in the commodities markets as Brent crude oil prices fell 0.6 per cent to $111.42 a barrel while US copper prices retreated 0.6 per cent to $369 a pound.Gold prices sank to a 4½-month low but also pared their worst losses to stand 0.4 per cent lower at $1,656 an ounce.German Bund yields hit a two-month high, rising 6bp to 1.54 per cent, while 10-year UK gilt yields climbed briefly above those of benchmark French bonds for the first time in nearly two years.Downbeat services purchasing managers’ index readings from Europe showing figures below the 50 expansion level added to risk-averse trading. But the UK reading – the worst since April 2009 at 48.9 – drew particular concern about the heath of the UK economy.“The sharp contraction in the UK service sector increases the risk of a triple-dip recession,” said Rob Harbron, of the Centre for Economics and Business Research think-tank.
21;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2012-11-01T16:22:22Z;Data point to sluggish US jobs market;Manufacturing expands at slightly faster pace;The crucial non-farm payrolls report will be released on time on Friday as a series of numbers released on Thursday pointed to a stable but sluggish labour market.Initial claims for unemployment insurance fell from 372,000 to 363,000, a little ahead of market estimates, while the ADP private payrolls report found a rise in job creation from 88,000 in September to 158,000 in October.Friday’s official payrolls, which will be released as scheduled despite the disruption caused by Hurricane Sandy, is the last big economic indicator due before next week’s presidential election. Thursday’s data suggest they are more likely to come in above than below consensus forecasts of 120,000 jobs.But the big political danger to incumbent President Barack Obama is of a sharp reversal to last month’s surprise drop in the unemployment rate from 8.1 to 7.8 per cent. Many economists suspect that was due to sampling error, at least in part, so Mr Obama could easily have to explain a rise in the rate on Friday.The initial claims data are likely to be distorted by hurricane effects over the next few weeks but last week’s baseline suggests modest improvement in the labour market. The weekly data vary a lot but are one of the most timely measures of the jobs situation.“Through the volatility, claims continue to signal resilience,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. “If anything, they point to marginal improvement, with the 367,000 averaged over the last four weeks down slightly from 371,000, on average, in the third quarter.”The ADP payrolls report has been revamped after criticism that it was too volatile and did a poor job of tracking the official payrolls release. The new data cover a larger sample of businesses and are compiled by Moody’s Analytics rather than Macroeconomic Advisers.Download FT writers’ dissection of the US jobs crisis that has loomed large in the US election campaign“Businesses are adding consistently to their payrolls. October’s job gains were in line with the average monthly gains of the past two years, with sturdy albeit less than stellar growth across most industries and company sizes,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “Businesses have turned more cautious in recent months, but that has yet to impact their hiring and firing decisions.”The new data series has no record yet, but if it perfectly tracked the official Bureau of Labor Statistics data for the private sector, then total payrolls growth on Friday might be 150,000 after a small fall in government jobs.“The changes in the series methodology limit the usefulness of comparisons between the new and old series,” noted Cooper Hawes at Barclays in New York. “In addition, we stress that closely aligning the ADP series to match past BLS data does not mean that it will necessarily be more useful for forecasting payroll employment.”Aside from the jobs data, the Institute for Supply Management released its closely watched monthly index of industrial activity, which rose slightly to 51.7. This showed the manufacturing sector expanding at a slightly faster pace than it did in September, on the back of higher demand and production. But while the ISM’s measure of domestic orders rose, its index of new export orders declined amid tough global economic conditions.“Manufacturing continues to hold up better in the US than in the rest of the world. It is still under pressure from global economic headwinds and domestic policy uncertainty,” says Nigel Gault, chief US economist at IHS Global Insight. “But improvements in the domestic economy – notably in housing and consumer spending – are providing support,” he said.The employment component of the ISM dropped from September’s data, but it remained above the threshold of 50 that separates expansion from contraction. This could offer hope that the October payroll data will show some recovery in manufacturing jobs after two months of consecutive declines.The BLS also released productivity data for the third quarter, which showed a continuing improvement in US competitiveness, although the pace of growth in productivity has settled back to a more normal level after dramatic rises during the recession.Productivity in the third quarter rose at an annualised rate of 1.9 per cent and by 1.5 per cent compared with a year ago. That is broadly in line with the long-run growth trend and suggests that businesses will have to hire more workers to increase output instead of squeezing more out of their existing labour force.Unit labour costs, which measure wage costs adjusted for productivity, fell by 0.1 per cent in the third quarter. That suggests US businesses will continue to gain international competitiveness as their effective labour costs are stagnant.Additional reporting by James Politi
22;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Jobs figures lift US dollar;;The dollar rose against other major currencies after positive jobs figures improved sentiment on the US economy, marking a sharp contrast with negative data on the eurozone.The dollar index, which weighs the dollar against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.2 per cent after figures showed US private sector employers added 162,000 new jobs in September, exceeding analysts’ expectations.Analysts said that economic data in the US was being watched for signs on how much “quantitative easing” the Federal Reserve was likely to do, after the central bank said last month its programme was dependent on the health of the US economy.“The conditions in the US labour market will remain key to shaping the length [of time] QE3 is in operation and hence today’s ADP report is crucial,” said Derek Halpenny, analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.The dollar was also supported by haven demand amid negative signs elsewhere in the global economy, with earlier data for the eurozone indicating a further contraction across the services sector. PMI data from Markit showed that the services industry in Germany, France, Spain and Italy was still in decline in September.The euro fell 0.1 per cent to $1.2907 while the pound fell 0.3 per cent to $1.6084. The dollar rose 0.5 per cent against the yen to Y78.56.The Australian dollar continued to fall against the US dollar after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates the previous day to 3.25 per cent and fresh figures showed a decline in exports.Markets moved to price in further rate cuts this year after the RBA warned of a slower growth outlook in the Australian economy in the year ahead.“Continued signs of slowing in Asia, particularly China, and the rapid deterioration in Australia’s trade position do not bode well, in our view,” said analysts at Morgan Stanley.The Australian dollar fell 0.5 per cent to $1.0219.In emerging markets, the Polish zloty outperformed its neighbours after Poland’s central bank defied expectations of monetary easing and held rates at 4.75 per cent. The euro fell 0.7 per cent to 4.089 zlotys, its weakest level in more than two weeks.
23;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;US private sector adds 162,000 jobs;;An increase in private sector hiring eased fears of a renewed slowdown in the US labour market, while the pace of growth in the services sector picked up in September, delivering a dose of economic confidence for Barack Obama before the first presidential debate on Wednesday.US businesses added 162,000 new jobs in September, according to ADP, the payroll processor. The figure exceeded analysts’ expectations of 140,000.However, gains in previous months were revised lower. The August improvement was reduced by 12,000 to 189,000 new jobs while July’s increase was cut by 17,000, resulting in a total 156,000 hires.The data were released before Friday’s crucial employment report from the labour department, which is expected to reveal that 113,000 jobs were created by government and businesses in September.A separate report from the Institute for Supply Management showed new orders in the non-manufacturing sector accelerated, even as employment cooled.ISM’s services index rose to 55.1, the highest since March, from 53.7 last month. This came in above consensus estimates of a level of 53.5. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.The forward-looking new orders index jumped to 57.7 from 53.7, but growth in employment eased to 51.1 from 53.8. Exports also waned to 50.5 from 52.Companies in the services industry, from agriculture to property, have avoided the contraction that their manufacturing counterparts faced in recent month on the back of slowing growth in China, a recession in Europe and uncertainties surrounding the US “fiscal cliff” – tax increases and government spending cuts scheduled for the end of the year.While ADP’s employment numbers are looked to as an indicator of the government’s non-farm payrolls, the data sometimes diverge. ADP forecast a large gain in August that turned out to be a much smaller advance than expected – only 96,000 jobs were created that month, according to the labour department.“Unfortunately, the ADP series has not been especially helpful for refining payrolls forecasts,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics. “It overestimated by 98,000 last month. Over the past two years, misses have ranged from -184,000, with payrolls weaker than ADP, to +116,000, limiting the information value of the data. Government payrolls can also be quite volatile.”ADP’s monthly employment report is taken from a subset of its business records, which represents roughly 400,000 US businesses and 24m employees in the private sector.Employment in the service sector expanded by 144,000 in September, down from 175,000 in August, while 18,000 jobs were created in the goods-producing sector.Within these categories, manufacturing employment rose by 4,000 and the number of construction jobs increased by 10,000, the strongest since March when mild winter weather boosted construction activity.The financial services sector added 7,000 jobs in September, marking the 14th consecutive monthly gain.Some economists remained downbeat on the US employment outlook, however.“The indicators that provide some steer of where the unemployment rate is heading over the next few months supply little evidence that it will dip below 8 per cent,” said Paul Dales, senior US economist at Capital Economics.“What’s more, we doubt that gross domestic product growth will be strong enough next year to drive the unemployment rate as low as the Federal Reserve hopes.”Most economists expect growth will stay near or less than 2 per cent for the rest of the year, a pace that is probably too weak to lower the persistently high unemployment rate.
24;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2012-09-06T16:16:21Z;US private sector hiring accelerates;;A string of encouraging data offered hope that the US recovery may be regaining some strength, easing fears of a renewed slowdown in job creation and delivering a dose of economic confidence for Barack Obama ahead of last night’s Democratic convention speech.The figures – released on Thursday – showed that 201,000 new jobs were added by private businesses in August – according to ADP, the private payrolls processor. This was the biggest gain in five months, and well above analysts’ expectations of 149,000 and July’s upwardly revised level of 173,000.Combined with a decline in weekly jobless claims and a pick-up in activity and employment in the services sector, this offered some measure of comfort that America’s labour market is recovering from its latest midyear slump.The positive indicators came on the eve of Friday’s crucial monthly jobs report, which is arguably the most politically sensitive of all US economic data – and could also have implications for the Federal Reserve as it decides whether to further ease monetary policy.Including government payrolls, economists predict that 125,000 jobs were created last month in the world’s largest economy, down from July’s 163,000. Based on Thursday’s figures, economists said there was a greater possibility of it being stronger, rather than weaker, compared to the consensus, which could help solidify Mr Obama’s re-election message and marginally shrink the chances of Fed action.But Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, argued that this wasn’t sufficient to dissuade the central bank from easing: “We wouldn’t expect this improvement to persuade the Fed to hold fire next week. Employment would need to grow by a lot more than 200,000 per month to bring the unemployment rate down at a pace more agreeable to the Fed.”Although recent data have showed some improvement, weak hiring patterns and persistently high unemployment above 8 per cent have been a cause for “grave concern”, Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke said last week as he made a case for further monetary easing.ADP said August hiring was led by the service sector, which added 185,000 workers. Goods-producing companies added 16,000 jobs, of which 3,000 were in manufacturing. At the same time, labour department data showed first-time claims for jobless benefits falling 12,000 to 365,000 – a one-month low – for the week ending September 1, down from 374,000 the week before. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected a smaller dip to 370,000.The four-week moving average for claims, which aims to smooth out the volatility of the weekly data, rose to 371,250 from 371,000.Meanwhile, employers announced fewer job cuts in August than July. Planned job losses fell 12.5 per cent to 32,239 last month compared with 36,855 in July – the lowest number of monthly job cuts by US companies since December 2010, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the recruitment company. Planned cuts fell 37 per cent from August 2011.“Job cuts slowed significantly over the summer, but it is too early to determine whether this is a trend,” said John Challenger, chief executive.“There have been other signs of economic improvement, including an uptick in home prices and strong automobile sales. However, there seem to be just as many reports showing continued trouble, such as three months of contraction in manufacturing.”The monthly report that tracks corporate dismissals by industry and region is used by investors to determine the strength of the labour market.“We view this report as suggesting that the modest improvement in labour market conditions that began in July has held through August, but further momentum has been lacking,” said Michael Gapen, director of US economic research and global asset allocation at Barclays.Other economic indicators have not been so upbeat, however. The Institute for Supply Management on Tuesday said its manufacturing index fell for the third straight month in August, the longest slide since the recession ended.But on Thursday, ISM released its survey of the services sector, which showed a slight pick-up in activity last month. The ISM non-manufacturing index rose to 53.7, from 52.6 last month and above consensus estimates of a level of 53. The employment component was among the brightest spots of the report, showing a strong rebound compared to July.A reading above 50 indicates that the non-manufacturing economy is expanding. The ISM surveys more than 375 companies from numerous sectors across the US including agriculture, mining, construction, transportation, communications and wholesale and retail trade.
25;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T20:08:49+0000;Samsung slips after sales miss forecasts;;Asian stocks remained under pressure as Samsung Electronics reported sales that missed analysts’ expectations and investors took the view that more monetary stimulus only highlight concerns about the global economy.The FTSE Asia Pacific index slipped 0.5 per cent to 229.00, Japan’s Nikkei 225 Average eased 0.7 per cent to 9,020.75 and South Korea’s Kospi composite index fell 0.9 per cent to 1,858.20.Samsung, the world’s largest maker of televisions and mobile phones and which accounts for 16 per cent of the Kospi, fell 2.0 per cent to Won1.16m after reporting sales that were less than analysts had predicted as investors speculated that the company’s earnings growth may have peaked.Elsewhere in Asia growth-sensitive resources stocks were among the region’s worst performers. BHP Billiton lost 1.0 per cent to A$32.09 and Rio Tinto fell 1.5 per cent to A$57.80 in Sydney while energy company Santos shed 2.4 per cent to A$10.69.In Tokyo, exporters led declines with Canon off 2.5 per cent at Y3120, Fujitsu falling 3.1 per cent to Y370 and Mazda Motor falling 1.9 per cent to Y104.Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 index lost 0.3 per cent to 4,157.81, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was flat at 19,800.64 while China’s Shanghai Composite index gained 1.00 per cent to 2,223.58.Banking stocks in Hong Kong and Shanghai were hit by concerns about the slowing economy and that an interest-rate cut would erode net interest margins. They were counterbalanced by gains for property developers on the prospect of lower rates driving housing demand.China Construction Bank fell 2.7 per cent to HK$5.16 and Agricultural Bank of China lost 2.5 per cent to HK$3.11 while the Shanghai Property sub-index jumped 3.5 per cent to 3,512.13.Investor focus is pinned on US jobs data due later on Friday as investors ponder whether the Federal Reserve will also ease policy.On Thursday, weekly initial jobless claims fell by the most in two months and the ADP report of private sector employment rose by a stronger-than-expected 176,000 in June.These two reports perhaps bode well for the official jobless claims numbers due on Friday. And if there is evidence that the US labour market is not as weak as many believe then this may reduce the need for the Fed to take further bold action to support demand.Central banks in Europe and China attempted to revive the sluggish global economy on Thursday by easing monetary policy and cutting interest rates.An interest-rate cut by the People’s Bank of China, which lowered its main one-year lending rate by 31 basis points to 6 per cent, failed to outweigh disappointment over the European Central Bank’s latest move to address the region’s debt crisis and slowing economy.While some investors welcomed the moves, they noted the actions also signalled policy makers are becoming increasingly concerned about the health of the global economy.
26;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2012-07-05T17:21:42Z;US private sector hiring surges;;The US labour market may be regaining some traction after a dispiriting slump, according to fresh data on private hiring and jobless claims that triggered optimism about America’s economic outlook.US companies hired more workers than expected in June, adding 176,000 new jobs, said ADP, the payrolls processor. Meanwhile, the labour department said first-time applications for unemployment benefits experienced their largest decline in two months – falling by 14,000 to 374,000 last week, well below the level forecast by economists.The data stoked hopes that the monthly jobs report due on Friday will show a significant acceleration in non-farm payroll formation, which had slowed as the US economy was buffeted by turmoil in the eurozone.“We do not want to over-emphasise these two reports …but it is good to see some upbeat news regarding the labour market after most related indicators weakened over the past few months,” said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan Chase.Some economists made upward revisions to their forecasts for the official data. Goldman Sachs, for instance, said it was expecting the US economy to have created 125,000 jobs last month, compared with its previous estimate of 75,000 positions.In May, US employers generated 69,000 in new payrolls, a much more anaemic pace than earlier in the year.If the improvement in the labour market is confirmed by the monthly jobs report, it could go a long way towards comforting economists that the recent nasty spell of data on the US economy has only been temporary.This in turn could dissuade the Federal Reserve from taking more aggressive action to ease monetary policy through a new round of asset purchases. It is also likely to bolster President Barack Obama’s position heading into the heat of his re-election campaign.However, the jump in weekly jobless claims and the improvement in the ADP survey – which tends to be quite volatile – may not necessarily translate into better payrolls data on Friday.Meanwhile, other economic indicators have not been quite as positive. The Institute for Supply Management on Monday said its manufacturing index fell sharply last month to its lowest levels in three years, signalling a significant slowdown in the industrial base.On Thursday, ISM also released its survey of the services sector, which also showed a drop in activity last month to its lowest level since January 2010.Erik Johnson, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said this all pointed to the continuation of a sluggish expansion in the coming months. “Looking forward, slow growth is expected – we expect GDP growth to decelerate from 1.9 per cent in the first quarter to an anaemic 1.5 per cent in the second – but the US economy should avoid recession,” he added.Nevertheless, there was a sunnier mood surrounding the labour market on Thursday. The ADP figures were stronger than the 100,000 new jobs forecast by economists following May’s upwardly revised gain of 136,000.ADP’s data showed job growth was concentrated in the services sector, which added 160,000 jobs. Goods-producing businesses hired 16,000 workers, among which 4,000 were added in manufacturing.Economists had also expected a much smaller decline in jobless claims to 385,000.The four-week moving average of claims, which smooths out volatility, fell 1,500 to 385,750.Paul Dales, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said the claims figures were “another sign that, although labour market conditions are not as good as earlier in the year, they are not deteriorating drastically”.
27;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2012-05-31T17:10:48Z;US data show loss of momentum;GDP revised down to 1.9% and jobs weaker;First-quarter growth for the US was revised down from an annualised rate of 2.2 per cent to 1.9 per cent on a day of gloomy data for the world’s largest economy.The downward revision to gross domestic product came alongside a weak jobs report from ADP, the payrolls processing company, and a rise in new claims for unemployment insurance.Economists await two crucial reports on Friday – official payrolls data for May and the purchasing managers’ index for manufacturing – but it is getting harder to blame weakness on temporary factors, such as unseasonal weather earlier in the year, rather than an underlying loss of momentum.How well the US economy stands up to renewed uncertainty in Europe will influence global growth prospects as well as President Barack Obama’s chances of re-election this autumn.There was one sign of hope: gross domestic income, an alternative measure of national output that can be more accurate than GDP, rose 2.7 per cent in the first quarter compared with 2.6 per cent in the last quarter of 2011.That is still not strong, but is more consistent with the drop in unemployment in the early months of this year, and does suggest greater momentum in the economy. The US Federal Reserve looks to GDI as a way to test the reliability of early GDP estimates and judge whether they will later be revised.The downward revision to GDP reflected a smaller build-up of inventories, higher imports than previously thought, and lower spending by state and local governments.New claims for unemployment insurance, the highest-frequency data on the labour market, rose 10,000 to 383,000 for the week to May 26. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected the number of claims to stand at the 370,000 mark. The prior week’s level of 370,000 was revised up to 373,000.The four-week moving average, which smooths out seasonal quirks, rose 3,750 to 374,500, but this is still below 384,250 reported at the end of April.“On balance, the disappointing tone of this report is consistent with the overall trend in the recent data flow, which continue to show weakening growth momentum,” said Millan Mulraine of TD Securities in New York.Some analysts were a little more positive. “The labour market has come off the boil a little since spring arrived, but the slowdown is much more modest than the one we saw last year, “ said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.Meanwhile, the ADP employment report suggested that the private sector created only 133,000 jobs in May, compared with an April estimate of 113,000, which was downwardly revised from the original report of 119,000.“While May’s increase was the 28th consecutive monthly advance, it nonetheless reflected a notable slowdown in the recent pace of hiring,” said Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, a research firm that helps to compile the data.“The sharpness of the deceleration seems consistent with other incoming data suggesting the economy, weighed down by heightened uncertainty over the European financial crisis and by growing concerns about domestic fiscal policy, slowed early in the year.”The ADP figure closely tracks the official payrolls figure over time although it tends to be more volatile.“If the official payroll number is in line with ADP – and statistically speaking, ADP is by far the best indicator of payrolls on a month-to-month basis – then May will be the third straight soft month,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.He reiterated the impact of high petrol costs between December and April on employment growth, but said: “With prices now barrelling back down, we look for better numbers in the summer.”
28;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Economic Outlook: US jobs data awaited;;Investors could use some good news this week to counter the gloom surrounding global markets. Their hopes will be pinned on the US labour market on Friday to deliver it, with the publication of the monthly non-farm payrolls report.After setting a modestly strong pace of recovery in the final months of 2011 and the beginning of this year, the last two payrolls reports have disappointed, coming in lower than expected and indicating that the labour market recovery in the world’s biggest economy might have stalled.Last month’s report showed that 115,000 new jobs were created in the US in April, missing expectations of 170,000. March’s 120,000 new positions disappointed forecasts of 203,000. Expectations have been set at a more modest 150,000 for the May payrolls.Missing this target will probably confirm that the US labour market is enduring a weak period, but market reaction will hinge on opinions of the likely response from Federal Reserve policy makers.“If we get another weak outcome the market will increasingly price in further quantitative easing against a backdrop of eurozone worries and fears over the scale of US fiscal drag next year,” says James Knightley at ING.The unemployment rate is expected to remain at 8.1 per cent. The ADP report on private-sector employment precedes the non-farm payrolls on Thursday and is forecast to show that 131,000 non-government jobs were created in May after the previous month’s 119,000.The US plays host to many of the week’s biggest data releases. On Thursday the second estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product is expected to reveal a slightly slower pace of growth than printed in the flash estimate. Quarterly growth is expected to be revised down to 1.9 per cent, from 2 per cent, reflecting a slower-than-expected pace of inventory build.Consumer confidence measures are published in Europe, the US and the UK this week. Obvious negatives are likely to be the eurozone impasse, falling financial markets and economic malaise. But some positives are beginning to emerge, notably lower petrol and food prices.In the eurozone on Wednesday, the decline in confidence is expected to have held at -19.3 as seen in the flash estimate, while in the US on Tuesday the Conference Board consumer measure is seen improving to 70 from 69.2 in April.In the UK on Thursday, however, the GfK confidence index is expected to worsen to -33 from -31, reflecting the double-dip into recession in the first quarter that was first reported in late April.Purchasing managers from the eurozone, UK and US publish their surveys of manufacturing activity in May on Friday. The eurozone PMI is expected to confirm the earlier flash estimate of a fall to 45 from 45.9 in April. The further the index falls below 50, the deeper the slowdown in business activity.The UK index is seen dipping too, but crucially it remains in expansion territory at 50.1 – down from 50.5 in April.The US index remains the strongest relatively. The ISM manufacturing index is also expected to slow, however, down to 54 from 54.8.
29;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2012-04-04T15:23:17Z;US private sector adds 209,000 jobs;March figures show labour market recovery;By Robin Harding in Washington and Anjli Raval in New YorkThe US is expected to post another solid month of jobs growth on Friday with growing evidence that the economy is in a phase of moderate but resilient recovery.Data from ADP, the payroll processor, showed that the private sector added 209,000 jobs in March and its February reading was revised up from 216,000 to 230,000. The ADP numbers can be volatile but track the official data over time.Now the big question for economists is whether growth in non-farm payrolls can accelerate much above 200,000 jobs a month, to levels that would rapidly drive down the 8.3 per cent unemployment rate, and fuel the wage increases that could lead to faster growth.“The fundamental question is what does the labour market truly look like today in an ageing and deleveraging economy?” said Steve Blitz, senior economist at ITG Investment Research in New York. “Is this as good as it gets?”Mr Blitz said that he expects a payrolls number in the low 200,000s for March released on Friday, but does not expect that to accelerate in the coming months, because he thinks some of the hiring last autumn was to catch up after the slowdown in the summer of 2011.Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at Capital Economics in Toronto, said that he also expects a number around 200,000. “Our forecast is a bit slower than February but mainly because we expect some payback from the very unseasonable weather in the last few months,” he said.A warm January and February may have led to construction jobs starting earlier in the year than usual, flattering the jobs figures in those months at the expense of March. Mr Ashworth said that there may be some improvement in job growth as the year wears on, with more private hiring, and local government taking back some workers as tax receipts pick up.Participation in the labour force will be another important indicator on Friday. If more people started to look for work again, then the unemployment rate will stay steady or even rise, despite an increase in jobs.The ADP data showed 23,000 extra manufacturing jobs. Employment in the construction industry grew by 13,000 in March, marking the sixth consecutive monthly gain. Although at a slower rate, employment in the financial services sector increased by 8,000 in February, marking the eighth monthly gain.Small businesses – those with up to 49 workers – added 100,000 positions, while large companies – those with 500 or more workers – increased payrolls by 22,000.In spite of a stream of positive jobs data in recent months, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US Federal Reserve has warned that falls in US unemployment may prove to be a one-off unless economic growth picks up.Separately, data from the Institute for Supply Management on Wednesday showed slightly slower growth in the non-manufacturing sector in March. The ISM’s services-sector index for March fell to 56 per cent from 57.3 per cent in February. Analysts had expected a level of 56.8. Readings above 50 signal growth in industries such as utilities, retail, healthcare and finance.Stocks and commodities are in retreat after the US Federal Reserve on Tuesday curbed expectations of more monetary stimulus.
30;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2012-03-12T21:50:03Z;Aéroports de Paris acquires Turkish airport operator stake;;A new alliance between Aéroports de Paris and TAV, the Turkish airports operator, will aim to expand in Russia, Central Asia and the Middle East, the Turkish group said on Monday after ADP agreed to buy a 38 per cent stake in TAV for $874m.As part of a concerted move into the growing Turkish market, ADP – which said it expected a double-digit return from the transaction as a whole – also agreed to buy a 49 per cent stake in TAV’s construction unit for $49m.The deal, which is scheduled to be finalised by July 1, brings the operator of Paris Charles de Gaulle airport into alliance with the operator of Istanbul Atatürk airport in a transaction that would give the partnership a total of 180m passengers in 37 airports around the world.Sani Sener, TAV’s president and chief executive, told the Financial Times that his group preferred ADP over other interested parties – which also included Vinci, the concession and construction group, as well as private equity groups – because of the potential for growth that the alliance offers.“In our minds we were always thinking about a strategic partner,” he said. “This will allow them and us to leverage our collective skills, outside Turkey in particular.”He added that he expected a “huge privatisation” of Russian airports, and that the companies would also seek acquisitions in Central Asia and Saudi Arabia.Mr Sener acknowledged that one of the reasons for the transaction was funding for TAV’s shareholders, which include Akfen Holding, a construction company that is looking to finance infrastructure projects in Turkey.But he argued the deal was also part of a process of consolidation in the airports industry, which has lagged behind restructuring in the aircraft manufacturing and airline sectors.“Airports have been far behind the two other players in aviation,” he said. “But there is huge room for growth for the airport business in the world because airports are congested and who gets capacity first will gain the passengers.”He argued that the partnership of TAV and ADP would not only enable them to combine their expertise but also give each group the opportunity to establish service companies in airports in which the other was already present.While Turkish Airlines, which has expanded rapidly in recent years, accounts for about two-thirds of TAV’s passengers, Mr Sener argued that the carrier was likely to continue to grow in coming years. He added that improved radar and wider-bodied aircraft would help Istanbul airport overcome capacity constraints.The shareholders in TAV were advised by Credit Suisse, Pekin & Bayar and Ertekin Law Office, while Aéroports de Paris was advised by JPMorgan, Hogan Lovells and Pekin & Pekin.
31;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T19:29:53+0000;Aéroports de Paris/TAV: talking Turkey;ADP has made a bet that the Turkish economy’s hectic growth will continue;"Airlines are merging; why can’t airports? At least the latter are doing so from a position of strength. The acquisition by Aéroports de Paris of a 38 per cent stake in Turkey’s TAV illustrates the point. The French company is as big as it needs to be at home and in search of new earnings, while the Turkish operator controls one of Europe’s fastest-growing markets. ADP is paying $874m for the stake, valuing TAV at TL11.30 a share, compared to the TL7 or so at which they were trading before the stake was put up for sale by three existing shareholders. That is the sort of premium acquisitive companies pay, especially in a quasi-auction process.The transaction fits the strategy of both operators. Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports in Paris are now Europe’s second and 11th busiest measured by passenger numbers and are continuing to grow: passenger traffic at CdG rose 4.8 per cent in 2011 to 61m. Growth in Turkey is stronger: 15 per cent a year between 2002 and 2011, and projected annual growth of 11 per cent between 2009 and 2023, according to ministry of transport numbers. Ataturk airport in Istanbul, with 37m passengers in 2011, is the main asset, but TAV also runs Ankara and Izmir airports, which have the capacity to expand to over 10m passengers a year each from 8.5m and 2.5m today.ADP believes the transaction will be earnings accretive from next year. There are admittedly few synergies in merging airport companies; they are essentially unique assets. That is why so much emphasis is placed on their growth potential. As such, the two biggest threats to TAV’s future profitability are capacity constraints in Istanbul and a slowdown in the rapid expansion of Turkish Airlines, by far the airport’s biggest customer. That expansion is a consequence of the Turkish economy’s hectic growth over a decade. ADP has just made a bet that it is going to continue.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
32;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2012-03-09T17:17:56Z;Miners help London stocks rise;;London stocks made progress on Friday, helped by improving risk appetite after stronger-than-forecast US jobs data.Investors were impressed with the latest US non-farm payrolls report. It showed a rise in the number of people employed outside the agricultural sector of 227,000 in February, better than forecasts of 210,000. The number of jobs created in January and February was also revised higher for both months.The data stimulated risk appetite across global markets. The FTSE 100 rose 28 points by the close to 5,887.61, a gain of 0.5 per cent, turning around from modest losses. Mining stocks were in demand after the numbers, which improved sentiment towards global economic growth. Vedanta Resources led base metals processors, up 2 per cent at £14.14.The results from Greece’s debt swap proposals showed that 85.8 per cent of bondholders had agreed to participate in the scheme. This triggered collective action clauses, which took total participation up to 95.8 per cent, also helping improve the mood.Shares in London Stock Exchange climbed 6.4 per cent to 955p after it announced it was to buy a majority stake in clearing house LCH.Clearnet.LSE Group failed in its bid to merge with Toronto Stock Exchange last year and embarks on the latest acquisition attempt as one of the few big exchanges not to own clearing facilities for its main market.Old Mutual, the Africa-focused insurer, reported full-year profit that failed to match market expectations. The company said operating profit for 2011 climbed 11 per cent to £855m, missing forecasts of £911m.Although it warned of tough market conditions, the company was upbeat about 2012 and said it aimed to pay down £1.7bn of debt by the end of the year following the sale of its Nordic unit. This helped the shares overcome the profit miss and they climbed 1.2 per cent to 164.8p.Aggreko, the company which will provide temporary power to the London Olympics this year, gained 4 per cent to £23.13 after reporting a better than expected rise in full-year earnings, thanks to growth in developing economies. Profit for 2011 climbed 6 per cent to £327m, topping estimates of £325m.Lower down the market, pubs group JD Wetherspoon said it was scaling back its expansion plans for 2012, blaming a rising government excise duty for prolonging tough trading conditions in the industry. The company said it would now concentrate on cutting costs.Wetherspoon’s reported a 11.1 per cent increase in six-month pre-tax profit, but was cautious on the second half of its financial year. Shares recovered from earlier falls of over 1 per cent to gain 0.4 per cent on the day to 405p.Overall, the mid-cap FTSE 250 index climbed 0.6 per cent to 11,527.96.
33;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Asian stocks rally on US job hopes;;Asian stocks were lifted by improving prospects for a Greek debt swap deal and a recovery in the US labour market, while a weaker yen boosted Japanese exporters.The FTSE Asia Pacific index was up 1.3 per cent to 243.96, ending a three-day losing streak that accounted for losses of 3 per cent.Risk appetite improved after data from ADP showed US private sector employers increased hiring and more investors joined a Greek debt swap, fuelling optimism that Greece would secure the deal.Miguel Audencial at CMC Markets, said: “If last night’s optimism on the Greek PSI [private sector involvement] is confirmed and Friday’s US non-farm payrolls follow the ADP data, expect the momentum the market had at the beginning of the year to continue.”Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 Average jumped 2 per cent to 9,768.96 as a weaker yen boosted exporters, with Canon up 2.2 per cent to Y3,715, while Toyota Motor jumped 2.6 per cent to Y3,330.Banks and brokerages were higher, tracking gains in US peers, after a report that the Federal Reserve was considering a new type of bond-purchase programme.Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Japan’s biggest lender, surged 2.7 per cent to Y415, Mizuho Financial Group rose 2.3 per cent to Y135 and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group added 2.5 per cent to Y2,735.Nomura Holdings, Japan’s largest brokerage, was the heaviest traded stock by turnover on the main board, jumping 4.7 per cent to Y378 while rival brokerage Daiwa Securities climbed 4.3 per cent to Y337.Technology shares lifted the South Korean market on expectations that Apple’s iPad3 launch would boost demand for components.LG Display, which supplies flat panels to Apple, jumped 2.2 per cent to Won28,200 and Hynix Semiconductor rose 2.2 per cent to Won29,750.Hana Financial Group rallied 3.8 per cent to Won40,650 after it said it planned to buy additional Korea Exchange Bank shares worth Won200bn on the open market. The announcement boosted KEB shares 1.7 per cent to Won8,230.The Kospi Composite index climbed 0.9 per cent to 2,000.76.Chinese shares were also higher, led by banks, property shares and metal firms, on speculation that Beijing will increase efforts to stimulate the economy. The Shanghai Composite index climbed 1.1 per cent to 2,420.28, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 1.3 per cent to 20,900.73.
34;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2012-03-07T14:57:34Z;Private sector boosts US labour market;;The US private sector added 216,000 new jobs in February as the labour market recovery continued to strengthen.Job creation reported by ADP, the payroll processor, was slightly higher than the average 215,000 positions forecast by economists, and January’s reading was revised up to 173,000 from 170,000.Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, which conducts the ADP survey, said: “The last three monthly gains in employment … have averaged 223,000, compared to 156,000 per month over all of 2011. This pick-up is consistent with the recent acceleration of the nation’s gross domestic product.”The report comes ahead of Friday’s labour department release of non-farm payrolls, which includes government jobs. Economists expect that survey to show that the economy added a net 210,000 jobs in February compared with 243,000 in January, with the private sector contributing 225,000 positions. The unemployment rate is forecast to hold at 8.3 per cent.Gains in the ADP report were spread across size of business, with small companies – those employing fewer than 50 workers – contributing the most growth with 108,000 new hires. Medium-sized businesses added 88,000 jobs, while companies with more than 500 employees grew by 20,000 workers.Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said: “These small and midsized firms are critically important. They are the engine of job creation here in the US.” He said that the government’s jobs reading “will eventually capture this bump in small and midsize hiring but with a lag.”Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James, said he was also encouraged by the growth in smaller companies, which was “a very good sign for the recovery.” He noted, however, that concerns remain over the effect of the mild weather across much of the US, which may have brought forward some seasonal hiring, and over rising petrol prices, which he said may cause some companies to delay expansion plans.Increases were seen in all sectors of Wednesday’s report. The services industries continued to lead growth, adding 170,000 jobs. In the financial sector, the 14,000 workers added was the largest monthly gain in two years.Employment in goods-producing industries, which includes manufacturing, mining and construction, added 46,000 positions. Within that category, manufacturers hired 21,000 new workers and construction jobs increased for the fifth consecutive month, adding 16,000 jobs.
35;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2012-02-01T15:54:08Z;US jobs growth slower than expected;;Jobs growth slowed in the US private sector last month after a surge in December, missing estimates of a stronger rise in a report released ahead of Friday’s government payrolls tally.Separately, US manufacturers followed upbeat factory data from China, Germany and the UK, reporting the fastest growth in seven months.US companies added 170,000 jobs in January on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to ADP, the payroll processor, below expectations of 182,000 new positions. December’s record-high of 325,000 newly created jobs was revised down to 292,000.“Over the last three months, the monthly gains in employment shown in the ADP National Employment Report have averaged 223,000, compared to 163,000 per month over all of 2011,” said Carlos Rodriguez, ADP chief executive.Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said the downward revision was not “overly concern[ing], however, since the ADP survey has a habit of vastly overestimating employment growth in the final month of each year because of seasonal adjustment problems”.The report showed the private sector added 152,000 services jobs and 18,000 goods-producing jobs in January. Manufacturers added 10,000 workers, compared with a surge of 20,000 in December.Growth was once again strongest among small and medium-sized businesses, which added 95,000 and 72,000 jobs respectively, while companies employing more than 499 people added 3,000 new workers.“Labour market conditions continue to improve at a moderate pace,” said Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, which produces the ADP report. He said the reading was “consistent” with the commerce department’s announcement last week that the US economy grew by 2.8 per cent in the fourth quarter.On the heels of positive purchasing managers’ indices from other leading industrial countries, the Institute for Supply Management said on Wednesday that the US manufacturing sector expanded for a 30th consecutive month.Its PMI rose to 54.1 from 53.1 in December, below expectations of 54.5, but the fastest pace since June. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.“Far from the US being tugged down by Europe, it looks like the US has done some heavy lifting (with of course plenty of help on sentiment from ECB liquidity policies!) in supporting European and global growth sentiment,” Alan Ruskin, strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note.New orders grew faster last month, rising to 57.6 from 54.8. Production and employment also continued to grow, but decelerated from their December rates. The employment sub-index slipped to 54.3 from 54.8, while production lost more ground, declining to 55.7 from 58.9.Inventories continued to contract, but at a slower pace, while prices swung from decreasing to increasing.Several of the survey respondents quoted in the ISM report were positive about the outlook for 2012. The “year [is] starting a little slow, but customers are positive about increased business in 2012”, said one, while another noted that “market conditions appear to be improving”.Rich Bergmann, global manufacturing lead at Accenture, said he was encouraged by the latest data. “In the last quarter, we’ve seen investment in infrastructure, investment in technology, rehiring and new hiring and expansion of new facilities.”Nine of the 18 industries surveyed reported growth, led by apparel and leather products, petroleum and coal products and machinery.Also on Wednesday, the commerce department said construction spending jumped 1.5 per cent in December as private building surged to a two-year high.
36;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2012-01-19T06:10:48Z;Paris rolls out the red carpet for Chinese tourists;;"China hosts the world’s biggest yearly mass migration during Lunar Year/Spring Festival celebrations, but the pushing and shoving involved with returning home doesn’t stop there. The travel rush is also spilling to Europe, where beleaguered economies are hoping to benefit from the bonanza.Paris is rolling out the red carpet for Chinese tourists as soon as they touch down on French soil.Airport operator ADP (Aéroports de Paris) plans to organise a lavish “welcome scheme” – its biggest ever for a single nationality – at its Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports designed to help Chinese “feel at home”.Although Paris is as famous for its brusqueness (the oft-cited anecdote of garçons refusing to answer tourists in English being one example) as it is for its sophistication, the fanfare would seem sensible, considering that Chinese are among the most lavish buyers of French goods.One Chinese jewelry magnate last year wasn’t satisfied buying just Bordeaux wine, so he decided to buy a vineyard complete with its 15th-century chateau. Another tycoon was so mesmerised by Versailles that he recreated the palace back home with imported materials.The ADP plans to deck its airports in Chinese New Year decorations and have an army of smiling Mandarin-speaking officials waiting to hand out red envelopes with a welcome message written by Pierre Graff, the operator’s president.The VIP treatment doesn’t stop there. Announcements will be broadcast in both Mandarin and Cantonese, passengers will be offered free guides, reductions on certain luxury items, and even apps for iPhone/Android in Mandarin that will help them organise their travel.The operator has even given guidance to non-staffers such as police officials and cleaners to be “aware” of cultural sensitivities in order to improve serviceability, an ADP spokeswoman told beyondbrics, adding that a research team had been set up to observe Chinese behaviour.“When our staff return credit cards [after a transaction] or a document to Chinese passengers, they make sure they are given with both hands instead of one,” she said. “In light of the constant rise in the number of arrivals of Chinese tourists in the past five years, the decision to organise the scheme was obvious.”While China’s Communist party has campaigned to put tourists on their best behaviour (via the Spiritual Civilisation Steering Committee) by issuing guidelines against spitting, queue-jumping, eating loudly, or haggling in shops with fixed prices, Parisians and other French people are also adapting.France is the top destination for Chinese travellers in Europe with 910,000 arrivals in 2010, according to the latest report from Euromonitor International, which looks at industry trends. Beyond Paris, the lush lavender fields of southern Midi are also popular, in part due to a Chinese television mini-series set in the region.Chinese spent by far the biggest amount in France too – $375m, according to Euromonitor. Chinese are avid shoppers, preferring to fork out on goods – often luxurious ones – rather than hotels and food. In fact, a majority of Chinese tourists visiting Paris stay in cheaper accommodation outside the city.Chinese visitors are clearly enticed by those very French flavours of romance, history, luxury and quality. But competition is hotting up, Euromonitor warned.European countries face a greater deal of competition for Chinese travellers from other Asian destinations, as well as from the US and Australia. It is therefore important for European countries to market Europe in China in order to continue its prestige reputation and to inspire Chinese travellers to pay the higher costs involved in travelling to the region.So China may come to Europe’s rescue after all. But rather than through the bond market, it’ll be via the baggage reclaim.Related reading:

But will they expend their new-found vigour by actually consuming, or will they dig down deeper into their bunkers?The answer matters for the world economy. US consumption accounts for roughly 70 per cent of the country’s GDP and 15 per cent of the planet’s. This means that a 3 per cent contraction in US consumption would be the equivalent to the economy of, say, Colombia, simply disappearing.The good news is certainly not ubiquitous. It comes in dribs and drabs. Household net worth took a nasty step down in the third quarter as property and share prices slipped. But Thursday’s private sector jobs report from payroll processor ADP was surprisingly robust (and will look even better if confirmed by Friday’s official jobs figures). It was accompanied by another tick down in initial jobless claims. In addition, delinquencies for many types of loan fell in the third quarter, according to the American Bankers Association. Consumer debt payments, as a percentage of disposable income, have reached lows last seen in the 1990s even while credit is expanding.The ultimate confirmation will come, of course, from the results of the companies where Americans spend their money. Here the signals are mixed. There are some bright spots, such as the Macy’s department store chain, and car sales were surprisingly strong. But several of the biggest retailers to report – Kohl’s, JC Penney, and, most significantly, Target – have posted disappointing Christmas trading.A thriftier US might be stronger and more balanced in the long run, and the great crash may have taught consumers valuable lessons. But austerity, whether from governments or from individuals, could not come at a worse time. By all means have virtue, but tomorrow.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
38;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;US private sector adds jobs in December;;US companies added the most positions in a year last month in a further sign that the labour market recovery is strengthening, but other data painted a mixed picture of the pace of economic growth.Private sector hiring increased by 325,000 in December, surging past forecasts of 178,000 new jobs, according to ADP, the payroll processor. November’s reading was revised slightly to 204,000 from 206,000.“The employment situation is improving slowly but with lower paying jobs, which means that the debt overhang will continue to be a problem going forward, which further diminishes the ability of consumers to accelerate gross domestic product growth in the coming year,” said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research.Thursday’s figures come ahead of the government’s employment report, due on Friday, which is expected to show the economy added 150,000 new positions, bolstered by a 175,000 increase in private payrolls. Employers added 120,000 new workers in November and the unemployment rate fell to 8.6 per cent, the lowest since March 2009.“The [ADP] estimate for December suggests that employment accelerated for the fourth consecutive month, consistent with the year-end pick-up in economic growth,” said Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, which conducts the ADP survey. “Today’s report also suggests that November’s somewhat surprising decline in the unemployment rate might stick and, indeed, that the unemployment rate could fall further in December.”Some analysts warned against raising expectations for Friday’s report, however, noting that ADP estimated 297,000 new jobs in December 2010 but the government figure came in at just 113,000.“Nonetheless, this report adds to the list of more encouraging indications on the labour market,” said John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros of RDQ Economics.A detailed look at the condition of the US economy state-by-stateAnother sign the job market may be gaining some momentum came in the labour department’s weekly report on jobless claims.First-time claims for unemployment benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 372,000 in the week ending December 31 from 387,000 the prior week. That was better than expectations of 375,000 claims and pulled down the four-week moving average to 376,500, the lowest level since June 2008.The ADP report showed services industries leading gains once again, adding 273,000 workers, while goods producers hired 52,000 new employees. Manufacturing employment rose by 22,000 and construction companies added 26,000 jobs in a positive sign for the housing market.Growth in the service industry picked up on December, according to the Institute for Supply Management. The group’s non-manufacturing index rose to 52.6 from 52 in November, but missed expectations of a rise to 53. Readings above 50 indicate expansion in the US services sector, which accounts for about 80 per cent of the economy.While the acceleration signalled an uptick in activity at the end of the year, it did not fully reverse November’s decline, and employment continued to contract, though at a slower pace than the previous month.“Economic growth continues to be slowed by the lag in employment,” said Anthony Nieves, chair of the ISM’s survey committee.“Employment remains contractionary at 49.4 against 48.9 and goes no way towards corroborating the particularly strong ADP release,” warned David Semmens, US economist at Standard Chartered.Another survey released on Thursday also suggested that employers may still be cautious about expanding. Planned job cuts rose in December from a year ago, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the placement company. Planned redundancies rose 31 per cent to 41,785 from 32,004 in December 2010, which was a 10-year low.That left total planned firings for the year at 606,082, a 14 per cent increase over 2010. Forty-one per cent of those redundancies were in government and the financial sector.Banks also led job cuts in December, followed by industrial goods manufacturers. From November, planned firings eased by 1.6 per cent, but the figures are not adjusted for seasonal variations.“Even as job cuts remain low in most sectors, employers still appear reluctant to add jobs,” said John Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas. “Job creation is likely to remain slow and steady in 2012.”
39;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;US private jobs growth quickens;Number of planned lay-offs stabilises;The pace of US employment growth accelerated in November, with private-sector companies adding a better than expected 206,000 jobs while the number of planned lay-offs stabilised.Meanwhile, low interest rates and falling home prices lured more buyers into the housing market, sending pending sales of existing homes up the most in nearly a year.In further evidence that the US economy has regained a little vigour in the last few months, the Federal Reserve’s latest Beige Book survey found “slow to moderate growth” across most of the country.The employment report from ADP, the payroll processor, beat economists’ expectations of 125,000 new positions over the month and was the largest gain in nearly a year. ADP also revised up the number of new jobs added in October to 130,000.Markets reacted positively to the report and an announcement that the world’s leading central banks were taking joint action to boost liquidity.Wednesday’s report came ahead of the government’s closely watched non-farm payrolls data, set to be released on Friday. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg are expecting total employment to rise by 122,000 after October’s 80,000 net gain and for the jobless rate to hold at 9 per cent.“This [ADP] report is strong enough certainly to pose some upside risks to the street’s forecast for NFP on Friday,” said David Semmens, US economist at Standard Chartered. “This also fits nicely with the improvement seen in initial jobless claims.” New claims for unemployment have come in below 400,000 for the last several weeks, an indication that lay-offs may be stabilising.Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, which conducts the ADP survey, said the increase “normally would be associated with a decline in the unemployment rate. An acceleration of employment is consistent with data showing that GDP growth, which slowed sharply around the turn of the year, is gradually recovering.”The services industry led job gains in November, ADP said, adding 178,000 jobs over the month compared with 28,000 new positions in the goods-producing sector. New construction jobs came in at the highest in five years, with a 16,000 gain, while manufacturers added 7,000 workers.The bulk of new hiring came from employers with less than 50 workers, which added 110,000 jobs. Companies employing between 50 and 499 workers hired 84,000 people, while big companies, with more than 500 employees, added 12,000 jobs.Also on Wednesday, a report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the placement company, said planned lay-offs in November were down 13 per cent from a year ago at 42,474. That level was slightly below the 42,759 planned cuts tallied in October, following a spike above 115,000 in September.The Beige Book – a round up of reports from business contacts across the US – found that “consumer spending rose modestly” and “manufacturing activity expanded at a steady pace” with only the St Louis district reporting a decline.The relatively upbeat tone is consistent with other data that suggests growth is slow but stable following a series of shocks over the summer.Figures from the National Association of Realtors showed pending home sales rose 10.4 per cent in October, the strongest rise since November 2010. That was well ahead of the 2 per cent increase economists had forecast.“Home sales have been plodding along at a sub-par level while interest rates are hovering at record lows and there is a pent-up demand from buyers who normally would have entered the market in recent years,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist. “We hope this indicates more buyers are taking advantage of the excellent affordability conditions.”Pending sales track contract signings but not closed transactions. Existing home sales, which reflect closed deals, rose in October, but so did the number of cancelled contracts. Cancellations have spiked recently on higher numbers of declined mortgage applications and appraisals coming in below negotiated prices.House prices have continued to slide, dropping 3.6 in September from a year ago, according to data released on Tuesday. Meanwhile, rates on conventional 30-year fixed mortgages have fallen to record lows since the Federal Reserve intervened to stimulate the housing market.“This is mostly a rebound rather than a surge from a steady trend, but it is welcome nonetheless,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, noting that pending sales had fallen 7 per cent over the previous three months. “It also is consistent with the recent strengthening in homebuilder sentiment and the modest pick-up in mortgage applications. In short, something seems to be stirring in the housing market, though we would certainly hesitate before calling a definitive start of a recovery.”
40;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2011-11-02T20:51:59Z;US companies add 110,000 jobs in October;;US companies added more jobs than expected in October while planned lay-offs fell to the lowest level in four months in a sign that the job market is stabilising, though at a weak level of activity.The private sector added 110,000 jobs last month, beating economists’ estimates of 100,000 new positions, and September’s total was revised up to 116,000 from 91,000, according to ADP, the payroll processor.“The good news is that employment growth appears stable, but the bad news is that gains of 100,000 or slightly less a month won’t be sufficient to reduce the unemployment rate or generate a pick-up in income growth,” said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.Analysts were looking to the US labour department’s non-farm payrolls report, due on Friday, to see whether the boost in economic growth seen in the third quarter will be reflected in hiring trends.Figures last week showed that third-quarter growth accelerated to 2.5 per cent, following an anaemic 0.4 per cent in the first three months of the year and 1.3 per cent in the second quarter.Economists polled by Bloomberg were expecting Friday’s figures to show the US economy added 95,000 jobs in October, led by 125,000 new private-sector positions.“ADP data is not going to change any [non-farm payroll] forecasts and is consistent with a pretty steady labour market in the last four months,” said Alan Ruskin, strategist at Deutsche Bank.The latest ADP report shows growth entirely concentrated in the services sector, which added 114,0000 workers. Goods-producing companies eliminated 4,000 positions.Manufacturers continued to downsize for a third month, cutting 8,000 jobs in a reflection of “uncertainty around investment and hiring,” said Gary Butler, ADP chief executive. The manufacturing sector slowed in October, according to the Institute for Supply Management amid concerns over domestic growth and global turmoil fuelled by the eurozone debt crisis.Employment growth in October was also stratified by company size. Small and medium-sized firms accounted for the entire monthly rise, adding 58,000 and 53,000 jobs respectively, while companies employing more than 499 people cut 1,000 jobs – the first reduction in five months.“Big manufacturing exporters have employment on hold, probably because of the deterioration in economic growth in Europe and Asia, but smaller domestically focused services firms are still expanding,” Mr Ashworth said.Meanwhile, planned job cuts slowed from a two-year high in September to 42,759 in October, the lowest level since June, according to a separate report from Challenger, Gray and Christmas, the placement company. That still left lay-off announcements 12.6 per cent above their level of a year ago, however.The biggest pullback in cuts came in the financial and government sectors, the report said. That was unsurprising following September’s report, in which the majority of cuts were attributable to the US Army’s five-year troop reduction plan and the announcement of 30,000 cuts at Bank of America.“Job cuts in government and financial services dropped significantly last month, but the two sectors are not out of the woods, by any means. Most of the government cuts this year were at the state level. We have yet to see the full impact of mandated federal spending cuts. Anticipated cuts at the US Post Office alone could result in more than 200,000 job cuts,” said John Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray and Christmas.
41;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2011-10-28T15:40:03Z;Local initiatives: Cities take big steps to trim carbon footprints;George Cole finds that innovations are saving money and helping the environment;"Cities are embracing green technologies that not only make them cleaner and greener, but can reduce costs and drive economic growth.“Going green helps the environment and can save cities money,” says Roger Kemp, a consultant on city planning and development.Here is a selection of schemes from three continents:● Carbon managementVancouver has the smallest carbon footprint of any big city in North America, even though its population has grown by 27 per cent since 1990.The city on Canada’s Pacific coast is embracing energy-efficient buildings and a district energy system that uses the waste heat produced from sewage. It is also rolling out a network of charge stations to encourage the take-up of electric vehicles.Sadhu Johnston, Vancouver’s deputy city manager, says: “More than 90 per cent of jobs are in small businesses, and that’s a great opportunity to work with the entrepreneurial community that is developing green technologies. Green jobs are growing faster than conventional jobs globally.”Copenhagen aims to become the world’s first carbon-neutral capital by 2025 and has developed a Copenhagen Climate Plan that includes 50 initiatives for achieving this target. These include building energy-efficient buildings, developing an infrastructure for electric and hydrogen powered vehicles, and using biomass to replace coal at a power station.Deutsche Telekom is working on a smart grid project with the energy service provider, ABB, that could see German households generating electricity from solar power installations and feeding any spare energy into the grid.Palo Alto in California is using carbon management software developed by California-based Hara that makes it possible to monitor and manage the city’s carbon footprint.“Armed with good information, people tend to make better decisions,” says Daniel Leff, chief executive of Hara, whose software helped Palo Alto save more than $500,000 on energy costs in the first year.● Green vehiclesIn London, a citywide electric charge point network for electric cars aims to have at least 1,300 charge points across the city by 2013.The UK capital has also invested in a fleet of buses that use hydrogen fuel cell technology, which emits water vapour as waste.In December, car drivers in France will be able to use an electric car hire service, Autolib, operated by Bolloré Group on behalf of Paris and more than 40 associated cities.Autolib uses the BlueCar, an electric bubble car developed by Bolloré, and the aim is to have 1,100 hire stations and 3,000 BlueCars across Paris, which could replace 22,500 privately owned cars on the road; reducing carbon emissions.● Heat and power generationAéroports de Paris (ADP) is using a geothermal power heating system for Orly airport.Paris sits on a huge well of steaming hot water and some of this is being piped up and used to help heat the airport’s terminals. ADP says the process will eventually cover a third of the airport’s heating requirements and reduce carbon emissions by around 9,000 tonnes a year.The UK company Pavegen Systems is installing special floor tiles at the Westfield Stratford City shopping centre in east London. The tiles, which convert pedestrians’ kinetic energy into electricity, can be used for lighting, or anything else that requires power.“The tiles could even provide half the lighting in a Tube station from footfall,” says Laurence Kemball-Cook, Pavegen’s chief executive.● Development projectsIn Japan, Panasonic is working with eight companies on a smart city project called Fujisawa Sustainable Smart Town.Fujisawa, which is about 50km west of Tokyo, is planned to open in 2014, and will include a series of solar power generation systems and household storage battery systems across the town.Stockholm Royal Seaport proposes to convert an industrial area in eastern Stockholm into a sustainable environment for residential and business use. When completed in 2030, it will have 11,000 homes and 30,000 work spaces.Its infrastructure will include energy-efficient buildings, waste, water and energy recycling systems, and smart grid technology.Agneta Persson, director of energy at WSP Group, a consultancy company that is helping to develop Stockholm Royal Seaport, says: “The key to success is integrated planning, and bringing together the different disciplines – such as building designers, city planners and public transport companies.”"
42;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2011-10-06T13:23:32Z;Initial US jobless claims stabilise;;US jobless claims rose modestly to 401,000 last week, hovering near the level considered indicative of an improving labour market.Initial claims for unemployment insurance were up 6,000 in the week ending October 1 from an upwardly revised 395,000 the previous week, the labour department said. Economists polled by Bloomberg had expected claims to rise more sharply to 410,000. The 400,000 level is seen by analysts as a sign companies may be slowing the pace of job cuts.The four-week moving average of claims, a more stable measure of the trend, dipped 4,000 to 414,000, the lowest level since late August.The fact that the trend of job losses is moving lower, despite last week’s rise, “is suggestive that US employers are in hiring freeze mode rather than full-blown cost-cutting mode”, said Jill Brown, vice-president of economics at Credit Suisse. “That’s what we think the flavour of tomorrow’s payroll report will be too.”Thursday’s data came ahead of the government’s closely watched monthly employment report due on Friday. Consensus estimates predict the US economy added 59,000 new jobs in September, following a disappointing flat reading in August, and that the unemployment rate will remain at 9.1 per cent.On Wednesday, a report from payrolls processor ADP showed the private sector added 91,000 new positions in September, beating forecasts. But a separate survey from Challenger, Gray and Christmas said planned job cuts surged to a two-year high, led by steep losses by Bank of America and the US army.The labour department report also showed continuing claims for insurance fell by 52,000 to 3.7m in the week ending September 24, while emergency claims were 9,188 lower at 3.03m.Initial claims fell the most in Pennsylvania, New York and Georgia, while Michigan, Alabama and Oregon reported the highest increases. The labour department said there were no special factors affecting last week’s report.
43;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2011-10-05T18:02:59Z;US companies add 91,000 jobs;;Planned lay-offs in the US surged to a two-year high as Bank of America and the US military announced heavy cuts, while companies continued to hire workers at a modest pace in September.The private sector added 91,000 jobs last month, beating forecasts of 75,000 new positions, according to a report from ADP, the payroll processor. The pace was “virtually identical” to the 89,000 jobs added in August and showed “modest job creation”, said Gary Butler, ADP chief executive.The report was “positive because it’s not negative but it’s not doing a lot for growth,” said Steve Blitz, senior economist at ITG Investment Research. “The economy downshifted in the second quarter from second gear to first gear and it’s just been revving in first gear. There’s no true sign of deceleration but no sign of acceleration either.”But lay-offs surged last month to the highest level in more than two years, according to a separate report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the placement company.Employers said in September they would cut 115,730 jobs, compared with 51,114 in August and 37,151 a year ago. The surge left the total number of redundancies announced in the third quarter at 233,258, more than double the level of the second quarter and the highest since 2009.Seventy per cent of last month’s cuts came from two employers: the US government, led by the Army’s five-year troop reduction plan, and Bank of America, which announced 30,000 lay-offs. as part of a restructuring plan.While “neither of these cuts is directly related to recent softness in the economy . . . both could definitely be a sign of more cuts to come,” warned John Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas.“Bank of America is not the only bank still struggling in the wake of the housing collapse and the military cutbacks are probably just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to federal spending cuts and lay-offs.”Job creation has been sluggish in recent months, with net job creation coming in at zero in August, as government cuts offset a feeble 17,000 new private sector positions. That tally was affected by a strike at Verizon Communications that has since been resolved. The return of thousands of striking workers is likely to boost the September figures, said John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros, analysts at RDQ Economics.Economists expect a net gain of 60,000 jobs in September when the labour department announces its monthly report on Friday. The estimate for private sector job creation is 90,000, in line with the ADP figures.Wednesday’s ADP report showed job growth was led by small and medium-sized businesses, while companies employing more than 499 people shed 5,000 jobs. The services sector created 90,000 positions, while goods producers added just 1,000 jobs.“If you look at where the growth in the economy is coming from, it’s only been in the real goods sector, and the services sector is only growing on the tail of the real goods sector,” Mr Blitz noted. He said the divergence between the sectors in the ADP figures may reflect a lag as industrial growth at the end of last year and early this year has generated momentum in services.A separate report on Wednesday from the Institute for Supply Management said the service sector expanded in September but at a slower pace. Its non-manufacturing index fell to 53 from 53.3 the previous month. Readings above 50 indicate expansion in the sector.“Respondents’ comments reflect an uncertainty about future business conditions and the direction of the economy,” said Anthony Nieves, chairman of the ISM’s survey committee.While business activity and new orders accelerated in September, the survey’s employment measure swung from expansion to contraction for the first time since August 2010.“It appears everyone is waiting to see what happens next. [There is] no trust in the economy or the federal government to do what is needed,” said one respondent.
44;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2011-09-02T02:47:22Z;Asia retreats ahead of key US jobs data;;Friday 08:10 BST. European stock markets continued to slide in initial trading, following Asian stock markets lower, after poor eurozone manufacturing data overshadowed better than expected US industrial data, and as nerves crept in ahead of key US jobs data.Germany’s Dax index was the worst performer in initial trading, slumping 1.7 per cent. Italy’s FTSE MIB index plunged 1.3 per cent on opening, followed by Spain’s Ibex and France’s Cac gauges, which both shed 1.2 per cent. The FTSE 100 fell 09 per cent on opening. The overall FTSE Eurofirst index shed 1 per cent, after climbing for four days.The MSCI Asia Pacific index snapped a six-day advance to drop 0.9 per cent, and Japan’s Nikkei fell 1.2 per cent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 index dropped 1.5 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng lost 1.4 per cent.Investors moved to lock in profits ahead of August US non-farm payrolls figures due out later on Friday. “The release of the US employment report comes at a particularly crucial moment, with macro indicators continuing to weaken and market worries about the ability of politicians to address the problems facing their economies as high as ever,” strategists at Barclays Capital said.Fears for the employment report are gathering steam. Goldman Sachs has pared its forecast from 50,000 jobs added to just 25,000, well below the market consensus of 68,000. Though the ADP survey of private payrolls on Wednesday showed a jump of 90,000 jobs, and jobless claims fell, some economists are pointing to temporary effects, such as the Verizon workers’ strike, as driving the improvement.The reversal in risk appetite caused most government bond yields to rally in Europe, as investors returned to safer assets. German 10-year bund yields narrowed 3bps to 2.10 per centIn Asia, technology companies and automakers were among the biggest losers, dragged down by concerns about the global economic recovery. Falling US sales weighed on Japanese automakers, which are suffering from the yen’s strength, but South Korean automakers were higher on the back of robust US sales .Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index declined as banks mirrored losses in their US peers overnight. Mainland lenders on the Shanghai exchange were also weighed down by concerns Beijing is likely to maintain its tightening policies in the face of high inflation. Some investors already looking ahead to August inflation figures due out next week. In Sydney, mining giants lost ground after a fall in metal prices.In currency markets, the yen was a touch stronger at Y76.78 per US dollar from Y76.91 late in New York. The Swiss franc, a favourite safe haven of investors, rallied 1.4 per cent to 1.11 against the euro, which is coming under pressure from the continent’s sovereign debt crisis.“The softness of European data, plentiful headlines about the parlous state of Greek finances and the likelihood that Greece will get its next tranche of aid, with a ticking off, and with considerable resistance and concern from some of the conservative European nations, continues to eat away at the euro,”Kit Juckes, an analyst at Societe Generale, wrote in a note.In commodities markets, gold rose to $1,836 an ounce as investors, while oil inched down to below $89 a barrel on economic concerns. Copper prices also dropped on concerns that manufacturing activity in Asia and Europe is coming under pressure.In overnight trading, a better-than-hoped-for industrial survey in the US failed to lift sentiment as disappointing figures on manufacturing in Europe and Asia helped put an end to a three-day rally in global equities. Other markets switched to “risk off” as well, with Treasuries and gold rallying and the euro remaining weaker.The CBOE Volatility index also continues to stubbornly hover above 30, despite the recent rally in US stocks, which indicates that investors still fear that the recovery can quickly come undone.
45;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2011-08-29T17:07:36Z;Sovereign spreads challenging cherished notions;Seventy large US companies now considered better credit bet than state;"A few years ago, I pointed out in a column that the cost of insuring the US government against a default in the credit derivatives market, had risen above that of McDonalds, the US fast food company, for the first time.Back then, in 2008, it seemed a shocking development. After all, Western finance has traditionally assumed that governments were the safest entities in the markets; indeed the yield on US Treasuries was considered the “risk free” benchmark. Thus paying more to insure loans to Uncle Sam than those to Ronald McDonald (or any other company) seemed distinctly bizarre.No longer. At the end of last week, trading in the credit derivatives markets implied that no less than 70 large US companies are now considered a better credit bet than the American government, according to Markit data. More specifically, the cost of insuring US government bonds against default for five years is currently trading around 50 basis points (meaning it costs $50,000 a year to insure against default for $10m of bonds), while the cost is less than 30bp for companies such as AT&T, New Cingular Wireless and Oracle. The spread for Google, HP, Coca Cola – and, yes, McDonald’s – is also well below the sovereign spread.And this is not just an American pattern: the credit default swap spreads for Telefonica and Iberdrola in Spain, for example, are also now well below that of their government. The idea that large companies are safer than governments, in other words, is no longer such a bizarre aberration in the derivatives world; on the contrary, it is almost accepted.Now some people might argue that this simply shows the danger of relying on CDS as a credit guide. After all, the market for many CDS contracts is thin. Thus prices can be erratic. Indeed, Creditsights, an industry newsletter, reckons that at present only eight US CDS contracts currently have net notional values in the market of more than $5bn, and just 27 more than $2bn.However, the CDS world is not the only place where the relative safety of companies and governments is changing. When Standard & Poor’s, the US rating agency, removed the AAA rating from US sovereign debt two weeks ago, for example, it left the AAA rating for four US companies unchanged. Thus Automatic Data Processing, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft are now rated higher than their own government – a pattern that used to be largely seen just in emerging markets.And if you dig into the reasons why those CDS rankings have changed – or why S&P left those four American companies rated above the government – it reveals some fascinating longer-term structural shifts. One way to read this trend is that it presents a verdict on relative levels of corporate governance, and transparency. More specifically, the reason why so many large companies command tight CDS spreads is that investors feel confident that they understand their balance sheets, and that these entities have plenty of cash on hand, and tangible, easily tracked revenues.Sadly, however, many public entities currently lack that sense of transparency; on the contrary, it is painfully hard to disentangle where the liabilities and tangible assets lie. Hence the high(ish) level of CDS spreads for US Treasuries: although investors know that America is highly unlikely to default on its bonds, the political climate is so volatile that it is hard to predict cash flows. However, a second factor is the issue of globalisation. Most of America’s best-run and healthiest companies these days are not really “American” anymore; on the contrary, they draw a growing proportion of their revenues from outside America’s shores, and hold vast pots of cash overseas.That gives them the ability to hedge themselves against an American, or Western, economic downturn; or, to put it another way, they can flee, with their cash if economic or political circumstances turn sour. So can many “European” companies; just look, for example, at the global nature of “Greek” shipping lines, or those “Irish” information technology groups. However, that option is not open to public sector entities; for better or worse, their credit risk is tethered to the West.Now, this swing may yet turn out to be temporary. And it should be noted it has not really affected actual funding costs yet: irrespective of CDS prices, the US government is still able to borrow money in the bond markets more cheaply than large American companies, including the 70 which now have tighter spreads. But, if nothing else, that 70-strong list shows again the degree to which the fall-out from the financial crisis is challenging some cherished 20th century ideas in finance. Investors should take note. Not to mention Western politicians.The writer is the FT’s US managing editorgillian.tett@ft.com"
46;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2011-08-03T15:26:26Z;US job creation slows and redundancies soar;;The US private sector added jobs for the 19th straight month in July but growth remained below the level needed for a steady recovery in the struggling labour market, while planned lay-offs jumped to a 16-month high, adding to worries over the health of world’s largest economy.Wednesday’s employment report from ADP, the payroll processor, showed job creation slowed to 114,000 new positions last month from June’s downwardly revised 145,000. The July increase was slightly ahead of expectations of 100,000 and in line with estimates for the private sector component of Friday’s government non-farm payrolls report.“While the ADP has stopped the rot in the run of recent data it still is very far from providing us with any comfort about the outlook for the labour market,” said David Semmens, US economist at Standard Chartered.“Today’s report shows modest job creation for the month of July at a rate of half what is needed for meaningful employment and economic recovery,” said Gary Butler, ADP chief executive.A separate report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the placement company, added to the gloomy labour picture with the news that the number of announced lay-offs at US companies surged 60 per cent in July to 66,414, a 16-month high. Lay-offs were concentrated at large firms, with cuts at Merck, Borders, Cisco Systems, Lockheed Martin and Boston Scientific accounting for more than half the total.“July marks the third consecutive increase we have seen in monthly job-cut announcements, which certainly seems to provide additional evidence that the recovery has stalled,” said John Challenger, chief executive of Challenger, Gray & Christmas.The labour market has been mired at anaemic levels through the recovery, with the unemployment rate stuck at 9.2 per cent two years after the official end of the recession. Friday’s labour department report is expected to show the economy added 85,000 jobs in July following June’s nine-month low of 18,000.Lacklustre gross domestic product growth figures released last week confirmed fears that the “soft patch” seen in the spring was in fact a broader and more prolonged slowing of the economy, raising the spectre of stagnation and even double-dip recession.“The slowdown in employment makes more sense in light of last week’s revised GDP numbers showing the economy grew slower late last year and this year than initially reported,” said Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, which produces the ADP report.ADP’s figures showed the service sector added 121,000 jobs last month, led by professional services and education and healthcare, while construction employment fell 11,000. The goods-producing sector shed 7,000 positions. Manufacturing employment fell by 1,000, a small decrease but a worrying sign for the industry that has been a powerhouse through much of the recovery.Small and medium-sized businesses were the biggest contributors to job growth, with companies employing less than 50 people adding 58,000 jobs and those employing 50 to 500 people hiring 47,000 new workers. Companies with more than 500 workers added 9,000 positions.However, some economists warned against reading too much into the report as a signal for the labour department reading.“ADP employment provided a misleading signal on payrolls for June, which may result in lower than the usual market sensitivity to this report,” said John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros of RDQ Economics. They noted that ADP originally showed a 157,000 rise in private sector employment in June, while the government report found companies had added just 57,000 positions.Meanwhile, growth in the US service sector slowed to the lowest level since February 2010 in July, according to the Institute for Supply Management. The non-manufacturing index fell to 52.7 last month from 53.3 in June, missing expectations of a slight rise to 53.5. Readings above 50 signal expansion.
47;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2011-07-31T14:54:34Z;Economic Outlook: Investors look to US job creation;;Financial markets will be hoping for a marked improvement in the rate of job creation in the US in July following two months of disappointment.The US labour market has developed a troublesome soft patch, which, alongside sovereign debt concerns, has not proved the best environment for investors.July nonfarm payrolls on Friday are expected to show a vast improvement on the paltry 18,000 jobs created in June– and hopefully more than double the 54,000 added in May. The average forecast of 100,000, however, still falls a long way short of the gains seen between February and April, when the economic recovery appeared to be gaining momentum.The ADP report on private sector jobs growth, which precedes the NFP report by a couple of days, has given some indication of the shortfall in public sector employment. The ADP survey for July is forecast to show a rise of 125,000 private sector jobs.“The government sector remains a big drag on employment,” says Madhur Jha at HSBC. “But we look for modest gains spread out across various industries including construction, manufacturing, retail and professional services.”Although there are monetary policy decisions by three central banks this week, none are expected to alter interest rates.First up is the Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday, which is seen holding at 4.75 per cent given stalling consumer confidence and the strong local dollar. Investors will be looking for clues as to the next move, however, given persistently high inflation.On Thursday, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank are expected to hold at 0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively.The UK bank is likely to continue to stress the even balance between upside and downside risks to inflation.The ECB, having lifted its main rate in July, will stand pat, but bank president Jean-Claude Trichet is likely to face tough questions in the press conference on the Greek bail-out.Much attention will be paid to this week’s raft of purchasing manager data. Manufacturing surveys from the UK, eurozone and US on Monday are all expected to show flat or easing activity.The UK manufacturing sector now appears vulnerable after the PMI eased to 51.3 in June. Any reading below 50 indicates activity is contracting. Economists expect the index to ease to 51 in July. Services PMI from all three follow on Wednesday and similar softness is expected. Industrial production by the eurozone’s German engine room will be closely watched on Friday, given the production declines reported by car manufacturers in June.“Hopes that the region’s largest economy might support the periphery and shield the eurozone as a whole from a marked economic slowdown are likely to be misplaced,” says Jennifer McKeown at Capital Economics.
48;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Leading four companies rate better than US;;The world’s largest and most liquid bond market is in danger of losing its coveted “risk free” status. As negotiations over the US debt ceiling make slow progress, fears are mounting that rating agencies will soon drop the US’s triple A rating.Yet, against this deteriorating picture, the fortunes of four of the country’s biggest companies remain robust. While Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s have placed the US on watch for a downgrade, both agencies have affirmed the triple A ratings of Exxon Mobil, Automatic Data Processing (ADP), Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft.In contrast with the debt-laden US government, these four companies are effectively being judged as safer long-term holdings by the rating agencies. This is in spite of the US having the power to raise taxes and implement laws that could hurt the prospects of companies.“It’s a new world in that these companies have transcended the national and political boundaries,” says Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.Even some US states appear to be on a sounder footing. Moody’s only put five of the 15 states it rates triple A on review for downgrade due to their high exposure to federal employment or federal transfers.So, in global markets where the reserve currency status of the US and its vast and deeply liquid bond market have been a haven in times of stress, investors may soon have to choose whether top rated companies are a safer place for their money.“There is the argument that no entity can be higher rated than that of their home country’s sovereign credit,” says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. “But there is a certain dimension that makes large mega-cap companies very attractive.”Currently, the cost of buying insurance for one-, and even five-years against the risk of the US defaulting in the credit derivatives market has risen above premiums being asked for Exxon, Microsoft and J&J. For the US, the higher risk of a default is being flagged by one-year insurance premiums rising well above the cost for five years. CDS is a thinly traded market for sovereigns, but is deeper for corporate credit.“These companies source, hire and fund themselves globally and the reach of government tax policy can only go so far. If push comes to shove mega-cap companies can relocate outside the US,” he adds.The divergent outlook between the US and these four companies highlights how a more globalised world and the financial crisis have altered the balance between the government and private sectors.While governments stepped into the breach left by the financial crisis, backed the banking system and enacted massive fiscal stimulus for the economy, companies battened the hatches, cut spending and conserved cash.“Economic boundaries are becoming more important than political ones. I can understand where they [rating agencies] are coming from as these are geopolitical global companies,” adds Mr Paulsen.Choosing a triple A rated company over sovereign debt, however, is complicated by the fact that a top rated company, by definition, has strong cash flows and little outstanding debt, meaning highly rated companies can never hope to compete with the size and liquidity of the US Treasury market. Moody’s says the four triple A rated US companies have just $45bn in total public debt.For now, US triple A corporate bonds are still trading at yields above those of benchmark Treasuries, investors say. That is partly because the liquidity of the US Treasury market, along with its triple A ratings, attracts big buyers like central banks and is therefore hard to replicate elsewhere.“The reason why these US companies are triple A is because they don’t have much debt,” says Jason Brady, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management. “They are not really an alternative to Treasuries.”“It does not mean that they cannot trade [with yields lower than Treasuries] over time. If the financial situation of the US continues to deteriorate, sure they can.”By S&P’s assessments, around the globe, some 107 corporate, local or regional government ratings exceed the rating on the sovereign in the country of domicile. These include the Basque Country which is double A plus, one notch above Spain.In general, there is no hard “cap” on the ratings of issuers, including corporations, financial institutions and local governments, by the rating of the country where they exist, but according to Moody’s, it is unlikely that an issuer can be more than one or two notches higher and those that are typically have special characteristics that insulate their creditworthiness.The four US companies that are rated triple A are all leaders in their businesses, highly profitable and have low leverage, says Dan Gates, a managing director at Moody’s. “Importantly, they also have global revenues, which usually makes a good candidate to be rated above the sovereign rating,” he says. However, Moody’s recently issued J&J with a negative outlook tied to higher leverage resulting from its acquisition strategy, recent product quality issues and slow top-line growth.Another example is Canon, which only gets 20 per cent of its revenue in Japan. Moody’s rates Canon Aa1 versus Japan’s Aa2 ratings.“A lot of people trust companies more than they trust countries,” says Asoka Wöhrmann, chief investment officer at DWS, the German fund manager owned by Deutsche Bank.In the eurozone, the debt crisis has even resulted in the unusual situation where the rates some companies pay to borrow in countries like Spain and Greece have fallen below those paid by their governments.“A corporate bond is certainly better than holding a government right now,” says Rupert Robinson, chief executive of Schroders private bank.
49;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2011-07-14T01:26:00Z;Moody’s places US rating on review;Warning shot over debt ceiling talks;The US may lose its triple A credit rating, after Moody’s warned that the political deadlock over raising the country’s debt ceiling could lead to a downgrade.Moody’s on Wednesday placed the US rating on watch for a possible downgrade, pending a decision in Washington on raising the $14.300bn debt ceiling. Failure to do so by August 2 could result in the US Treasury missing a debt payment.“The review of the US government’s bond rating is prompted by the possibility that the debt limit will not be raised in time to prevent a missed payment of interest or principal on outstanding bonds and notes,” said Moody’s. “As such, there is a small but rising risk of a shortlived default.”Steven Hess, senior credit officer at Moody’s, said: “This review is not any different to what we do with any other debt issuer facing an event that would lead to a downgrade.” He added: “A missed payment will trigger a downgrade. If the debt ceiling is raised, we still look at the outcome of long-term deficit reductions.”Moody’s is the first of the major rating agencies to place the US on notice of possible downgrade. In April, Standard & Poor’s affirmed its triple A rating for the US, but revised the outlook on its long-term rating to negative from stable.Standard & Poor’s has warned that it will slash its US credit rating to D, the lowest level, in the event the debt ceiling is not raised and the country misses a debt payment.Moody’s said an actual default, regardless of duration, would fundamentally alter the agency’s assessment of the timeliness of future payments, and a triple A rating would likely no longer be appropriate. They would likely assign a rating in the double A range.In April 1979, the US Treasury experienced a short-term default due to technical problems that sent Treasury bill yields 30 basis points higher to 60 bps. Treasury resumed debt servicing and investors recovered the lost interest on the interest payment owed.There was a shortlived reaction across markets late in New York on Wednesday as Treasury yields, the dollar and equity futures were briefly sold off in thin after-hours trading. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose 3 basis points to 2.91 per cent, before retreating to 2.88 per cent. S&P 500 September futures dropped 0.8 per cent to 1,303. The dollar index slipped 0.3 per cent. Gold was steady at $1,582 an ounce, after hitting a record high $1,587 earlier on Wednesday.“This particular announcement I don’t think has significantly dented the credibility of the US, but every day that brings us closer to August 2 without a deal, there is an increased chance that the market loses its patience,” said Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of US fixed income strategy at Barclays Capital.Moody’s “also placed on review for possible downgrade securities either guaranteed by, backed by collateral securities issued by, or otherwise directly linked to the US government or the affected financial institutions”. It said this review could affect the triple A ratings on some $130bn of municipal debt as well as issues by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Farm Credit Banks.The rating agency said it will determine over the next several weeks the “vulnerability” of other triple A rated municipal credits to the credit of the US government.By way of contrast, in a separate announcement, Moody’s affirmed the triple A ratings of US companies ADP, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft.“Each of the companies exhibits characteristics, to varying degrees, that could enable its Aaa long-term rating to be sustained as much as two-three notches above the US government’s rating,” said Moody’s.Moody’s said a US default would likely be shortlived and the expected loss to holders of Treasury bonds would be minimal or non-existent.Alan Levenson, chief economist at T Rowe Price said: “The event of a US default, technical or not, would entail an immediate 40 per cent reduction in federal government outlays, equal to nearly 10 per cent of gross domestic product, a massive adverse shock to aggregate demand.”Last month, analysts at S&P Valuation and Risk Strategies, a research team separate from the agency, estimated that investors in the US government bond market could face losses of up to $100bn if the largest economy loses its triple A rating. They also said that a ratings downgrade resulting in higher bond yields and lower prices could also mean the US Treasury paying $2.3bn-$3.75bn a year more in interest on financing a $1,000bn annual budget deficit.Municipal issuers that have an above average level of exposure to the US government, for example through strong dependence on federal money for Medicaid, the healthcare programme for the poor, will be placed on review for downgrade.Issuers with a low reliance on direct or indirect money transfers from the federal government or a low dependence on the capital markets for liquidity would not be affected.“In the event of an actual downgrade of the US government bond rating, these credits could be rated one or perhaps two notches higher than the US government’s rating,” Moody’s said.
50;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
51;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2011-07-08T21:16:38Z;Wall St tumbles on disappointing jobs data;;Financial stocks led the way down in the final session of a choppy week on Wall Street as weaker-than-expected employment numbers dashed hopes that the “soft patch” in the US economy was coming to an end.The S&P financial index was down 1.3 per cent at the close, but the energy, industrial and technology sectors were not far behind as investors dumped riskier assets after the disappointing employment data.BB&T suffered the most in the financial sector, losing 3.3 per cent to $26.09. Bank of America was down 1.9 per cent to $10.71, despite news that it had reached a deal to sell its Balboa Life Insurance unit to Securian Financial, a US provider of insurance and retirement plans.In the wider market, the S&P 500 index was down 0.7 per cent at 1,343.81, although the measure was still up 0.3 per cent over the week.The losses were prompted by news that the US economy had added only 18,000 jobs in June, which was well below the 105,000 expected by economists.“This is terribly disappointing news,” said Brett Hammond, senior economist at TIAA-CREF Asset Management. “It is easy for the markets to shrug off one month of bad data, but this is two months in a row now,” he said.The negative reaction to the data were particularly acute due to strong ADP employment numbers in the previous session, which had raised hopes that Friday’s data would be strong.The ADP report showed that 157,000 private jobs had been created in June, ahead of the 95,000 expected, causing many analysts to revise upwards their expectations for the official number.This raising and then dashing of hopes left cyclical stocks sharply lower in the session after gaining on Thursday.In the industrial space, Caterpillar was down 1.1 per cent to $110.41 despite news that China’s regulator had approved its acquisition of mining equipment firm, Bucyrus International.Elsewhere, Cummins was down 1.9 per cent at $106.77 while the S&P industrial index was 1.2 per cent lower.The worst performing stock on the S&P 500 index was JDS Uniphase, which fell 4.6 per cent to $15.94. The S&P technology index was down 0.5 per cent, paring some of its 9 per cent gain over the past two weeks.The best performing sectors were defensives. The S&P utilities index was down 0.3 per cent while the telecommunications sector fell 0.3 per cent.The Vix volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, was up 1.6 per cent at 16.21.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.5 per cent at 12,657.05, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.5 per cent to 2,859.81. But in spite of these losses, the indices were up 0.6 per cent and 1.6 per cent, respectively, over the week.Before the losses on Friday, the Dow was just 0.7 per cent short of a three-year high and Nasdaq was less than 0.1 cent away from a ten-year peak. These near-records came after two weeks of gains on Wall Street as investors began thinking the recent soft patch in the US – which pushed stocks down more than 7 per cent from the start of May to the middle of June – was finally coming to an end.The ADP employment data on Thursday appeared to strengthen the bullish case, causing a “risk on” trade. Investors were also looking to position themselves for a healthy earnings season, which begins on Monday when Alcoa reports.But the data on Friday left investors wondering if the strong 5.9 per cent rebound in the last two weeks may have been premature.“Hopefully, with supply disruptions related to the Japan earthquake and tsunami fading, and oil prices off their peaks, the labour market will perk up again,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.“If not, it is going to be an uglier second half than most anticipate,” he added.In corporate news this week, News Corp was in focus as the furore over allegations of phone hacking at one of its British newspapers escalated. The stock was down 7.3 per cent at $16.75 over the week, as the paper in question was closed down and some speculated that News Corp’s proposed takeover of BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster, could be in jeopardy.Target, the discount retailer, was one of the best performers this week, adding 6.7 per cent to $51.14 after reporting strong retail sales numbers.

And the uncertain smile came on Thursday as hopes were rekindled that the soft patch may soon be over.The ADP survey of US private sector employment suggested 157,000 jobs were created in June, double the consensus forecast. It followed a better than expected US manufacturing survey, adding to the sense that the country’s economy is not as bad as feared. Backing this view is the copper price move. It has risen $1,236 per tonne from its low eight weeks ago, and now stands at $9,750 – just 4.4 per cent shy of its February high.Still, it is too soon to declare the soft patch over. While the ADP survey has broadly moved in line with the official non-farm payrolls, due on Friday, figures are often way off.In January, for example, the ADP report suggested 190,000 private jobs were created, while the official figures showed just 94,000. The median over- or underestimation has been about 50 per cent since 2003.After the ADP surprise, the official jobs numbers need to show strong job creation, and probably also a fall in the unemployment rate (which stood at 9.1 per cent in May) to avoid disappointing investors. Good figures reinforcing hopes that the soft patch is passing should prompt a further step forward for bullish sentiment, which has left the S&P 500 just 18 points below its recent intraday high of 1,370.But caution is warranted. Important as payroll data are, one month does not a recovery make – particularly since the market typically ignores the margin of error, a whopping 100,000 jobs.

Italy’s UniCredit shed 4.2 per cent to €1.34 and Intesa Sanpaolo lost 2.6 per cent to €1.73. Italy’s FTSE MIB index shed 0.2 per cent to 19,735.63.Overall, the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index climbed 0.4 per cent to 1,123.32, with Portuguese retailer Jerónimo Martins leading, up 4 per cent to €13.93.Further adding to risk appetite, the monthly ADP report on US private sector jobs creation showed a payrolls increase of 157,000 in June. This was seen as an indication of a stronger monthly non-farm payrolls report on Friday.Belgian drug and chemicals group Solvay climbed 3.1 per cent to €111.60 after UBS raised its rating to “buy” from “neutral”.Dia continued to climb, surging through its issue price of €3.40 after falling heavily on its Madrid debut on Tuesday. The discount grocer that was spun off by French supermarket giant Carrefour, jumped 12.3 per cent to €3.65, after rising 1.4 per cent on Wednesday.Shares in Carrefour, which have lost ground in recent sessions due to discounting the value of Dia shares and future profits from the unit, climbed 2.1 per cent to €23.72.
54;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2011-05-04T22:22:00Z;Bank to publish inflation data from internet;;Inflation data harvested from the internet will take its first big step into financial markets on Thursday after a bank agreed to publish real-time price indices developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.State Street will initially publish inflation data for the US, UK, Germany, France and Brazil in a partnership with PriceStats, a spin-off from MIT.The new indices will allow investors to track inflation almost as it happens and may help them to forecast official inflation data, which often move markets, with greater accuracy.Unlike official inflation numbers, which come out monthly with a lag of weeks, the new indices will come out every day with a lag of just three days. A further advantage is that the methodology used for different countries is the same whereas official agencies use different techniques.Roberto Rigobon, an economics professor who set up MIT’s Billion Prices Project’ with colleague Alberto Cavallo, told the Financial Times that a long-term goal is to “change the way that data is collected around the world”.The deal marks another step in the rapid development of real-time information on the economy, using electronic collection of data to produce statistics faster and at lower cost than traditional surveys.The MIT data is collected by automatically scanning retailer websites. By contrast, traditional inflation data is collected by researchers who visit thousands of shops to record prices.There are several other projects to collect economic information electronically or publish it in real time. For example, the payroll processor ADP publishes a monthly jobs index based on its internal data, which on Wednesday reported a 179,000 increase in private payrolls from March to April.Ceridian, another payment processor, publishes an industrial activity index based on credit card payments by truckers to buy fuel. Real estate websites have produced price indices and employment sites have published data on job openings.Google has developed its own Google Price Index based on similar scouring of internet retailers but has not yet published its results.Mr Rigobon said the PriceStats inflation indices are similar to official data in many countries. There are still differences, however, because some goods are not bought online so internet data is unlikely to displace official statistics soon.”We’re collecting information on almost every sector except for the services sector,” said Mr Rigobon.The PriceStats index for the US rose 1.91 per cent from January to March compared with a 1.96 per cent rise in the official consumer price index published by the Bureau of Labour Statistics.But the PriceStats index moved earlier – rising 0.81 per cent in January, before the official CPI caught up in March.“Our prices seem to move earlier than the official statistics,” Mr Rigobon said. State Street said using this to forecast official data would be an early priority.Mr Rigobon said a likely reason was that online shoppers tend to have higher incomes and are less price sensitive when they are buying. That may mean that online retailers can raise prices earlier than physical shops when they suffer an increase in their own costs.Neither PriceStats nor State Street would comment on the financial terms of the partnership or whether State Street has invested in PriceStats.
55;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Energy leads further Wall Street retreat;;"US indices retreated further from multiyear highs achieved last week after disappointing economic data, softer commodity prices and a number of lacklustre earnings reports.The sharpest falls came from the energy sector, with National Oilwell Varco, the oilfield services company, falling 3.4 per cent to $69.92 and Cameron International losing 4.1 per cent to $48.70.ExxonMobil, the largest company in the world by market capitalisation, was down 0.9 per cent to $84.81 as the oil price fell back. The S&P energy index was off 1.6 per cent.“The fall in commodity prices should eventually be a good thing for the markets but in the meantime it is weighing heavily on the energy and material sectors,” said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service.Energy stocks had led the rally in US equities over the past six months.Since the end of September, the S&P energy index has risen 49 per cent while the broader S&P 500 index is up 28.5 per cent.But this pattern has started to change in the past few weeks, with April the first month in almost a year where energy stocks did not outperform the benchmark S&P 500 index.The S&P energy index is down 1.2 per cent this month.Material stocks also lost ground in the session. Freeport-McMoRan, the largest copper miner in the world by market capitalisation, fell 3.9 per cent to $51.14 while Cliff Natural Resources lost 4.1 per cent to $87.55. The S&P materials sector was down 1.7 per cent.These losses left the S&P 500 index down 0.7 per cent to 1,347.32 at the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was also 0.7 per cent softer at 12,723.12, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.5 per cent to 2,828.23.Weak economic data weighed on sentiment across the wider markets, leaving all of the major S&P sectoral indices trading lower.The biggest disappointment was over the ISM non-manufacturing composite index, which plunged to 52.8 in April from 57.3 the previous month in a worrying sign of the rate of growth in the US services sector. However, a reading above 50 still indicates expansion.Separately, employment data from Automatic Data Processing estimated that the private sector had added 179,000 jobs in April, below the 200,000 economists had expected. The ADP data is significant as it is the first in a slew of crucial employment numbers to be released this week.The big event will be on Friday, when the official, monthly non-farm payroll numbers are set to be released, but before that there are the weekly numbers on Thursday.Some weak earnings results also kept market sentiment lower. Las Vegas Sands fell 7.4 per cent to $42.50 after the casino resort operator missed analysts’ earnings and revenue forecasts.Elsewhere, Kellogg, the cereal company, reported a 12 per cent drop in earnings and slimmer gross margins for the first quarter, sending its shares down 1.2 per cent to $56.78. Investors reacted negatively to the news as the maker of Rice Krispies and Pop-Tarts became the latest in a long line of companies to feel rising commodity costs.Last week, Procter & Gamble said it had underestimated commodity inflation in “a very difficult operating environment”.Kimberly-Clark and Nike have also reported weaker results this season thanks to higher commodity prices.In deal news, Applied Materials, the US semiconductor equipment maker, announced plans to buy rival Varian Semiconductor in a $4.9bn cash deal. The news sent shares in Varian up 51.3 per cent to $61.36, while Applied Materials lost 1 per cent to $15.09.Elsewhere, ConAgra Foods announced it had made a $4.9bn cash offer to acquireRalcorp, the cereal maker, in a deal that would make ConAgra the third-largest US packaged foods company by revenues.This sent shares in Ralcorp up 4.9 per cent to $87.39 while ConAgra Foods added 3.1 per cent to $25.51.Renren, China’s leading real-name social networking service, saw its shares surge 28.6 per cent to $18.01 on its trading debut in New York.The Beijing-based company, which is unlisted in China, had priced its initial public offering at $14 per share to raise $743m, at the top of its projected range
of $12-$14."
56;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2011-04-28T18:52:49Z;Banks braced for knock-on from credit downgrades;;"Reduced confidence in the creditworthiness of developed economies’ government finances has caused significant knock-on downgrades of the debt of banks and other companies in the countries concerned.Standard & Poor’s, the rating agency which is taking a particularly bearish stance on sovereign risks and recently lowered the ratings outlook of Japan and the US to negative, says $8,400bn worth of debt was downgraded in the first quarter of 2011, versus just $367bn worth of upgrades.An important cause of this deteriorating credit picture – which follows a period of more upgrades than downgrades at the end of 2010 – has been the growing incidence of cuts in sovereign ratings. Often, the impact of such downgrades does not end with the debt issued by the government in question; the ratings of banks and other entities that rely on some kind of government support also face the knife.“There are multiple ways in which even strong banks find their fates to be intertwined with their sovereigns,” says Matt King, global head of credit strategy at Citigroup. “It is much harder for financial institutions to maintain a credit quality which is better than their parent sovereign than it is for non-financials.”In the first quarter of 2011, 17 sovereign issuers were downgraded by S&P and 40 corporate issuers, including banks, also had their ratings lowered.Diane Vazza, analyst at S&P, says the links between sovereign and bank ratings are nothing new. What is different is that so many sovereign ratings are under pressure in so many parts of the world, she says.In addition, the boom in global debt issuance means there is a lot more debt to downgrade in the first place. In the first quarter, downgrades followed sovereign rating cuts in eight countries. The most were in Portugal, where 17 ratings were cut after a downgrade of the country’s debt rating.The links between sovereign ratings and the financial strength of financial institutions stem from three factors, according to Mr King.First, banks are usually big holders of the debt sold by their home countries. Losses on sovereign debt would weaken the capital base of the banks owning it.Second, banks rely on debt markets much more than most non-financial companies do. Shaky investor sentiment, and resultant higher borrowing costs, can hurt banks needing to refinance maturing debt.Third, weak sovereign ratings often coincide with a weak economy. “That can also knock banks because of exposure in their loan and mortgage portfolios,” says Mr King.The country whose rating backs the most debt is the US. S&P’s decision to change its outlook on the debt of the US to negative means that there is now a one-in-three chance the US will be downgraded in the next two years.A US downgrade to below triple A would not affect S&P’s rating of the four US companies with triple A ratings: ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson, Microsoft and ADP. S&P also does not tie its US state and local government ratings directly to the US rating because they have the power to raise taxes and cut expenditures independently.But the potential ripple effects of a US downgrade would be widespread.In tandem with its move on the US, S&P revised its outlooks on the debt of government-backed mortgage financiers Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Federal Home Loan Bank System and the Farm Credit System Banks to negative. The US government took over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008 and guarantees their debts.“Given how closely intertwined they are, it does not make sense for them to be rated higher than the US government,” said Matt Albrecht, an analyst at S&P.Outlooks on three US clearing houses and one central securities depository also were revised to negative because of their “role supporting the infrastructures of the US financial system” and correlation with the economic stability of their home market.Because their business and assets are highly concentrated in the US, S&P also changed the outlook on five US insurers that carry triple A ratings.Any US downgrade is still some way away and may be avoided altogether. However, recent experience has already highlighted the broad effects of other sovereign downgrades. “The rise in public indebtedness remains a serious threat to economies and [to] financial markets,” says Jan Loeys at JPMorgan. “The warning should not be forgotten.”"
57;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2011-03-30T21:00:57Z;Wall Street stocks boosted by jobs data;;Deal news helped to lift the pharmaceutical sector on Wall Street while the wider markets were buoyed by promising employment data ahead of the big monthly payroll report on Friday.Valeant, an acquisitive speciality pharmaceutical company, said it was making a $5.7bn hostile offer for Cephalon, another drugmaker.The news sent shares in Valeant up 12.8 per cent to $50.08, while Cephalon jumped 28.4 per cent to $75.44, the biggest gainer on the S&P 500 index. The $73-a-share cash proposal, which represents a 29 per cent premium to where the shares have traded over the past month, comes after Valeant tried and failed to engage Cephalon’s management and board in takeover discussions.Elsewhere in the sector Merck was up 1.6 per cent to $33.30 while Forest Laboratories rose 4.3 per cent to $32.48. The S&P healthcare index was up 0.7 per cent.In the wider markets the S&P 500 was up 0.7 per cent to 1,328.26 after the ADP National Employment Report estimated that private non-farm employment had risen by 201,000 in March.The figure was broadly in line with expectations, but kept traders’ hopes alive for a strong official employment number on Friday. This was the fourth month where the ADP figure showed about 200,000 jobs being added, compared with the previous four months where the average was 74,000.“In short, there has been a clear and sustained acceleration in private payroll gains,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.The S&P 500 has bounced back 5.7 per cent in the past two weeks as traders have turned their attention to the US domestic economic recovery and away from global tensions.The Vix index, a measure of expected volatility in the marketplace, fell 3.2 per cent in the session to 17.6, falling below 18 points for the first time since the tensions began in Middle East and north Africa in the middle of February.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.5 per cent to 12,350.23 while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.7 per cent to 2,776.79.Financial stocks gained ground in the session, led by Visa and MasterCard, following speculation that US curbs on debit card fees will be delayed or modified.Visa was up 2.8 per cent to $74.23 while MasterCard added 0.8 per cent to $253.66 in reaction to comments from Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, in the previous session that the central bank would not meet an April 21 deadline to come up with a final rule on debit card transaction fees.Jon Tester, Democratic senator, is also pushing for a chamber vote on a bill that could delay the cap by two years.Elsewhere in financials, Goldman Sachs was up 0.4 per cent to $159.07 while JPMorgan Chase added 0.9 per cent to $46.45. The S&P financial sector put on 0.7 per cent.Among telecoms, AT&T rose 2.2 per cent to $30.71 after Randall Stephenson, the chief executive officer, struck an upbeat note, saying that the company’s takeover of T-Mobile USA would boost network capacity and improve service for devices such as the iPhone. He also said that he expected some divestiture before the deal was allowed to go ahead by the regulators.Shares in AT&T are up 9.9 per cent since the $39bn deal, which would create the largest wireless carrier in the US, was announced early last week.These gains helped lift the S&P telecoms index 1.4 per cent in the session with Verizon Communications also gaining ground, up 0.4 per cent to $38.46.Among the individual stocks in focus BlackRock, the world’s largest listed investment manager by assets, gained 6.7 per cent to $198.98 on news that the company was replacing Genzyme, the biotech group, in the S&P 500 index.The stock rallied on the expectation that mutual funds and other investment vehicles that track the S&P 500 index will now buy its shares.Qihoo Technology, China’s largest provider of free antivirus software, traded on the New York Stock Exchange for the first time after an initial public offering. The stock rose 135 per cent on its opening day, to $34, more than double its IPO price of $14.50.Oxford Industries, an apparel maker, climbed 33.4 per cent to $33.37 after reporting an 18 per cent rise in its dividend and strong fourth-quarter earnings.Citrix Systems, the software maker, was up 3.1 per cent to $72.24 after Morgan Keegan & Co initiated its coverage of the stock with an “outperform” rating.
58;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2011-03-27T18:27:49Z;Economic Outlook: Test for US non-farms data;;Markets have been losing faith in the US monthly non-farm payrolls survey as a useful economic indicator as sharp falls in the overall unemployment rate have failed to be matched by any big leaps in job creation.The expected rise of 190,000 in the March payrolls, following February’s 192,000 gain, would go some way to restoring its reputation, but this would still remain some way short of the 308,000 leap seen in March 2004, one of the biggest increases of recent years.“Initial jobless claims have been trending lower for the past seven months, while the employment indices within the ISM manufacturing and non-manufacturing surveys have both been on a steady uptrend for nearly a year,” says Stephen King, global head of economics at HSBC.“However, an ongoing exodus from the labour force has been an important factor in the falling unemployment rate.”The unemployment rate is expected to remain at 8.9 per cent in March.As usual, the NFP report will be preceded on Wednesday by the ADP survey into private-sector job creation for the same month, in which it is expected about 210,000 new jobs will be reported.The European Central Bank on Thursday receives its final update on consumer prices before its governing council meets on April 7, when it is widely expected to raise its main refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 1.25 per cent. Energy and fuel prices are likely to be the focus as headline eurozone inflation remains above the ECB’s target at an annual 2.4 per cent.Meanwhile, on a data-crowded Friday, the final updates for March’s eurozone purchasing manager surveys of manufacturing are expected to confirm the strong growth indicated in the flash estimates.Purchasing managers in the UK also update on Friday. Manufacturing growth is expected to continue, albeit at a fractionally slower rate than in February.The US Institute for Supply Management is also forecast to show that manufacturing growth eased slightly in March, as previewed in the latest durable goods orders report. This is also likely to be a factor in a similar slowing of growth in the Chicago PMI report on Thursday.Japanese industrial production numbers for February, released on Wednesday, will offer a measure of how this sector of the economy has suffered as a result of the March 11 earthquake. In the last set of pre-quake numbers, production growth is forecast at 3.5 per cent, unchanged from January’s reading.The final reading of the UK’s fourth-quarter gross domestic product is not expected to contain revisions, but then nor was the second reading that showed the economy shrank by 0.6 per cent in the quarter, as opposed to the 0.5 per cent flash estimate.
59;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2011-03-02T21:36:48Z;US stocks rebound in late trading;;"Shares in Yahoo rose following unconfirmed reports that the internet search company was in talks to sell or trade its stake in Yahoo Japan, while the broad market rebounded from mid-session losses to close modestly firmer.Yahoo might be looking to exchange its 35 per cent stake in Yahoo Japan and give the majority owner Softbank a stake in the US company, according to a report in the Financial Times citing people familiar with the discussions.Any negotiations however, according to sources, were in the formative stages and the talks could still go nowhere. Yahoo rose 3.3 per cent to $16.63, one of the biggest gainers on the S&P 500.Softbank, which holds a 41 per cent stake in Yahoo Japan, on Wednesday said there was “no truth” to the media reports. Yahoo declined to comment.Other technology stocks were also in focus. Texas Instruments, the second-largest US chipmaker by sales after Intel, gained 3.3 per cent to $36.14 as JPMorgan raised its recommendation on the shares to “overweight” from “neutral”.Another semiconductor company, Xilinx, rallied 5.6 per cent to $34.54 while Altera gained 3 per cent to $42.46. The Philadelphia semiconductor index gained 1.4 per cent while the S&P technology index rose 0.5 per cent, the strongest gainer along with energy of all 10 major S&P indices.That helped stem losses on the S&P 500, which closed up 0.2 per cent to 1,308.44, trimming some of its 1.6 per cent loss in the previous session.The index is still off 2.6 per cent from its mid-February high, because of fears that sustained high oil prices due to political instability in north Africa and the Middle East may
hamper economic growth.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.1 per cent to 12,066.80 in the session while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.4 per cent to 2,748.07.Sentiment was lifted somewhat by the ADP national employment report which suggested that job creation had been strong in February. The report estimated that private non-farm payroll employment had risen by 217,000 last month, ahead of the 180,000 expected by economists.This was a positive leading indicator for the official non-farm payroll figures which will come out on Friday, although the ADP number is not always a successful predictor of these widely watched numbers.“ADP has not exactly covered itself in glory recently in terms of accuracy versus the government data, so we don’t look for any change to the published median forecast of 193,000 for total non-farm payrolls and 200,000 for private payrolls,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Worries over oil prices, which edged up in the session, continued to weigh on sentiment in the wider markets.Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said in the previous session that higher oil prices were “a threat both to economic growth and to overall price stability”.Some economists appeared more worried about the inflationary risk of the higher oil price than the chance of it damaging growth. “I think fears are overblown of a sharp oil-related downturn in global growth. I worry more about the inflationary consequences,” said Joachim Fels, co-head of Morgan Stanley’s global economics team.Las Vegas Sands, the casino resort company which fell 6.3 per cent in the previous session after announcing in its annual report that it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, bounced back slightly, rising 1.2 per cent to $44.24.Some analysts suggested that this might be an opportunity to buy the stock. “We believe this news will have limited fallout given the huge successes that LVS has had in Macau and Singapore and its ability to execute on a true integrated resort,” Citigroup said.Costco Wholesale reported a 16 per cent rise in second-quarter earnings but this failed to impress investors. The stock fell 2.5 per cent to $71.76.Elsewhere in the sector, BJ’s Wholesale Club, a membership-only warehouse retail store, reported an 81 per cent fall in fourth-quarter profits on charges related to store closures. But the company also reported that same-store sales had risen by 5.5 per cent. Its shares rose 2.8 per cent to $49.66.Apple was in focus as it unveiled the second edition of the iPad. Shares rose 0.8 per cent to $352.12."
60;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2011-02-02T22:03:31Z;Mixed earnings weigh on Wall Street;;Wall Street slipped slightly after a mixed batch of earnings reports, but indices stayed close to the 28-month highs reached in the previous session.Whirlpool, the world’s largest appliance maker, reported that its fourth-quarter earnings had missed forecasts, sending shares down 2.1 per cent to $83.60. The company re-ported earnings of $171m or $2.19 a share, falling short of consensus forecasts of $2.26 a share as the high costs of items such as paint and steel ate at margins.Hershey, the confectionery company, also admitted it was struggling with margins given the rising cost of cocoa and sugar, but still managed to deliver fourth-quarter earnings in line with expectations. Shares were up 3.1 per cent to $48.61.The S&P 500 index closed down 0.3 per cent to 1,304.03, keeping above the psychologically significant 1,300 level.The Dow Jones Industrial Average maintained the 12,000 mark, keeping flat at 12,041.97. The Dow closed above 12,000 on Tuesday for the first time since June 2008. The Nasdaq Composite was also flat at 2,750.16.“The markets are taking a little bit of a breather right now as investors try to work out whether there is more to go in this rally. There seems to be equal sentiment on both sides about whether we are due a correction or the bull run will continue,” said Christian Magoon of Magoon Capital, an independent consultancy on exchange traded funds.Investor sentiment was lifted by healthy figures from the ADP employment survey, which estimated that private non-farm payroll employment will have risen by 187,000 in January, ahead of the 140,000 forecast by economists.This prompted some optimism that the non-farm payrolls report to come out on Friday will be strong, but traders were reluctant to become too overjoyed as there is not always a direct correlation between the two figures. ADP also lowered its December figure to 247,000 new jobs from a previous estimate of 297,000.The financial sector saw the worst losses in the session. The S&P financials index was down 0.9 per cent to 223.50 led by Genworth Financial, a mortgage guarantor and life insurer, which fell 8.5 per cent to $12.76 after posting a loss in the fourth-quarter. Michael Frazier, chief executive, said that the results were not acceptable.Elsewhere, Marathon Oil, the fourth-largest US oil and gas group, reported fourth-quarter earnings up 99 per cent due to higher oil prices. While the results beat analysts’ expectations, the markets have come to expect impressive results after bumper earnings from other oil giants such as ExxonMobil, and so the stock fell 1.5 per cent to $46.89. Also in the sector Cameron International, which makes oil-and-gas pressure-control equipment, gained 4.5 per cent to $56.08 after reporting fourth-quarter earnings up 69 per cent.Solar stocks also rose after MEMC Electronic Materials, a silicon maker, gave a strong 2011 sales forecast. The stock jumped 15.4 per cent to $13.42 while First Solar, which makes photovoltaic panels, was up 5.3 per cent to $164.40.Meanwhile, shares in Electronic Arts rose 15.8 per cent to $18.09 after the company unexpectedly announced a $600m share buy-back. EA, the second-largest video game publisher, also reported earnings figures showing a 39 per cent growth in digital revenues in its third quarter, suggesting that its digital strategy was paying off.Elsewhere in the entertainment industry, Time Warner, the media group, reported fourth-quarter profits up 22 per cent and gave a forecast for double-digit earnings growth in 2011. The company, which owns television networks such as HBO, also announced an 11 per cent increase in the company’s dividend and a $5m share repurchasing plan sending the stock up 8.6 per cent to $35.10.NaviSite, a cloud computing company, soared 32.2 per cent to $5.46 on news it was going to be bought by Time Warner Cable for $230m, or $5.50 a share. Time Warner Cable was up 0.9 per cent to $69.33.Mattel, the world’s biggest toymaker, was up 0.9 per cent to $24.37 after reporting improved sales and boosting its dividend.In the pharmaceutical sector, Chelsea Therapeutics International was down 18.5 per cent to $5.04 after the biotechnology company said it was changing the goal for a late-stage study of its hypotension drug after a disappointing interim study.
61;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2011-02-02T19:55:31Z;US employers unsure about economic recovery;;European and US companies are becoming more dependent on temporary workers, suggesting employers are unsure about the economic recovery, according to Manpower, one of the world’s biggest staffing agencies.The US-based company said on Wednesday there was “exceptional” demand for temporary staff in Europe. It was also seeing an increased demand worldwide for technology workers.It forecast revenues would rise by up to one-fifth in the current quarter compared with the same period last year, driven by rises of up to 41 per cent in the Americas, 18 per cent in France and 17 per cent in the rest of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The economic recovery has prompted companies to increase headcount, but many prefer the flexibility of temporary workers. In the US, temporary positions are thought to have accounted for up to half the jobs created since the economic downturn.US job growth in January was much stronger than expected, according to a report issued on Wednesday by ADP, the payroll services group. A separate report by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the outplacement firm, said job cuts announced by US employers dropped 46 per cent last month from a year earlier to 38,519. The US Labour Department’s monthly jobs report on Friday is expected to show about 145,000 jobs created in January, up from 113,000 in December.Jeff Joerres, Manpower chairman and chief executive, said that in the last quarter, “Europe performed exceptionally, as did our IT staffing”. He said demand for temporary staff was also rising in emerging markets.In the fourth quarter to December 31, restructuring costs pushed the company to a net loss of $350m or $4.29 per diluted share, compared with a net profit of $29m or 37 cents per share in the same period a year earlier. Excluding extraordinary items, net profit was 66 cents per share. Sales rose by 18 per cent to $5.2bn.Manpower shares were 1.38 per cent lower at $64.99 at lunchtime in New York.
62;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2011-02-02T18:57:15Z;One-off factors make jobs data unpredictable;;"Ever since the US recovery began almost two years ago economists have been
waiting for the monster: a dramatic rise in one of the main data series that
signals an acceleration in the economy.The next chance for it to arrive is on Friday when the Bureau of Labor Statistics announces the number of jobs created in January. Every other labour market indicator suggests that things are improving but so far official payroll numbers have not confirmed this.Factory purchasing managers said this week they were hiring: the employment purchasing managers’ index rose to 61.7 in January, where anything above 50 marks growth. New claims for unemployment benefits are following a meandering path downwards. Job losses have all but halted and the number of openings is up.“Everything that we’re seeing right now is pointing to an acceleration in hiring,” said Eric Green at TD Securities in New York.There was another encouraging sign on Wednesday when the ADP national employment report said the private sector added 187,000 jobs in January. Stronger job growth at small and medium-sized businesses, which added 97,000 and 79,000 jobs respectively, was especially encouraging.“The ADP data . . . may prompt an upward revision to Friday’s non-farm payrolls expectations but sustained improvement in the unemployment rate is still months away,” said Michael Woolfolk, analyst at BNY Mellon Global Markets.The official number for January is expected to come in at 142,000, a modest acceleration, but there is a wide range of estimates because the numbers will be affected by a host of one-off factors.One is the weather. Data for the January survey were collected during the week of the 10th – which included a blizzard in the north-east of the US on the 11th and 12th. How that will affect the numbers is impossible to predict. Bad weather normally reduces activity but seasonal adjustment may smooth it out. The snow may have led to extra temporary jobs clearing it and the comparison is to an also snowy December.A more important influence is that January is the month when the BLS announces how many people were employed a year ago using unemployment insurance tax records that it collects from the states.The BLS has already said that it expects to cut 366,000 from its previous figure for the number of people employed in March 2010. But that could actually turn out to be a positive because the lower baseline may imply that job growth was faster during 2010, which could in turn suggest that the economy has more momentum.“It’s likely that more of the downward revision occurred in the first half of the year and stronger job growth in the second half. That is what will really get the market’s attention,” said Mr Green.Also unpredictable is the unemployment rate, which fell from 9.7 per cent to 9.4 per cent in December – largely because of a drop in the number in the labour force. If signs of recovery prompted more people to look for jobs in January, then the unemployment rate could rise again. The consensus of economists is for 9.5 per cent.“As a product of the choppy . . . household employment survey, plus the erratic labour force data, even the direction of the unemployment rate is unfathomable at this stage,” noted Rob Carnell of ING Bank in London.Even if the payroll numbers are good, therefore, the celebrations for a strong labour market recovery may have to wait."
63;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2011-02-02T14:06:10Z;Small business hiring lifts US private payrolls;;An increase in hiring at small businesses helped US companies add more workers than expected in December, offering hope that the labour market recovery is stabilising.The ADP national employment report said on Wednesday that the private sector added 187,000 jobs in December, down from a revised 247,000 the prior month.The increase was larger than Wall Street analysts projected, with gains across most industries.ADP said the report reflected “solid growth of private non-farm payroll employment heading into the New Year” and noted that businesses added 217,000 jobs a month during the last six months. That was a marked improvement from the prior six months, when businesses added 52,000 workers.The December gains were broad-based. The services sector added 166,000 positions and businesses that produce goods added 21,000.Small and medium-sized businesses hired the most, adding 97,000 and 79,000 jobs respectively. Big companies hired 11,000 workers.Wednesday’s figures follow strong manufacturing data earlier in the week that showed hiring in the manufacturing sector growing at the fastest rate since 2004.On Friday, the US government will release its official non-farm payrolls report, which is expected to show the US economy adding 142,000 jobs and the unemployment rate ticking up to 9.5 per cent. Some economists are wary that severe winter weather will skew the data, as workers were forced to stay at home because of snow.“The ADP data this morning may prompt an upward revision to Friday’s non-farm payrolls expectations, but sustained improvement in the unemployment rate is still months away,” said Michael Woolfolk, analyst at BNY Mellon Global Markets.
64;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2011-01-07T22:43:26Z;Financial stocks lead Wall Street lower;;Falling financials led Wall Street lower after the US economy added fewer jobs than expected in December, and there were fears that some home foreclosures could be invalidated.The S&P 500 financials index lost 0.9 per cent after rising earlier in the week.The sector was hit after Massachusett’s highest court upheld a ruling against US Bancorp and Wells Fargo, which voided foreclosures on two homes. Investors fretted that the case could form a precedent that would be used to void other foreclosures.US Bancorp fell 0.8 per cent to $26.09 while Wells Fargo retreated 2 per cent to $31.50.But financials also suffered as one of the sectors most exposed to the sluggish economic recovery.JPMorgan fell 1.9 per cent to $43.64, Morgan Stanley declined by 2.1 per cent to $28.20 and Bank of America lost 1.3 per cent to $14.25.“The disappointment regarding the headline [payrolls] figure has clearly had an impact on financials,” said Howard Ward, portfolio manager at Gamco. But he added that if you count the revisions to previous payroll numbers the report became “a non-event”.Payrolls increased by 103,000 compared with an average estimate of 150,000. Some economists had revised their figures higher after Wednesday’s ADP report showed a surprisingly large leap in employment.The unemployment rate, which was forecast to fall from 9.8 per cent to 9.7 per cent, actually declined further – down to 9.4 per cent.But some analysts think that this could be a sign that some people have given up looking for jobs and no longer count themselves as unemployed. They warn the rate could rise as they start to look for work again.The S&P 500 was down 0.2 per cent to 1,271.50, higher by 1.1 per cent over the week.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2 per cent lower at 11,674.76, adding 0.8 per cent over the five days, and the Nasdaq Composite had edged down 0.2 per cent lower at 11,674.76 but was up 1.9 per cent on the week.US stocks have had a positive start to the year but Thomas Lee, equity strategist at JPMorgan, said this could point to a pause in the rally in March or April.He said that historically positive investor sentiment surveys had been followed by a pullback within 60 to 70 days.“But in our view, this does not mean investors should move to the sidelines now, as the typical further advance, from first reading to peak, has been around 6 per cent, implying the S&P 500 would reach 1,333 before a pause takes place,” Mr Lee said.Elsewhere in financials, two institutions that suffered badly during the financial crisis moved forward with their plans to bolster their balance sheets.Citigroup fell 0.2 per cent to $4.94 after sources said that the bank was seeking buyers for CitiFinancial, the largest consumer finance company in the US. The deal could raise hundreds of millions of dollars.AIG, the bailed-out insurer, rose 1.2 per cent to $61.18 after it said it was on track to complete a recapitalisation as soon as next week. The board has approved a plan to give warrants to non-government shareholders enabling them to buy shares at $45, as a sweetener to the substantial dilution that will occur when the Treasury assumes its stake.Diamond Offshore rose 4.9 per cent to $70.57 after analysts at Goldman Sachs raised the deepwater oil driller’s rating from “sell” to “conviction buy” and said there could be 25 per cent upside to the share price.Baker Hughes also benefited from a Goldman upgrade, jumping 3.2 per cent to $56.60, after analysts upgraded the oilfield services provider from “neutral” to “buy”, saying they expected the difference between its margins and those of its peers to narrow.
65;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2011-01-07T19:16:58Z;US jobs report an ‘utter mess’;;Markets hoped that December’s payroll report would mark a breakthrough for the US economy’s recovery, with a surge in private job creation towards 200,000 – a level that would finally put a dent in the unemployment rate.Instead they got a murky mixture of a report, prompting one economist, Rob Carnell of ING Bank, to call it an “utter mess” and question why markets focus so much on payrolls at all.The problem is that the monthly payrolls report contains two different measures – a survey of households and a survey of employers – and in December they pointed in different directions.The employment survey, the normal focus of attention, showed overall growth in payrolls of only 103,000. That was well below expectations, especially after a disappointing November report and a remarkably high estimate from private- sector payroll processor ADP earlier this week.Yet the household survey, from which the unemployment rate is calculated, sent a completely different message. It showed an extra 297,000 people in jobs and 260,000 fewer people in the labour force. The combination of the two was enough to cause a drop in the unemployment rate from 9.8 to 9.4 per cent.The reality – taking the trend in both measures and other recent data together – is likely to be somewhere in between. Jobs growth is picking up a bit to more than 100,000 a month but still shows no sign of a dramatic acceleration.“At the moment [both surveys] send the same message: things are doing OK but not as well as you would have hoped or expected given the apparent strength of growth,” said Paul Dales, senior US economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman,struck a similar note in testimony to Congress prepared before the release of the payrolls data. “Although recent indicators of spending and production have generally been encouraging, conditions in the labour market have improved only modestly at best,” Mr Bernanke said.There are a few theories to explain all the moves in the data. One is seasonal adjustments, which tend to be tricky at the end of the year and may have distorted the ADP numbers.The difference between the household and business survey data is most likely just a one-off, although there are some suggestions that the business survey may have a slight bias towards larger companies, and their hiring behaviour could be different.Most analysts attribute the fall in labour force participation and therefore the fall in the unemployment rate, to the expiry of long-term unemployment benefits in December.If you no longer receive unemployment benefits, the theory goes, then you no longer have any reason to tell a survey you are ac-tively looking for work. The number of “discouraged workers”, who say that they are no longer looking for a job because they do not think they can find one, was 1.3m in December.Congress has since renewed long-term unemployment benefits. A likely consequence is that the size of the labour force will bounce back in January, reversing the fall in the unemployment rate.A further disappointment was in the average duration of a spell of unemployment, which rose from 21.7 to 22.4 weeks, suggesting that those people who are finding jobs have not been out of work for very long.In his testimony, Mr Bernanke said “persistently high unemployment, by damping household income and confidence, could threaten the strength and sustainability of the recovery”.He will have to wait for any real sign of momentum in the US labour market.

In a six-month Portuguese bill auction, yields soared to 3.686 per cent from 2.045 per cent at the previous sale.Analysts said that reports in the Irish press that the Swiss National Bank had refused Irish government bonds as collateral from investors attempting to raise funds in repo transactions could also focus attention on Dublin’s continuing financial problems.Guilia Comotti at Barclays Capital said that the move actually took place on December 21. It appeared to be the result of Ireland’s credit rating falling below the minimum double A minus rating acceptable by the SNB for euro-denominated collateral following downgrades from ratings agencies Fitch and Moody’s in December.She noted that Irish bonds were still acceptable as collateral by the European Central Bank, though the lack of clarity on the extent of eurozone authority to address such structural problems left peripheral debts vulnerable.“This uncertainty is likely to weigh on the euro in the next few months,” said Ms Comotti.Commodity-linked currencies were stronger as oil rose in defiance of the dollar’s surge. The Mexican peso was up 0.3 per cent to 12.1951 against the dollar, and the Canadian dollar rose 0.2 to C$0.9960.The Australian dollar fell below parity with its US counterpart for the first time in more than a week as worries about flooding continue to weigh on its economy. The Aussie fell 0.6 per cent to $0.9994.

This is unquestionably a positive for the economy, the labour market, income growth and risk assets,” said Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak. “[But] it should be pointed out that December always has seasonal quirks for a host of estimates and, while ADP suggests that there is no real reason to dispute this number, we doubt such strength will be repeated.”The Institute of Supply Management’s reading on the services industries improved in December to its highest level since May 2006.Financials and consumer discretionary stocks led the risers after the improving economic data boosted confidence in the recovery.The financial sector gained 1.2 per cent with AIG jumping 7.3 per cent to $60.93 after the insurer said that it had received offers of up to $3bn for Nan Shan Life Insurance, its Taiwanese unit. Wells Fargo added 2.3 per cent to $32.14 while JPMorgan rose 1.2 per cent to $44.70.The S&P 500 consumer discretionary index rose 0.8 per cent with online travel agencies leading the gainers. Priceline.com added 5.9 per cent to $433.60 while Expedia increased 4.1 per cent to $25.43.The S&P 500 closed up 0.5 per cent to 1,276.56, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.3 per cent higher at 11,722.89 while the Nasdaq Composite had added 0.8 per cent to close at 2,702.20.Atheros Communications added 1.5 per cent to $44.64 after soaring 19 per cent in late trade on Tuesday on deal speculation. On Wednesday it agreed to be bought by Qualcomm for about $3.2bn in cash, or $45 a share.In the latest in a series of deals in the technology sector, Qualcomm is aiming to compete more effectively in the market for tablet computers by using Atheros’s expertise in wireless technology. Shares in Qualcomm added 2.1 per cent to $52.03.Elsewhere in technology, Youku, the Chinese online video website that listed in the US to much fanfare at the end of last year, climbed 6.5 per cent to $37.95 after the company said that it was working with a “major” Hollywood studio to provide an on-
demand paid video service.Falling commodity prices weighed heavily on energy and materials stocks in early trading but the sectors had pared their losses by midday.The S&P 500 energy index edged higher by 0.2 per cent while the materials sector closed flat.ExxonMobil fell 0.3 per cent to $74.70 and Conoco-Phillips was down 0.5 per cent at $67.55.In the materials sector, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold declined by 0.3 per cent to $118.35 while Southern Copper Corporation lost 0.7 per cent to $48.60.Elsewhere in materials, Alcoa, which has risen in recent days on the back of analyst recommendations, spent much of the day in negative territory before closing up 0.2 per cent at $16.56. Brian Yu, an analyst at Citigroup, cut the aluminium producer’s rating from “buy” to “hold”.Rising demand for fertiliser helped Mosaic beat earnings expectations in its second quarter. Farmers are buying more fertiliser as they seek to make the most of corn and soyabean prices that are at multi-year highs.Analysts at RBC Capital Markets kept their “outperform” rating on the stock. “Interestingly, the stronger-than-expected performance was largely attributable to the phosphate business,” they said. “Consistent with Mosaic’s third-quarter 2011 guidance, we expect to see improving results from the potash business that could provide additional momentum for Mosaic’s stock.”Majority-owned by Cargill, the agribusiness group, Mosaic earned $1.01 per share, excluding the sale of its stake in a Brazilian fertiliser producer, up from 24 cents a share in the same quarter the year before. Shares in Mosaic gained 2.8 per cent to $77.09."
68;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2011-01-05T21:26:14Z;Job growth bolsters recovery confidence;;Surveys showing faster-than-expected jobs growth and a boost for the services sector bolstered confidence that the US economic recovery has shifted to a higher gear.The strong monthly readings on Wednesday from ADP and the Institute for Supply Management added to a string of encouraging news on the health of the US economy, which has recovered from the recession of 2007-2009 at a sluggish pace but has recently been showing signs of more rapid growth.The ADP survey signalled that businesses have started to hire new workers more aggressively, a key step towards bringing down the 9.8 per cent unemployment rate.“It’s clear that the US economy is entering 2011 on a very strong note, with good upward momentum,” said Michelle Girard, an economist at RBS in Connecticut.“Employment is clearly accelerating and that seems consistent with other data gathered at the end of the year. There are a lot of things that seem promising to us,” said Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers in St Louis.The latest evidence of a more rapid economic expansion caused 10-year Treasury yields to increase from 3.36 per cent to 3.46 per cent in morning trading, as the bond sell-off of the past two months continued.The dollar rallied and equity indices moved higher, with the S&P 500 index up 0.5 per cent. In minutes from their December 14 policy meeting released this week, Federal Reserve policymakers noted the improved outlook, but judged that the improvement was not sufficient to consider curtailing their plans to support the economy through the purchase of a total $600bn in long-term government bonds by the end of June.Still, a more rapid acceleration in activity could prompt the central bank to begin reining in the programme.The private sector added 297,000 jobs in December, up from a revised 92,000 in November and the 11th straight month of expansion, according to ADP. The gain was significantly higher than the 100,000 new jobs that economists had predicted, and bodes well for the more widely followed monthly jobs report from the US government, set to be released on Friday.The services sector led gains with 270,000 new jobs, the largest monthly rise since the survey began in 2000. The improving health of services businesses – which account for the bulk of US economic activity – was highlighted by the ISM’s non-manufacturing index, which rose to 57.1 in December from 55 in November, surpassing estimates of 55.6 per cent. A reading above 50 indicates growth. The December figure was the 12th consecutive month of growth in the sector, and the most rapid expansion since May 2006.Executives were “mostly positive about business conditions,” said Anthony Nieves, chair of the ISM non-manufacturing business survey committee, though some warned of growing price pressure. Business activity and new orders grew faster in December, with executives citing increased consumer optimism and demand for new products.The strong business activity reading “should translate into some sharing of that revenue with the labour side of the economy,” said Jonathan Basile, director of economics at Credit Suisse.Hiring continued for the fourth straight month, though at a slower rate than in November. But with companies sitting on more cash as business activity increases, employment is likely to pick up, Mr Basile said.“It’s about ‘show me the money’, and it looks like the service firms have it. They need people to generate the output.”
69;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”

The upward revision of the figure, a leading indicator for hiring, matched economists’ expectations.Recruitment companies, which have risen significantly in the past couple of months, gained after the report.

71;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;US private sector adds 43,000 jobs;;Private companies added 43,000 jobs in October, offering a glimmer of hope ahead of the national jobs report on Friday.Economists had expected the survey of ADP private sector employers to show growth of just 20,000 jobs. Instead, the jump of 43,000 was the largest addition of jobs to the economy since June.The gains were a good sign as the US Federal Reserve wraps up its meeting, at which it decides how much stimulus to pump into the economy. But it was still not a reversal of longstanding weakness in the US labour market.“Double-digit trends in ADP are not strong enough to bring down the unemployment rate,” said Jonathan Basile, an economist at Credit Suisse, who said that sustained triple-digit increases are needed to reduce unemployment.September’s loss of 39,000 jobs was revised to a loss of just 2,000. Combined with other revisions and the new gains, the report showed an overall job gain of 107,000.The strongest gains were made by small and medium-sized businesses with fewer than 500 employees. Those companies added 45,000 jobs, offsetting a decline of 2,000 jobs by the largest companies.The jobs also came from the service sector, which added 77,000 jobs, offsetting a decline of 34,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector.“These would be welcome developments if they persist as the service sector needs to be the primary engine of job growth as the manufacturing cycle slows, and smaller firms have been hiring at a sluggish pace,” said Julia Coronado, chief US economist at BNP Paribas.The financial services industry lost jobs, but by the slimmest margin since July 2007, by just 2,000 jobs. Construction continued its heavy losses, losing 23,000 jobs.The non-farm payroll report for October on Friday is expected to show a gain of 60,000 jobs overall, with a loss of 20,000 government jobs offsetting a gain of 80,000 private-sector jobs. That would reverse a net loss of 29,000 jobs in September.According to Credit Suisse figures, the ADP survey has underperformed the national survey FROM the Bureau of Labor Statistics by an average of 73,000 jobs a month over the past year.It follows strong performances for the Institute of Supply Management’s surveys of manufacturing and non-manufacturing activity for October.The non-manufacturing survey, a measure of service sector activity, released on Wednesday showed the index at 54.3, its highest level since March and an improvement from 53.5 in September. A reading of more than 50 indicates expansion.Earlier in the week, the manufacturing index, a measure of new factory orders, was at 56.9, marking the 15th consecutive month of rising manufacturing activity.
72;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2010-11-01T00:15:21Z;Cloud computing in businesses;;"Cloud computing may be one on the most talked-about IT trends of recent years, but it has yet to make much of a mark inside big business. Like many new tech trends, the hype has far outweighed the business realities.If that is to change, then it could well be projects such as recently undertaken by the tax division of ADP, the big US payroll processing company, that explain why.Extracting data from its customers’ individual systems to prepare employee tax returns has been an expensive proposition, requiring separate engineering in the case of each customer to create the interface with ADP’s own systems.As a result, it has only been economic to sell the tax filing service to large companies, typically with more than 1,000 employees, says Lori Schreiber, general manager of ADPs tax services division. But inserting a computing service delivered from the ""cloud"" into the middle of this process has now changed the economics of the business.In ADP's case, the cloud service in question, from IBM, is a standardised way of ""mapping"" information from client systems so that it can be ""read"" by ADP's own systems.As a result, says Ms Schreiber, ADP can now sell the tax filing service to medium-sized companies it could not profitably reach before. It has also been able to change the way it prices its service, potentially making it more attractive.""It allowed us to promote it as more of a standard model, rather than charging for it as a professional service where we bill by the hour,"" Ms Schreiber says.If cloud computing is to become more than an empty promise, it is this type of new business potential that will account for the shift.IBM, which has just revamped its cloud computing strategy to base it around services like the one sold to ADP, says this highlights the way the new technology is likely to be felt in the day-to-day business world.""Taking the operating cost out of service delivery"" is one of the big opportunities for companies in many industries, says Mike Daniels, head of IBM's services division. The key, adds Erich Clementi, head of strategy for the company's cloud business, is the ""extreme standardisation"" made possible by the central delivery of a service. By streamlining Individual processes like this, businesses will be able to create more flexible services, and at a lower standard cost, he says.As the ADP case suggests, this could open up new business opportunities. For companies in industries like telecommunications, financial services and media and entertainment, pushing some parts of their processes into the cloud will make it possible to ""reach markets that weren't reachable before,"" says Frank Gens, an analyst at IDC. ""It will become a fundamental part of the model for all companies trying to reach emerging markets.""Until now, most of the attention in cloud computing has been on the so-called ""public clouds"" run by companies like Amazon.com and Salesforce.com - centralised services where companies can buy computing resources in much the way they buy electricity.Services like these have mainly appealed to start-up companies or those looking to create new businesses from scratch. Starting with a blank sheet of paper, designing a company's processes with no ""on-premise"" systems can be highly appealing.But for most companies - with large sunk investments in IT systems and an understandable aversion to handing over control of their most important corporate data - this is too big a step to take.Much of the focus of the big tech companies is now on refining these services to make them appeal to established companies. Mr Daniels compares it to the emergence of e-business in the early days of the internet: after a brief flurry of excitement over the potential of pure-play dotcoms to topple business leaders in many industries, the new technology was applied to enhance the operations of established businesses. It was Walmart, not Pets.com, that won the day, he says.""The belief is, the money will really be in the enterprise loads, and no one has really untapped that yet,"" adds Paul Maritz, chief executive officer of VMware, which makes some of the key software for data centres that deliver cloud services.The key to unlocking this potential are what the tech industry calls ""hybrid clouds"" - combinations of on-premise and remote, third-party systems that can be combined to create a service, much as ADP found with its tax-filing service.To make this work, companies need to isolate individual processes that they can outsource, and accept a much higher level of standardisation in these areas, Mr Daniels says. He compares it to the standardisation that has already been imposed on many service functions inside companies, like human resources.The same constraints are now being placed on the IT departments’ application programmers, he says. They will lose some choice in the platforms they build on and will have to choose from a narrower ""catalogue"" of IT services, but with significant benefits to their companies in terms of operating flexibility and cost.These standardised services, in turn, will evolve to suit the needs of particular industries, bringing what IBM says will be a new addition to the IT lexicon: ""industry clouds.""This is all a long way from the model of fully-outsourced, ""public clouds that first drove interest of the new technology architecture. To the tech purists, it will smack of compromise, surrendering some of the scale benefits promised by fully centralised computing.There's no question, you lose a lot of the economies of the public cloud,"" says Mr Gens. ""As soon as you say ‘private', you're talking a higher price point.""Long term, that makes the full cloud computing model an appealing one. But for the foreseeable future, the gains seen by most businesses will come from more modest and achievable goals."
73;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;US new jobless claims drop to lowest since July;;The number of Americans claiming new jobless benefits fell by 11,000 last week to its lowest level since July, giving some hope that hiring may be steadying, though at a still-depressed level.The US department of labour reported that 445,000 US workers requested benefits from the government last month, extending the streak of declines in claims to four weeks.The less-volatile four-week moving average of claims fell to 455,750, also its lowest since July. However, it remains above historical norms, and below the threshold economists say is necessary for the US to sustainably create new jobs.The improvement was sunnier than the slight uptick in claims that surveyed economists had been expecting. The previous week’s claims were also revised upward, from 453,000 to 456,000, making the improvement more dramatic.Meanwhile, the number of people still receiving jobless benefits decreased by 48,000 to 4.462m after an upward revision of last week’s figures. It was still higher than economists expected, suggesting that people are not finding jobs as quickly as they would normally be expected to.“It’s pretty clear the US labour market is still basically frozen,” said Zach Pandl, desk economist at Nomura in New York. “There’s some hiring going on, some quitting, but the gross labour market turnover the US is famous for has not been operating as it used to.”Mr Pandl noted that the bulk of Americans receiving unemployment insurance are now in emergency programmes not reflected in the labour department’s data.There are 5.1m people receiving emergency benefits, a figure which rose 256,500 from the second to third week of September, the most recent data available.The claims data also continue to show a rising trend in regional divergence, in which employment in the older, “rust belt” states was steady, while previously faster-growing “sun belt” states were seeing job losses as fast as at any point in the recession.The biggest increases in claims were in California and Florida, while New York and Illinois saw the biggest drops in claims.The improvement in the new claims data also contrasts with a decline in private employment as measured by the ADP survey on Wednesday. That showed a cut of 39,000 jobs by companies in the private sector.The most complete tally of employment will be reported on Friday, when the US releases its non-farm payroll report.The median forecast became more pessimistic on Thursday, following the fresh ADP and claims reports. Previously economists had called for a flat report, but they are now expecting a loss of 5,000 jobs for September.Economists still foresee a gain of 75,000 private-sector jobs, offset by a decline in government hiring from the census programme. The economy had lost 54,000 jobs in June and July.

The data did note bode well for the upcoming US employment report, which many see as crucial to the Fed’s decision over whether to embark on a second round of quantitative easing (QE2) .“The ADP report is extremely weak and the threat of a negative non-farm payroll number on Friday is becoming a reality,” said Tom DiGaloma, head of fixed-income rates trading at Guggenheim Securities.“This is not what the White House needs right now with the November elections 30 days away. QE2 is almost a certainty at this point.”Expectations that the US central bank would ease policy further have underpinned a strong rally in global share prices over the past month.“Equity markets are discounting a boom,” said Andrew Wilkinson, senior analyst at Interactive Brokers. “Some say that the Fed’s liquidity boost will end up creating more asset price bubbles, which is why stock indices are surging.“Rather than rising on the prospect for a surge in consumption leading to higher economic activity, equity markets could be accused of rallying precisely because there’s a wall of cheap money coming our way.”But Tony Crescenzi, strategist at Pimco, warned that there was a limit to the “bad news is good news” mindset that investors appeared to have adopted recently with regard to economic data.“Efficacy remains a major question mark with respect to the Federal Reserve’s actions,” Mr Crescenzi said.“The efficacy of QE in particular represents a major unknown even for the Fed, as few truly know the effect that a given amount of QE will have on financial conditions, and few truly know the impact that any loosening of financial conditions will have on the economy.”US and European equities showed signs of nervousness about the jobs figures, with the S&P 500 index closing just a fraction lower and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 trimming an early rise to finish 0.5 per cent higher.There was a more bullish tone in Asia, however, where the Nikkei 225 rose 1.8 per cent to a two-month high and most other markets hit multi-month peaks.However, Tokyo equity traders highlighted lingering worries about the persistent strength of the yen, which has been most notable against the dollar.And analysts at Goldman Sachs forecast further dollar weakness against a wide range of currencies.“The combination of weaker growth, more QE, FX policy pressure on Asia for more currency appreciation and widening external imbalances all point in the same direction – broad dollar weakness. And this is likely to remain the dominant theme,” Goldman said.The dollar touched a 15-year low against the yen of Y82.75, beneath the level at which the Japanese authorities intervened recently. However, dealers said that there was no sign that the Bank of Japan had stepped in again.The US currency also fell to an eight-month low against the euro, and the trade-weighted dollar index hit its lowest since late January. The decline in the dollar was accompanied by further hefty gains for US government bonds.The yield on the 10-year Treasury touched a fresh 2010 low, of 2.36 per cent, before finishing the day at 2.40 per cent. Two and five-year bonds saw new record-low yields.The yield on the 10-year German Bund sank 7bp to 2.22 per cent, while the spread between it and the Irish 10-year bond widened 14bp to 424bp after Fitch cut Ireland’s credit rating.Commodity prices climbed across the board. Copper hit a 26-month high above $8,300 a tonne and tin reached a record high.Oil pushed above $83 a barrel.Gold’s record-breaking run continued, with the metal reaching $1,349.80 – its seventh all-time high in eight sessions.Meanwhile, Frank Øland Hansen, senior economist at Danske Bank, suggested that the European Central Bank would not be comfortable with the euro’s appreciation over the last month, which he said roughly translates to a 0.5 percentage point reduction in gross domestic product growth in 2011.
75;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;US private sector sheds 39,000 jobs;;US businesses shed workers for the first time in eight months in September as slowing output has hampered the economy’s ability to create jobs.Companies cut 39,000 workers last month, according to the ADP National Employment Report. Economists had predicted an increase in private sector employment and the data added to fears of a stalled recovery.“The decline in private employment in September confirms a pause in the economic recovery already evident in other data,” ADP said on Wednesday. “There simply is no momentum in employment.”Recent figures from the Institute of Supply Management have indicated that the manufacturing sector is starting to cool. Meanwhile, high rates of foreclosure continue to put pressure on home prices and sales.The disappointing data initially rattled US investors, and S&P 500 Futures, which had risen 0.4 per cent ahead of the release, slightly pared their gains and were up 0.1 per cent to 1,155.80. The yield on US 10-year Treasuries was down 6 basis points to 2.41 per cent shortly after the report.Cuts at businesses that produce goods were to blame for the September decline, with 45,000 workers losing their jobs. An increase of 6,000 workers in the services sector was not large enough to offset the struggles facing construction firms and manufacturers.Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR, said the figures were “indicative of a painfully slow healing process in the labour market as cost-cutting remains a key part of corporate business plans”.ADP’s report is seen by analysts as a harbinger of the government’s official non-farm payrolls data, which will be released on Friday. That is expected to show that payrolls were flat in September, with the unemployment rate holding steady at 9.6 per cent.
76;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;US companies cut 10,000 jobs in August;;Private-sector employment in the US fell for the first time this year in August, underscoring fears that a recovery in the labour market is faltering, but a surprise rise in manufacturing activity offered a glimmer of hope for the sputtering economy.Businesses shed 10,000 workers last month, according to ADP Employer Services. That was the first monthly decline since last December and failed to meet economists’ projections that hiring would edge higher.The US private sector added a revised 37,000 jobs in July.“The decline in private employment in August confirms a pause in the recovery already evident in other economic data,” ADP said in its report.In August, the manufacturing sector was hit the hardest, with businesses that produce goods cutting 40,000 workers. Construction workers felt the brunt of that decline, with 33,000 losing their jobs as the housing market stalled.The troubles facing the housing market were highlighted by a separate commerce department report on Wednesday that showed construction spending falling by 1 per cent to an annual rate of $805.2bn in July. That was the lowest level in 10 years and left spending off by more than 10 per cent from a year ago.The US services sector continued its run of strength, however, adding 30,000 workers and marking its seventh consecutive monthly increase.But small and medium-sized businesses were under the most pressure in August, cutting 5,000 and 6,000 jobs respectively. Hiring at big companies was flat during the month.“Demand growth has slowed, largely triggered by the spring plunge in stock prices, and cautious companies are responding by holding fire on hiring,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.The ADP report is closely watched as a foreshadower of Friday’s government non-farm payrolls figures, which are expected to show that the US economy shed 131,000 workers but that the private sector added 42,000 employees.Meanwhile, the Institute of Supply Management said on Wednesday that manufacturing activity in the US accelerated in August, as its index rose from 55.5 in July to 56.3. Readings above 50 signal expansion and analysts were predicting that growth slowed in the sector.Strength in the factory sector was fuelled by increased production and employment, but new orders grew more slowly in August.“This number decidedly does not fit with a double-dip scenario,” said Alan Ruskin, strategist at Deutsche Bank, who noted that growing import orders show that domestic demand is holding up.
77;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2010-08-04T22:36:01Z;Overview: Nervousness lingers despite improved data;;Brighter news on the US economy helped the dollar stage a modest recovery on Wednesday and put equities on a slightly firmer footing, while pulling shorter-dated Treasury yields up from record lows.But investors remained very cautious, given that many were awaiting Thursday’s non-farm payrolls report for further clues about the economic outlook and whether the Federal Reserve might take further steps to stimulate growth.Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA, said the speed and breadth of the slowdown in the US recovery had been fairly dramatic, given the rebound in financial markets since reaching a bottom in March of last year.“The slowdown is clearly more than a pause that refreshes,” he said. “The rate of deceleration reflects the modest contribution the consumer has made to the recovery, leaving the economy heavily dependent on companies that are concentrating on current earnings at the expense of future growth.“This leaves policymakers with a real policy dilemma of an unemployment rate that is stuck in the 9-10 per cent range and the longest duration of joblessness in history.”Some respite for the markets came as the Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-manufacturing activity unexpectedly rose to 54.3 in July from 53.8 the previous month.Crucially, the employment component of the index climbed back above the 50 level that separates contraction from expansion – and reached its highest level since December 2007.“With private sector service jobs accounting for about 83 per cent of all private sector jobs, movements in this index and the employment component bear close watching,” said Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak. “Viewed that way, the increase in the index and the employment reading are absolutely and unquestionably a positive.”The apparent improvement in the labour market outlook was backed up by the latest private sector jobs report from ADP Employer Services. This showed that 42,000 jobs were created by private employers in July, up from a revised 19,000 increase in June.The improvement in Wednesday’s data releases helped push the US two-year government bonds yield up 3 basis points to 0.57 per cent. It touched a record low of 0.52 per cent on Tuesday as speculation intensified over whether the Fed would decide to use funds from maturing mortgage bonds to buy Treasuries or new mortgage bonds.Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics said the US central bank was unlikely to do anything more than make some minor cosmetic changes at its policy meeting next Tuesday.“We suspect that Fed officials would need to see evidence of a much more severe deceleration in economic growth before they would be willing to countenance any meaningful expansion of quantitative easing,” he said.Meanwhile, the 10-year Japanese government bond yield fell below 1 per cent for the first time in seven years Wednesday on talk that the recent strength of the yen could prompt further easing from Bank of Japan.On the currency markets, the dollar fell to a fresh eight-month trough of Y85.33 in early trade – within striking distance of its 15-year low against the Japanese currency of Y84.81. But the dollar subsequently rallied back above Y86 as concerns about the slowing US economy were soothed by Wednesday’s ADP and ISM data. The euro also slipped back below $1.32 after reaching a three-month high of $1.3261 on Tuesday. Meanwhile, sterling weakened after a disappointing reading on the UK service sector purchasing managers report undermined recent robust economic indicators.Global equities struggled for a clear direction as the backdrop of broad economic uncertainty overshadowed some positive earnings reports. By midday in New York, the S&P 500 was up 0.3 per cent, while the FTSE Eurofirst 300 finished flat. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo fell 2.1 per cent as exporters were hurt by yen strength.Commodity prices put in a stronger showing, with oil above $82 a barrel and copper staying in sight of Monday’s three-month high of $7,500 a tonne. Gold climbed back up to $1,200 an ounce.
78;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2010-08-04T16:48:43Z;Dollar rebounds on US employment report;Wall Street strengthens ahead of non-farm payrolls report;Wednesday 19.30 BST. A turn in US economic data has reversed the decline of the dollar, but investors are still expressing concern about the prospects of a global economy that is increasingly reliant on shaky consumers.The risk appetite picture is mixed. The FTSE All-World stock index is up 0.1 per cent. Asian shares were lower and European shares were flat, but Wall Street is trading higher. The S&P 500 index closed up 0.6 per cent. US Treasury yields are now rising following stronger-than-expected US employment figures.Earlier, a run in the yen brought the Japanese currency nearer to its 15-year high below Y85 to the dollar. Uncertainty about the US economy has driven investors seeking havens from risk away from the dollar– normally in demand in such markets – and into the arms of the yen. The yield on Japanese 10-year bonds dropped to a fresh post-crisis low, at just under 1 per cent.But a silver lining in the US labour market has eased risk revulsion, and lessened expectations of the Federal Reserve taking emergency steps to loosen access to money.Ahead of the official non-farm payroll report on Friday, ADP reported 42,000 jobs were created in the private sector in July, above expectations of 40,000. Also in July, US non-manufacturing services activity grew slightly, contrary to expectations of a decline. Futures markets are now pricing in a lower chance of a decrease to a rate of zero by next year.“Markets are extremely responsive to economic data right now,” said Stephen Wood, chief market strategist at Russell Investments. “And the employment situation is becoming a dominant data point, because it also has an impact on Federal Reserve policy. They’re keeping one if not two eyes on the jobs market.”Meanwhile, the corporate picture continued to be bright. Toyota, Japan’s biggest company, added its name to the list of carmakers that have topped forecasts and raised their projections for second-half profits. And a series of European banks, led by Lloyds Banking Group, also lowered their provisions for losses on bad loans.Yet sentiment is likely to remain restrained, as evidenced by oil’s stumble from intra-day highs. European equity markets were little moved by the US economic surprise. In fact, the euro and the pound dropped back after reaching multi-month highs on Tuesday. It would be the pound’s first close lower in two weeks.The main global worry is the consumer, and whether there will be enough demand to support a global recovery once industries’ inventory restocking subsides. Reports showed that eurozone and UK services activity were surprisingly slow. Eurozone retail sales in July were also behind forecasts.Asia is a mixed bag of prospects and its stock markets reflected that. Indonesia, Korea and India are struggling with inflation – a sign of growth – while China said its inventory restocking cycle was easing, putting the onus on consumers to pick up as business demand slackens. Service activity in Australia was also reported to be slowing.Brazil is not inspiring confidence either, as its central bank has not raised rates as expected, citing risks to growth from slowing internal demand. It reported a decline in service sector confidence today.“Brazil has been disappointing to many,” said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.☼ Factors to watch. In spite of positive economic data out of the US today, the big report is still the non-farm payroll due out on Friday. Reuters today polled a group of the most accurate forecasters. They expected the headline figure, which includes government jobs to be below expectations, at a loss of 70,000 jobs, versus 65,000 in the broader forecast.The Bank of England’s monetary policy committee announces its decision on interest rates on Thursday. Few bank-watchers actually expect a rate rise – though you wouldn’t know that from the way the pound has been surging of late, nearing $1.60. ☼• Europe. Banks are down across Europe, in spite of strong earnings reports. Another clutch of European lenders reported earnings that topped estimates, including Lloyds Banking Group, Société Générale and Standard Chartered. Profitability was driven by lower provisions for bad loans, as it was for HSBC and BNP Paribas earlier in the week.Without their support, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 is flat. The leading decliners were retail shares, thanks to weakening measures of consumer demand, balanced by gains in defensive sectors such as electricity and health care. The UK’s FTSE 100 index closed down 0.2 per cent after the UK’s services PMI missed expectations. Germany’s Dax index was up 0.4 per cent, as the country’s own service sector was found to be expanding at its fastest rate in three years.• Asia. The Nikkei led decliners in the region, down 2.1 per cent. The yen’s push brought further fears for Japanese companies, whose exports would become more expensive if the yen were to remain at such elevated levels. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was down 0.7 per cent.After Indonesia’s central bank declined to raise rates, Jakarta’s IDX composite index was up 0.3 per cent, as were other Asian emerging markets. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was up 0.7 per cent, though Shanghai was up barely 0.1 per cent. China said growth would slow in the current quarter, which would also moderate inflation pressures – a top worry for Asian property and manufacturing sectors.Mumbai’s Sensex was up 0.6 per cent, as the government looks more likely to tackle inflation. Street protests at high prices have put pressure on the finance ministry to reverse course and support rate increases planned by the central bank.• Currencies. Investors were easing their flight from risk in the afternoon.The yen is now down 0.6 per cent against the US dollar at Y86.29. Earlier it had inched closer to Y85, its lowest level in nearly 15 years. Gains peaked in the Asian session after Japan’s finance minister said he was “watching closely”, sparking fears that Japan could intervene to counterbalance the yen’s rise. It switched to a loss after the ISM and ADP figures in the US. The yen is now down 0.6 per cent against the New Zealand dollar and 0.7 per cent against the South African rand.The US dollar is also showing strength elsewhere. The euro and the pound are weaker versus the dollar after hitting fresh multi-month highs during Tuesday’s session. The euro is down 0.5 per cent at $1.3160, and the pound is 0.4 per cent lower at $1.5893.• Bonds. “Haven” debt was seeing strength earlier, but has eased. Japanese 10-year yields fell to their lowest since 2002, dropping 4 basis points to 1 per cent. On Monday, US 2-year bond yields had reached all-time lows.But US Treasury benchmark 10-year bonds are up 5 basis points to 2.96 per cent. German Bund yields are flat at 2.60 per cent. The US said it would auction off $74bn of 3, 10 and 30-year bonds, raising supply concerns that put downward pressure on bond demand.US corporate bonds are at record levels of demand. Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in a report that of the 10 lowest-coupon US-dollar corporate bonds ever issued, all have occurred in the past 14 months, as investors make a striking shift from equities into fixed income.• Commodities. Gold is higher after risk aversion grew during Asian and European trading, up 0.7 per cent to $1,194 an ounce. Earlier it regained the $1,200 level for the first time in two weeks, rallying after falling to three-month lows in July.US WTI crude oil rallied earlier but wobbled late, not helped by global growth concerns. It is down by 12 cents at $82.43 a barrel. It rallied sharply when risk assets were accumulated at the beginning of March, reaching three-month highs, also supported by storm warnings for the Gulf of Mexico and facility closures in the North Sea.Follow the Global Market Overview on Twitter at @telisdemos(Jamie Chisholm is on holiday)
79;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;ADP says US companies add 42,000 jobs;;US companies added a better-than-expected 42,000 workers in July, as small businesses started to pick up some of the hiring slack.July hiring picked up from the previous month, when the private sector added a modest 19,000 workers, according to ADP Employer Services. Analysts expected the closely watched survey to show that businesses added 30,000 employees last month.The US private sector has added jobs in each of the last six months, but the increases have been tepid, as wary businesses have been hesitant to ramp up hiring. ADP said that with monthly hiring averaging 37,000 jobs in the last half-year there was “no evidence of acceleration” in private sector employment.Small businesses were the biggest bright note last month, adding 21,000 jobs. Businesses with fewer than 50 employees have struggled to compete with bigger companies that have greater access to credit, but July was their best month for hiring in two years.Medium-sized businesses matched that success, also hiring 21,000 new workers, while hiring at big companies with more than 500 employees was flat.Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR, said the ADP data was indicative of “a painfully slow healing process in the labour market as companies continue to use cost-cutting as a key part of their business plans”.Last month, United Technologies said it would cut another 1,500 jobs this year and next even after it reported a 14 per cent jump in its second quarter net income as it continued its “relentless focus on cost”. The industrial conglomerate, which employed more than 200,000 workers at the end of last year, had already shed 900 jobs this year.It was the US services sector led job creation in July, adding 63,000 employees. Businesses that produce goods, however, shed 21,000 employees and the manufacturing sector cut 6,000 workers.A separate report on Wednesday showed that activity in the US services sector grew faster in July. The Institute of Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index rose from 53.8 to 54.3 last month, surprising economists who predicted a decline.Leading the expansion were growing new orders and employment, which had contracted in June. Executives said they saw improvement in the sector but remained cautious due to tight capital funding and instability in the markets.Firings at factories could cast more doubt over manufacturing, which was leading the recovery earlier in the year. On Monday, the Institute of Supply Management said that US manufacturing activity slowed in July, falling to its lowest level since last December.ADP’s survey is closely watched for its ability to foreshadow the government’s official non-farm payroll report, which will be released on Friday.Those figures are expected to show that the US economy lost 63,000 jobs in July with the unemployment rate ticking up to 9.6 per cent. However, private sector employment is projected to rise by 90,000.
80;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2010-07-11T08:28:20Z;Invesco manager sees income investment gems;Large global companies deliver attractive yields to Invesco;Invesco Perpetual’s £129m (€155m, $196m) Global Equity Income Fund suffered a fourth-quartile debut year against its peers in the global growth sector, with the market led by poor quality and dividend-cutting stocks.Manager Paul Boyne says the group’s long-held view is that low interest rates, quantitative easing and other expansionary programmes are a symptom of western problems rather than the basis of sustainable economic recovery.“Removal of this ‘state aid’ will pose significant challenges for economies and markets into 2011 as the true state of unaided economic growth becomes apparent,” he adds.“We see little evidence of a sustainable pick-up in developed market consumption growth, as consumers and lenders are deleveraging and persistent unemployment may impair a durable recovery.”This perspective – and the group’s focus on valuation – has meant little exposure to areas where a cyclical recovery is discounted into share prices.In contrast to a fairly bearish macro view, Mr Boyne is generally positive on markets, especially with regard to income investment. “Companies have aggressively reduced costs and today we see many with low debt and very high cashflow, the inverse of the household sector,” he says.“Many sectors currently offer yields in excess of historic averages and we continue to find companies that have well-covered dividends.”Despite a year of material and often painful dividend cuts, he highlights good experience of the opposite, with companies including Home Depot and United Technology increasing distributions.Over the first months of 2010, the fund’s best relative sector performances came from industrials, financials and information technology, and the worst from materials and telecom services. Mr Boyne says the negative impact of his high exposure to telecom services was more than countered by low exposure to financials and overweight positions in industrials and consumer staples.“The relative underperformance of many less cyclical sectors has left large sections of the market looking attractively priced and coincidentally, many of these areas also pay high dividend yields,” he says.“In a world where we believe interest rates will have to remain low to support beleaguered western economies, the attraction of sustainable dividend yields above cash rates, and in many cases also above current corporate bond yields, cannot be ignored.”With the west retrenching, Mr Boyne says it is important to remember economic expansion and capital formation in many emerging countries is redefining the global economy.“What we are seeing today is that large global companies are able to orientate their businesses towards these markets and are investing significantly for growth,” he says.As income investors, the team is concerned with identifying sustainable cashflows and undervalued businesses and sees many such opportunities in current conditions.One recent addition is Automatic Data Processing, for example, which serves thousands of corporate clients globally, providing payroll and other workplace solutions.“We were attracted to its predictable recurring revenues that deliver sustainable cashflows,” Mr Boyne says.James Smith is a freelance journalist who writes for Investment Adviser
81;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2010-06-30T12:51:20Z;Slow US hiring signals ‘lethargic’ jobs market;;US companies added a modest 13,000 jobs in June, as private-sector job growth stalled amid a wobbly economic recovery.June hiring slowed dramatically from the previous month, when private companies added 57,000 workers, according to ADP Employer Services, signalling that private companies held back ahead of summer. The gain was much smaller than the 60,000 additional jobs that economists had expected.Alan Ruskin, a strategist at RBS Global Banking & Markets, said that the figures were “consistent with a labour market that is lethargic at best, moribund at worst”.Private sector employment has climbed for five months running, with average gains of 34,000 jobs per month.“The slow pace of improvement from February through June is consistent with other publicly available data, including a pause in the decline of initial unemployment claims that occurred during the winter months,” ADP said in its report.Job creation was blunted by a 35,000-job drop in construction employment. The services sector continued to show strength, adding 30,000 jobs, and manufacturers hired 16,000 workers.ADP’s survey is closely watched ahead of the government’s official non-farm payrolls report, which is released on Friday. That is expected to show 115,000 jobs lost in June, in spite of a gain of 110,000 private sector jobs, as Census hiring peaked in May.“The ADP results for the private sector are indicative of a painfully slow healing process in the labour market as companies continue to use cost-cutting as a key part of their business plans,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.
82;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2010-06-04T21:49:23Z;Investors head for cover amid new default fears;;Global markets were sideswiped on Friday by a combination of weaker-than-expected US jobs data, European debt default fears and rumours of large derivatives-related losses at a French bank.Equity and commodity markets were stung, while credit markets priced in sharply higher rates to cover the risk of default. Meanwhile, investors sought safety in quality sovereign issues and dollar and yen havens.Non-farm payrolls from the US had been keenly awaited after Thursday’s ADP report on private sector employment suggested 55,000 jobs had been created in May. The non-farms report also takes into account public employment, and expectations that more than 410,000 census officials had been hired in May, made the headline NFP number of 431,000 look tame. “This is a timely reminder that, although the economic outlook is improving, the recovery is still pretty fragile,” said Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics.Meanwhile, the biggest fear for global investors in recent weeks has been the contagion of the fiscal crisis in Greece to other areas of the eurozone and beyond. On Friday, Hungary clumsily delivered on these fears, after a spokesman for the prime minister said the economy was in a “very grave situation”, and that talk of a default was “not an exaggeration”. These comments were later played down, but the damage to the markets could not be undone.“The market fears another Greece-like situation,” said Marc Chandler at Brown Brothers Harriman. “Comments by Hungarian officials that Hungary is not far from Greece’s fate simply adds to the market anxiety and talk of default is not helpful.”On top of this, there were rumours on trading floors that French bank Société Générale had suffered derivatives-linked losses – a rumour that the bank later rebuffed.In all, it was a volatile Friday, which came on top of concerns over the state of Spain’s fiscal position earlier in the week and lingering pangs about slowing growth in China after Monday’s manufacturing data.Spreads on credit markets widened on Friday, as the cost of insuring sovereign debt against default climbed. Hungarian credit default swaps soared 116 basis points to 430bp, while Spain’s rose 62bp to 320bp.Meanwhile, on currency markets, the Hungarian forint fell 2.7 per cent against the euro and was nearly 4 per cent lower versus the dollar on Friday. Over the week, it fell 5.3 per cent against the euro.As investors fled European assets, the single currency fell 1.6 per cent to $1.1967 on Friday, a loss of 2.5 per cent over the week.“Clearly, the damage wrought to investor confidence recently has left players skittish and risk averse with little appetite for buying the euro heading into the weekend,” said Michael Woolfolk at Bank of New York Mellon.The dollar index, which measures the performance of the US unit against a basket of currencies, jumped 1.3 per cent on the day and was up 2.1 per cent over the week.The yen fell 0.6 per cent versus the dollar over the week on speculation Japan’s new prime minister would adopt a weak yen strategy and intervene in the market to stop rapid appreciation.On government bond markets, spreads between the yields on German 10-year Bunds and 10-year equivalents in both Italy and Spain widened to their highest levels since the introduction of the euro in 1999.Investors were buyers of high-quality assets and piled into US Treasuries, sending yields sharply lower. The yield on the 10-year note fell 18bp to 3.20 per cent, a fall of 10bp over the week.UK sovereign issues were also bought, and the yield on the 10-year gilt fell 8.5bp to 3.49 per cent, down 9bp on the week.Asian equity markets were closed before any of Friday’s events had a chance to undermine them and consequently many closed higher on the week. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 Average was up 1.4 per cent, while India’s BSE Sensex gained 1.5 per cent.In Europe, it was the first negative session of the week on the FTSE Eurofirst 300. Until the close on Thursday, investors had bought bargains in the recently battered oil and financial sectors and the pan-European index ended that day 2 per cent higher over the week.However, following Friday’s losses it finished up just 0.1 per cent on the week.On Wall Street, it was a much more volatile week and the S&P 500 closed down 3.4 per cent.On commodity markets, US oil prices fell more than 4 per cent on Friday to $71.51 a barrel on fears of slowing demand. The price of Brent fell $3.32 to $72.08. The price of cocoa hit a 33-year high in London, with the July contract jumping to £2,600 per tonne.

Illustrated magazine, among others, earned 61 cents a share in the quarter, beating average analyst estimates of 48 cents a share.Sprint Nextel was 2 per cent higher to $4.18 as the telecoms group was upgraded to “buy” from “hold” at Deutsche Bank with its target price raised from $4.75 to $6.Consumer discretionary stocks remained under pressure as investors doubted the strength of consumer confidence.Whirlpool, a consumer electronics maker, lost 4.5 per cent to $104.21, carmaker Ford was 4 per cent lower to $12.34 while Best Buy, an electronics retailer, declined 3.7 per cent to $42.90.However, lower-end retailers managed to gain ground, with drugstore chain Walgreen leading the group higher, rising 1.7 per cent to $35.73.Warehouse chain Costco added 1.2 per cent to $60.36, discount retailer Walmart was 1.4 per cent higher to $54.77 and grocery chain Supervalu climbed 1.6 per cent to $15.Garmin, a maker of portable navigation devices, lost 8.8 per cent to $34.19 after the company’s first-quarter profit came in well below Wall Street expectations, hurt by the increasing popularity of smartphones that offer navigation services.Excluding non-recurring items, earnings were 38 cents a share compared with average analyst expectations of 42 cents a share.XL Capital was one of the session’s best performers as the Bermuda-based insurer posted first-quarter profit that positively surprised investors and rose 4.8 per cent to $17.99.The company recorded net income of $143.9m in the quarter, up from $3.1m a year earlier.Drugmaker InterMune plunged 75 per cent to $11.38, making it one of the biggest fallers in the Russell 2000, a small-cap index, on news that it failed to win US regulatory approval for a lung treatment that analysts estimated could bring in more than $1bn in annual sales.Ariad Pharmaceuticals pushed 5.8 per cent higher to $4.03 as the drugmaker announced that pharma giant Merck is to acquire all development and marketing rights of Ridaforolimus, its experimental cancer treatment, for $50m cash and about $19m reimbursement of development costs.Merck was down 0.6 per cent to $35.59."
84;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;US jobs market continues modest growth;;US businesses added jobs in April for the third month suggesting that improvement in the stricken labour market is gaining momentum, figures showed on Wednesday.Private companies added 32,000 jobs last month, according to the ADP employer services survey. That was better than Wall Street analysts had predicted and came with positive revisions from the prior two months, showing a modest increases in February and March.The monthly rise was the biggest since early 2008 and was highlighted by continued strength in the services sector, which added 50,000 jobs. Businesses that produce goods kept struggling last month, losing 18,000 jobs, but manufacturing employment continued to rise.“The ADP results for the private sector are indicative of a grudging healing process in the labour market as companies continue to use cost-cutting as a key part of their business plans,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.Big and medium-sized businesses fared the best in April, adding 14,000 and 17,000 jobs, respectively. Small businesses lagged behind a little, adding 1,000 workers.ADP said that its results were consistent with the patterns seen in jobless claims, which saw their pace of improvement stall during the winter. It also noted that its survey did not reflect census hiring, indicating that the government jobs report would be even stronger.The ADP report comes ahead of Friday’s official non-farm payrolls report that is expected to show the US economy added 189,000 jobs last month, leaving the unemployment rate at 9.7 per cent. In March the US added 162,000 workers.Meanwhile, the Insitute of Supply Management’s survey of the US services sector was unchanged at 55.4 in April. Readings greater than 50 signal expansion, but analysts had expected the sector to grow more quickly last month.Inventories and business activity grew in April, but employment and new orders slipped and prices rose during the month. Executives queried by the ISM said that more projects were starting to get the “green light” and that they were seeing more relaxed attitudes regarding spending and hiring.

The flight bookings provider hits Spanish stock exchanges on Wednesday with a €1.3bn initial public offering, western Europe’s largest in almost two years.It has been a tough road. European equity markets have see-sawed this year, the spectre of Spanish sovereign risk has scared the market, and other large IPOs, such as rival Travelport, have been postponed. Then the volcanic ash cloud disrupted the investor roadshow. But in spite of the extra train travel, bankers managed to peddle the stock at a mid-range price. It was four times subscribed.Anything can be sold if the price is right and Amadeus has been carefully pitched. For €11 per share, investors appear content that post-IPO net debt of three times this year’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will be manageable. An enterprise value multiple of about eight times also appears fair. Its peer group is difficult to nail down, but other transactional businesses such as Western Union, Experian and ADP are valued at about 10 times ebitda.So the consortium of private equity and airline owners probably left money on the table. But this is no surprise. After all, being the first to reopen the IPO market requires nothing less. BC Partners, which together with Cinven will remain Amadeus’s two largest owners, will be pleased to demonstrate the ability to exit holdings to its own investors. The term on its current fund expires next year and raising a new one is a priority.A success with Amadeus, one of its most valuable investments, is well timed. Air France and Lufthansa will also be happy with the deal. After enduring a recession and then a volcanic eruption, the IPO will toss €104m and €51m into their respective coffers.

86;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2010-04-01T13:11:26Z;Jobless claims boost hopes for US labour market;;The number of Americans claiming jobless benefits has fallen to the lowest level since 2008, signalling that the US economy could soon start creating jobs, labour department figures showed on Thursday.Continuing jobless claims fell by 6,000 to 4.66m, the lowest level since December 2008. However, the decline reflects some unemployed workers seeing their benefits expire as well as a slowdown in job cuts.New claims for unemployment benefits also fell last week, declining by 6,000 to 439,000. That was in line with economists’ expectations and brought the four-week average of initial claims down to 447,250.Economists estimate that new jobless claims need to fall to the low 400,000-level before the economy can consistently generate jobs.“Even after recent declines, the level of claims is higher than one would expect it to be if private non-farm payrolls were really poised to begin sustained gains,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.The labour department will release its closely watched non-farm payrolls report on Friday. Analysts predict that the economy added up to 200,000 jobs in March with the unemployment rate holding steady at 9.7 per cent. Some of the optimism was dampened on Wednesday when the ADP employer services survey showed that private sector companies cut 23,000 jobs last month.Last week, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and New Jersey were among the states seeing big drops in jobless claims. The improvement was largely the result of fewer job cuts in the construction industry.
87;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2010-03-31T21:58:44Z;Gloomy US job figures halt equity progress;;Uncertainty about the outlook for US employment kept financial markets on tenterhooks on Wednesday as investors took stock of what has been a broadly positive quarter for risky assets.Participants hoping for a strong rise in Friday’s crucial non-farm payrolls number were unsettled by a survey from ADP Employers’ Services showing that the US private sector shed 23,000 jobs in March compared with expectations for an increase of 40,000.The consensus among economists is for a rise in March payrolls of 190,000. But analysts noted that the two series differed hugely in their methods of calculation, with payrolls likely to be positively affected by both the unwinding of the adverse weather impact earlier in the year and by substantial hiring of census workers.“Although the US labour market is on the mend, it is difficult to gain an accurate sense of the extent of this improvement given the quality of the underlying data,” said Michael Woolfolk, of Bank of New York Mellon.On the currency markets, the dollar retreated from a three-month high against the yen following the ADP report’s release while the euro rallied back above $1.35.US government bonds rose, pushing the yield on the two-year Treasury down 4 basis points to 1.02 per cent and the 10-year down 1bp to 3.85 per cent.“The market reaction to the ADP numbers has been disappointing but this looks more like a temporary setback than a sea-change in risk sentiment,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Securities.Mortgages weakened sharply against Treasuries and 30-year coupons on Fannie Mae rose above 4.5 per cent, as the Federal Reserve completed its $1,250bn purchase program.Meanwhile, the fragility of the eurozone recovery was highlighted by news that the region’s unemployment rate had reached 10 per cent in February – the highest for 11 years – while consumer price inflation jumped to a 15-month high of 1.5 per cent in March.Howard Archer, economist at IHS Global Insight, said there was evidence that underlying price pressures remained largely muted while further increases in unemployment were likely to hold down wage growth and limit consumer spending.“Consequently, there remains a compelling case for the European Central Bank to keep interest rates at 1 per cent not only at its April 8 policy meeting but also until 2011,” Mr Archer said. “Furthermore, the ECB will probably continue to tread lightly in withdrawing its emergency liquidity measures.”The ECB was asked for €17.9bn ($24bn) of funds at its final six-month long-term refinancing operation on Wednesday, much less than expected. Giuseppe Maraffino, fixed income strategist at UniCredit, said this offered a clear sign that banks’ liquidity needs had declined in recent months and that they no longer needed to participate in long-term operations.“Importantly, [these] results should ease concerns related to the effect of the expiration of the 12-month LTRO on July 1 [when €442bn is due to be repaid] on banks’ liquidity needs and on the market.”But a reminder of the headwinds facing peripheral eurozone economies came from news that Moody’s Investors Service had downgraded five Greek banks.Greek government bonds fell sharply, with the yield spread over German Bunds widening.The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 equity index ended the session 0.1 per cent lower – but recorded a 2.8 per cent gain in the three months from January to March, a fourth successive quarterly rise. In New York, the S&P 500 had its best first-quarter gain since 1998, although it closed 0.3 per cent lower on Wednesday.In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 eased 0.1 per cent but rose 5.2 per cent over the three-month period.The broad decline in risk aversion during the quarter was illustrated by an 18 per cent drop in the Vix volatility index to 17.7.In commodities, US oil climbed above $83 a barrel even after a rise in crude inventories last week, although copper retreated from a 19-month high. The weaker tone of the dollar pushed gold up slightly to $1,114 an ounce.
88;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2010-03-31T21:38:00Z;Investors cautious ahead of crucial labour data;FTSE All-World index falters in face of 18-month highs;22:30 BST: A first quarter that started with a bang looked to be finishing with a whimper on Wednesday as lingering sovereign debt fears and trepidation before a crucial US labour report encouraged traders to pare risky bets ahead of the Easter weekend.The FTSE All-World index, which had welcomed the first day of the new decade by jumping 1.7 per cent, again faltered in the face of 18-month highs, and was flat by the end of trading in New York. Greek debt was again under pressure, though the euro bounced on better economic data out of Germany.The global equity benchmark has added 2.6 per cent in the first three months of the year, but that advance disguises a 6.7 plunge at the most febrile point of the eurozone’s sovereign debt woes in February.Those worries have characterised the quarter and are still affecting sentiment. However, of more immediate concern, perhaps, is the market’s need for confirmation that the year-long rally is not assuming a rosier economic scenario than is the case.The US non-farm payrolls numbers due on Friday – consensus is for a net 190,000 jobs added – may go a long way to address that anxiety. But before that, traders got a clue to the health of the jobs market from the ADP employment report released on Wednesday.It was a disappointment. ADP showed 23,000 private sector jobs were shed in March, compared with forecasts for a 40,000 gain.The news hit US stocks, the S&P 500 down 0.3 per cent at close, with heavier initial losses pared following slightly better than expected data on factory orders and an announcement by President Barack Obama that he plans to open up more US waters to drilling for oil.“Tomorrow’s releases of Challenger job cut and initial jobless claims figures will become key indicators, and Friday’s employment figures could well be trend-changing for thin markets, if they reflect the weakness seen in today’s ADP figures,” said Nick Beecroft, senior forex consultant at Saxo Bank.Indeed, Goldman Sachs encapsulated the dichotomy facing investors as they ponder the big factors that may drive assets from here.“The most plausible catalysts for fresh highs in equities are the combination of steady growth news and lower inflation on the macro side or upcoming earnings on the micro side,“ the bank said in a note.However, it added: “Set against this, better data – including payrolls – might translate more in the near-term into rates pressure than equity gains.”● The performance of European bourses was as wet as the continent’s weather. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 0.4 as traders tracked fluctuations in the US stock futures and later Wall Street proper. The FTSE 100 in London was saved by a strong end of session auction and added 0.1 per cent.Asian exchanges had earlier showed signs of fatigue, the FTSE Asia-Pacific index dropping 0.6 per cent. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 could not hold onto a new intraday 18-month high after exporters welcomed a softer yen. The benchmark index finally succumbed to the regional torpor and fell 0.1 per cent.China’s Shanghai Composite lost 0.6 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng also fell 0.6 per cent, completing a miserable quarter for the Chinese mainland. The SCI has lost 5.1 per cent, while across the Sea of Japan, the Nikkei has gained 5.2 per cent.● Greek government bonds continued to find few buyers after Athens said it would issue a global dollar-denominated note in late April. The yield on the seven-year note that was auctioned earlier in the week with a coupon on 5.9 per cent was up 11 basis points to 6.36 per cent. Greek 10-years sported a yield of 6.51 per cent, up 9 basis points, having earlier hit the highest in five weeks, as investors continued to doubt the ability of Athens to manage its fiscal deficit.With the German benchmark yield down 2 basis points at 3.08 per cent, the premium investors demand for Greek notes relative to Bunds widened to 344 bp. The cost of insuring Greek debt against default move to its highest level since the start of the month.The yield on US benchmark 10-year Treasuries pulled back from 10-month highs, dropping 2bp to 3.83 per cent as the weak ADP data trumped worries about supply and the end of quantitative easing.● The euro was able to shrug off the deterioration in the lowly rated sovereign debt market, as traders preferred to focus for the time being on news of an unexpected drop in German unemployment and a bounce in the nation’s engineering orders. Data showing eurozone unemployment rising to 10 per cent appeared to have little impact.The single currency rose 0.7 per cent against the dollar to $1.3509, and added 1.4 per cent to Y126.23 against a broadly weak yen.The yen’s tough day extended the dollar as well. The greenback held the Y93 mark at the end of currency trading, its highest close since last August.“The industrial production showed the first decline in a year …raising fears that the recovery process could be stalling,” said currency strategists at BNP Paribas. “A break above the 92.95 high seen last week will trigger gains towards the 93.75 [intraday] high seen at the beginning of the year.”The dollar index, a measure tracking the buck’s performance against a basket of its peers, fell 0.5 per cent to 81.07 as investors reacted to the soft ADP numbers.● Copper fell back from the 20-month intraday highs hit in the previous session, losing 0.4 per cent to $3.54 per pound in New York trading. Gold climbed 1 per cent to $1,114 an ounce, resuming its tight inverse correlation to the dollar.In spite of the pullback in equities, oil rallied, rising 1.2 per cent to $83.38 after bearish US inventory data, its highest mark since October 2008. Oil has typically closely tracked global stocks during the quarter, rising 2.8 per cent since January 1, nearly matching a 2.7 per cent advance for the FTSE All-World index. So it was a surprise to see a rare, stark departure.“The rally is a factor of the quarter- and month-end booking keeping,” said Mike Fitzpatrick, vice president of energy at futures brokerage MF Global. “We think this rally is also driven by surrogate money, with investors shifting cash from financials into [physical] commodities expressive of true value because they lack trust in financials right now.”Additional reporting by Telis Demos
89;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;Weak economic data weigh on yen;Euro shows strength against US currency;The yen fell to a three-month low against the dollar on Wednesday as weak economic data boosted the Japanese currency’s funding credentials.Traders said the yen was also undermined by the prospect of increased capital outflows from Japan as new investment strategies were implemented and capital allocated by Japanese companies at the start of the new fiscal year in Tokyo. The Japanese manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell in March while Japanese earnings dropped by more than expected.In addition, figures showed housing starts in Japan fell for the first time in five months in February.The news heightened expectations that monetary conditions in Japan were set to remain loose for the foreseeable future, in contrast to the US where Treasury yields have risen sharply in recent weeks.That has seen the yen fall against the dollar as the prospect of low interest rates in Japan has improved its relative attractiveness as a funding currency for carry trades, in which low-yielding currencies are sold to finance the purchase of riskier, higher yielding assets elsewhere.Ulrich Leuchtmann, of Commerzbank, said in an environment in which the global economy seemed to be recovering and stock markets were not providing any cause for concern, the yen was not in demand as a haven. “We expect that the recovery of the global economy is not only going to lead to a rise in risk appetite but also increase the Japanese rate disadvantage significantly,” he said.The yen fell to a low of Y93.59 against the dollar, its weakest level since January 8. It recovered some poise, however, after the ADP survey of US private sector employment came in weaker than expected.The Japanese currency was 0.8 per cent lower at Y93.52 in late New York trade. It also dropped 1.5 per cent to a two-month low of Y126.32 against the euro and lost 1.5 per cent to Y141.93 against the pound. Meanwhile, the euro rose 0.7 per cent to $1.3511 against the dollar as figures showed a surprise fall in German unemployment and eurozone inflation came in higher than forecast.The euro was also supported as demand for the European Central Bank’s final six-month, long-term refinancing operation came in lower than expected.Elsewhere, the dollar fell 0.7 per cent to $1.5181 against the pound and lost 1.2 per cent to SFr1.0540 against the Swiss franc.But the Australian dollar slid against the US dollar, down 0.2 per cent to $0.9176, after data showed an unexpected drop in March retail sales. The figures dealt a blow to expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia would move to raise interest rates at its policy meeting on April 6.
90;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2010-03-31T17:29:47Z;US jobs data;;So much for US traders hoping for a long weekend break for Easter. Positive jobs data on Wednesday could have provided some comfort that Friday’s all-important payrolls data would live up to their upbeat billing.Instead, the ADP employment report showed a 23,000 decline last month, undershooting expectations of a 40,000 rise.Friday is made more complicated by the fact that Europeans will be on holiday and Americans are itching to join them. US stock markets are closed and bond markets would have been likewise, but for the payrolls report.Friday is not a holiday in government circles, hence the release date. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says it works to a set timetable for data collection and, once gathered, it cannot choose a release date.For the markets, the extremely thin conditions will only exacerbate the volatility associated with “Payrolls Friday”.Confusing the message from Wednesday’s numbers is the fact that the ADP report has historically been a poor predictor of payrolls, but for the past three months it has been virtually spot on.Now investors have to choose. Follow ADP, and temper payrolls bets, or stick to the pre-ADP forecasts for a 180,000-plus rise.There are, as ever, two tracks to consider: the near-term likely market mood, and what the data tell longer-term investors about the outlook.Short-term expectations are still for a gain as job disruption from the “snowmageddon” of January fades and census-related hiring picks up.But neither of those points to a genuine recovery. Private sector hiring might creep higher, but the ADP report suggests it is anaemic at best. Bulls will note how employment always lags behind the upturn. They are right but lacklustre jobs creation does not point to executive confidence. Expect a quiet day in the markets on Thursday ahead of the report but that will be the calm ahead of the storm.
91;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2010-03-31T15:02:03Z;US companies cut 23,000 jobs in March;;US companies continued to cut jobs in March, dashing hopes that private sector employers would begin hiring for the first time in two years.Private businesses cut 23,000 workers this month, according to a survey from ADP employer services. on Wednesday. That failed to meet expectations of Wall Street analysts who were expecting gains of 40,000, but was the smallest monthly total of job losses since February 2008.“The latest numbers will douse some of the ebullient expectations ahead of Friday’s number, though the trend is still ultimately favourable,” said Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS Securities.Producers of goods, such as manufacturers, continued to weigh on the labour market in March, with employment in that sector falling by 51,000. A bright note was the services sector, which added 28,000 workers and marked its second consecutive monthly rise.The ADP report comes ahead of Friday’s closely watched government non-farm payrolls figures. The US economy is expected to have added 200,000 jobs with the unemployment rate holding steady at 9.7 per cent.Wednesday’s data could be understated because it does not track census hiring, which is expected to account for 100,000 jobs, and because it does not make adjustments for weather, which depressed February’s official report.In March, small businesses fared the worst, culling 12,000 jobs. Meanwhile, large companies cut 7,000 workers and mid-sized groups cut 4,000.Economists have been wary that the jobs market is lagging so far behind the rest of the economy’s recovery and that the growing problem of long-term unemployment could be leading an erosion of skills among displaced workers.“Roughly nine months after the recession in output finished last year, the economy is still losing jobs,” said Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at Capital Economics. “Yes, employment sometimes lags output by a few months, but not normally by this long.”Separately on Wednesday, commerce department figures showed that US factory orders climbed by 0.6 per cent to $383.5bn in February after rising by a revised 2.5 per cent the prior month. It was the 10th rise in the last 11 months as businesses have looked to replenish inventories to meet renewed demand.
92;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Ethical investors want more proof of good deeds;Clients and advisers push for tougher validation of data;Last year, investors ploughed $20.6bn into US sustainable investment funds compared with $5.5bn of net inflows in 2018, according to Morningstar, the data provider.But despite the near fourfold increase in investor interest, advisers are sceptical about the company and asset management data showing the environmental, social and governance impact of the funds themselves.“I struggle mightily. I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported data and I just don’t buy it,” says Traci Richmond, a financial adviser with The Meakem Group in Bethesda, Maryland.The problem with ESG data is the lack of verification. “There’s so much data and information out there, it’s really, truly a data war,” says Tim Williams, the director of education initiatives at the Money Management Institute, a trade association.Morningstar, Bloomberg and MSCI are among the providers of ESG data and rankings. Each has recently attempted to address investors’ scepticism by seeking out more third-party verification. MSCI, for example, points to “alternative data sets” published by “sources outside of the company” that help “minimise reliance on voluntary disclosure”.There is also a growing trend to adopt ESG reporting standards set by organisations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TFCD). But these bodies cannot set mandatory rules on data verification.I don’t believe the indexes. They are using self-reported dataThe US Securities and Exchange Commission has resisted adopting measures that some investor groups have proposed. Hester Peirce, one of the commissioners, has been openly disdainful of the ESG trend, describing it as “labelling based on incomplete information, public shaming, and shunning wrapped in moral rhetoric preached with cold-hearted, self-righteous oblivion to the consequences, which ultimately fall on real people.”Even so, late last year the SEC sent letters to some fund managers who target socially responsible assets, asking them to provide data on what factors they took into consideration.With no clear state-backed scrutiny of ESG data, investors and advisers must uncover deficits or misrepresentations in the growing pool of facts and figures themselves. “The challenge is how do you take all that information and turn it into useful investment decisions at all levels of the food chain,” Mr Williams says.Many wirehouses, the national brokerages selling investment services via advisers, have started to provide tools and resources to help clients better evaluate ESG data — and not just accept them at face value.Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and UBS have increased their spending to acquire higher quality data and better sorting mechanisms for funds and assets that purport to be socially responsible.Last summer, Morgan Stanley launched a tool to help investors and advisers uncover misalignments between their portfolios’ assets and socially responsible objectives. The tool only uses third-party verified data and identifies where data quality deficits persist, says Courtney Thompson, a vice-president in Morgan Stanley’s Global Sustainable Finance group. “Having the data available is a key [and is] driving traction around the investments.”Morningstar also advises investors to be sceptical of fund managers and companies claiming a socially responsible focus. “I would caution investors that, while ESG index funds on the whole separate ‘better’ ESG companies from ‘worse’ ones reasonably well, those decisions are not based on fundamental evaluations and mistakes can be made,” says Jon Hale, Morningstar’s head of sustainability research. “Companies have started to understand that their ESG and sustainability disclosures are being scrutinised more heavily, and that helps.”Investors should seek underlying holdings reports from fund managers “so they can look at really what exposures they have”, says Vanessa Jilot, a financial adviser at Viewpoint Financial Network in Pleasanton, California. “My clients hope that, as you have more money moving to request ESG data, reporting will get better.”
93;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2010-03-07T22:34:43Z;The careerist: Pro bono work;‘You have graduates reporting directly to the chairman’;"Pro bono work is usually thought of as the preserve of lawyers, but organisations as varied as advertising agencies and professional services firms also donate their staff’s time to good causes – either for free or for reduced fees. Although employees should do pro bono work for selfless reasons, your good deeds can also be rewarded in terms of your career.How does pro bono work add to my experience?
If you are relatively junior, it can be a very good way to step up. “People who do pro bono work in the Accenture Development Partnerships typically take on more senior roles than they would in big corporate roles,” says Royce Bell, a senior executive at the consultancy firm. “You get to see a lot of nuts and bolts and it’s very good to get outside the normal cosy corporate world. You’d think that someone who sets up an IT system in Chad would have a broader view than a person who has only worked in Fortune 200 companies.”Six years ago, Maya Mehta, a senior associate at Clifford Chance, the law firm, set up the legal advice surgery for the Newham Asian Women’s Project in London. “It’s a great way to sharpen your skills as a lawyer,” she says. “Particularly with the high level of client contact and range of issues. As a trainee in Hong Kong, working with Filipino women who had been abused made me realise how much I could help others just by applying basic legal skills.”What about opportunities for building relationships?
Pro bono work often brings together people from different parts of organisations who might not otherwise meet.Phil Georgiadis, chairman of Walker Media, the London agency, says it can cut through hierarchies, too. “I’m about to do some work for Great Ormond Street Hospital and I’ll enlist a couple of graduates to work with me – that’ll be the account team. So suddenly you have a graduate who is reporting directly to the chairman, which is very rare,” he explains.What about job satisfaction?
Using your professional skills in the service of good causes often adds a kind of ethical dimension to your career and can be very motivating. Ms Mehta says the inspiration for starting the NAWP pro bono scheme came about from reading about forced marriages and honour killings: “It got to the point where I couldn’t just turn the page. I wanted to do something about it.”She says it is also one way of bridging the divide between Canary Wharf and the less privileged areas that surround it.Pro bono work can be rewarding in other ways, too. Mr Georgiadis says you can be freer to be more creative with work done for charities: “You often have the opportunity to do some really interesting marketing and [you have more leeway] than you might have with, say, a breakfast cereal.”Mr Bell adds that ADP projects tend to be smaller and shorter than their corporate counterparts: “It’s much easier to see overall results and understand the positive effect of what you are doing.”Are there any downsides?
Those who go on long-term schemes such as the ADP may be asked to take a reduced salary – although in the case of the ADP, if you’re in Chad or Mongolia, even a reduced salary lets you live pretty well."
94;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T20:08:49+0000;Short View: Jobs data full of sound and fury;;The monthly ritual of the US non-farm payroll data is always full of sound and fury. Usually it signifies little more than nothing. The key data are notoriously subject to revisions.February’s instalment, due on Friday, could be a classic. The employment picture is finely balanced, but clouded by snow and by the need to take a count of Americans.The north-eastern US has had a terrible winter. Thus seasonal effects could keep payrolls much lower than forecasters, working only with economic variables, had been predicting.But there is another one-off effect, as workers are hired to help carry out the national census, which happens once each decade. This is also hard for economists to model.The ADP survey of private sector employment, a good indicator, was no worse than expected this week. But this may be because it does not take account of weather – it barely dipped after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, while official numbers were seriously dented.This week’s ISM survey of supply managers in the services sector showed employment recovering more than expected. Without the weather, there might by now be a strong wave of opinion waiting for an emphatically strong number from payrolls.That in turn would have a disproportionate impact on confidence across world markets because, unlike other important economic variables, US employment has not yet started to recover – it is merely worsening at a much slower rate. This fits with the fear of “bears”, that the recovery is merely the result of a temporary restocking boom as companies expand their inventories in response to a rebound in new orders and the latest ISM figures suggest that the restocking effect may now be fading.A strong employment report could decisively address such concerns – but the picture will be obscured by snow. That in turn means that traders should brace for more sound and fury than usual.john.authers@ft.comVideo: www.ft.com/shortview
95;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Job-cutting at US companies falls to two-year low;;US businesses cut jobs at the slowest rate in two years in February, offering hope that the economy could soon begin adding workers, while the services sector continued to expand.Private companies shed 20,000 workers in February, according to a survey from ADP employer services. That was the smallest decline in employment since job losses began mounting in February 2008.Wall Street analysts were expecting more job losses last month and Wednesday’s data were an improvement from January’s job cut tally.The monthly decline in employment was the result of continued pressure in the goods producing sector, which shed 37,000 workers. However, within that sector manufacturers added 3,000 employees, recording their first monthly increase in more than a year.The services sector continued to show renewed strength, adding 17,000 jobs. It was the second consecutive monthly rise in the sector.Small businesses felt the brunt of the job cuts in February, sheding18,000 workers. Big companies cut 10,000 jobs, while medium-sized groups added 8,000.Some analysts have warned that the debate about healthcare reform is scuppering the healing of the labour market by creating uncertainty for small businesses regarding the insurance costs they will face.The ADP report comes two days before the official government employment report, which is expected to show 58,000 jobs lost last month and the unemployment rate ticking up to 9.8 per cent. Economists expect harsh winter weather to skew the February jobless figures for the worse.Lawmakers are continuing to seek ways to stimulate the labour market. Last week the US Senate passed a $15bn jobs package to create tax incentives for businesses to hire workers.On Tuesday night, Barack Obama, president, signed a bill extending jobless benefits after one senator gave up his bid to block the effort because the extension would add to the deficit.Meanwhile, a separate report on Wednesday from the Institute of Supply Management showed that the US services sector expanded for the second month running in February, with new orders and supplier deliveries gaining momentum.ISM’s non-manufacturing index climbed to 53 last month from 50.5 in January, beating estimates. A reading above 50 signals expansion and the February figure was the highest since October 2007. Employment in the services sector continued to contract last month, according to ISM, however the pace of that contraction slowed.Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at Capital Economics, noted that the ISM data suggest that the US economy is growing at annualised rate of 2 per cent, pointing to a “modest” recovery.
96;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2010-02-03T21:39:33Z;Traders seek cues from data as rally fades;Concern lingers about sovereign debt risk;21:25 GMT. The boost to risk appetite from a slew of upbeat global manufacturing reports showed signs of fading on Wednesday, as investors sought confirmation that the recovery was also taking hold in service sectors and the labour market.The FTSE World equity index fell 0.4 per cent and Wall Street gave up 0.6 per cent as the impetus of recent days dwindled.Global stocks had earlier this week been able to claw back a decent chunk of January’s losses after Monday’s reports on factory activity painted the picture of a broad improvement. The navigation of a number of political issues – such as the reappointment of Ben Bernanke as Federal Reserve chairman, a perceived toning down in the White House’s bank-bashing rhetoric, and chatter that the Volcker Rule may not come to pass – has also helped sentiment.For most developed countries, however, it is services that account for the vast majority of activity, and surveys of the sector in Europe and the US on Wednesday may be crucial in determining whether the risk rally can proceed.So far, the report card reads “could do better” – something for the European Central Bank and Bank of England to ponder as they prepare to release their latest decisions on interest rates on Thursday.The eurozone service sector expanded in January at a slower pace than for the previous month. But at least it expanded – the fifth consecutive month it has done so. Of some concern, however, is the divergence within the region. Just as was the case with manufacturing, Germany and France did well while Spain contracted for the 25th month in a row.In addition, the UK service sector expanded at its slowest pace since August. Snow, a phenomenon apparently peculiar to Britain, was blamed. And across the pond, their peers in the US enjoyed the first month of growth since October, though the pace of activity was a touch slower than had been forecast.But the final piece of the bull-market jigsaw is jobs. Few analysts believe the appetite for riskier assets can continue without a clear sign that the US workforce is growing again. The ADP report on private sector employment released on Wednesday showed 22,000 jobs lost in January, a sharp improvement from the 61,000 cut in December. Thursday sees the weekly initial claims number and Friday the mother of all data, the non-farm payrolls.Some analysts are daring to talk of a net gain in employment for last month.“Today’s [ADP] report indicates January non-farm payrolls should come in at an initial plus 25,000 and be revised to a final plus 39,000,” said Michael Woolfolk, forex strategist at BNY Mellon in New York.In the meantime, there is still the lurking Gollum of sovereign risk. It will be interesting to see the market’s reaction to the European Commission’s formal assessment of Greece’s deficit reduction plan. Will it calm nerves or simply allow the markets to shift their gaze to one of the other fiscally strapped so-called peripheral economies, such as Spain or Portugal? News of Spain’s weak service sector will only increase investor wariness.● Greek government bonds were a bit more popular, as traders absorbed the broadly supportive comments from the EC about Athens’ budget proposals, though the yield of 6.68 per cent, down 7 basis points, suggested investors remained nervous. The yield spread with German Bunds tightened to just below 350 basis points, compared to more than 400bp last week.Portugal’s 10-year yield at one stage spiked by 30 basis points to 4.75 per cent, its highest since March last year. It was later trading up 25 basis points at 4.70 per cent. Meanwhile, Portugal’s 5-year credit default swaps, which set a cost for insuring the nation’s debt against default, rose to a record high of 196 basis points, according to Reuters.US 10-year Treasury yields were up 6 basis points, to 3.70 per cent, after the Treasury gave details of the $81bn of debt sales next week.● European bourses initially reacted positively to the late portion of Wall Street’s 1.1 per cent rally overnight, but then pulled back as New York’s new session got off to a poor start. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 lost 0.7 per cent and the FTSE 100 in London fell 0.6 per cent.Asia saw good gains, with Chinese stocks in particular putting some miserable recent performances behind them. The Shanghai Composite, which has been among the worst hit of major markets of late on fears of monetary tightening, jumped 2.4 per cent, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong leapt 2.2 per cent, with resources and mining groups in demand. The Nikkei 225 climbed 0.3 per cent and the FTSE Asia-Pacific index advanced 1.3 per cent.● The euro lost its early gains as traders awaited further developments on the eurozone’s fiscal woes. News that eurozone retail sales had fallen by 1.6 per cent in the year to December contributed to the single currency losing 0.4 per cent versus the dollar.The buck rose 0.5 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. “The 22,000 decline in Jan ADP is the smallest loss since February 2008, which serves to bolster the US data-driven argument for prolonged USD gains,” said Ashraf Laidi at CMC.● Gold breached $1,120, taking its gains to more than $40 since its close on Friday. However, as the dollar found its footing the precious metal fell back, and was later down 0.5 per cent at $1,109.Oil also pared an early advance. After surging 3.8 per cent on Tuesday, crude fell 0.4 per cent to $76.95 as inventory data provided little support.
97;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;ADP shows US job cuts at two-year low;;Companies in the US last month cut jobs at their slowest rate in two years, in a sign that the labour force is slowly mending.Separately on Wednesday, the Institute of Supply Management’s latest survey of the services sector showed activity rising for the first time in three months and climbing to the highest level since May 2008.Private businesses shed 22,000 workers in January, according to a survey by ADP employer services. It was the 10th month running that the pace of job losses declined and was better than economists predicted. December’s figures were also revised, showing 61,000 jobs lost instead of the previously estimated 84,000.“The labour market is deteriorating at a decelerating pace,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.The services sector continued to outshine goods producers, with services companies adding 38,000 jobs. It was the second consecutive month that the sector added workers.Workers at businesses that produce goods continued to be punished in January, with 60,000 employees shed from payrolls. Manufacturing saw some improvement, as the decline of 25,000 workers was the smallest drop since January 2008.Construction workers remain under pressure, with 37,000 jobs lost. Volatility in the residential and commercial real estate markets have hit these workers especially hard and the industry has lost 1.8m in the last two years.Big businesses and small businesses cut 19,000 jobs and 12,000 jobs respectively. However, medium-sized companies added employees for the first time in a year.Wednesday’s ADP survey sets the stage for Friday’s closely watched government employment report. Analysts expect the economy might have added 10,000 jobs last month while the unemployment rate held steady at 10 per cent.Meanwhile, ISM’s non-manufacturing index rose to 50.5 in January from 49.8 the prior month, slightly trailing expectations. A reading greater than 50 signals expansion.The expansion was driven by improvement in employment and growth in prices. However services jobs continued to shrink, but at a slower pace, during the month, according to ISM. Of the industries surveyed, four expanded and 11 contracted.“The non-manufacturing index is being weighed down by the continuing weakness of retail sales and domestic demand in general,” said Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at Capital Economics.The non-manufacturing figures were weaker than the robust ISM data earlier this week showing strength in the factory sector.
98;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2010-01-06T21:56:30Z;US jobs data weigh on Wall Street;;"US stocks struggled to push higher on Wednesday after disappointing jobs data left investors concerned about Friday’s non-farm payrolls report.Private companies cut more jobs than expected in December, according to the survey by ADP employer services. However, the data still represented a significant improvement from the previous month.On Friday, the government is expected to report that the unemployment rate held steady last month at 10 per cent.After dipping in and out of the red, the S&P 500 closed 0.1 per cent higher to 1,137.14, which represented a 15-month high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was unchanged at 10,573.68 but the Nasdaq fell 0.3 per cent to 2,301.09.“The New Year rally appears to have stalled, suggesting that the big recovery drive in 2009 and the rally in the last two weeks of December may have already priced in current economic recovery,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC Markets. “Beyond the employment report, investors may also be awaiting corporate outlooks in the upcoming earnings season to set the tone for the year.”The market showed little reaction to the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s December meeting, which indicated that some policymakers were ready to provide more stimulus measures if needed.US Airways dropped 4.1 per cent to $5.09 after the company said air traffic in December had declined 3.6 per cent. Over the course of 2009, domestic mainline capacity was down about 8 per cent. The company also said it expected to take a non-cash charge of about $49m in relation to its decision to lease back some of the planes it loaned to Republic Airline.On Tuesday, Continental Airlines prompted a rally among airlines after reporting that revenues from its main jet operations in December fell at the slowest rate for 11 months. Continental’s shares slid 3.6 per cent to $19.88 on Wednesday.Sonic, the chain of drive-in restaurants, also prompted concerns over consumer spending after posting a first-quarter profit sharply below the consensus estimate. The group said it had suffered from the effects of high unemployment and increased competition from rivals who have been cutting prices aggressively in the recession. The shares fell 13.1 per cent to $8.91.Elsewhere in the consumer sector, Walgreen reported an unexpected drop in December like-for-like sales, sending its shares down 0.8 per cent to $36.72. “Consumer concerns over high unemployment and the challenging economy were a drag on holiday sales at the end of November, and we’ve seen a similar pattern through mid-December,” said Greg Wasson, chief executive of the retail pharmacy chain.However, Family Dollar Stores climbed 12.5 per cent to $30.92 after the discount retailer posted a higher-than-expected profit for its fiscal first quarter. The company, which sells household brands at discounted prices, said it had begun to attract higher-
income customers.Beazer Homes weighed on the market after announcing it would issue 18m common shares and $50m of new debt. The issue overshadowed encouraging quarterly results, sending the shares down 12 per cent to $4.77. The group said it had seen the fastest growth in the western US, where orders rose 41 per cent in the final three months of last year.Monsanto, the world’s largest seed producer, reported a surprise quarterly loss due to falling herbicide sales in Brazil and Europe. The group has been gradually scaling down its herbicide business, which has suffered from increased competition. After early losses, the shares closed 1.5 per cent higher at $84.79.Goldman Sachs gave a boost to 3M, adding the diversified manufacturer to its “conviction buy” list. Shares in 3M rose 1.4 per cent to $83.67. The bank also upgraded Boise to “buy” from “neutral”, helping to lift the paper and packaging manufacturer’s shares 8.4 per cent to $5.91.Wells Fargo raised Tenneco, the world’s largest maker of vehicle exhausts, to “outperform” from “market perform”, sending its shares 2.5 per cent higher to $20.76."
99;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2010-01-06T15:33:40Z;US groups shed fewest jobs since March 2008;;US businesses shed the fewest workers since March 2008 last month as the flood of job losses continued to slow, figures showed on Wednesday.Separately, the Institute of Supply Management said that the US services sector expanded slightly in December but continued to lag behind the recovery in the smaller manufacturing sector.Private companies cut 84,000 jobs, according to a survey by ADP employer services, the ninth consecutive month that the pace of job cuts declined. The result was slightly worse than economists projected but marked a strong improvement from the prior month when 169,000 jobs were lost.“Payrolls will soon be positive,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.A highlight in the December figures was job creation in the services sector, which added 12,000 workers. That was the first time the sector had added jobs since March 2008.The strength in services, however, was blunted by the loss of 96,000 jobs from companies that produce goods, with nearly half of those concentrated among manufacturers.Big companies with more than 500 employees were the most aggressive with layoffs last month, reducing their payrolls by 34,000. Small and medium-sized companies each cut 25,000 workers.ADP’s survey was in line with a separate report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a US outplacement firm, showing that job cut announcements fell last month to the lowest level since the recession began in December 2007. The total of 45,094 announcements was a 73 per cent drop from the same month a year ago and marked the fifth month running that job cut announcements eased.Economists keep a close watch over the ADP and Challenger figures ahead of Friday’s official non-farm payrolls report. According to estimates of Wall Street analysts, the US economy might have created jobs in December, although the unemployment rate is likely to hold steady at 10 per cent.Meanwhile, the latest ISM non-manufacturing survey rebounded from 48.7 in November to 50.1 last month. A reading above 50 signals expansion, but Wednesday’s data suggest that activity is increasing at a slower pace than economists expected.“The service sector is the unusually soft piece in the recovery story,” said Alan Ruskin, a strategist at RBS Securities.Unlike ADP, which reported that employment has been growing in the services sector, ISM saw contraction in 12 of the 18 industries that it tracks. However, retail, finance and public administration saw employment expand.The tepid activity in the US services sector is lagging behind the resurgence in manufacturing, which according to ISM reached its highest level of activity since 2006 in December.Paul Ashworth, senior US economist at Capital Economics, argues that the disparity is due to manufacturers “riding the coattails” of the global industrial recovery and reaping the benefits of a weaker US dollar. However, the US services sector is continuing to battle weaker domestic demand.
100;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2009-12-02T22:29:03Z;Yield-hungry investors shrug off Dubai;;The search for yield continued on currency markets as investor confidence improved, although the rise in risk appetite was tempered by a degree of lingering caution.Traders took a steady approach ahead of Friday’s US employment data. They received a foretaste of the non-farm payrolls report on Wednesday after the ADP monthly employment report suggested 169,000 jobs were lost in the private sector in November, roughly in line with market forecasts.The reaction was muted, however, and the dollar slipped against most other currencies, as equity markets continued to trade higher – an indication that risk assets were again in play after last week’s Dubai debt shock.“Suggestions that Dubai World will restructure its debts and that perhaps the problem was always regionally-centric has allowed risk appetite to rear its head again,” said Stuart Bennett at Calyon.In the immediate aftermath of Dubai World’s announcement that it was to restructure its debt and halt repayments for six months, investors piled into the perceived safety of dollar assets. But the effects were only fleeting as fears of contagion into other emerging markets were seen as overplayed.“If sentiment deteriorates the dollar serves as a safe haven. However, investors are now used to crises and leave safe havens increasingly quickly when the storm is over,” said Antje Praefcke at Commerzbank.Among emerging market currencies, the Hungarian forint was up 0.5 per cent to Ft178.89 against the dollar, while the South African rand added 0.5 per cent to R7.3376 and the Mexican peso jumped 0.8 per cent to 12.75 pesos.Against the major currenciess, the dollar was mixed late in New York, down 0.1 per cent versus sterling to $1.6614, but up 0.3 per cent to the euro at $1.5042, as higher gold prices also kept the US currency in check.After an early slide, as a funding currency for carry trades, the dollar recovered ground against higher yielding currencies. In late New York trade, the dollar was up 0.1 per cent at $0.9243 against its Australian counterpart. The US dollar was 0.7 per cent higher at $0.7210 versus the New Zealand dollar.“The higher-yielding currencies, particularly the Aussie, have performed well lately as a move out of fear into yield is becoming more apparent,” said Phil McHugh at Currencies Direct.The yen was weaker across the board, down 0.8 per cent against the dollar to Y87.41, after the Bank of Japan on Tuesday announced new liquidity measures.The yen fell 1 per cent against the pound to Y145.39 and slid 0.6 per cent versus the euro to Y131.47.
101;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2009-12-02T20:12:41Z;Fed sees subdued economic rebound;;Economic recovery is spreading and strengthening slightly, but the rebound remains subdued, according to the latest beige book survey by the Federal Reserve.The survey was released soon after Judd Gregg, a Republican member of the Senate banking committee declared his support for Ben Bernanke’s reappointment to a second term as Fed chairman – a welcome fillip for the Fed chief ahead of his confirmation hearing on Thursday.Most experts anticipate bruising questioning for the Fed chairman amid congressional concern over the scope of Fed powers revealed by the crisis and public anger of its role in bail-outs.The 12 regional Fed banks reported that “economic conditions have generally improved modestly since the last report” – with eight citing some pick-up in their regions. The east, south-east and parts of the Mid-west appeared to be lagging behind, with conditions in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond and Atlanta Fed districts “little changed” or “mixed”.While the previous beige book report – released on October 21 – stated “virtually every reference to improvement was qualified as either small or scattered”, the latest report upgraded the assessment slightly, repeatedly characterising the recovery as modest or moderate.However, the Fed continued to use language that denoted a soft rather than powerful rebound.“Consumer spending was reported to have picked up moderately,” the survey said, while manufacturing was “on balance steady to moderately improving”.The Fed said banks reported “steady to weaker loan demand” amid “continued tight credit standards” and “steady to deteriorating loan quality” – one reason why the recovery may continue to be a weak one for some time.The regional Feds said labour market conditions “remained weak” though there were “signs of stabilisation” and even “scattered signs of improvement” – holding out some hope that the jobless rate could soon stabilise.Their view was supported by jobless data on Wednesday that showed the pace of layoffs continuing to abate. US companies cut 169,000 jobs last month but it was the smallest number since July 2008. Private companies have shed fewer jobs in each of the past eight months, according to a survey by ADP, the employer services group.Although the November figure was an improvement on October’s revised figure of 195,000, it was higher than economists had been expecting.“Although overall economic activity is stabilising, employment usually trails economic activity, so it is likely to decline for at least a few more months,” ADP said in its report.The ADP survey comes ahead of tomorrow’s government non-farm payrolls report, which is expected to show that the US economy shed 123,000 jobs last month, leaving the unemployment rate at about 10.2 per cent. In the past two years, 7.3m Americans have lost their jobs.Big businesses fared better than their mid-sized and smaller counterparts in November. Large companies, with more than 500 workers, shed 44,000 jobs, while medium and small companies cut 57,000 and 68,000 workers, respectively.Economists have been keeping a close eye on jobless claims figures, which have also been slowly creeping lower, as an indicator for when the economy will begin creating jobs. However, most analysts agree that until benefits claims stay consistently at the 400,000-per-week level, job creation will not occur.A bright note on Wednesday came from a report by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a placement company, that said job cut announcements had plunged by 73 per cent in November from a year ago, when the recession was at its worst.
102;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;US sheds 169,000 private sector jobs;;US companies cut 169,000 jobs last month as the pace of layoffs continued to abate slowly, figures showed on Wednesday.Private companies have shed fewer jobs in each of the past eight months, according to a survey by ADP employer services, and last month marked the smallest number of cuts since July 2008.Although the November figure was an improvement on October’s revised figure of 195,000, it was higher than economists had been expecting.“Although overall economic activity is stabilising, employment usually trails economic activity, so it is likely to decline for at least a few more months,” ADP said in its report.Employment in the services sector continues to be stubbornly high, with 81,000 jobs lost in the month. Companies that produce goods cut 88,000 jobs, but the decline in manufacturing employment was the smallest since May 2008.The ADP survey comes ahead of Friday’s government non-farm payrolls report, which is expected to show that the US economy shed 123,000 jobs last month, leaving the unemployment rate at about 10.2 per cent. In the past two years, 7.3m Americans have lost their jobs.On Thursday, Barack Obama, US president, will hold a jobs forum at the White House, gathering business leaders and economists to brainstorm ways of boosting employment more quickly.Big businesses fared better than their mid-sized and smaller counterparts in November. Large companies, with more than 500 workers, shed 44,000 jobs, while medium and small companies cut 57,000 and 68,000 workers, respectively.Economists have been keeping a close eye on jobless claims figures, which have also been slowly creeping lower, as an indicator for when the US economy will begin creating jobs. However, most analysts agree that until benefits claims stay consistently at the 400,000-per-week level, job creation will not occur.A bright note on Wednesday came from a report by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a placement company, that said job cut announcements had plunged by 73 per cent in November from a year ago, when the recession was at its worst.John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros, economists at RDQ Economics, said: “The rate of job cut announcements has declined sharply this year to levels seen during normal expansions.“While initial jobless claims are still at levels that point to net payroll declines, these layoff announcements data suggest that initial claims will continue to drop during this quarter.”
103;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2009-11-04T23:26:35Z;Overview: Fed calms investor fears;;Wall Street stocks pared much of their gains late on Wednesday, the dollar lost ground and long-dated Treasury bond yields rose after the Federal Reserve left US interest rates unchanged and reaffirmed its commitment to keep borrowing costs low for an “extended period.”The US central bank also said household spending appeared to be expanding, but remained constrained by ongoing job losses. After September’s policy meeting, the Fed referred to spending as ”stabilising.”The Fed statement also listed low rates of resource allocation, subdued inflation trends and stable inflation expectations as new reasons for keeping rates low for an extended period. “Those three factors could make an argument for exceptionally low rates for a very extended period,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS.The comments from the central bank came hard on the heels of data showing that the pace of US service sector growth had declined last month.The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index eased to 50.6 from 50.9 in September, a weaker figure than expected but still above the 50 level that signals expansion. Mr Ruskin, said: “The latest data certainly play to the economic rationale about why it is too soon for the Fed to signal future tightening.”Economists expressed particular concern about a sharp drop in the employment component of the ISM services report from 44.3 to 41.1.Earlier in the session, ADP Employers Services said that US private sector employers had cut 203,000 jobs in October, fewer than a revised 227,000 in September, but a little more than expected.Mike Englund at Action Economics said the ISM and ADP figures “elevated the downside risk” for tomorrow’s crucial non-farm payrolls report.US equities were choppy, and after the S&P 500 rose as much as 1.5 per cent following the Fed’s statement, it tumbled in the last half hour of trade, as financials slumped, and closed up 0.1 per cent. Earlier, the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 1.6 per cent.In Asia, the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo rose 0.4 per cent while the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.5 per cent, taking its advance so far this week to 4.4 per cent.Meanwhile, credit default swap spreads narrowed on both sides of the Atlantic.Longer-dated US government bonds sold off as investors absorbed details of the Treasury’s record quarterly refunding and the Fed’s easy policy stance. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury rose 6 basis points to 3.53 per cent, while 10-year inflation bonds priced in a future inflation rate of 2.13 per cent, up from 2.06 per cent.In Europe, the yield on the 10-year German Bund yield rose 3bp to 3.32 per cent while the 10-year UK gilt yield added 6bp to 3.78 per cent ahead of policy decisions from the European Central Bank and the Bank of England on Thursday.The main focus for the markets will be on whether the UK’s monetary policy committee extends its quantitative easing programme. “We suspect that the majority of MPC members will decide that a further £25bn ($41bn) extension of the QE programme to £200bn is warranted, to give the recovery a further helping hand,” said Howard Archer at IHS Global Insight.Sterling rose on the currency markets after data showed that UK service sector activity had hit its highest level for two years. The dollar fell back from Tuesday’s one-month high against the euro as the Fed emphasised rates would stay low.The US currency’s retreat also lent support to commoditiy prices. The benchmark oil price briefly rose above $81 a barrel after data showed an unexpected decline in US crude inventories last week. Gold reached a fresh record high just shy of $1,100 an ounce.David Rosenberg, chief strategist at Gluskin Sheff, was bullish on the prospects for the metal.“Looking at the growth rates in fiat currency that central banks are creating to stimulate their economies and the amount of bullion that would be necessary to back up this massive global monetary infusion suggests that gold can at least double if not triple from here,” he said.
104;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2009-11-04T17:57:28Z;Job data welcomed as markets await Fed;‘Great correlation trade’ returns as investors’ risk appetite grows, while gold hits a new high;The “great correlation trade” crunched back into gear on Wednesday as markets successfully negotiated the day’s important batch of data, pushing equities, oil and gold higher and forcing the dollar lower ahead of an eagerly anticipated announcement from the US Federal Reserve.The US-based ADP employment report showed that 203,000 private sector jobs were lost in October. Although this was slightly more than the 190,000 forecast by analysts, investors welcomed the fact it represented the smallest number of job losses for the survey since July 2008.Markets are desperate for evidence that the US labour market is showing meaningful improvement, so such surveys – particularly the non-farm payrolls due on Friday – can set the market’s tone for several days.US equities opened higher, and extended their gains as traders chose to dismiss weaker than expected service sector numbers. The S&P 500 was up 1.1 per cent at 17:00 GMT. Better than expected third-quarter results from media group Time Warner also helped sentiment.Bond yields rose as traders became less-risk averse. The yield on the US 10-year Treasury was pushed above the 3.5 per cent level, up 4 basis points at 3.51 per cent.But the most crucial piece of news will be the announcement later today from the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee. No change in the main interest rate is expected but traders will watch the accompanying statement for any suggestion that the Fed is poised to row back from its ultra-loose monetary policy.Sharp movements in the dollar often occur following the Fed’s announcement. Any strengthening of the greenback could weigh heavily on equities and commodities, though it should be noted that many in the market feel the Fed always tries to ensure it delivers no unpleasant surprises.Bank of England and European Central Bank monetary decisions are due on Thursday.Earlier in the trading day, service sector surveys across Europe had been generally well-received as investors welcomed confirmation that the dominant portion of the region’s economy grew in October at its fastest pace in 22 months.The FTSE Eurofirst 300 climbed 1.6 per cent as financial and retailing stocks rebounded, the latter aided by better-than-expected profits from UK retailer Marks & Spencer.This followed a broadly positive session for Asian indices, in which Hong Kong closed up 1.8 per cent, Shanghai added 0.5 per cent and Tokyo rose 0.4 per cent. Sentiment was helped by the World Bank raising its forecast for economic growth in developing east Asia this year.Tuesday had witnessed a dislocation to the ‘great correlation trade’ – in which a falling dollar lifts riskier assets – when gold soared despite a stronger greenback on news that India was buying 200 tonnes of the yellow metal.Oil had also bucked the GCT trend in US trading on Tuesday after solid factory order data helped it rebound from earlier losses.However, the dollar resumed its decline on Wednesday - going back above $1.48 to the euro - allowing traders to slip into familiar patterns. Gold hit a fresh record high of $1,095,05 and oil recovered the $80 a barrel level. The weekly US oil inventory data showed an unexpected fall in crude stocks.
105;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2009-11-04T14:12:11Z;US loses 203,000 jobs in October;;The US economy lost 203,000 private sector jobs in October, a survey showed on Wednesday, indicating deterioration in the labour market will persist even as the economy returns to growth.Job losses are slowing, but not as quickly as some analysts had hoped. The decrease in private sector jobs was the smallest since July 2008, and marks the seventh consecutive month of declines in job losses, the ADP National Employment report showed. The report also revised its estimates of September job loss, estimating that 227,000 had been lost, 27,000 fewer than its previous estimate.“Despite recent indications that overall economic activity is stabilising, employment, which usually trails overall economic activity, is likely to decline for at least a few more months,” ADP said in its release.The US unemployment rate has more than doubled in the past two years and the number of people without jobs has risen by 7.6m to 15.1m since the recession began in December 2007.Job losses were still widespread across industries and business sizes. The report estimates that 86,000 jobs were lost in the service sector, 117,000 in the goods-producing sector and 51,000 in the construction sector. Medium and small sized businesses lost 75,000 jobs each and large businesses employed 53,000 fewer employees.The numbers come just days after official figures showed the US economy returning to growth in the third quarter after the longest period of economic contraction since the great depression and ahead of Friday’s labour department report. Investors will be looking to see if the unemployment rate crosses the psychologically significant 10 per cent level. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect the economy to shed another 175,000 jobs and the unemployment level to reach 9.9 per cent.The data also follow results in the jobs component of the Institute of Supply Management’s survey which indicated a surprise stabilising of the labour market. The employment index unexpectedly jumped 6.9 percentage points to 53.1, the first indicator of growth after 14 consecutive months of decline, leaving it at its highest level since early 2006.There have only been three instances since 1979 when the employment index has shown a growth in the manufacturing sector and US payrolls fell, said Joseph Bruseulas, director of Moody’s Economy.com.
106;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2009-10-01T17:58:09Z;Short View: Growth levelling;;It appears that we have our “V”. The start of the month on Thursday brought with it the usual slew of updates on the health of the world economy, and they appeared to be in agreement. The rebound from the freefall in output that followed the Lehman bankruptcy is now over. Growth is levelling out at a rate that implies very gradual expansion, but also implies continued bad unemployment.In the US, the Institute of Supply Managers’ survey of manufacturers showed a slight drop in activity, from 52.9 to 52.6, compared with the forecast of 54. The ISM is set so that numbers above 50 indicate expansion and numbers below show contraction.The pattern of levelling out or slight declines was common to China, the eurozone and the UK. Investors would have been happy to accept this outcome earlier in the year when the ISM dropped below 33.But in the US, aided by a cheap dollar, many had hoped for more. In combination with the ADP survey of private jobs, which suggested that job losses are running at a worse rate than had been thought, it sparked nervousness ahead of today’s US non-farm payrolls report.There is a positive gloss for this. If growth calms down at this point, inflation is that much less of a concern. Yields on long-term treasury bonds dropped to their lowest in four months. As perhaps the most widely held scenario for a renewed collapse revolves around sharp increases in bond yields, this is arguably encouraging.There was also good news from a sharp rise in US pending home sales (possibly helped by tax credits). But equities reacted as though to some very bad news, and had their worst day in some weeks. That suggests that some unjustified optimism on the economy had been baked into prices.john.authers@ft.comwww.ft.com/shortviewForum: Discuss John Authers’ Short View

The ADP National Employment Report showed that employers in the private sector cut 254,000 jobs from payrolls in September after cutting a revised 277,000 jobs in August. Analysts expected a reduction of 200,000 jobs.Investors were nervously awaiting Friday’s report on the unemployment rate.The S&P 500 eventually closed 0.3 per cent lower at 1,057.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3 per cent to 9,712.28 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.1 per cent to 2,122.42. But Wall Street still recorded its seventh straight monthly gain and has risen about 15 per cent over the last quarter. The Dow also notched up it biggest quarterly rise since the fourth quarter of 1998.“Watching today’s trading in equity markets reminds me of watching a marathon runner heading for a finish line with no energy left, aiming just to finish the race,” said Colin Cieszynski, an analyst at CMC markets. “With the third quarter ending today, it appears in some ways that equities are continuing to mark time before quarter end and the big data points due later this week.”Industrial stocks led the market lower throughout the day on fears about the pace of economic recovery. Alcoa dropped 1.4 per cent to $13.12 and United States Steel lost
2.6 per cent to $44.37.American Superconductor rose 10.5 per cent to $33.54 after the company said late on Tuesday that it had signed a contract with China’s Sinovel Wind to provide electrical components for use in wind turbines.Jabil Circuit, the electronics maker, posted better-than-expected earnings for the first quarter, mainly due to cost cuts.The company has said it expects to cut about 4,500 jobs as part of a restructuring programme. Its shares gained 9.2 per cent to $13.41.Financial stocks also dragged the market lower. CIT Group fell 45 per cent to $1.21 after reports that the group was nearing a plan that would be likely to hand the commercial lender over to its bondholders.CIT, which specialises in lending to retailers and other middle-market companies, is said to be preparing an exchange offer that would eliminate up to
40 per cent of its more than $30bn in outstanding debt.Bank of America lost 1.4 per cent to $16.92 after announcing a deal to sell a long-term asset management business, which makes up its Columbia Management division, to Ameriprise Financial for about $1bn. Ameriprise rose 12.3 per cent to $36.33.However, Nike, the largest athletic shoemaker, helped lift the market from the opening bell.Late on Tuesday, the company reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings after cost cuts offset declining revenues in key markets such as the US and China. Its shares rose 7.7 per cent to $64.70.Darden Restaurants, which owns the Red Lobster chain, also beat analyst estimates when it reported its first-quarter earnings. However, its shares fell 5.6 per cent to $34.13 after
the group’s forecast disappointed analysts.Saks fell 4.9 per cent to $6.82 after the luxury department store chain said it would offer as much as $100m in shares.In a regulatory filing posted late on Tuesday, the group said it would use the proceeds to reduce debt.Discovery Laboratories struck an agreement with the Food and Drug Administration over its experimental lung drug, sending the company’s shares
22.5 per cent higher to $1.36."
108;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2009-09-02T20:36:32Z;Downbeat jobs report drag on Wall Street;;US stocks dipped in and out of the red before ending lower on Wednesday following the release of downbeat data on job losses, prompting speculation that the market’s correction had begun.The ADP employment report suggested that private employers cut more jobs in August than had been expected, which continued to weigh on the market after it opened lower for the third consecutive day.Wall Street had initially taken some comfort from the Challenger jobs report, which showed that the pace of US job losses had slowed.This was quickly counterbalanced by the ADP data, which said companies cut 298,000 posts in August. Analysts had expected 250,000 job losses.Disappointing news on factory orders also offset better-than-expected data on non-farm productivity.The S&P 500 closed down 0.3 per cent at 994.75. On Tuesday, the index fell below 1,000 for the first time since the middle of August. The Nasdaq fell 0.1 per cent to 1,967.07, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.3 per cent to 9,280.67.“Even though the ADP numbers were a little bit disappointing, it is still consistent with improving data so I think what we’re going to see . . . is the market trying to stabilise over the next day or so before we move into the long weekend,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners.Energy companies were some of the market’s best performers following BP’s announcement that it had made a significant oil discovery at its Tiber Prospect in the US waters of the Gulf of Mexico.ConocoPhillips, one of BP’s partners in the Tiber, closed up 0.4 per cent at $44.34. The materials sector also fed the market’s gains after the price of gold climbed to a three-month high during the day.As the mood of uncertainty persisted, investors headed towards the consumer staples sector later in the day. Brown-Forman, the maker of Jack Daniels and Southern Comfort, was one of the main beneficiaries, rising 5.9 per cent to $46.39. Coca-Cola climbed 2.3 per cent to $49.8.After leading Tuesday’s decline, the S&P financials group flirted with gains for brief periods before closing down 1 per cent.Wells Fargo rose 0.5 per cent to $26.09, after Bloom-berg reported the bank planned to pay back bail-out money to the US government without issuing new shares.The San Francisco-based lender had been at the centre of a sell-off in the financial sector on Tuesday as fears grew about the health of the banking system.But concern still lingered. Citigroup closed up 0.4 per cent at $4.56 and Bank of America was up 1.1 per cent at $16.27.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac suffered after the Mortgage Bankers Association proposed that Congress transform the government-controlled mortgage lenders into several smaller privately-held companies backed by government guarantees.Fannie Mae was down 13.8 per cent at $1.37, while Freddie Mac retreated 13.7 per cent to $1.64.The industrial sector also showed losses as investors digested the stream of mixed economic data.General Electric was down 1.1 per cent at $13.20, while US Steel Corporation was down 0.6 per cent at $41.71.Textron, which owns a network of aircraft, defence, industrial and finance businesses, escaped the sector’s decline and closed 12.2 per cent up at $17.39 after an upgrade from Goldman Sachs.However, homebuilders maintained losses even as the broader market wavered.Hovnanian fell 7.4 per cent at $4.65, while Standard Pacific was down 1.2 per cent at $3.26. The stocks had enjoyed a rally a week previously when US home sales data for July came in above forecast.In the pharmaceuticals sector, Walgreen fell 0.7 per cent to $33.81 after the drugstore chain announced that comparable front-end sales had fallen 1.3 per cent in August as shoppers cut back on discretionary items.After a rally on Tuesday on news of trials of seasonal flu vaccines, Novavax fell 10.7 per cent to $5.94 on a downgrade.The utilities sector remained in the red for most of the day.
109;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Pace of US job cuts appears to ease;;US companies shed the fewest number of jobs in nearly a year last month, as the sharp pace of job cuts slowly started to ease.Separately on Wednesday the commerce department said that US factory orders increased in July for the fifth time in the last six months as companies have begun to replenish their stocks.Private companies cut 298,000 jobs from their payrolls in August, according to a survey by ADP employer services on Wednesday. The figure was an improvement from the previous month’s decline of a revised 360,000 jobs but was worse than economists had predicted.Job cuts have eased in the private sector in each of the past three months and have shown substantial improvement from earlier in the year, when monthly job losses averaged 691,000 in the first quarter. Although the pace of job cuts is slowing, economists are fearful that the US economy could be facing a “jobless recovery”, where hiring painfully trails behind other areas of growth.“Employment losses are clearly diminishing,” ADP said in its report. “Despite recent indications that overall economic activity is stabilising, employment, which usually trails overall economic activity, is still likely to decline for at least several more months, albeit at a diminishing rate.”Producers of goods were hit the hardest last month, with the sector shedding 152,000 jobs. Companies providing services cut 146,000 workers, while manufacturers had their best month since July 2008, cutting 74,000 jobs.Big companies, with more than 500 workers, fared the best last month, with medium-sized and small businesses bearing the brunt of job losses.“Firms may have cut labour aggressively in this cycle, but for the moment there is enough spare capacity to defer the decision of increased hirings,” said Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.Analysts took hope from a separate report on Wednesday from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement consultancy, which showed that announced layoffs declined to the lowest level this year in August and were down by 21 per cent from July. Planned job cuts have narrowed in six of the past seven months and were off by 14 per cent compared with the same month the year before.“This report is consistent with other data showing a considerable lessening of the pace of job declines from the peak rates earlier in the year,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief US economist at MFR.In spite of recent signs of easing, the US labour force remains under severe pressure. High rates of unemployment and and the impact of companies reducing the number of hours their employees are working is ramping up productivity.The labour department said that in the second quarter of this year productivity in the business sector grew at an annual rate of 6.6 per cent. That was the sharpest rise since the third quarter of 2003, as hours worked fell by 7.6 per cent but output showed a moderate dip of 1.5 per cent.Economists were eagerly awaiting the official non-farm payroll report due on Friday. Wall Street analysts expect that the US economy shed 225,000 jobs last month, raising the unemployment rate to 9.5 per cent.Meanwhile, the rise in US factory orders followed Tuesday’s Institute for Supply Management figures showing that manufacturing activity in the US expanded for the first time in 19 months. Factory orders grew by a less-than-expected 1.3 per cent to $355.5bn, fuelled by a surge in demand for durable goods.John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros, economists at RDQ Economics, note that factory orders are up at an annual rate of 14.3 per cent in the last three months, signalling a boost in business equipment spending in the second half of the year.
110;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2009-08-05T21:02:17Z;Banks buck wider Wall St retreat;;"US stocks declined on Wednesday but the benchmark S&P 500 index managed to stay above 1,000 as the market pared some of its early losses sparked by downbeat economic data.The ADP employment report suggested that private employers cut more jobs in July than expected, which weighed on markets at the start of trading.Equities then extended those losses following the release of figures showing output in the service sector in July was weaker than expected.The ADP report is considered an indication of the unemployment rate, which will be released on Friday, and investors focused on this more than the Challenger jobs report, which suggested fewer companies announced job cuts in July than a year ago.But positive words from UK bank Lloyds, which said that its loan impairments had peaked, along with figures showing mortgage applications rose more than 4 per cent last week, drove buying in US bank stocks even in the face of negative data.Citigroup rose 10.2 per cent to $3.58 while Bank of America rose 6.5 per cent to $16.66 and Wells Fargo gained 5.7 per cent to $28.02.After the closing bell, Cisco and News Corp released their quarterly earnings and both companies beat estimates.Industrial stocks were the significant drag, led lower by Quanta, the biggest US builder of powerlines, which missed earnings estimates after being hurt by continuing weakness in the energy sector. Its shares fell 1.2 per cent to $23.17.The S&P dropped 0.3 per cent to 1,002.72, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4 per cent to close at 9,280.97.The Nasdaq Composite index dropped 0.9 per cent to 1,993.05.“The economic news suggests that the economy is bottoming but the turn is going to be slow,” said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist at RidgeWorth Investments.There were mixed signs on consumer activity as several blue-chip companies reported quarterly results. Shares in Whole Foods, the upmarket grocery chain, bounced 15.6 per cent to $28.70 after the company beat estimates for sales, profits and margins.Kraft also showed resilience in the food sector after the company, which counts Oreo cookies among its well-known brands, beat analysts’ expectations and raised its full-year profit outlook.But the shares slipped a fraction lower to $28.33
following a recent spike on the back of similarly good numbers from rivals General Mills and Kellogg’s.There were more negative signs on customer spending, however, from Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer group.The company’s revenues disappointed Wall Street and, even though earnings were slightly ahead of analysts’ expectations and the company maintained its full-year guidance, its shares fell 2.8 per cent to $53.91.Meanwhile, Polo Ralph Lauren, the clothing company, rose 7.1 per cent to $68.31 after stronger sales and cheaper supply chain costs helped the company post stronger profits and margins than expected.Elsewhere in the consumer sector, Electronic Arts saw its shares rise
following impressive results, fuelled by strong sales of The Sims 3 video-game and tight cost
controls.But the stock ultimately lost 6.8 per cent to $20.40, after John Riccitiello, chief executive, warned of continued weakness in the sector, saying orders from retailers remained low.Garmin jumped 23.8 per cent to $33.66 after the satellite navigation system maker beat its earnings estimates and significantly improved profit margins following steep cost cuts.Two of the best-known car rental companies found gains. Shares in Dollar Thrifty rose 14.2 per cent to $20.02 after the company exceeded estimates, having successfully raised its prices and cut costs last year.Some industry analysts now predict the company could become a takeover target for a bigger rival.One of those rivals, Avis, announced a quarterly loss with rental volumes remaining low. But the shares closed up 5 per cent to $9.39 as the company said demand had begun to stabilise."
111;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Survey finds US job losses slowed in July;;A survey on Wednesday showed US companies cut a worse than expected 371,000 jobs last month, but the haemorrhaging of jobs across the economy continues to slow.The ADP National Employment Report, published with Macroeconomic Advisors, showed its smallest decline since October. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected, on average, a decrease of 350,000.Barack Obama, US president, later on Wednesday touted the impact of his administration’s stimulus programme on creating jobs, while announcing $2.4bn in Energy Department grants for electric-car development.Speaking in Indiana, one of the areas hardest hit by job losses, the US president said:“This area has been hit with a perfect storm of economic troubles…And there have been times where nearly one in five people in this area have been looking for work. Overall the companies believe these investments in battery technology will save or create thousands of Hoosier [Indiana] jobs.”He said the stimulus passed in February had already created “dozens” of jobs resurfacing the runway at a local airport and that local factories had begun recalling employees.The 371,000 lost posts shown in the ADP report are consistent with an increase of 0.3 percentage points in the unemployment rate, Chris Varvares, president of Macroeconomic Advisors, said in a conference call. This would bring the unemployment rate for July - which will be released on Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics - up to 9.8 per cent. But, he said, the numbers could represent a change of as little as 0 or as much as 0.6 per cent.According to the report, the private sector has shed 6.7m jobs since losses began in February 2008. But losses have moderated considerably, down over 100,000 from June and at about half of their peak level last March.“It’s going to be a slow grind upward for the remainer of the year,” said Joseph Brusuelas, director of Moody’s Economy.com.Losses continued to be widespread. Employment in the service sector fell by 202,000. In the goods-producing sector it fell by 169,000 and in the manufacturing sector it dropped by 99,000. Large businesses lost an additional 74,000 workers in July, medium-sized businesses dropped 138,000 people and small business payrolls fell by 138,000.“Sub-par” job gains should begin at the beginning of next year, said Mr Varvares, and consisted job growth is expected by mid-2010.ADP began releasing the survey of the payroll data of 1 in 6 private employers in May 2006, and revised its methodology in January after criticism about its accuracy.A separate survey by outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas, found that planned job cuts jumped 31 per cent in July to 97,373, after falling to a 15-month low in June.“After June’s surprisingly low job-cut total, a July rebound was not entirely unexpected,” said John A. Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas in a release. “Monthly job cuts are likely to return to levels in excess of 100,000 by the fourth quarter.”Separately, the pace of the contraction of the service sector, which accounts for about 80 per cent of US economic activity, unexpectedly increased, according to an index of the Institute of Supply Management, released on Wednesday.The index fell 0.6 from 47.0 to 46.4. Economists surveyed by Reuters had been expecting the index to increase to 48.0. Any number below a 50 indicates a contraction. The reading comes just two days after the ISM’s manufacturing survey showed the pace of the decline of the non-manufacturing sector slowed.The employment component of the index also showed a faster decline, falling -1.9 points to 41.5.“The service sector poised to continue cutting jobs at an advanced pace,” said Mr Brusuelas, director of Moody’s Economy.com.
112;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2009-07-01T13:00:42Z;US private sector sheds 473,000 jobs;;US companies cut nearly a half million jobs last month as the recession continued to cut into the labour market in spite of other recent signs of hope in the economy.Private companies cut 473,000 jobs from their payrolls in June, according to a survey by ADP employer services on Wednesday. The figure was slightly lower than the revised 485,000 jobs slashed in May, but was worse than economists expected and raised fears that the unemployment rate would continue to climb.Although the monthly figure remains grim it was the lowest total since last October and marks an improvement from the more severe job losses earlier in the year. ADP noted that monthly job losses in the second quarter averaged 492,000, down from 691,000 in the first quarter.Employment in the goods-producing sector was hit the hardest, where 250,000 jobs were shed. Manufacturers, which have shed workers for 40 months in a row, culled 146,000 jobs in June, and construction employment fell by 97,000 as builders continue to cut back. In the services sector 223,00 jobs were lost.Last month medium-sized businesses suffered the most job cuts, followed by small businesses and large companies.“Despite some recent indications that economic activity is stabilising, employment, which usually trails overall economic activity, is likely to decline for at least several more months,” ADP said in its report.Some analysts took hope from a separate report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement consultancy, which showed that announced lay-offs declined in June for the fifth straight month and were down 9 per cent compared with the same month a year ago. However, persistent high levels of jobless claims and Tuesday’s Conference Board report showing a drop in consumer confidence continue to darken optimism for a fast recovery.Wednesday’s reports sets the stage for Thursday’s labour department non-farm payroll figures. Economists expect that the US shed another 363,000 workers in June, pushing the unemployment rate to 9.6 per cent.Wall Street initially took confidence from the Challenger report but futures lost some of their shine after the release of the ADP figures.
113;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;ADP: Private sector cut 532,000 jobs in May;;US companies cut more than half a million jobs last month as the recession continued to chip away at the country’s labour market, while the service sector shrank more than expected.Private companies cut 532,000 jobs from their payrolls in May, according to a survey by ADP Employer Services. Although that was fewer than the revised 545,000 jobs slashed in April, the number was worse than many predicted and pushed shares lower on Wednesday morning.“This is a weak report [but] you could argue at least it was better than it was a few months back,” said Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, which jointly produces the ADP survey. Earlier in the year, payrolls were consistently being cut by more than 600,000 each month. “That improvement, if it sticks and even improves further, is consistent with a notion that a freefall in the economy is likely over,” Mr Prakken added.Figures from the Institute of Supply Management showed that the US service sector – which represents about 80 per cent of economic activity in the US – was still contracting in May, albeit at a slightly slower pace.The index rose to 44, from 43.7 in April. Any number below 50 indicates contraction, and economists had predicted a better figure of 45.”It kind of fits with all the other news we’re getting: things are less bad but they’re not yet growing,” said Jonathan Basile, an economist at Credit Suisse. “It’s encouraging to see this stabilisation process start to take hold, but at the same time the weakness does persist. These are still indications that we’re not totally out of the woods yet.”Companies have responded to such shrinking activity by cutting jobs. Last month the number of manufacturing jobs dropped by 149,000, while service providers cut 265,000 workers.The ADP report is closely watched because it comes two days ahead of the government’s official payroll and unemployment figures for May. In April, unemployment climbed to 8.9 per cent while payrolls dropped 539,000. Economists expect the unemployment rate to punch through 9 per cent when it is released on Friday.
114;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2009-05-06T20:30:27Z;US stocks jump ahead of stress tests;;"US banking stocks jumped on Wednesday amid a flurry of reports about how well companies had fared in the government’s stress tests on banks’ balance sheets, the results of which are due on Thursday.Reports said that Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, American Express and Bank of New York Mellon would all pass the tests without needing to strengthen their balance sheets. That sent KBW index of banks up 10.8 per cent.Bloomberg reported that Citigroup needed $5bn, half the level reported on Monday. Its shares leapt 16.6 per cent to $3.86.Meanwhile, the New York Times said the government had asked Bank of Americato raise nearly $34bn, more than triple the figure previously reported.But the bank overcame this to find gains after Citigroup said it was unlikely to need to issue new shares. Its stock jumped 17.1 per cent to $12.69, taking its weekly gains above 45 per cent.Wells Fargo, which Bloomberg said would need $15bn, rose 15.6 per cent to $26.84.Regions Financial provided a microcosm of the volatility in the market, slumping 11 per cent in eight minutes after the Wall Street Journal said it also needed new capital. But its shares then surged, and closed
6.2 per cent up at $5.83.“The fact that Timothy Geithner [the Treasury secretary] waited three months after announcing the stress tests to give us more details worked out well. They have been able to come up with some solutions so banks are not going to have to go out and issue new shares,” said Andrew Wilkinson of Interactive Brokers.But Robert Loest, fund manager at Integrity Mutual, said: “Investors are deluded. The stress tests were done by the banks themselves, and any rational person would be suspicious of that.”The reports helped extend early gains which came after labour market data from ADP said that companies laid off nearly 25 per cent fewer workers in April than expected.Elsewhere in the financial sector, Lincoln National, the life insurer, soared after its quarterly results. The company made a loss after writing off some of the value of its annuity business, but investors focused on unexpectedly strong operating profits, sending its shares up 33 per cent to $15.57.The benchmark S&P 500 closed 1.7 per cent higher at 919.53 points and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2 per cent to 8,512.28 points.But the Nasdaq Composite index, which has outperformed the other two this year, gained only 0.3 per cent to 1,759.10 points as some investors looked to bank profits.Energy companies were behind financial stocks as the day’s biggest gainers as the price of oil rose to new highs for the year. Chevron gained 3.6 per cent to $68.11.The better-than-expected data from ADP matched a report from outplacement group Challenger that also suggested the rise in unemployment was slowing.It also added to confidence the economy might be slowing its contraction after figures showed mortgage applications rose last week.But Pulte Homes and Centex, the rival homebuilders that are due to merge, announced heavier losses than expected amid rising unemployment and foreclosures. Pulte lost 8.1 per cent to $11.31, while Centex slid 8 per cent to $10.78.The homebuilding sector took another knock after a report from Zillow.com said nearly a quarter of US homeowners owe more than their properties are worth.There was some good news for consumer stocks however as Disney reported a narrower fall in earnings than expected. The company’s profits dropped as it had to offer discounts to attract visitors to its US theme parks, but the fall was not as bad as analysts had predicted, and its shares rose 11.8 per cent to $25.87.Dow Chemical also fell after it announced it was offering $1.63bn in common stock to pay back debt owed following its acquisition of rival Rohm & Haas. It slid 7 per cent to $15.19.General Motors was one of the day’s heaviest fallers ahead of its earnings report on Thursday. The company is expected to make an eighth straight quarterly loss, and is reportedly facing opposition to its restructuring plans from the United Auto Workers union. Its shares tumbled 10.3 per cent per cent to $1.66."
115;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Overview: Bulls maintain buoyant mood;Worries over financial sector are offset;Further evidence that the global economy might have bottomed and unofficial reports on how banks fared in the US government’s stress tests on Wednesday buoyed equity, commodity and credit markets.Data from ADP Employer Services showed that the pace of US private sector job losses slowed last month, offering investors some welcome news before tomorrow’s crucial non-farm payrolls report.Service sector data for the eurozone and the UK heightened the mood of tentative optimism – as did China’s central bank, which said the country could maintain “stable and relatively fast” economic growth.“Signs of recovery are becoming more widespread and convincing, bringing comfort to investors, households and policymakers after long months of stress and oppressive depression,” said Marco Annunziata, chief economist at UniCredit.“The positive reaction of market players and, to some extent, consumers, is an extremely welcome development that could accelerate the recovery and normalisation of the financial system.”Others took a more cautious tack on the economic outlook, however.“In technical terms the US recession could be near the end but the recovery won’t be very pretty,” said Steve Barrow at Standard Bank. “It is not a normal recession and, therefore, we should not assume a normal recovery.”Julian Jessop at Capital Economics noted that incoming economic data were consistent only with a slowing of the pace of contraction, rather than a return to meaningful growth. “The world economy still faces major headwinds as past imbalances and excesses are unwound,” he said.Uppermost among concerns on investors’ minds was the outcome of the stress tests on US financial institutions as rumours about banks’ additional capital requirements swirled through the markets.“Make no mistake about it, banks may still require more capital and there are more challenges ahead,” said Axel Merk of Merk Investments. “In our opinion, an arbitrary stress test does not resolve the issues at hand and may only serve to create new problems.”But, for Wednesday at least, the bulls held the upper hand in equity markets. By the close in New York, the S&P 500 was was up 1.7 per cent, while the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 1.4 per cent. The FTSE 100 in London briefly rose above the level at which it ended 2008.Asian markets hit a seven-month high, although Tokyo remained closed for the golden week holiday. Hong Kong rose 2.5 per cent and Shanghai gained 1 per cent as both enjoyed a fifth successive advance.Emerging market assets were also buoyant. The MSCI EM equity index climbed 1.2 per cent to a seven-month high. The spread of emerging market bond yields over US Treasuries fell 14 basis points to the lowest since early October.But US and European government bonds fell as equities rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was up 2bp at 3.19 per cent but fell back slightly to stand down 1 basis point at 3.15 per cent after a well-bid auction of a record amount of 10-year notes.Credit spreads narrowed, with the investment-grade Markit iTraxx Europe index falling 6bp to 131bp while the Markit CDX North America index was 3bp lower at 153bp.Money market activity indicated a further thawing of credit conditions as three-month dollar Libor remained below 1 per cent for a second day running.In commodities, the oil price pushed above $56 a barrel. The ADP data boosted demand hopes even as weekly data showed that US crude inventories had hit a 19-year high.Risk appetite was also less apparent in the currency. The safety appeal of the dollar and the yen was enhanced by uncertainty about banks and today’s European Central Bank policy meeting.But Daniel Tenengauzer, head of foreign exchange strategy at Banc of America Securities-Merrill Lynch, said the yen had probably entered a medium-term down trend. “The yen is likely to remain a major funding currency, and limited domestic investment return prospects suggest more capital outflows to higher-yielding foreign markets on improvements in risk appetite.”

Angry denials quickly collapsed as an independent investigation triggered a series of damaging revelations that saw NMC admit evidence of fraud and more than $4bn of undisclosed debt.Earlier this month, NMC’s major creditor, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB), successfully applied to a UK court to place the London-listed business in administration. Restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal has taken over management of the hospitals and clinics, replacing the entire board.“Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this company,” said Judge Sebastian Prentis at the hearing.The unfurling scandal has been lucrative for consultants, with boutique investment banks coming in to advise the company’s management, shareholders and creditors.The appointment of Alvarez & Marsal to handle the UK administration comes after the previous management brought in investment bank Moelis & Co and accountancy firm PwC to assist them with debt restructuring and operational advice as NMC sought a debt standstill. Shareholders, such as Mr Shetty, have also engaged their own advisers, including investment bank Houlihan Lokey, to steer them through the situation.The crisis at the UAE’s largest private healthcare provider has coincided with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. “The turmoil at NMC couldn’t come at a worse time given the growing Covid-19 crisis,” says one healthcare consultant. The number of cases had risen by Wednesday to more than 5,300, with 33 deaths.The Gulf state has introduced tight restrictions on movement, with Dubai imposing a 24-hour curfew that requires residents to apply for a permit to leave their homes to collect essentials. A mass testing programme has involved opening 13 drive-through testing centres across the seven-emirate federation, as well as the construction of a laboratory in Abu Dhabi that can assess tens of thousands of samples a day.While some non-essential NMC facilities have closed because of the nationwide lockdown, one person close to the company says any hospital and clinic that can serve patients is staying open. NMC has more than 2,200 beds and 2,000 doctors in 200 facilities across the UAE.The company’s former management attempted to block the administration effort, arguing that such a move would destabilise the business at a critical juncture. Alvarez & Marsal quickly wrote to assure staff that the administrators would strive to allow medical staff to deliver healthcare efficiently, including a commitment to pay salaries on time. NMC struggled to meet February payroll.Clearly something has gone very wrong with the management and oversight of this companySome local healthcare executives believe that the government would have intervened if it feared a shortage of intensive care beds. As it is, Dubai alone already has up to 5,000 available for Covid-19 patients and can handle more than 10,000 with the construction of two field hospitals. It also plans to convert deserted hotels into medical facilities if the need arises.“The government has a full handle on the number of intensive care beds needed,” says one healthcare executive. “If they needed the hospitals, they would have acted differently on NMC.”Alvarez’s three joint administrators working on NMC are all senior managers based in the UK, rather than in the consultancy’s UAE office. In a letter to staff, Richard Fleming, managing director of Alvarez & Marsal Europe, said this was because NMC is registered in the UK.At the administration hearing, the judge expressed his confidence that the new management, backed by fresh funding, would be able to keep NMC a going concern. ADCB has pledged to provide new working capital facilities.Yet the scandal has once again tarnished the UAE’s reputation as a commercial centre. Coming less than two years after the fall of Abraaj — a Dubai-based private equity group that collapsed when it was accused of misusing investor money — it has intensified concerns about local regulators’ capacity to deal with such complex cases.Abraaj started to unravel when overseas investors in the group’s healthcare fund raised the alarm on its alleged use of their money for internal purposes, rather than investments. Alissa Amico Kole, managing director of the Govern Center, which advises on corporate governance, points out that the original whistleblower on NMC’s financial problems — research firm Muddy Waters — also came from outside the region.To bolster local ability to handle such crises, Nasser Saidi, a governance consultant, says the financial regulator’s powers could be expanded into a supervisory body to screen regional companies seeking to list abroad. He also believes that a UAE version of the UK’s Companies House — providing information on corporate ownership and financials to the public — would benefit transparency.While the Abraaj scandal damaged the fundraising prospects of the Middle Eastern private equity industry, NMC threatens to do likewise for UAE companies seeking to access the deep pools of capital in western markets.“The level of scrutiny for companies from here will be off the charts,” says one investment banker.
117;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;US manufacturing data spur hope for economy;;The rapid contraction of US manufacturing activity ap­pears finally to be slowing, a survey showed on Wednesday, spurring tentative hopes that the country’s economy could be stabilising.Manufacturing output shrank again in March for the 14th consecutive month but the Institute for Supply Management index rose to 36.3 from 35.8 – slightly more than economists were ex­pecting. Any number of less than 50 shows a contraction.The sub-index for new factory orders rose to the highest level since August last year, giving stock markets a fillip on Wednesday.A scattering of better than expected data has emerged from the US economy in recent weeks, including rising mortgage applications and steadying retail sales. They have prompted cautious optimism among some US politicians, including Barack Obama, the president, who said last week there were “glimmers of stabilisation” in the economy.Wednesday’s data releases gave fodder to both optimists and pessimists. Private US companies cut 742,000 jobs in March, according to ADP’s closely watched monthly employment survey, as the recession continued to savage the labour market. Almost 100,000 more jobs were cut than economists were expecting.Revisions to February’s employment numbers showed 9,000 more jobs were lost than originally estimated, putting that month’s total job losses at 706,000.“It does suggest the labour market remains very fragile and that the outlook is dismal,” said Samarjit Shankar, director of global strategy at Bank of New York Mellon.The ADP numbers raised concerns that the US government’s monthly jobs data – seen as one of the most important indicators of the economy’s health – would also be dire when released on Friday.“It’s a terrible number. It is almost a loss of three-quarters of a million jobs, possibly the highest we have seen so far over the length of this crisis. Obviously [it is] foreboding ahead of [Friday’s] non-farm payrolls report,” said Matt Esteve, a foreign exchange trader at Tempus Consulting.A breakdown of the ADP data shows that the pain was spread throughout the economy, with large, mid-sized and small businesses all cutting a similar number of jobs. The goods-producing sector, including construction and manufacturing companies, cut 327,000 jobs, while service providers cut 415,000.ADP changed the methodology of its survey in December after it significantly undershot the US government’s labour report.●Sweden’s economy will contract by 4.2 per cent this year, pushing unemployment up to 11.7 per cent by 2011, writes Robert Anderson in Stockholm. The new government forecast represents a big revision from December’s prediction of a 0.8 per cent decline in gross domestic product and shows how the open economy is expected to suffer one of the worst recessions in western Europe. Industry has been severely hit by the collapse in global export orders and has reacted quickly by slashing production and jobs to maintain profitability.
118;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2008-12-03T20:54:19Z;Record contraction in US services sector;;"US service industries contracted by the biggest margin on record in November, while the private sector shed the most jobs in six years, new data showed on Wednesday.The Institute of Supply Management said that its monthly survey of business conditions in the non-manufacturing sector recorded a reading of 37.3 per cent in November – down 7.1 percentage points from the month before – where a reading of 50 indicates expansion. That was the lowest reading since the survey began in 1997, the biggest month-to-month drop and worse than the 42 per cent reading economists had expected. Of the 18 industries surveyed, one reported growth: healthcare.The services index is “consistent with the economy contracting at a rapid pace”, said Abiel Reinhart, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase.Earlier this week the National Bureau of Economic Research announced that the US economy had officially been in recession since last December.Wednesday’s report also pointed to the speed of the decline over the month, with the Employment Index dropping 10.2 percentage points to 31.3 per cent, and the new orders index falling 8.6 percentage points to 35.4 per cent, also record lows.The recession in the services sector was indicated by the report as the private sector shed 250,000 jobs, according to the ADP payrolls report. Small, medium and large businesses were all hit and the services sector shed jobs for only the second time in six years.The report was above analysts’ expectations of 200,000 job losses and comes two days before the labour department’s monthly report on the jobs market.Economists are predicting total non-farm payroll losses of 350,000 – the worst in over 25 years. In October, the economy shed 240,000 jobs and unemployment jumped to 6.5 per cent, the labour department said in its last report. The government report also includes public sector employment. The month saw the 24th consecutive month of declining jobs in construction and the 27th month that jobs have fallen in manufacturing. The ADP report is put together from anonymous payroll data from thousands of US businesses.A separate survey showed that large US businesses announced 181,671 layoffs in November, the most in almost seven years, as financial companies such as
Citigroup cut jobs. The survey, by Challenger Gray Christmas, also showed that announcements of corporate layoffs are up 148 per cent compared with last year.US productivity rose more than thought in November as companies cut jobs, according to a report from the labour department. Non-farm business productivity rose by 1.3 per cent compared with an estimate of a 1.1 per cent. Economists had expected productivity gains to be revised down.● A key global services and manufacturing activity index staged a record fall in November, with the chances of the international economy remaining in deep recession into 2009 increasing, JPMorgan said.The Global All-Industry Index, which aggregates purchasing managers’ indexes across manufacturing and services around the world, fell to 35.4, a record low, from 43.1.The Services Business Activity Index, also produced by JP Morgan with research and supply management organisations, plummeted to 36.1 in November from 44.2 as all national PMI indices reported lower output."
119;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;Dollar stumbles amid US jobs fears;;The dollar lost ground on Wednesday as gloomy economic data stoked fresh fears over the health of the US economy.The Institute for Supply Management’s headline services index fell to 44.4 in October from 50.2 in September, below the consensus forecast of 47.0 and the lowest reading since the survey began in July 1997.Meanwhile, the ADP survey estimated the US private sector shed 157,000 jobs in October, the most in almost six years.Analysts said the data signalled that the US economy had entered recession and did not bode well for Friday’s employment report.By midday in New York, the dollar had fallen 0.8 per cent to $1.3080 against the euro, lost 0.5 per cent to Y99.13 against the yen and dropped 0.4 per cent to SFr1.1575 against the Swiss franc.Meanwhile, the pound fared even better, rising 1.2 per cent to $1.6148 against the dollar in spite of more grim UK economic data.A survey showed activity in Britain’s services sector slumped, prompting some analysts into predicting a full percentage point rate cut at Thursday’s Bank of England meeting. But analysts said a 100 basis point interest rate cut could prove to be beneficial for the pound.Adam Cole at RBC Financial Markets said that at the moment decisive policy action from central banks was proving to be positive for their currencies,“In periods of sharp global downturns, investors are prepared to pay a premium for central banks that are proactive,” he said.The pound also rose 0.3 per cent to £0.8104 against the euro and climbed 0.5 per cent to Y159.83 against the pound.The Swedish krona was the worst performing major currency, however, after the release of the minutes of the Swedish central bank’s monetary policy committee meeting held in October.The minutes revealed a very downbeat assessment of the global and the Swedish economy with all members supporting the 50bp rate cut delivered a couple of weeks ago.Analysts said while expectations of further rate cuts weighed on the krona, it was also hit by fresh concerns over the Swedish banking sector.Swedbank, the country’s fourth largest bank, announced it would be the first to participate in the Swedish government’s voluntary guarantee programme for bonds and certificates, in an effort to help take the pressure off rising funding costs.Worries over the exposure of Sweden’s banks to a slowdown in the Baltic states helped push the krona down to a record low against the euro in October.On Wednesday, the krona fell 1.1 per cent to SKr9.9910 against the single currency and dropped 0.3 per cent to SKr7.6327 against the dollar.
120;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2008-10-21T22:01:24Z;Aéroports de Paris/Schiphol;;Few deals these days can claim to be neither forced nor affected by the credit crunch. So the cross-shareholding alliance between Aéroports de Paris and Schiphol Group is unusual, even before their claim that it is the first between airports in different countries. The Air France-KLM merger makes greater co-ordination between the main hubs of Paris and Amsterdam logical. Sharing best practice in such areas as check-in and retail development sounds straightforward. Cost and revenue synergies of €71m a year by 2013 from joint purchasing of equipment, luggage handling systems and telecommunications also look easily achievable.More challenging may be getting the “dual hub” to act like a single entity. For airports 300 miles apart, making transfers between the two “as simple as a subway” sounds a bit of a dream (or maybe a nightmare) – even with Air France-KLM running shuttle flights and a high-speed rail link from 2010. But the airports say that, with a combined 143 destinations and 30,000 weekly long- to medium-haul connections, there is wide scope for co-ordination to give passengers more flexibility. If Schiphol and Charles de Gaulle really can better co-ordinate operations from their combined nine runways, then London’s Heathrow, still battling for permission to construct a third, will have to sharpen its act.There are other implications for the UK. ADP’s 8 per cent stake in Schiphol is valued at 11.3 times trailing earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, Schiphol’s reciprocal 8 per cent of ADP at 10.5 times. That is well below the cheap credit-fuelled 28-30 times that airport valuations reached in recent years, at least for underdeveloped assets.With valuations sliding, Ferrovial’s BAA may struggle to attract the £2bn-plus valuations mooted for London Gatwick, which it is selling under pressure from regulators. Apply an ADP/Schiphol-style multiple of 10-11 to Ferrovial’s forecast £165m ebitda for Gatwick this year, and £1.6bn-£1.8bn looks like being a more realistic selling price.To e-mail the Lex team confidentially click hereORTo post public comments click here
121;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2008-08-27T17:27:33Z;The end of a software gravy train;;"That parts of the software business are being reinvented as a service industry has become a truism in the technology world. Why face the hassle of loading and running software when you can go online and tap into some internet service that does the job just as well, at a fraction of the cost?Behind this glib observation, though, lies a world of hurt. One of the world’s most profitable industries is being turned into – well, it’s not quite clear what yet, but it is likely to be something that no longer commands profit margins fit to make Croesus jealous.This was brought home to me again this week when listening to the co-heads of SAP discussing the difficulties they have had breaking into this so-called “software as a service” market. The idea of Saas is that companies pay a low monthly fee based on the number of employees who access an online service. No need to buy customer relationship management software to keep track of clients, for instance: just plug your company’s data into a web service.An all-singing, all-dancing online service for medium-sized companies has been one of the most important initiatives for Europe’s biggest software company for the past couple of years, and it does not seem to be going well. Henning Kagermann, SAP’s cerebral boss for the past decade, and Léo Apotheker, who will take over the reins fully next year, say they are deliberately holding back while they perfect the system.They profess themselves patient: the technology and the business model work, they say; they just need more automation to squeeze out cost. Once they prove they can make money they will be ready to “scale up” fast.There is a distinct tone of sour grapes as they contemplate how Wall Street has embraced lossmaking or only marginally profitable Saas start-ups with open arms. “If you are a start-up and you burn money, the Street rewards you,” says Mr Kagermann; established companies do not get given the benefit of the doubt.One can sympathise – but only up to a point. This has all the hallmarks of a big, successful company trying to learn an entirely new business and floundering. The technology approach, the management skills and the financial incentives are all very different in the Saas business. SAP may eventually get the formula right, but it has high cultural, organisational and economic barriers to cross.Even most of the companies created from scratch to address this market are labouring to show they can make a decent hand of it. Consider the economics of Saas, which are very different from those of traditional software. Like all subscription businesses, these turn on three things: how much it costs to attract new customers (known as subscriber acquisition costs), how much money can be extracted from those customers in regular subscriptions (known as “average revenue per user”, or Arpu) and how often subscribers drop out and have to be replaced (the churn rate).Saas has punishingly high sales and marketing costs. The SAP executives say this is their biggest problem, and one they are working to address with automation. Pure Saas companies face the same challenge. Even Salesforce.com, the one company that has proved it can make a consistent profit from the business (albeit a small one), spends half its revenues on sales and marketing. For others, the figure is much higher.Of course, high sales and marketing expenses are not a problem if new customers end up supplying steady Arpu and sticking around long enough to yield a decent return on the acquisition costs. This is where the new online software industry has yet to prove itself. Most new customers of Saas companies are turning to the service for the first time. They are still learning the ropes, and have not yet learnt how to play rival suppliers off against each other. Tougher price competition and customer churn will be inescapable characteristics of a more mature, competitive market.That makes Saas very different from the old software business. The real gravy for companies such as SAP, Oracle and other “enterprise” software companies comes from the annual maintenance fees they charge their customers, not selling new software. Maintenance accounted for 58 per cent of Oracle’s software revenues last year, and 74 per cent of the profits.Customers usually have no choice but to pay up. They know that dumping their traditional software supplier and moving to a new one will leave them facing huge switching costs. That kind of customer lock-in does not apply to the online service business. As Marc Benioff, who built Salesforce.com, puts it: “It’s like your telephone service – if you don’t like it you can switch.”The companies that come out on top could end up looking much more like today’s telephone companies than the present generation of enterprise software companies. They will have systems for vacuuming up large numbers of customers cheaply, and will compete on their ability to guarantee high levels of service quality and availability.ADP, a big, boring computing utility that processes many companies’ payrolls, is one model for how this new business could evolve.Some traditional software companies will make the leap into services, but make no mistake: they won’t make software-style profits any more.richard.waters@ft.com"
122;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T18:07:40+0000;Sharp fall in US private sector jobs;;The US suffered the largest drop in employment in nearly six years in June, a sign of the deteriorating economic environment, according to a closely watched survey of business employment published on Wednesday.Non-farm private sector employment fell by 79,000 in the month, including a 3,000 decline in service sector employment, according to the monthly ADP survey.It was the largest drop in non-government jobs and the first decline in service-sector employment since November 2002, when the US economy was suffering the after-effects of the collapse of the internet bubble and the September 11 attacks. The drop in services jobs is significant because the sector is the powerhouse of US employment.Economists had been exp­ec­ting the report to show a loss of 20,000 jobs. The previous month’s change in emp­loyment was also rev­ised down from an increase of 40,000 to a rise of 25,000.The report was released ahead of government figures on non-farm employment out today, which show a fall in jobs in the first five months of the year. The ADP employment numbers tend to vary markedly from non-farm payrolls. However, this month’s data could prove significant because, over the past six months, the ADP report has tracked about 100,000 ahead of government data, according to Alan Ruskin of RBS Global Banking & Markets.If that trend were to continue, the ADP report could signal a precipitous drop of about 200,000 jobs in official payroll numbers, far deeper than the 60,000 previously expected. “This is grim. If – if – the survey’s recent relationship with the official payroll numbers persists, you should expect a headline number near 200K tomorrow,” wrote Ian Shepherdson, an economist at HFE, in a note.Manufacturing data on Wednesday provided modest encouragement, showing that new orders from factories rose in May, echoing a report on Tuesday from the Institute of Supply Management that suggested the sector grew in June after four months of contraction.Factory orders grew 0.6 per cent in the month, according to the commerce department, although excluding volatile transport orders it grew a more modest 0.4 per cent, in line with expectations. Orders for non-defence capital goods excluding aircraft fell 0.4 per cent during the month.“This marks the third consecutive monthly gain, but the increase may have more to do with surging oil prices than a resilient economy,” wrote economists at Wachovia in a note.
123;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2008-06-04T15:51:31Z;US productivity gains help offset energy burden;;US productivity accelerated in the first quarter of this year, according to revised government data published on Wednesday, a trend which could help companies offset the inflationary burden of rising energy costs.First quarter non-farm productivity, a measure of business efficiency, increased at a 2.6 per cent annualised rate in the first three months of this year, revised from an originally reported 2.2. per cent.From the first quarter of 2007 to the first quarter of 2008 productivity increased by 3.3 per cent, the biggest increase since mid-2004.Although some economists fear that record oil and raw materials prices will eat into company profit margins, many analysts are confident that productivity gains will help offset some of these problems.Unit labour costs increased at a 2.2 per cent annualised rate in the first quarter, indicating companies were broadly successful in keeping wage demands under control, in spite of the growing cost pressures on consumers.Although the increase in unit labour costs over the past year was revised higher the 0.7 per cent growth rate was still well below the underlying rate of inflation. Labour costs account for around two thirds of the cost burden on US businesses.US companies laid off 260,000 workers in the first four months of this year and many of those who did not lose their job saw their hours reduced.Hours worked declined at a 1.8 per cent annual rate in the first quarter but output continued to rise, albeit modestly, at a 0.7 per cent annual rate.Wages have struggled to keep pace with inflation leading some economists to conclude that consumers - not companies - will bear most of the pain from rising commodity costs.“Companies are much more tightly run,” said Amitabh Arora, head of interest rate strategy at Lehman Brothers. “Unlike 20 years ago they have the ability to keep wages in check and reduce their costs.”Private sector employers added 40,000 jobs in May, according to a report by ADP Employer Services, a business outsourcing company but economists were quick to talk down the report’s significance.Since the new year the ADP employment numbers have varied wildly from non-farm payrolls, which are due on Friday. US employers are expected to have cut 60,000 jobs in May, more than the 20,000 job losses recorded the previous month.A spate of recent reports has depicted an economy which has slowed significantly but not yet fallen off a cliff, an argument leant further weight on Wednesday by the latest update on the US services sector.The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing composite index dipped from 52 to 51.7 in May, a fraction better than a reading of 51 forecast by economists.However, inflationary pressures were clear from the 4.9 point jump in the prices paid index to 77, the second-highest reading in the 11-year history of the report.
124;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T21:07:36+0000;Telematics: Spy in the cab or a vital digital assistant?;;"Tax rates, green issues and tough new regulations are among the factors wresting decisions about fleet management away from the traditional fleet manager and towards the boardroom.Technology, however, can give the business and the drivers unprecedented levels of control and visibility.Bob Harbey, business development director at the US-based company Microlise, says: “No longer can simplistic ‘dots on the map’ technology provide operations managers with the information and control they need to address issues such as the Working Time Directive and pressure to cut carbon footprints and fuel costs.” Green issues are, a recent survey suggests, among the three most important challenges for fleet managers.Mr Harbey says that modern technology allows managers to track driver progress, update customers on delivery times, warn of delays where necessary, and contact drivers to change route if an ad hoc pick up is needed.“Smart telematics can also allow managers to ensure driver credibility with technology feeding back every time the doors of the vehicle are opened, stopping internal theft, which is especially important with high value products and helping to track the way the vehicle is driven,” he says.Drivers, of course, are resentful of anything that smacks to them of “spy-in-the-cab” measures.Hitachi Capital Vehicle Solutions, the UK fleet management arm of Japan’s Hitachi group, offers a sensing device located in the vehicle that provides the driver with a green, amber or red signal, depending on how the car is being driven.Heavy or careless cornering, for example, would throw up an amber: an emergency stop, a red.Phil Peace, the company’s sales director, says: “Having that information in the car means that through self-management, drivers drive more effectively.”The company, with 40,000 cars and commercial vehicles on its books, exemplifies the modern approach – essentially leveraging technology to provide fleet management services to companies to allow them to concentrate on their core activities.For the driver, Mr Peace explains, the principal aim is to ensure that the vehicle is there when it is needed and appropriately maintained. A password-protected extranet site and a helpdesk give drivers all the information they need.They can, for example, check what their company will allow them to do and what not. If they lose their keys, they can retrieve the numbers from the site. They can go through the whole process of choosing, ordering and configuring their car online. An online calculator will give them an idea of their tax liability.For a fleet manager, Hitachi attempts to provide as much strategically valuable information as possible. Its basic fleet management software is Kerridge Kestrel, provided by the US-based services group ADP, over which it runs business intelligence software which provides a “dashboard” giving the manager an overview of the state of the fleet.It will, for example, show the mix of makes in the fleet, which can be a powerful asset for large fleets when negotiating manufacturer support. It will also indicate, via a red section on a dial, when particular cars are due for road-worthiness testing. The service includes provision for checking drivers’ licences and an online assessment of driving ability as well as checks on CO2 emissions and carbon offsets.Tracking vehicle movements in real time is important both for control and fiscal reasons. Cognito, the UK-based mobile workforce specialist, says tax changes on company vehicles used for personal activities that came into force last April mean that the rates can increase by 600 per cent, unless fleet managers can prove the vehicle has been used solely for business purposes.STVA, a Paris-based transport and logistics company has, in collaboration with ALD Automotive, developed a web-based system to track the whereabouts of any vehicle in its supply chain.It comprises three software packages: an ordering system that enables ALD employees to plot vehicle movements, specifying address, customer, vehicle and date details; a logistic management system to provide-the most efficient and cost effective way of moving vehicles around; and a sub-contractor interface so approved suppliers can update movement progress and enter cost details.From another perspective, Verizon Wireless, part of the US-based telecommunications group, has developed a global positioning system-based application that can provide fleet managers with information, including the location and speed of a vehicle and how many times the ignition has been turned on or off.A web-based application, Field Force Manager, allows the business to map the location of employees, jobs and other activities in real time, schedule and dispatch jobs and receive fleet, job and employee reports.Carbon, tax and regulatory issues are not the whole story, however. Aspective Fleet Management, part of the Vodafone mobile phone group, seems to have the right priorities. Jeremy Squire, head of sales, customers and field service for the company says its automated, on-demand tools are helping companies achieve efficiencies in fleet and workforce management.“Innserve, for example, is a company maintaining drinks dispensing systems in pubs and restaurants across the UK. About 400,000 maintenance calls and 70,000 installations can be allocated on the basis of availability, location and resources.”“The system is robust enough to ensure the UK should never run out of beer and is available 365 days of the year to 3,000 engineers,” he says."
125;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2008-04-30T20:49:06Z;Overview: Fed rate cut move unsettles investors;;The Federal Reserve unsettled US markets on Wednesday, when after cutting the Fed funds rate by an expected 25 basis points to 2 per cent, the central bank left its policy outlook open.Meanwhile, Brazil’s stock and bond markets and currency rallied sharply after Standard & Poor’s upgraded the country’s sovereign rating to triple B minus, the lowest investment grade rung. The Bovespa index surged more than 6 per cent to a record high.The Fed’s latest move did not prevent a strong month for global equity markets. However, doubts about the economy and whether the Fed has cut rates to their lowest point in the current cycle sparked a weaker dollar, while US bond yields were lower in late trade.“A Fed pause is not cast in stone and the risks on rates remain heavily skewed to the downside,” said Alan Ruskin, strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital.Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at the Hartford financial services group, said the accompanying statement from the Fed was similar to that issued at its last meeting but noted that it referred to the “substantial” easing of monetary policy already carried out.“The Fed is getting the markets ready for a period of transition,” she said. “It may still have to cut rates again – but importantly, its next meeting is not for eight weeks, which will give it a chance to monitor the data.”Drew Matus, economist at Lehman Brothers said: “These comments could be interpreted as a neutral bias although we believe the probability of a cut is still more likely than a hike.”Earlier, Wall Street pushed higher as US gross domestic product data showed that the economy had expanded at an annual rate of 0.6 per cent in the first quarter, slightly more than the consensus forecast and the same pace as in the last three months of 2007.“The rise, along with the recently announced faster pace of tax rebates, raises doubts as to whether or not real GDP will decline at all in 2008, leaving many people wondering what happened to the recession,” said Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wachovia.However real final sales to domestic purchasers slid by 0.4 per cent on an annual basis, the first negative reading since the 1990-91 recession.Ahead of the April employment report due tomorrow, payrolls group ADP Employer Services said that 10,000 private sector jobs had been created in the US in April compared with expectations of a decline of 70,000. However, analysts noted that the ADP reports had recently been much stronger than the official payrolls figures.The Bank of Japan, meanwhile, left interest rates on hold as it lowered its growth forecasts but raised its inflation expectations.“The BoJ made it clear that it now has a neutral stance on rates,” said Hiroshi Shiraishi, of Lehman Brothers. “We continue to expect the BoJ to be on hold throughout this year and start hiking rates in the second half of 2009.”The BoJ’s announcement followed news of a 3.1 per cent slump in Japanese factory output in March, a much bigger decline than had been expected.The data, plus the lack of action by the BoJ, prompted a steep rise in Japanese government bonds as short-covering emerged following last week’s plunge.The yield on the 10-year JGB fell 5 basis points to 1.57 per cent.After the Fed’s decision the yield on the 10-year US Treasury fell 8bp to 3.74 per cent while the yield on the two-year note fell 7bp to 2.28 per cent.In Europe, the 10-year Bund yield was 1bp lower at 4.13 per cent.In the currency markets, the prospects for eurozone interest rates came back into focus after the European Commission’s economic sentiment index fell to its lowest since August 2005 and inflation data for the region came in weaker than forecast.The euro touched a one-month low against the dollar in early trade. Its subsequent recovery gained traction after the Fed move and the euro was up 0.4 per cent late in New York.European equity markets rounded off a strong month positively, while Wall Street fell back. The S&P 500 fell 0.4 per cent, a monthly gain of 4.8 per cent, its first rally since October.The pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.7 per cent, giving it a gain in April of 6 per cent – its best monthly performance since October 2003.In Asia, the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo slipped 0.3 per cent but recorded an 11 per cent monthly rise, its best for 13 years.In commodities, oil prices retreated on news of a big rise in US crude inventories last week, with West Teaxs Intermediate dipping below $114 a barrel.
126;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Overview: Investors remain hopeful that worst is over;;Wall Street was unable to extend the upward momentum that fuelled global equities on Wednesday. Trading across markets was volatile as investors digested unsettling comments from Ben Bernanke, Federal Reserve chairman.During the New York afternoon session, oil and gold prices reversed early losses as the dollar drifted lower. Although stocks surrendered modest morning gains, the tone remained constructive in the credit market.“After the big move - on Tuesday for equities and credit - the give back has been minimal and that is encouraging,” said Michael Kastner, portfolio manager at SterlingStamos. “We can expect a period where markets back and fill and it seems we saw the worst during the last 10 days of March.”The Fed said on Wednesday it would lend $25bn in Treasuries for high quality debt held by dealers. Last week, the Fed exchanged $75bn in bonds for lower quality debt and the smaller auction suggests that stress in the system has been reduced.Others, however are wary about the recent recovery in global equity markets, sparked by the Fed and other central banks averting the imminent threat of a financial meltdown.“Confidence within the financial sector itself remains fragile,” said Julian Jessop, of Capital Economics. “The broader economic fallout from the credit crisis will persist for months and maybe even years to come.”Mr Bernanke underlined that point when he warned the Congressional joint economic committee that the US economy would not grow much in the first half of this year and could even contract “slightly”.He also said that much of the needed economic and financial market adjustment had already taken place, which some market watchers interpreted as suggesting that the scope for further interest rate cuts might be limited.Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital said: “The bottom line is that the Fed has downgraded the near-term economic outlook since its latest round of projections in January but has not changed its view that growth will begin to pick up in the second half of this year and return to a trend-like pace in 2009”.There was some heartening news after ADP Employers Service, the data provider, said private sector jobs had increased by 8,000 last month compared with the consensus forecast for a drop of 45,000 and a revised 18,000 decline in February.The ADP survey, however has been a poor indicator ahead of the monthly payroll reports. The survey for March is released on Friday and economists expect a decline of 50,000 jobs.Asian equity markets put in powerful performances as they played catch-up with the gains recorded in Europe and the US on Tuesday.In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average rose 4.2 per cent to its highest level for a month while Hong Kong rose 3 per cent and Sydney gained 2.6 per cent.Europe also continued in a strong vein, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rising 1.2 per cent for a two-day gain of 4.4 per cent.Late in New York, the S&P 500 had closed 0.2 per cent lower, after recording an early rise of 0.6 per cent.Credit spreads continued to tighten across the board.The investment-grade CDX North America index fell 10 basis points to 120bp. In Europe, the iTraxx Crossover index of mainly junk-rated credits tightened 17bp to 521bp.Credit default swaps on UBS continued to tighten following Tuesday’s news of further big writedowns at the Swiss bank.Interest rate futures market lowered the odds of further aggressive interest rate cuts by the Fed following Mr Bernanke’s testimony.A quarter-point cut in the Fed funds rate to 2 per cent at the central bank’s next meeting remained fully priced in but the odds of a 50bp easing were reduced to 12 per cent. In mid-March those odds were at 80 per cent.That helped prompt a flattening of the yield curve on US government bonds.The yield on the two-year Treasury was up 12bp at 1.90 per cent late on Wednesday, while the 30-year yield rose 2bp to 4.40 per cent.In Europe, the benchmark 10-year Bund yield rose 3bp to 3.99 per cent.On the currency markets, the dollar was unable to sustain its recent gains against the euro and slipped in afternoon trade.Earlier, the dollar touched a three-week high against the yen as risk appetite showed signs of improving.In commodities, US oil futures rose nearly $4 to $104.83 a barrel in volatile trade. The latest US inventories data showed an larger-than-forecast rise in crude stocks but a hefty fall in gasoline supplies.Gold rebounded to just below the $900 an ounce mark and pared some recent losses.
127;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Surprise rise in US private sector jobs;;Private sector employers unexpectedly added to the US workforce last month, providing a degree of reassurance to economists who fear an economic downturn could trigger a sharp rise in unemployment.However, the initial boost to investor sentiment was offset by a bigger-than-expected drop in factory orders, underscoring weakness in the US manufacturing sector.Nonfarm private employment increased by 8,000 in March - a far stronger result than the decline of 45,000 jobs forecast by economists. The previous month’s figures were also revised higher, from a loss of 23,000 jobs to a decline of 18,000.The uptick in private employment helped assuage some of investors’ worst fears about the employment market ahead of Friday’s closely-watched jobs report.However, Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said little weight could be put on one number: “It does not necessarily mean there was a real improvement in the state of the labour market in March because the data are very noisy from month-to-month.”Economists at Lehman Brothers also advised caution, because ADP payroll growth has tended to outpace official private employment growth.Although some economists revised their estimates for nonfarm payrolls following the ADP report, Friday’s employment report is still expected to show show a third consecutive month of jobs losses.Small private businesses, with less than 50 employees, appear to be holding up better than their larger competitors, adding 55,000 jobs last month compared to a decline of 52,000 jobs at companies with more than 500 workers.On a sector basis, private sector service-providing industries added 85,000 jobs, but this was largely offset by a loss of 77,000 positions in the goods-producing sector. Manufacturing was also particularly weak, showing a decline of 58,000 jobs last month.Underscoring the problems facing US manufacturers, the US commerce department said new orders at US factories declined for a second consecutive month, falling 1.3 per cent in February, much more than a 0.8 per cent drop forecast by economists.Factory orders in January declined a revised 2.3 per cent, a slight improvement on the 2.5 per cent fall originally stated.
128;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2008-01-30T22:41:28Z;Wall Street rally proves shortlived;;A brief rally by US stocks fizzled out in late trading on Wednesday after a 50 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee failed to convince traders the US economy is on the mend.Financial companies led a rebound immediately after the Fed cut the funds rate to 3 per cent but traders then took profits as rumours began circulating of more potential downgrades at key bond insurers.A 50bp cut was almost universally expected and analysts said that although there was considerable downside potential if the Fed had not satisfied the market, the upside from its more aggressive stance was limited.“People are selling any kind of rally they can get and lock in any profits they can,” Ryan Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management, said. “Anyone who things these problems are going to disappear with a single cut has more thinking to do.”The S&P 500 closed down 0.5 per cent at 1,355.81 near its lows for the session, having earlier soared 1.7 per cent immediately after the Fed eased. Of the S&P’s ten leading sector only industrials and technology ended in positive territory with telecoms and financials weakest.The Nasdaq Composite gave up 0.4 per cent to 2,349 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.3 per cent to 12,442.83.“It’s not a catalyst for an immediate rebound in the economy by any means. If the Fed hadn’t delivered we would have been looking at a lot more red numbers,” Hugh Whelan, equity manager at Hartford Investment Management, said.The Fed has now cut interest rates by 125bp in little more than a week responding to concerns that the US economy is slowing rapidly.“This removes the fear that things are going to get horribly bad. I think they did what they had to do and it takes that worse case scenario off the table,” Bill Stone, chief investment strategist for PNC Wealth Management, said.Further evidence of the problems the Fed is trying to tackle was provided by a report which showed the economy barely grew in last three months of 2007. For all of 2007, the US economy expanded at its slowest pace since 2002, just 2.2 per cent.The news was a blow for those equity investors who have tentatively become more optimistic in recent days about growth prospects for US companies.“The new leg down in housing, along with the continuation of the retrenching trend by the US consumer, is weighing on growth,” said TJ Marta, strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “The Fed has a growth problem and a financial crisis to deal with.”However, a snapshot of private sector employment painted a contrasting picture, as a projection of hiring in January by ADP showed a rise of 130,000 jobs.Although ADP numbers can be volatile, economists now expect the closely watched January employment report, due on Friday, to show a gain of 65,000, up from 18,000 in December.The S&P financial index rallied 4 per cent off its session-low after the Fed cut rates but the sector closed in negative territory after Fitch Ratings cut bond insurer FGIC’s triple-A rating to double-A. Ambac Financial and MBIA fell 15.9 per cent to $10.87 and 12.6 per cent to $13.96 respectively on fears they face downgrades from either Moody’s or S&P.Oppenheimer analyst Meredith Whitney said banks may have to write down up to $70bn if bond insurers lose their AAA credit ratings, with losses concentrated at Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and UBS.“This is significant, as many investors are of the belief that the fourth quarter was a ‘kitchen sink’ for all outstanding capital hits this credit cycle,” Ms Whitney said. “When it becomes clear [as we think it will] that more charges are on the horizon, we believe the market will take another turn for the worse.”Citi fell 0.1 per to $27.87 while Merrill gave up 2.4 per cent to $56.08 after its chief executive, John Thain, said the bank’s net exposure to monoline insurers was $3.5bn.In the technology sector Yahoo reported a 23 per cent decline in fourth quarter profit and gave a cautious outlook for 2008. The shares slumped 8.5 per per cent to $19.05 after several analysts downgraded the stock.After the closing bell Amazon said its fourth quarter profit more than doubled to $207m, in line with expectations, but the shares, which closed up 0.4 per cent at $74.21, fell 8.3 per cent after-hours.Rambus, the chipmaker, fared much better, soaring 17.7 per cent to $19.44 on hopes it could claim $10bn in royalties by winning a patent infringement case.The recent rebound in US homebuilder stocks came to an end after Centex, the number four US firm, saw its fiscal third-quarter loss widen to $975.2m, much worse than analysts had feared. The shares fell 8.9 per cent to $26.41.Merck, 3.2 per cent weaker at $46.47, fell to a $1.63bn loss after it took a big charge to cover litigation costs. Although adjusted earnings beat expectations, analysts were disappointed by sales of a cervical cancer vaccine.Boeing was the best performing Dow component after it increased fourth quarter earnings by 4 per cent and raised its 2008 profit outlook. The shares climbed 2.3 per cent to $82.84.
129;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2007-12-05T22:28:09Z;Wall St rallies led by tech stocks;;Wall Street stocks rose on Wednesday for the first time this week, boosted by a solid gauge of private sector employment hiring in November.The S&P 500 closed up 1.5 per cent at 1,485.01 near its high for the day.Among leading sectors, technology lead with a gain of 2.5 per cent, followed by a 2 per cent rise in financials and a 1.9 per cent rally in energy stocks.Not all the news was good for financials however. Concerns about US bond insurers sparked a dramatic turnaround in that sector.Moody’s issued a statement saying that MBIA “was at greater risk of a capital shortfall than previously communicated, and a shortfall is now considered somewhat likely”. This could threaten its AAA rating.MBIA swiftly surrendered its gains from early trade and the stock fell 15.9 per cent to $27.42. Meanwhile, Ambac dropped 8.9 per cent to $23.52. The cost to insure MBIA and Ambac debt against default also rose.The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.8 per cent to 2,666.36, while the Nasdaq 100 gained 2 per cent to close at 2,099.31.Blue-chips also rose sharply and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.5 per cent higher at 13,444.96.Shares in AIG led bluechips, as they rose 4.9 per cent to close at $58.15. Another Dow financial, Citigroup rallied 3.5 per cent to $33.69, while a 4.2 per cent rise in Microsoft to $34.15 also boosted the blue-chip barometer.Smaller companies were not ignored by investors and the Russell 2000 index rose 1.8 per cent to 765.64. “The reason for today’s rally is, for the first time in a long time, a good old-fashioned reason – that the economy is doing well and not whether the Fed will cut rates or not,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist of Wells Capital Management.In economic news, the ADP national employment report estimated that 189,000 private sector jobs were created in November. Economists had expected a 50,000 gain, and the news pushed bond yields higher.“As long as people have jobs, consumers will spend money,” said Mr Paulsen.The ADP number suggests that the November employment report, due on Friday, will expand by around 210,000 jobs. Economists, however expect a gain of 70,000 jobs.Other data did little to dissuade investors that the Federal Reserve will ease its stance on rates next week.The Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-manufacturing businesses, slipped more than expected to a reading of 54.1 in November from 55.8 the previous month.Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital, said: “This mix of decelerating growth, with higher price indications, tends to play more to the crowd expecting a 25bp cut in the funds rate next week, rather than a 50bp cut.”A bullish note was struck for technology after Thomas Weisel Partners said demand for notebook computers would increase in emerging markets, particularly Brazil, Russia, India and China. The broker upgraded Intel to “overweight”.The Philadelphia Exchange’s semiconductor index gained 2.3 per cent.IBM was up 1.4 per cent at $108.16 on the news but AMD gave up gains closing down 3.7 per cent at $8.91. Apple rose 3.2 per cent to $185.50.Energy was also in favour and the sector held much of its gains in spite of oil prices falling after a surge in early trade.ExxonMobil rose 2 per cent at $89.92 as the American oil index rose 1.6 per cent.Among laggards, cable operator Comcast said 2007 revenue would be lower and expenses higher than previously forecast, citing greater competition and a slowing economy. Shares in the company plunged 8.7 per cent to $18.92.Among gainers in the financial sector, Fannie Mae recovered after initial falls. Its shares added 2.7 per cent to $36.13.The mortgage financier said late on Tuesday that it would issue $7bn in preferred stock and cut its dividend to raise cash.Fellow government-backed mortgage company Freddie Mac made a similar move last week. Its shares gained 7.3 per cent to 34.67.Countrywide advanced 4.2 per cent to $10.42, but still remains 77 per cent down on the year.
130;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2007-12-05T22:16:08Z;Global overview: US data lifts equity markets;;Reassuring US employment data helped soothe some concerns about the impact of the credit squeeze on the global economy on Wednesday, giving a strong boost to equity markets and the dollar.Credit concerns, however were stoked after Moody’s, the ratings agency suggested that MBIA the bond insurer would likely reveal a capital shortfall.There was also renewed money market tightness. Sterling and euro one-month Libor rates continued to rise, although there was a modest easing in the dollar rate – the first for more than three weeks.Economic reports, however were the main focus of the day and buoyed equities. ADP’s National Employment Report showed that US companies added a whopping 189,000 jobs in November – more than three times the consensus forecast.Analysts said the data suggested the headline non-farm payrolls number would now exceed 200,000, against a previous consensus of 80,000, although they also noted that ADP’s figures had been erratic in the past.“Statistically speaking, ADP is the best single indicator of payrolls month-to-month, but it is still not very good,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.“Prudence dictates we move up our [NFP] estimate from our initial 50,000 number. We now look for payrolls to rise by about 125,000.”In other data, the third-quarter advance in non-farm business productivity was revised from 4.9 per cent to 6.3 per cent at an annual rate. Unit labour costs showed the biggest decline for four years.However, a note of caution was injected into the day’s proceedings by the Institute for Supply Management’s November service sector survey. While the headline index was a shade weaker than expected, it still indicated expansion in the sector, but analysts were alarmed by a surge in the prices-paid component to its highest level for more than two years. “This, given the Fed’s inflation worries and coupled with the strong ADP employment report, indicates that a 25 basis rate cut looks more likely than a 50bp move at next week’s [Federal Reserve] policy meeting,” said James Knightley, economist at ING.Meanwhile, expectations for a cut in UK interest rates on Thursday were heightened by a weak service sector report and news of a third successive monthly decline in the Halifax house price index.“All the hallmarks are building for a sharp correction in the economy and the Bank of England would be ill-advised to keeping sitting on the fence or else they will end up with a UK recession on their hands next year,” said analysts at Bear Stearns.By contrast, soft service sector and retail sales releases in the eurozone were unlikely to trigger any change of heart at the European Central Bank just yet, analysts said.“Despite the weakening activity picture and market conditions, we suspect that renewed concerns over the inflation outlook will mean that the ECB will continue to signal a bias towards further policy tightening for some months yet,” said Capital Economics.Equity market indices moved higher across the board. In New York, the S&P 500 index closed 1.5 per cent higher, while in Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 rose 1.7 per cent. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average climbed 0.8 per cent while the Hong Kong market gained 1.6 per cent. Emerging market stocks were also firmer.US government bonds suffered modest losses and the yield on the two-year Treasury rebounded from a high of 2.98 per cent after the ADP number and was at 2.90 per cent in late trade. Buyers sought Treasuries after the MBIA news. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was up 3bp at 3.93 per cent.In Europe, the 10-year Bund yield was 1bp higher at 4.05 per cent but the yield on the 10-year UK Gilt was down 4bp at 4.54 per cent as the market was gripped by rate cut hopes.On the currency markets, the prospect that the Fed might not cut rates by as much as some had feared sent the dollar higher against both the euro and the yen. Sterling retreated sharply on the back of rate cut talk.In commodities, oil prices initially moved above $90 after Opec rejected demands to increase output, however January West Texas Intermediate, the US crude benchmark, ended the session at $87.49, down 83 cents.
131;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T20:19:31+0000;US jobs report eases slowdown fears;;"Employment in the private sector rose almost four times faster than expected last month, according to an estimate from ADP, the payroll services firm, soothing fears that the credit crisis is about to cause a sharp economic slowdown.The jobs figures came as a slew of other data on Wednesday suggested slowing, rather than plunging, economic growth. New orders for manufacturing goods rose in October; productivity growth was the strongest for four years in the third quarter, driving down labour costs; and business activity in the service sector was still growing last month, allbeit at a slower pace.“The economy is softening quite a bit, but not in a dangerous way,” said Bruce Kasman, chief economist at JP Morgan.The US economy added 189,000 jobs last month, compared with 106,000 in October, and much more than the 50,000 jobs that economists had predicted.Attention has focused on employment this month as a measure of how the credit crisis and housing slump are feeding through into the rest of the US economy.The ADP report is compiled from pay records that the company processes for nearly 23m employees at US companies. It foreshadows the government’s official non-farm payroll figures, out this Friday.Ben Bernanke, Fed chairman, in a speech last week cleared the way for an interest rate cut and indicated that the jobs numbers would play a important role in the Fed’s decision.“The jobs number on Friday are the health barometer of the economy,” said John Ryding, economist at Bear Stearns.The ADP figures point to a relatively healthy jobs environment. The monthly average rise in private sector employment for the three months until the end of November was 123,000, up from 43,000 between July and September.The Fed is generally expected to cut rates by a quarter point to 4.25 per cent, although some observers predict a half-point cut.“Plainly the market is not positioned for a 100,000 plus November non-farm payroll number and a decent upside surprise would engender a larger adjustment to macro thinking [and Fed expectations] than a similar magnitude downside surprise,” said Alan Ruskin of RBS Greenwich Capital in a note.Yields on 10-year Treasury bonds rose on Wednesday morning, and stocks opened higher after the data was released.“We expect a 25 basis point ease [at the next Fed interest rate meeting] and a clear message that the Fed is not done yet,” said Mr Kasman.However, the ADP estimates seem to contradict data from the US labour department that have shown both initial and ongoing claims for unemployment benefits rising. Rising unemployment suggests a slowdown in jobs growth. The ADP figures are a relatively new data set and have turned out to be unreliable in the past, according to economists.The current economic data also reveals little about the reflaring of the credit crisis, which after cooling off at the end of September and throughout much of October, had reignited in November. “Anything that happened from mid-November to early December is not going to be picked up in this economic data,” said Mr Ryding.US productivity in the third quarter rose by the largest amount in four years, according to revised figures from the labour department, showing lower hourly pay and rising output per worker. Non-farm productivity rose at an annual rate of 6.3 per cent, compared with 2.2 per cent growth in the previous quarter, and the largest gain since the third quarter of 2003.The strong productivity numbers, and slowing growth in labour costs, will help ease the Fed’s concerns over rising prices. Productivity has probably been rising as the US economy shifts towards greater exports as the dollar weakens while strong growth in emerging markets such as China and Latin America maintains demand for US goods.“This is unequivocal good news,” said Brian Bethune, an economist at Global Insight. “Keeping labour costs contained at this point in the middle of the business cycle is quite a remarkable achievement. It takes some pressure off the sense that a pipeline of inflation has been building.”The service sector slowed in November, according to the Institute of Supply Management, and was weaker than expected, as the troubles in the credit markets and housing slump spread deeper into the economy. The ISM’s index of business activity in the service sector fell to 54.1 per cent, where a level above 50 suggests growth. Economists had expected a level of 55 per cent. The index showed that employment growth in the sector fell, and was nearly flat over the month.New manufacturing orders grew by 0.5 per cent, driven by orders for aircraft and defence."
132;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2007-05-30T20:50:28Z;S&P 500 hits record high after Fed minutes;;The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Wednesday, as investors looked on the bright side of the Federal Reserve’s recent meeting minutes.While stocks are set to record their third straight positive monthly gain on Thursday, investors face a cocktail of potentially potent economic data due on Friday.On Wednesday, fears that a sharp slide in Chinese stocks overnight would spark a similar reaction on Wall Street faded early. Stocks opened lower but losses were quickly contained. “Any link between Shanghai and the S&P 500 is tenuous at best,” said Jack Ablin, portfolio manager at Harris Private Bank.For some investors, the lack of a major pullback in US stocks was disappointing.“We were ready for some opportunities in equities if there was a large sell-off,” said Michael Kastner, port-folio manager at Sterling-Stamos.After the Fed minutes were released, the leading benchmarks made fresh highs and the S&P 500 index finished up 0.8 per cent at 1,530.23, above its March 2000 close of 1,527.46. The June S&P futures contract rebounded from a low of 1,512.60 earlier in the day and closed at a new contract high of 1,532.50. Within the S&P, the energy and telecoms sectors led gains, while health care lingered in negative territory.The Nasdaq Composite shrugged off early losses and closed up 0.8 per cent at 2,592.59, a fresh six year high. A decline of 0.4 per cent in semiconductor stocks dented the technology sector, led by Intel, down 1 per cent at $22.08 and Applied Materials, off 1.5 per cent at $18.93.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8 per cent to 13,633.08, its 25th record close this year. Caterpillar, up 3.6 per cent at $78.48, led gainers in the Dow.Healthcare stocks Merck, down 1.3 per cent at $52.71, and Pfizer, off 0.5 per cent at $27.41, both weighed on the blue-chip benchmark.A bright spot in the healthcare sector was Biogen Idec, up 5.9 per cent at $52.13 after it approved a $3bn buy-back of its stocks.With attention focused on employment, inflation and manufacturing reports due on Friday, stocks generally traded in a narrow range.“All eyes are on the employment report,” said Mr Ablin. “The labour market has been sustaining the consumer in the face of higher gas prices and weak housing.”On Wednesday, ADP said it expects 97,000 new private sector jobs were created in May. The ADP report which excludes government workers suggests payrolls will be around 117,000 this month, below the current consensus call of 135,000.Traders believe a payroll gain of at least 100,000 jobs will be enough to soothe concerns that the labour market is faltering.Mr Kastner said investors were hoping that capital investment spending would take over from consumer spending in pulling up economic growth and take over from consumer spending in the months ahead. He also believed corporate earnings were likely to fall this year, pressuring stock valuations.Merger and acquisition activity on Wednesday was led by the news that CDW the technology retailer had agreed to a $7.3bn private equity buy-out.InterContinental Exchange struck a $665m deal with the Chicago Board Options Exchange in the hope of boosting the chances of its hostile bid for CBOT Holdings.At this juncture, the CBOT has agreed to be bought by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. ICE hopes its deal with CBOE will resolve a legal dispute between the options exchange and CBOT, which argues that some of its members are entitled to an equity stake in CBOE.Shares in ICE rose 0.65 per cent to $148.71, CBOT shares gained 2.4 per cent to $197.62, while CME was up 0.4 per cent at $527.85.In other deal news, eSpeed, an electronic bond trading platform controlled by Cantor Fitzgerald, said it would buy BGC Partners, Cantor’s privately held brokerage unit, in a $1.3bn deal. Shares in eSpeed rose 0.4 per cent to $9.23.In earnings news, Coldwater Creek reported a stronger than forecast first quarter profit and the retailer rose 16.6 per cent to $24.37.Pulte Homes said it would cut 16 per cent of its workforce, and shares fell 0.1 per cent to $27.41.Shares in Coca-Cola were up 1.6 per cent at $53.05. Citigroup upgraded the beverage maker to a “buy” with a $59 price target.NiSource fell 7.8 per cent to $22.07 after the utility said it had concluded talks without selling its Indiana electricity assets, but would still consider spinning off that unit. Utility stocks have recently pared solid gains this year – the S&P utility sector is up 12.8 per cent in 2007 – as investors have become concerned at the sector’s low dividend yield as compared with rising bond yields.“Utilities have run a little further beyond reasonable valuations,” said Mr Ablin.Verisign was 5.3 per cent higher at $29.43 after chief executive Stratton Sclavos resigned. The internet infrastructure company’s stock is up 22.1 per cent this year on the back of expansion and diversification of its operations.
133;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T20:32:47+0000;Global Overview: Equities push higher on earnings;;Global equity markets pushed higher on Wednesday as robust corporate earnings, relentless merger and acquisition activity and a fall in oil prices lifted sentiment.The dollar also remained on the ascendant, climbing to a two-month high against the yen as the markets remained impressed by the surprisingly robust US manufacturing data from the Institute for Supply Management on Tuesday.However, Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said he was “baffled” by the strength of the figures.“The rise in the ISM index is impossible to square with either the regional surveys released over the past few weeks or our medium-term, yield-driven model,” he said. “We think it is quite likely that in their next iterations the ISM will drop sharply.”James Knightley, at ING, agreed that the bounce in the ISM was not consistent with other recently published data but said that it could not be ignored.“It will help to keep the Fed’s hawkish rhetoric in place for a while longer,” he said. “It also suggests that the US economy could rebound strongly in the second half of 2007, which dents the arguments for rate cuts, if this comes true.”On the currency markets, the dollar rose as high as Y120.31, while the euro spent most of the day below $1.36. The US economics focus began to switch to the release on Friday of non-farm payrolls data, particularly after the publication on Wednesday of a weak employment report by ADP Employer Services.Equity markets recorded strong gains on Wednesday. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed further into record territory and closed up 0.6 per cent. The S&P 500 rose 0.65 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite index gained 1 per cent.Analysts pointed out that the Dow had been outperforming the broader market for several weeks, as dollar weakness boosted interest in large multinational stocks.“If the strength in these stocks fails to broaden out to include the other major indices, we could see investors get a bit squeamish,” Cantor Fitzgerald said.European and Asian markets joined in the party as investors returned to the fray after May Day holidays on Tuesday.In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.5 per cent, with media stocks among the biggest gainers because of fresh speculation about consolidation in the sector.Asian stocks rallied, with the Nikkei 225 Average in Tokyo up 0.7 per cent, Hong Kong 0.3 per cent higher and South Korea up 0.7 per cent.Bangkok climbed 0.9 per cent to its highest level for four months on hopes that the central bank would cut interest rates.In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 index leapt 1.5 per cent to a record close after the Reserve Bank of Australia left interest rates unchanged at 6.25 per cent after benign first-quarter inflation figures last week.The next focus for investors will be the central bank’s quarterly statement on monetary policy to be published on Friday.“The RBA will likely retain an explicit or implicit tightening bias in the statement and tighten again in August following the second-quarter consumer price index,” said Stephen Kirchner at Action Economics.In government bond markets, an early advance for US Treasuries after the ADP data was reversed when slightly stronger than forecast US factory orders figures were released.The gains for equities also weighed on bonds, traders said.The yield on the 10-year Treasury was 0.2 basis points higher at 4.644 per cent late on Wednesday and the yield on the two-year note was also at 4.644 per cent.European bond prices fell back after data showed eurozone unemployment dipping to a record low and manufacturing in the region continuing to expand.The 10-year Bund yield was up 6.5bp to 4.207 per cent.UK gilts followed other bond markets lower, in spite of weak UK mortgage approvals data.In commodities, oil prices fell sharply even though the latest US inventories broadly matched market expectations. June Brent tumbled below $66 a barrel at one point, but closed at $66.25 a barrel, down 75 cents.Gold continued to retreat as the dollar remained firm, but ended off the day’s lows.
134;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2007-05-02T17:39:11Z;Manufacturing survey extends dollar gains;;The dollar rose to a two-month high against the yen Wednesday, extending its gains following a stronger-than-expected survey of the US manufacturing sector.On Tuesday, the ISM survey of US manufacturing rose to its highest level in almost a year in April, confounding expectations and helping the dollar to pull away from the all-time low of $1.3680 against the euro it hit last Friday.Gavin Friend, strategist at Commerzbank, said the robustness of the ISM report would, for some, call into question the idea of a gradual slowdown in US activity and eventual rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.“It is early days for such a judgment,” said Mr Friend. “Given the pattern of US data generally, markets will have to wait for next month’s ISM report for some clarification that things are turning around.”The dollar rose 0.5 per cent to an eight-week high of Y120.28 against the yen early in Wednesday’s session and climbed 0.3 per cent to a peak of $1.3562 against the euro as data showing a smaller-than-expected rise in March German unemployment weighed on the single currency.However, the dollar later pared some of its gains after the ADP employment report showed a weaker-than-expected rise in private sector employment in the US in April.However, analysts said the dollar’s muted reaction to the ADP figures reflected caution ahead of Thursday’s US non-farm payrolls data.By mid-afternoon in New York, the dollar was 0.1 per cent higher at $1.3595 against the euro and up 0.3 per cent at Y120.10 against the yen.Hans Redeker, global head of strategy at BNP Paribas, said the generally dollar bearish market positioning, especially against high-yielding currencies, would add to the US currency’s upside mo­m­entum in the short term.“The dollar has been used as a funding currency against the Australian dollar, the New Zealand dollar and to a lesser degree against the pound,” he said. “Accordingly, a rebounding dollar will see these currencies come under the most pressure.”The pound fell 0.4 per cent to $1.9900 against the dollar, while the Australian and New Zealand dollars fell 0.3 per cent to $0.8250 and 0.4 per cent to $0.7378 against their US counterpart respectively.The pound also lost ground against the euro, falling 0.3 per cent to £0.6830, after data revealed below-forecast UK mortgage app­rovals in March. Matthew Strauss, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said the figures showed that recent rises in UK interest rates were feeding through to the housing market. “The data should reduce the risk of a 50 basis-point hike next week by the Bank of England, but will do little to delay a 25 basis-point hike,” he said.
135;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T21:00:03+0000;Bisys considering management buy-out;;Bisys, the US fund administration company that recently settled SEC fraud charges, has been considering a management buy-out.The group a few months ago hired Bear Stearns to evaluate the viability of a sale of the company, and is leaning towards a buy-out, according to those familiar with the discussions.Bisys in September paid $21m to settle charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission that the company had secretly arranged to kick back part of its fees to 27 fund groups in exchange for getting the funds’ administration business. The deals spanned the five years from 1999 to 2004.Separately, Bisys in October agreed to pay $66.5m to settle a shareholder lawsuit that accused it of falsifying financial statements.A recent research report by Jefferies stockbroking firm said that the best route to recovery for Bisys would be for the company to be sold. A price of at least $13 per share would be justified, it said.Bisys shares have recently been trading at about $12, after falling sharply to below $10 on news of the settlements earlier this year. Before that, it traded in a range of roughly $15.Bisys executives could not be reached for comment.Bisys is a big player in the lucrative field of fund administration, performing back-office functions for mutual fund and hedge fund companies.The group was formed when its business was spun off in 1989 from Automatic Data Processing. It was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1992 and has acquired more than 40 companies.Fund administration firms have received a fillip in recent years from the growing hedge fund industry.Most hedge funds are not big enough to undertake back- and middle-office functions, and so outsource this to fund administrators. Large companies such as Fidelity usuallly do their own fund administration.
136;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2006-12-06T22:09:26Z;Markets awaiting US employment data;;Global markets remained on edge on Wednesday as the countdown continued to the release of key US employment data on Friday.Anticipation over the US non-farm payrolls report for November has been building in markets. Typically one of the most important features of the economic calendar, the report has assumed even greater importance amid the growing divide over the extent of a slowdown of the US economy, not least between the US Federal Reserve and currency and bond markets.While the Fed forecasts a steadily moderating economy, currency and bond markets have been pricing in a harder downturn on expectations that weakness in the housing market and manufacturing would spread to the overall economy.Investors and traders appeared reluctant on Wednesday to take out large positions ahead the payrolls data in spite of one positive clue to its outcome.ADP Employer Services said its monthly survey had shown US companies added 158,000 jobs in November, the most since June. The increase followed a gain of 128,000 in October. The non-farm payrolls are expected to show an increase of 110,000 last month compared with 92,000 in October, according to a Reuters poll of economists.The ADP survey has been highly volatile and criticised as an indicator of the actual increase in non-farm payrolls. However, Ashraf Laidi, chief foreign exchange analyst at CMC Markets, said the ADP survey’s track record in predicting whether non-farm payrolls overall would broadly be better or worse than expected was significantly better.The dollar edged higher. On Wednesday in New York, the euro had eased 0.1 per cent to $1.331 against the greenback. At the same time, Treasuries had weakened with the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond rising 3.3 basis points to 4.479 per cent. US and European equities were largely flat.Traders also appeared cautious ahead of a European Central Bank monetary policy meeting on interest rates on Thursday. The bank is expected to lift its benchmark interest rate a quarter percentage point to 3.5 per cent, according to all 51 analysts polled by Dow Jones.But there will be intense scrutiny of comments by Jean-Claude Trichet, ECB governor, following the rate decision, for clues on the interest rate outlook. Eurozone growth has been more buoyant than expected this year, but on Wednesday saw some weaker-than-expected data on German manufacturing. Orders fell 1.1 per cent in October from September – the second consecutive monthly fall. The market had expected a 1.2 per cent rise.“It [the fall] tends to suggest that the ECB might need to think twice about ploughing full speed ahead to much tougher policy next year,” said David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns.Meanwhile, sterling fell 0.2 per cent at $1.9696 against the dollar in reaction to £2bn of tax increases announced in the UK pre-budget report.Stephen Jen, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley, said the trend of a weak dollar and strong euro and sterling should continue until the US emerged from its economic “soft patch”.He said a reasonable target for the euro was $1.35 against the dollar and $2 for the pound but he did not expect the currencies to overshoot these levels by much. Mr Jen said when the US economy reasserted itself in 2007, possibly by the summer, the dollar would also reassert itself.“I eagerly await the opportunity in several months’ time to buy dollars,” he said.
137;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2006-07-07T21:10:39Z;Market Overview: Stocks subdued in face of geopolitical turmoil;;"World stock markets struggled to make progress this week against a backdrop of uncertainty about global interest rates, record oil prices and heightened geo­political concerns.A weak headline figure in Friday’s US employment report was initially welcomed by stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic, although a second look showed unexpected signs of inflation.Non-farm payrolls rose by 121,000 in June, against expectations of an increase of about 185,000. The weakness was particularly surprising as robust data earlier in the week from payroll services company ADP had persuaded many economists to raise their forecasts for Friday’s numbers.“Presumably, the ADP report will be taken rather less seriously after this,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.But Friday’s data also showed the annual rate of average hourly earnings growth came in at a robust 3.9 per cent, the highest since June 2001.Rob Carnell, economist at ING Financial, said the earnings growth data would keep up the pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again, from the current level of 5.25 per cent, at its first August policy meeting.“The household employment survey released at the same time as non-farm payrolls showed a rise of 387,000, building on a 288,000 rise in May, and suggests employment growth might not be as weak as the headline payrolls figures at first suggested,” he added.On Wall Street Friday, the S&P 500 closed down 0.7 per cent, a loss of 0.4 per cent on the week; the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.2 per cent, off 1.9 per cent for the week and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.2 per cent lower, 0.5 per cent lower for the week.But Treasuries held early gains as investors appeared to shrug off inflation implications of the payrolls report. By midday, the yield on the 10-year bond was down 5.7 basis points on the day and 1.7bp over the week. The dollar fell below Y114 to hit a four-week low against the yen while the euro pushed above $1.28.European markets also had to contend with the threat of higher borrowing costs this week. The European Central Bank left rates unchanged at 2.75 per cent at its meeting on Thursday but gave a very strong hint it would tighten by a quarter point early next month.Monique Wong, fixed income strategist at UBS Investment Research, said the other implication to take away from Thursday’s meeting was the increased possibility of faster-paced rate increases.“If the ECB raises rates in early August, it will automatically mean an increase in the pace of tightening from quarterly to every two months,” she noted. “There would be a distinct chance of the ECB managing two rate increases in the fourth quarter instead of just one.”The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index inched up 0.2 per cent over the week.Asian stocks were rattled by North Korea’s midweek missile tests, although the impact of the news proved short-lived.In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 fell 1.3 per cent over the week, its first weekly decline for a month. In Seoul, the benchmark Kospi index lost 1.7 per cent over the week but rallied on Friday for the first day in five.Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, believes the missile tests could end up being a milestone in China’s emergence as a global power.“The North Korean crisis could well force the Chinese leadership to make a critical choice between a threat to regional security and the imperatives of economic prosperity,” he said.This week’s subdued performances by equity markets came as oil prices climbed to record highs because of high levels of US petrol demand and worries about North Korea and Iran.On Friday, the benchmark US crude future hit a record peak of $75.78 in early trading, but settled at $74.09 down $1.05 on the day.Gold also appeared to be back on an upward track. It held above the $600 an ounce level all week and some traders were predicting a test of $700 in the next few weeks."
138;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2006-07-07T17:03:38Z;Bonds up as jobs data ease rate rise fears;;Government bond prices rallied on Friday after weaker-than-expected US employment data eased worries over the extent of US interest rate rises.The eagerly-awaited non-farm payrolls data showed that 121,000 new jobs had been created in June, up from 92,000 the previous month. However, the figure was well short of recently-raised forecasts for up to 200,000 new jobs. Forecasts had been increased sharply when a survey released on Wednesday by payroll services company ADP indicated the creation of some 380,000 jobs in June.However, hopes that the US Federal Reserve might now have more room after the official data to pause raising rates were countered by further indications of a strong labour market with June average hourly earnings rising at their fastest yearly rate since 2001.“While June’s headline payrolls came through softer than forecast …there was a potential sting in the tail with US wage inflation hitting a fresh five-year high – which will keep the Fed’s inflation hackles up and focused on another rate rise in the next couple of months,” said David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns.US Treasuries rallied and yields fell across the curve on Friday on the payrolls news. In afternoon trade, two-year yields were 3.4bp lower at 5.183 per cent, while 10-year yields down 5.7bp at 5.128 per cent.However, while the 10-year yields were 1.7bp lower over the week, two-years remained up by 2.1bp.European government bonds also rallied late in the day on the payrolls news. The yield on the two-year Schatz was 3.3bp lower at 3.604 per cent, while that on the 10-year bund was down 6bp at 4.056 per cent.This still left yields on the Schatz and the bund higher on the week, by 3bp and 0.2bp respectively.Eurozone issues had firmed on Thursday despite hawkish comments by Jean-Claude Trichet, head of the European Central Bank, following the bank’s decision to leave rates unchanged at 2.75 per cent - as expected. Analysts said that Mr Trichet had given explicit hints that rates would be raised at the ECB’s meeting in early August. However, he eased some of the worst fears of some bond investors by playing down the prospect of a half-point increase.The Bank of England also left rates on hold on Thursday as expected and gilts benefited in spite of more strong data from the housing market.Prices rallied further on Friday to leave the two-year gilt yielding 4.7bp less on the week at 4.717 per cent, while the 10-year yield fell 5.6bp over the week to 4.639 per cent.Japanese government bonds also saw yields decline on Friday, but the benchmark 10-year issue was still 1bp up on the week at 1.960 per cent.
139;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2006-07-06T22:06:24Z;Market Overview: Investors’ greater resilience helps equities and bonds to hit back;;The mood on global financial markets took an optimistic turn on Thursday as both equities and bonds rallied.Greater resilience prevailed after investors were spooked on Wednesday by rising oil prices, geopolitical tensions and interest rate worries after data from payroll services company ADP showed a sharp jump in US employment growth in June.European bonds and shares gained in spite of explicit hints by the European Central Bank that interest rates would rise in early August.US equities rose strongly while US Treasuries firmed. Fears that the ADP survey would foreshadow stronger than expected official numbers on payroll growth out on Friday eased a little after data showed weaker than forecast services sector growth in June. The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing business activity index fell to 57.0 in June from 60.1 in May, its lowest level since January and below consensus forecasts of 59.0.This was somewhat countered by news of a slight fall in jobless claims last week.But investors appeared to be more hopeful that the critical payrolls data would not force the US Federal Reserve’s hand in raising interest rates further.At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.7 per cent higher, the S&P 500 index was 0.3 per cent up and the Nasdaq Composite index was flat.Yields on 10-year Treasuries were down 3.9 basis points at 5.188 per cent, and yields on two-year paper fell 2.5bp to 5.217 per cent.The market benefited from rising forecasts for the impending second-quarter earnings season, particularly oil companies. Oil prices on Thursday dipped back below $75 a barrel after the release of lower-than-forecast levels of gasoline inventories.But oil companies were at the forefront of risers in the US and Europe.Mary Ann Bartels, analyst at Merrill Lynch, said that the consensus second-quarter earnings growth rate for S&P 500 constituents rose from 12.3 per cent last week to 13.4 per cent. She said this was “powered by a dramatic expected rise in the earnings growth of energy stocks” for the second-quarter from 25 per cent last week to 30 per cent.In Europe, market attention focused on the hawkish pronouncements of Jean-Claude Trichet, the European Central Bank president. As widely expected, an ECB monetary policy meeting left the central bank’s benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2.75 per cent.Mr Trichet left few people guessing about the ECB’s intentions when he declared that the bank would exercise “strong vigilance” to ensure price stability. In the past, “vigilance” has been considered a codeword used by Mr Trichet to signal imminent interest rate rises.“It is as plain as punch the ECB is going to raise interest rates at its next meeting in early August,” said David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns. Mr Brown said markets were pricing in a 90 per cent probability of an 25bp interest rate rise at that time.The euro touched a fresh all-time high against the yen and a one-month peak against the dollar. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index rose 0.97 per cent to 1,318.78 while the yield on 10-year Bunds was down 2.4bp to 4.110 per cent.In Asia, share markets were mixed. Tokyo and Seoul still appeared to be weighed down by concern over oil prices and the missile tests by North Korea. The Nikkei 225 Average dropped 1.3 per cent while the Kospi index fell 1.2 per cent. Jakarta ended marginally higher after the Indonesian central bank cut interest rates.
140;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2006-07-06T17:16:31Z;The Short View: Payroll numbers hard to predict;;The ADP (Automatic Data Processing) employment report has raised the stakes for the US non-farm payroll numbers that will be announced on Friday. On Wednesday, the ADP reported a gain of 386,000 private sector jobs in June, the largest increase since it started estimating numbers in 2001.According to Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics, the average difference between the payroll numbers and the private sector component of the non-farm payrolls has been just 60,000 per month. That makes the consensus estimate for a non-farm payroll increase, at 155,000 before the ADP data, look pretty conservative. Shepherdson thinks the ADP number is too high, but is still moving his payrolls forecast up to 200,000.The data will be of consuming interest to investors because of the potential impact on Federal Reserve policy. The Fed’s statement late last month sparked an equity market rally when it suggested the peak in rates might be imminent. But a very high payroll number, pointing to renewed economic strength, might tempt the Fed into further rate rises.A problem for the Fed, and for the markets, is that the payroll data can be very erratic. May’s release was much weaker than expected at just 75,000, and a high number in June may simply reflect a rebound from that shortfall.The picture was made even more hazy on Thursday by jobless claims, which were slightly lower than expected, and by a weaker-than-forecast survey of the services sector.If monetary policy is being guided by data which are full of “noise”, and subject to revision, that introduces a strong element of uncertainty into rate-setting, which adds to volatility in financial markets.For example, Wednesday’s job report saw a jump in Treasury bond yields, because of the implications for higher rates. Then Thursday’s services sector survey sent bond yields back down again, presumably on the grounds that activity is not that strong. But, just to illustrate the confusion, equities initially rose on the jobless claims and good reports from retailers, both signs of economic strength. Perhaps the payroll numbers can provide some much-needed clarity.philip.coggan@ft.com
141;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2020-04-24T21:11:09+0000;Dollar rallies on high US job creation estimate;;The dollar rallied on Wednesday, aided by a report estimating that the US economy created an astounding 368,000 jobs in June.The ADP National Employment Report usually ruffles few feathers in the forex market.However traders were stunned by the ADP report which indicated that June non-farm payrolls, released on Friday, will be well above show the consensus estimate of 155,000.“If this data is reflected in the Bureau of Labor Statistics number then wage inflation will remain a real threat in the US and once again the argument for a pause to the run of rate hikes will potentially start to lose ground,” said Andy Cottrill, senior FX dealer at CMC Markets, who described the ADP number as “somewhat surprising”.With US factory orders data also surpassing expectations, the dollar rose 0.5 per cent to $1.2723 to the euro, 0.7 per cent to Y115.66 versus the yen, 0.5 per cent to $1.8345 against sterling and 0.4 per cent to C$1.1123 against the Canadian dollar.Not everyone was swept along with the tide, however. Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at Bank of New York, remained cautious on payrolls, particularly in light of the employment component of Monday’s Institute for Supply Management manufacturing report dipping below the 50 breakeven level.“The ADP number was well out of the ballpark and that was dollar-positive, but we are setting ourselves up for a big let-down if payrolls disappoint,” he said.“If they are below 150,000 it will be a clear signal to make another run at $1.30 on euro/dollar, and probably a successful run.”Tony Norfield, global head of FX strategy at ABN Amro, attributed the dollar’s gains partly to nervousness over the euro.According to ABN, the market is now pricing in an 80-90 per cent probability that the European Central Bank will speed up its rate normalisation policy and raise rates on August 3.However Mr Norfield fears these bullish rate expectations will unwind if Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the ECB, does not sound sufficiently hawkish at the press conference following Thursday’s rate decision.“The ECB has got to press several buttons at the same time to keep the euro supported and there is a risk that they don’t hit some of them,” he argued. “Trichet has got to have an open mind on 50 [basis points] at the end of August or the euro is going to go down.”One thing that seems clear is that the dollar is not being supported by strong medium-term fundamentals.July’s BNP Paribas/IP&E Investment Managers’ Expectations Indicator, found that dollar/yen sentiment had hit record bearish levels, with the number of fund managers anticipating a fall in the dollar against the yen at an all-time high.Elsewhere Asian currencies briefly wobbled on news that North Korea had test-fired seven missiles into the Sea of Japan.However the South Korean won fell just 0.4 per cent to Won946.4 to the dollar and the yen drifted just 0.2 per cent to Y147.15 to the euro, admittedly hitting another all-time low of Y147.31 in the process.Mr Woolfolk said the resilience of emerging market currencies in the face of the missile tests suggested that risk tolerance was rising again and that this represented a bottom for higher risk assets such as emerging markets and commodities.Hans Redeker, head of currency strategy at BNP Paribas, also remained sanguine. “We stick to our guns, expecting Asian currencies to rally,” he said. “North Korea launching missiles will have no lasting impact on financial markets. Note that the Swiss franc, the market’s risk barometer of choice, did not react.”Indeed, by mid-session New York trade the Swiss franc was 0.7 per cent weaker at SFr1.2331 to the dollar and 0.2 per cent lighter at SFr1.5691 to the euro, a two-month low.
142;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2006-07-05T16:40:26Z;Market Overview: Geopolitical tensions and growth worries weigh;;Geopolitical tensions hit world equity markets and pushed crude oil to a record high above $75 a barrel on Wednesday.North Korea’s missile tests were followed by the postponement of negotiations between the European Union and Iran over the latter’s nuclear programme.Stronger than expected economic data in the eurozone and in the US also reignited investor fears about how far central banks on both sides of the Atlantic would raise interest rates.US bond markets were particularly hit hard, with yields on 10-year Treasuries jumping 6.7 basis points to 5.222 per cent.Andrew Milligan, head of strategy at Standard Life Investments, said the rate concerns and North Korean tensions had “taken the edge off” a recovery in risk appetite in recent days.“Investors had been starting to piece together a more optimistic view of the outlook,” he said. “This highlights the current fickleness and uncertainty in investor sentiment.”Some analysts said the market reaction to the North Korea tests had simply been a knee-jerk response, while others said they had provided a catalyst for profit-taking, particularly in Asia, where stocks had risen in the previous four sessions.In Seoul, the Kospi index finished off its intra-day lows but still 0.5 per cent weaker at 1,279.85. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average fell 0.73 per cent to 15,523.94.The yen also fell to a fresh record low against the euro on news of the tests.The interest rate worries in the US were sparked by a survey by ADP, a payroll services company, showing that US private sector employers created an estimated 368,000 jobs in June, compared with 122,000 jobs the previous month.This stirred fears that Friday’s monthly payrolls data, a widely tracked benchmark for assessing the strength of the economy, would be more robust than expected.The June non-farm payrolls data report had been expected to show job growth of about 155,000 following a 75,000 increase in May, according to consensus forecasts. After the ADP data, economists were revising these forecasts, some now predicting a number as high as 250,000. That would put additional pressure on the US Federal Reserve to continue to raise rates, slowing the economy to quell inflationary pressures.Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said the June ADP survey showed the biggest increase since the company first began using its own data to mimic the official payrolls numbers in 2001.He said the ADP numbers were not particularly accurate as an indicator. “Even allowing for this . . . we are moving up our number for the headline to about 200,000,” he said.There were further signs of economic strength yesterday with a larger than expected 0.7 per cent rise in US factory orders in May.The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.7 per cent lower, as did the S&P 500 index. The Nasdaq Composite lost 1.7 per cent.European shares and bonds were hit by interest rate concerns as a survey showed growth in the eurozone services economy hit a six-year high in June. This intensified speculation that Jean-Claude Trichet, pres­ident of the European Central Bank, could signal future interest rate rises after a monetary policy meeting today.Yields on 10-year bunds rose 6.2 basis points to 4.13 per cent while. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index dropped 1.19 per cent to 1,305.69.
143;ADP;Automatic Data Procs;2006-05-31T18:33:01Z;Lex: Aéroports de Paris;;"There are good reasons to be wary of Aéroports de Paris’s proposed initial public offering. The French government, which owns Europe’s second largest airport operator, will reduce its stake from 100 to 70 per cent, and will retain control. The likelihood of it selling more in the future creates a potential overhang, which could weigh on the share price.Strong state interest, though, has an upside as well. The regulator recently allowed ADP to increase airport charges by 3.25 per cent a year, in real terms, from 2006 to 2010. Although this is being challenged in court by the International Air Transport Association, which accuses the French government of fattening up ADP for privatisation, it provides clarity on future revenues. Contrast this with the regulatory uncertainty surrounding BAA, the UK airports operator.There is less clarity, though, over ADP’s fair value. Its regulated asset base (RAB), which is not published, is estimated at €4.5bn, and is projected to grow to €5.5bn by 2010, as it undertakes much-needed investment in Charles de Gaulle airport and elsewhere. The regulator does not disclose the return on capital allowed, nor the cost of capital. Assuming both are 6.25 per cent and that there is no real growth in RAB beyond 2010 implies a value of 1.2 times RAB, or €5.4bn. Including non-regulated property and other assets worth an estimated €1.5bn gives a target enterprise value of €6.9bn.Using the mid-point of the government’s range of €41-€47.50 a share, ADP’s enterprise value will be €6.6bn. The IPO does not look massively overpriced using comparative valuation approaches either. Throw into the mix demand from French retail investors, who are expected to take up a large proportion of the offer with enthusiasm, and this one could well fly.- Click here to add your comments
