0;PBCT;People's United Finl;2011-09-15T21:36:13Z;S&P 500 tops 1,200;;The S&P 500 closed above 1,200 for the first time since September 1 as the rally stretched to four days.The benchmark closed up 1.7 per cent at 1,209.11, though bearish investors warned that it was unlikely to top 1,250 with fears about Eurozone debt still elevated.“There’s a limit to how far any rally can go without a resolution to the crisis in Europe,” said Channing Smith of Tulsa-based Capital Advisors.Financials rose 2.6 per cent, with big bank stocks to the fore.Morgan Stanley was up 7.2 per cent to $16.59 after the company paid a regular dividend on news that Wall Street veteran John Mack will step down as Chairman. The bank also paid a regular dividend on its preferred stock.Goldman Sachs also rose 3.7 per cent to $107.97.Earlier, European banks stocks had soared after central banks committed to action to provide dollar liquidity.But Capital One Financial was down 0.2 per cent at $43.46 on fears that weak macroeconomic data had not filtered through to a reduction in spending by its credit card holders.New England bank People’s United Financial was flat at $12.43 as Goldman initiated coverage of north-eastern banks with a “sell” rating on the stock.Goldman said north-eastern banks were “as good as it gets” in the financial sector, given the low mortgage and default rate in the prosperous region, but worried that People’s United’s stock price implied optimistic capital deployment and value creation.Netflix fell 15.6 per cent to $176.20 after the online group cut its forecast for physical DVD subscribers, as a change in pricing structure took effect.The group projected that DVD-only subscribers would reach just 2.2m by the end of September, 25 per cent fewer than the forecast it made in July. It also lowered its forecast for streaming-only subscribers from 10m to 9.8m.The fall in projected customer growth pushed the stock beneath $200 for the first time since March.“Management have clearly underestimated the impact of the price hike for the combined service,” said James Cordwell at Atlantic Equities. But he said the stock price fall might be an overreaction, as “the vast majority of Netflix growth came from its streaming-only package”.Aircraft manufacturer Textron rose 4.1 per cent to $17.44 as investors continued to be impressed by the potential for earnings-per-share growth from a debt-juggling operation announced on Wednesday.Textron will issue debt to buy back outstanding convertible bonds. Credit Suisse calculations suggest the diluted share count will fall 12 per cent if Textron is able to retire all of the outstanding convertible bonds.That would raise earnings per share at the cost of a hit to earnings per share this year from higher interest payments on the newly issued debt.But Credit Suisse analyst Julian Mitchell said the group, which relies heavily on defence spending, was unlikely to deliver sales growth. “Our scenario work indicates that Textron has less than average upside in a low growth scenario, which investors seem to believe is the most probable, and higher than average downside in a bear scenario,” he told clients.The strong run in semiconductor shares, which has seen stocks such as Micron up as much as 15 per cent this week, ran out of pace just as JPMorgan urged investors to buy into the momentum.“Semis starting to – finally – break out. Time to gas up the minivan and climb on board,” JPMorgan analyst Christopher Danely wrote to clients, but the Philadelphia semiconductor index underperformed the S&P 500 on Thursday, and Micron dropped 2.2 per cent to $7.04.Life insurer Lincoln National Corporation, up 8.2 per cent at $19.78, rose more than any other stock in the S&P 500. But the stock is still underperforming peers, down 31 per cent in the quarter to date, compared with 23 per cent for the group, as its portfolio makes it sensitive to equity markets and low interest rates, according to Andrew Kligerman at UBS.Tenet Healthcare bounced 6.2 per cent to $4.77 but remains in the red for the week, after poor earnings results.Higher than expected inflation figures for August led to concerns the Fed might delay further easing. There were also signs weak macro data were working their way through to earnings expectations.
1;PBCT;People's United Finl;2009-11-23T21:36:21Z;Wall Street rallies on housing data;;US stocks bounced back from last week’s lows after dollar weakness boosted energy companies and encouraging housing data reassured investors about the pace of economic recovery.Housebuilders’ shares edged up after data showed that sales of previously owned homes in the country had risen 10.1 per cent in October.The S&P 500 homebuilding index, which has plunged 25 per cent since the middle of September, was up 1.1 per cent.DR Horton, the sector’s second-biggest operator, also benefited from an upgrade by Citigroup, which raised the stock from “sell” to “hold”.On Friday, the stock lost more than 15 per cent of its value after the company reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss. The shares were up 2.8 per cent to $10.66 on Monday.Renewed deal activity in the consumer sector also boosted sentiment on Wall Street. The bidding war for Cadbury intensified over the weekend as expectations grew that the chocolate maker, which is the subject of a hostile bid from Kraft Foods, would receive a counterbid from Hershey.Nestlé was also reported to be weighing up its options for the British company. While Cadbury shares gained in London, Hershey dropped 1.3 per cent to $36.39 and Kraft was up 0.6 per cent to $27.34.Shares in Diedrich Coffee jumped 29.5 per cent to $33.65 after Peetâ€™s Coffee & Tea, the gourmet coffee chain, raised its offer for the company to $32 per share.Green Mountain Coffee also confirmed its $30 a share offer for the company.Peet’s Coffee was down 13 per cent to $33.06 while Green’s shares were up 0.6 per cent to $65.44.The S&P 500 closed 1.4 per cent higher at 1,106.24 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.4 per cent to 2,176.01. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit its highest level since October last year, rising 1.3 per cent to 10,450.95.Stocks fell last week after a rush of disappointing economic data left investors nervous about the pace of the economic recovery.Renewed dollar strength had also hit commodity stocks. However, the rising oil price on Monday helped to lift the S&P energy sector 1.6 per cent.Richard Sparks, senior equity analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research, said: “The week after options expiration, which is the week that we’re now in, is traditionally weak but the selling that we experienced last week has created an environment where people don’t want to miss the next move up.”He also said the low volumes that have characterised the rally over the past two weeks could be setting stocks up for further gains.“It gives the potential for the rally to continue because most of the time the market doesn’t top out on slow, measured buying. It is the high-volume euphoria that creates market tops.”Elsewhere in the consumer sector, Tyson Foods, the world’s largest meat processor, posted better than expected quarterly results but its shares were down 1.5 per cent to $12.88.A writedown on its beef business meant that the group swung to a net loss but total revenues grew due to strong demand for pork, beef and chicken.Campbell Soup’s quarterly profit also beat analysts’ estimates after the company benefited from the lower cost of tomatoes, grain and tin.Campbell has experienced high demand for its soups and pasta sauces over the past year as more shoppers cook at home to save money. Its shares were 1.4 per cent higher at $34.60.In other deal news, Odyssey Marine Exploration, which specialises in recovering goods from shipwrecks, announced that it had bought a minority stake in SMM Project.SMM owns the mineral rights to 60,000 sq m of the South Pacific ocean floor and Odyssey’s acquisition will allow it to branch out into the exploration of gold and copper. Odyssey shares rose 3.9 per cent to $1.59.People’s United Financial, the holding group for People’s United Bank, said it would buy Financial Federalfor about $738m in an effort to boost its equipment financing businesses. Financial Federal soared 29.5 per cent to $26.61 while People’s was down 2.7 per cent to $16.03.
2;PBCT;People's United Finl;2007-06-29T20:36:21Z;US stocks fall leaving June in red;;US equity benchmarks fell on Friday and while they posted a modest rise this week, June was their worst monthly performance since February.This month was tough going for stocks outside of the energy and technology sectors.The financial sector extended its loss for the month to 4.3 per cent on Friday. Concerns over the sector’s exposure to subprime mortgage troubles and a potential credit crunch sparked renewed selling. That sank an early rally in the broad market on news that core inflation for May was benign.The S&P 500 index fell 0.2 per cent to close at 1,53.35, for a gain of 0.1 per cent this week. That left the S&P lower by 1.8 per cent in June, its second monthly decline this year after a loss of 2.2 per cent in February.The Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent lower at 2,603.23, a return of 0.6 per cent this week. For June, the Nasdaq fell 0.05 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1 per cent to 13,408.62, for a rise of 0.4 per cent since Monday. For the month, bluechips fell 1.6 per cent, less than its 2.8 per cent fall in February.Returns for the leading benchmarks during the second quarter were led by the Dow’s rise of 8.5 per cent. The Nasdaq gained 7.5 per cent and the S&P rose 5.8 per cent in the last three months.However, since the Dow and the S&P both set record closes of 13,676.32 and 1,539.18 in early June, sentiment has been hurt by a number of factors.“Through June equity investor worries have ranged from inflation angst to an unwinding of expectations that the Fed will ease in 2007 to outright fear that the leveraged buy-out spigot will dry up, among many others,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup.A look at the ten major S&P sectors reveals that utilities, which are sensitive to interest rates, fell 5.3 per cent this month. It was also the only leading group to record a negative return, down 1.1 per cent, for the second quarter.June was a tough month for financials, and it is the only leading sector that is currently negative for the year, down 2 per cent. Bear Stearns fell 2.8 per cent to $140 on Friday. Home builders and real estate stocks also performed weakly this month as housing woes increased.Blackstone slid 16.5 per cent to $29.27, this week, extending losses below its recent $31 listing price.In contrast, energy and information technology sectors led gains this month – up 1.7 per cent and 0.6 per cent – and during the second quarter, up 14.3 per cent and 10.2 per cent respectively.A big gainer among technology stocks this week, was Research in Motion. Its fiscal first quarter earnings rose 73 per cent amid strong sales of its BlackBerry wireless e-mail devices and the company also announced a three-for-one stock split. RIM also issued upside second quarter profit guidance and shares rose 20.8 per cent to $199.99 on FridayIn earnings news this week, Palm reported a 44 per cent slide in fiscal fourth-quarter profit in spite of record sales of its Treo smartphones. Higher costs and increased competition hurt the bottom line. The stock fell 3.3 per cent to $16.02 on Friday.Apple, ahead of its iPhone going on sale in the US later on Friday, rose 1.2 per cent to $122.04.Citigroup views the stock as a hold and said: “While we remain very fond of Apple’s long-term story and outlook, we expect a better near-term “sell on the news” entry opportunity to appear once the pre-launch hype tapers off.”Cisco, gained 3.5 per cent to $27.85 this week. A brokerage upgrade for the tech bellwether boosted tech stocks in general.Among blue chips,General Motors rose 6.6 per cent to $37.80 this week and reached its highest price since January 2005, at $38.66, on Friday. The carmaker was the best performing Dow and S&P stock in June, up 26 per cent. This week GM sold its Allison Transmission commercial and military business for about $5.6bn to two private equity firms.Goldman Sachs said the shares could rise more should GM’s talks with labour unions end on a positive note for carmakers seeking to control legacy medical and retirement costs. Buy-out announcements continued to arrive in the past week in spite of credit worries.In deal news on Friday, Komag jumped 7.8 per cent to $31.89, up 21.9 per cent this week, on news it will be bought for $1bn, or $32.25 a share, by Western Digital, a hard disk drive maker. Western fell 0.9 per cent to $19.35.Earlier this week, Guitar Center accepted a $1.9bn cash buy-out offer from a private equity firm and its shares soared 16.7 per cent to $59.81. People’s United Financial bought Chittenden Corporation for $1.9 bn in cash and stock. Chittenden shares rose 25 per cent to $34.95, while People’s fell 6.7 per cent to $17.73.European suitors also sought US companies this week. Basell, the Dutch chemical company, agreed to buy Huntsman, the US chemical concern, for $6bn. Huntsman rose 26.9 per cent to $24.31.Roche, the Swiss drug maker, launched a hostile bid for Ventana Medical Systems, a tissue-based diagnostics specialist. Ventana surged 48.7 per cent to $77.27 this week.
3;PBCT;People's United Finl;2007-06-27T21:22:11Z;Wall St rebounds sharply as volatility slumps;;US equity benchmarks rebounded sharply on Wednesday, with strength in technology and energy stocks a boost for sentiment as the Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting on interest rates got underway.Stocks shrugged aside a drop in May durable goods orders and worries over the subprime mortgage market that was accompanied by a surge in volatility during early trade.The S&P 500 index rose 0.9 per cent to close at 1,506.35, and reversed after touching a low of 1,484.18. Leading sectors included, energy stocks, boosted by a renewed rise in oil prices, technology and utilities.Financials reversed early losses and shares in Bear Stearns rose 2.8 per cent to $143.31. The bank has been the focus of worries that troubles in the subprime mortgage market could hurt Wall Street.Late on Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission said it had initiated a broad-based investigation into the troubled subprime mortgage market.“We have seen a lot of volatility in the market, exacerbated by the subprime fallout,” said Richard Sparks, senior equity options trader at Schaeffer’s Investment Research. “The market seems to believe it is contained and not a major problem.”Equity volatility as measured by the Chicago Board Options Exchange’s Vix index experienced a wild ride. After a rise towards 19 early in the day, a level not seen since the start of March, Vix subsequently tumbled 17.9 per cent to 15.51 late on Wednesday.As stocks recovered ground during the day, home builders and real estate stocks also rallied after experiencing compelling weakness in recent days.Technology stocks led broad market gains and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.2 per cent to 2,605.35, boosted in part by Oracle’s better than expected fiscal fourth-quarter results. Semiconductor stocks rallied 2.2 per cent.Blue chips, lagged overall gains, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.7 per cent at 13,427.73.Downbeat economic news was a source of worry for stock investors early on Wednesday. Durable goods orders fell 2.8 per cent in May, greater than the expected 0.8 per cent decline and non-defence capital goods also slid sharply.Meanwhile orders for non-defence capital goods excluding aircraft, fell 3.0 per cent, reversing the 2.3 per cent rise in April. Year-on-year, orders for what is a barometer of business spending were lower by 1.4 per cent.The data pulled bond yields lower, and boosted the expectation of rate cuts later this year and for 2008. Worries still prevail that the weak housing market will hurt the overall economy.“Housing is a long, slow sore that will not heal anytime soon,” said William Strazzullo, chief market strategist at BellCurve Trading. “The issue is what will be the spillover effects for consumption and it’s too early to say at this point.” For now, stocks are stuck in a range, said Mr Strazzullo.Anxiety among investors was also heightened after US Foodservice said it would postpone the financing of its $7.1bn buy-out by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice and Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts due to weak market conditions.Underwriters pulled a $1.5bn bond offering that was to be used to finance the purchase of the company from Royal Ahold by the two private equity firms – suggesting that ongoing trouble in the debt markets could damp the recent rush of buy-out deals.In spite of that concern two deals were announced on Wednesday.Guitar Center said its board accepted a $1.9bn cash buy-out offer from a private equity firm. Shares in the music retailer soared 19.8 per cent to $59.98.Meanwhile, People’s United Financial, the banking firm, agreed to buy the New England-based Chittenden Corporation for $1.9 bn in cash and stock. Chittenden shares rose 24.5 per cent to $35.15, while People’s United Financial fell 2.9 per cent to $18.17.Among stocks in the news on Wednesday, ConAgra Foods rose 4.5 per cent to $26.70 after a surge in its fiscal fourth quarter profit.Nike jumped 8.3 per cent to $58.29, after its said growth in the US and abroad had pushed profits up 32 cent in the fourth quarter compared with the year-ago period.Oracle reported a jump in quarterly profit late on Tuesday. The results beat the consensus forecast of analysts, and the company also issued a bullish outlook for the current quarter. Oracle shares rose 2.8 per cent to $19.69.Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp said that he expects his group’s acquisition of Dow Jones, whose shares fell 0.4 per cent at $58.56, will take place within the next two to three weeks or not at all. Mr Murdoch also said he did not intend to increase his bid of $5bn.Shares in Blackstone continued to slide, after the private equity firm listed at $31 a-share last Friday. The stock fell 2.7 per cent to $29.92, and is down 14.7 per cent so far this week.
4;PBCT;People's United Finl;2020-04-16T04:01:47Z;Brokers must prepare for unparalleled conditions;Top advisers face grim task of navigating crisis for clients;"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a human tragedy whose scale is yet to be fully comprehended.The resulting economic shock of recent weeks has also created unprecedented disruptions which have left many people confronted with pressing questions about job security, threats to household income, tax liabilities, and the survival of their businesses. Financial advisers now face the task of dealing with many clients who, beyond all this, will probably have suffered sharp falls in the value of their assets.Louise Gunderson, an FT 400 adviser with UBS Financial Services in New York, has vivid memories of the last financial crisis. When the US stock market began dropping in February, the first thing she did was check that her clients had enough cash. “After 2008, I make sure people have at least a year of cash flow available,” Ms Gunderson says.Like many other advisers, Ms Gunderson and her team of seven have spent most of their time in recent weeks reassuring investors about their long-term plans and talking through clients’ personal worries.Against the distressing backdrop of crisis, the eighth annual edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisers provides a snapshot of the best professionals at traditional US broker-dealers.The scale of assets under management is important in selecting the FT 400, as is a positive record in growing this figure, which is a measure of client retention and investment performance. But the list also recognises that advisers’ jobs extend to acting as consultants, life coaches and even amateur psychologists.More advisers have advanced industry designations such as those for financial planners, retirement specialists or financial analysts. Some 72 per cent of the FT 400 advisers have at least one such credential, up from 69 per cent last year.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever this year, in the wake of a crisis many commentators say is without modern precedent. Advisers had already been emphasising services besides investing such as longer-term financial planning and tax management.In recent years, a growing number of advisers have also given up assembling their own mix of investments for clients in favour of selecting from an array of model portfolios. These are computer-aided blends of stocks, bonds and funds that are actively managed to the investor’s risk tolerance and financial goals. Some 20 per cent of advisers say they have increased their use of model portfolios over the past year, while only 10 per cent have decreased such use.Managing client relationships will be more important than ever in the wake of this crisisSelecting investments is not financial advisers’ biggest worry, according to our survey conducted in November and December of 2019. Instead, the top challenge cited by 70 per cent of FT 400 advisers is managing their day-to-day operational requirements. That is a change from the prior year when the FT 400 picked meeting client demands as their biggest burden.Operational challenges are only intensifying in response to coronavirus, as nearly all meetings with clients have shifted to phone calls or video-chat services such as Zoom and Skype. Advisers may long for an eventual return to consultations in person, but some say they might continue to use video or screen-sharing technology more often when things return to normal.Any return to normal cannot be predicted. Brokers who offer investment advice are also planning for the new Securities and Exchange Commission “Regulation Best Interest,” that could be the biggest rule change to their business in many years. The new regulation will limit brokers to recommendations that serve their clients’ best interests, and includes new standards for disclosing brokers’ potential conflicts of interest. The rule is scheduled to take effect on June 30. The SEC has indicated it intends to stick to this deadline despite the pandemic and its consequences.As usual, the larger states with higher concentrations of wealth have more FT 400 advisers. New York has the largest number of advisers on the list with 77, followed by California with 67. Florida is in third place with 21, followed by Illinois with 20.Many first-rate advisers missed the list. Competition is tight, so the gap between those who made and missed the cut can be narrow. The advisers in this year’s listing benefited from strong financial markets last year; the average adviser managed $2bn in assets as of June 30, up from the $1.8bn average in the previous year’s list. This year’s markets in June are highly unlikely to provide such a boost.How is coronavirus taking its toll on markets, business, and our everyday lives and workplaces? Stay briefed with our coronavirus newsletter.Sign up hereListed advisers come from 23 broker-dealers, and the best-represented companies are Merrill Lynch (with 18 per cent of advisers) and Morgan Stanley (16 per cent). Wall Street’s dominance is not guaranteed to last for ever, though. Such national brokerages with the broadest array of services, known as the wirehouses, have focused on retaining successful brokers over the recruitment of a high volume of additional advisers.And many successful brokers have been leaving wirehouses to run their own businesses. The four wirehouses, which also include UBS and Wells Fargo, have the smallest concentration of advisers on the list in its eight-year history: 48 per cent of the FT 400, down from 53 per cent the previous year.It is still unclear how the pandemic and its attendant disruptions will affect the long-term changes under way in the financial advice industry. Fortunately for their clients, the top advisers are used to turbulence."
