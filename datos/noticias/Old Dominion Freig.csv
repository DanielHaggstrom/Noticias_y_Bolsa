0;ODFL;Old Dominion Freig;2013-03-05T18:27:24Z;America’s truckmakers run into soft patch;;On Van Brunt Street in Brooklyn, by New York Harbour, it is easy to appreciate the role of trucks as the lifeblood of the US economy.When a ship calls at Red Hook container terminal, waiting trucks line up along the street ready to decant the contents, their radiator grilles proclaiming them “International” or “Freightliner” products. Trucks roll to and from warehouses in neighbouring streets, some belonging to YRC and Old Dominion – two of the US’s biggest truck operators.While the lifeblood continues to pump through Red Hook’s streets, the flow seems to have slowed sharply at the end of last year. John Wiehoff, chief executive of CH Robinson, a significant operator, last month told investors on its fourth-quarter conference call that December had finished “very poorly” and the beginning of January was “very weak” both in volumes and profit margins.Sandy Cutler, chief executive of Eaton Corporation, the diversified industrial group, says the trucking weakness reflects consumers’ concerns over the potential impact of fiscal cliff tax rises and spending cuts.The question for trucking companies and truckmakers is how long-lasting the downturn will be and how severe its effects.North American truck production fell 23 per cent year on year in the fourth quarter of last year, according to Eaton. Daimler Trucks North America, the North American truck arm of Germany’s Daimler, which makes Freightliner trucks, announced on January 30 it might lay off 1,300 workers because of the downturn.“Consumers are starting to really come to grips with what this tough economy and wage situation mean,” Mr Cutler says.The long-term picture remains far from clear. Martin Daum, chief executive of Daimler Trucks North America, says that in October he was confident the North American market for large trucks would grow further in 2013 after 2012’s 13.6 per cent year-on-year figure. But by late January he was sure 2013 would be 10 per cent down on 2012. The market has subsequently recovered slightly.“Ultimately, 2013 will be between minus 10 per cent and plus 10 per cent,” Mr Daum says. “I can’t even tell you which way.”Trucking groups’ year-end results all painted a similarly gloomy picture of demand in December. Mr Wiehoff told investors that many of CH Robinson’s customers appeared to have undertaken unusually long year-end shutdowns, followed by slower-than-normal production ramp-ups in January. Both YRC and Old Dominion Freight Line sounded similarly gloomy about December’s figures.“Our hope is that that was a big part of what we were seeing – just diminished year-end activity that carried over into January,” Mr Wiehoff says.Yet truckmakers mostly remain confident that demand will hold up better than in 2009, when year-on-year demand for trucks fell by 50 per cent.Paccar, maker of the Kenworth and Peterbilt brands, and North America’s second-biggest truckmaker by sales, says it expects overall heavy truck sales in the US and Canada this year to total between 210,000 and 240,000 vehicles, compared with 225,000 in 2012. Robin Easton, Paccar’s treasurer, says that is around the level required to replace trucks at the end of their life.Several manufacturers are optimistic that the record average age of the North American truck fleet – about eight years – means many customers have no choice but to replace them with ones that consume less fuel and meet new, higher environmental standards.“In this economic environment, our customers are willing and capable of replacing their fleets,” Mr Easton says. “It’s just that at this particular time there are not that many that are willing to grow their fleet.”Navistar International, maker of International brand trucks, saw its share of the US heavy truck market fall from 18 per cent in the year to the end of October from 28 per cent in the same period of 2011, partly because of its initial failure to produce an engine that met the latest US environmental requirements.Mr Daum predicts that this replacement trend will lead to a growing divide between small operators – who run many of the trucks in Red Hook – and larger, better-financed ones.Daimler’s latest trucks, Mr Daum points out, consumed 14 per cent less fuel than their equivalents as recently as 2009.Many small operators, their margins squeezed because they use older, less fuel-efficient trucks, struggle to raise the finance to buy newer vehicles.That gives large, well-financed operators like Old Dominion or YRC that run modern fleets “a huge operational cost advantage”, Mr Daum says. The advantage affects businesses’ most basic running costs.“I’m not talking [just] maintenance and reliability costs,” Mr Daum says of the advantages. “I mean hard cash fuel running through that engine.”
