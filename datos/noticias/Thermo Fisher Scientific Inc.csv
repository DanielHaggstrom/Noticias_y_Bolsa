Mark Stevenson on Thursday told the BBC’s Today programme the company had agreed with the government to supply “more than 100,000 tests per day” and would scale up its manufacturing capacity to enable the kits to be manufactured in the UK. Government ministers have come under heavy criticism for failing to roll out testing quickly enough, which they have blamed in part on lab capacity, as well as shortages of essential supplies, such as swabs and chemical reagents. Mr Stevenson’s remarks came ahead of an announcement by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, that the UK had opened the first of three “Lighthouse Labs” in Milton Keynes. Officials said each lab network, which are being set up across the country, will have the capacity to test “tens of thousands” of patient samples every day. The government last week set a target to increase the number of diagnostic PCR tests, which check if someone has been infected with the virus to 100,000 a day by the end of April, from about 15,000 at the moment.Paul Nurse, director and chief executive of London’s Francis Crick Institute, which is supporting the testing effort, on Wednesday said the goal was “a stretch”.In order to rapidly scale up the pace of testing, the government has put out a call to arms to industry to build a “British diagnostics industry at scale”.As part of this, pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline will set up a new testing lab with Cambridge university, which aims to process 30,000 samples a day by the start of May. The government has also set up a task force of more than 100 companies to help provide additional supplies of testing machinery and consumables that are in short supply globally, such as swabs.Despite concerns about shortages, Mr Stevenson told the BBC that “the challenge has really been making sure we have the lab capacity”.The government hopes the three new laboratories being set up should help meet this need.Government officials confirmed they were working with Thermo Fisher, which is manufacturing equipment and providing extensive logistical support, but added that they were also working with other companies.The Financial Times is making key coronavirus coverage free to read to help everyone stay informed. Find the latest here.They added that while the UK had a world-leading pharmaceutical industry, it did not have a big diagnostic base on which to start a mass programme of testing.Germany, by contrast, already had a “huge, existing diagnostic lab facility to start with”, said one official. “We’ve been building them for a while. Testing though can only be seen in context of whole testing regime.”Describing the opening of the new lab network as a “historic moment”, Mr Hancock said: “We have set the challenge of achieving a 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of the month. “Backed by Britain’s world-class scientists and industry partners, the opening of Milton Keynes lab today is a crucial step taken in tackling this virus.”

2;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2020-03-03T09:07:31Z;Thermo Fisher to buy diagnostics group Qiagen in $11.5bn deal;Dutch company is developing kits to test for novel coronavirus;Thermo Fisher has agreed to buy Dutch diagnostics group Qiagen in a $11.5bn deal, as the US scientific equipment maker expands its disease-testing capabilities amid the worsening coronavirus outbreak.The group, which has a market capitalisation of around $122bn and provides diagnostic tools, said buying the Dutch company would allow it to strengthen its portfolio, notably in testing for infectious diseases.Qiagen is developing kits to test for Covid-19, which has infected more than 90,000 people globally and killed more than 3,000. It previously provided testing equipment that was used during the Sars and swine flu outbreaks.Thermo Fisher had been reported to have had an interest in Qiagen before the coronavirus outbreak erupted. In November, Qiagen, whose shares are listed in Frankfurt and New York, launched a strategic review to consider bids from various suitors before later saying it planned to go it alone.Thermo Fisher will pay €39 a share for Qiagen, valuing the group at $11.5bn, including $1.4bn in debt. The offer represents a 23 per cent premium to Qiagen’s closing share price on Monday.“This acquisition provides us with the opportunity to leverage our industry-leading capabilities and R&D expertise to accelerate innovation and address emerging healthcare needs,” said Marc Casper, Thermo Fisher president and chief executive.Qiagen has been working on equipment to detect Covid-19 since the outbreak began in January. Last week it said it had sent test kits to four hospitals in China for evaluation and plans to apply for emergency authorisation to sell them in the US, Korea and China.The kits, which provide test results in about an hour, are expanded versions of the company’s “QIAstat-Dx Respiratory Panel”, which is used to test for various other respiratory syndromes.Qiagen’s shares were buffeted last year after parting ways with its long-term chief executive Peer Schatz and warning on profits in October as sales slowed in China. November’s announcement of talks exploring a potential acquisition sent them higher before being knocked again when the company terminated discussions in December.Peter Welford, an analyst at Jefferies, said “a deal is likely to be welcome” for Qiagen “given lingering uncertainties on China execution, QIAstat-Dx rollout, and midterm growth drivers.”Mr Welford said that given the back and forth over recent months over a potential deal for Qiagen, a counterbid is unlikely at this point. Antitrust considerations are unlikely to derail it, he added.Shares in Qiagen were up 19 per cent in early afternoon trading in Frankfurt trading. Thermo Fisher shares were up 3 per cent in pre-market trade on Wall Street.
3;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2017-06-12T04:00:42Z;Big US pharma dealmaking plunges to five-year low;Trump’s failure to overhaul American tax code takes toll on M&A  ;"Big dealmaking in the US pharmaceuticals sector has sunk to its lowest level in five years, as companies shy away from large takeovers following President Donald Trump’s failure to move ahead with overhauling the American tax code . At the beginning of the year drugmakers had been preparing for a deals bonanza after Mr Trump pledged to quickly pass reforms to allow large companies to repatriate billions of dollars in cash from overseas without incurring a 35 per cent tax bill. But this year there have been just two takeovers of a US target company worth more than $5bn, according to figures prepared by Dealogic for the Financial Times — Thermo Fisher’s $7.2bn deal for drug ingredients maker Patheon, and Takeda’s $5.4bn takeover of cancer specialist Ariad. At less than $13bn, the total value of large US deals announced this year is the lowest since 2012. The biggest industry acquisition in 2017 is Johnson & Johnson’s $30bn takeover of Actelion, a Swiss biotech company, a deal which allowed J&J to use its foreign cash hoard without paying US taxes. Mega deals include job losses. This is becoming a bigger consideration for US-based businesses compared to years past given the increased socio-political focus on jobsThe drop-off in dealmaking shows the extent to which the pharmaceuticals industry has been hit by the difficulties Mr Trump has faced advancing his agenda, with tax reform held up by the fight to repeal Obamacare and the allegations over his campaign’s alleged ties to Russia. Drugmakers provided investment bankers with a steady stream of work and fees in recent years as they engaged in a frenzy of dealmaking aimed at restocking drug pipelines with new medicines to offset patent expiries on older blockbuster medicines. Dealmakers also complain that Mr Trump’s pledge to crack down on high drug prices has had a chilling effect on takeover activity, because it has become much harder to work out the value of a target company without knowing how much ìt could charge for its drugs. Punit Mehta, global co-head of healthcare at Credit Suisse, said the slowdown in deal activity had been exacerbated by concerns about extracting cost synergies that may lead to job losses. “Mega deals, which often rely on cost-saving synergies, include job losses. This is becoming a bigger consideration for US-based businesses compared to years past given the increased socio-political focus on jobs,” he said. Investor appetite for large deals, a staple of the M&A frenzy of 2014 and 2015, had diminished, he added. “Some of the recent deals have been pricey and not performed as expected, leading investors and companies to be cautious.”The essential guide for decision makers in health — straight to your inbox every FridayHowever, Mr Mehta believes big-ticket deal activity will pick up because of structural reasons. “Large companies have over $500bn of firepower to deploy; they are not going to sit on it forever whether tax reform happens or not.”Thomas Sheehan, head of global healthcare at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said despite the slowdown the fundamentals for dealmaking remained unchanged and activity was bound to pick up again. “Large pharma players consistently search for innovation-driven growth and raising cash remains historically cheap, and so the overall environment remains positive for a pick-up in deal activity over the next 12 months.”David Gluckman, global co-head of healthcare at Lazard, said if one large deal was announced, it might lead to others. He said: “There could be a domino effect …it’s hard to predict exactly when this will happen, but it could play out this way.”"
4;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2017-05-17T16:21:13Z;Goldman Sachs piles into US leveraged loans market;Bank pursues business advising M&A buyers as well as sellers;Goldman Sachs has burst into the top tier of underwriters of US leveraged loans, as the bank goes all-out to position itself as an adviser to buyers of companies, as well as sellers.The Wall Street powerhouse, a clear number one in M&A advice, has traditionally been the go-to bank for companies on the receiving end of a bid. In the 1980s and 1990s, for example, Goldman was known for putting up defences against debt-fuelled raiders such as Carl Icahn and T Boone Pickens, and for forcing high prices for companies if boards wanted to sell.But in recent years, as more and more defence business has been captured by boutique advisory firms — sometimes run by former Goldman partners — the bank has tried to play both sides. To do that, it has moved into acquisition-financing activities historically dominated by the likes of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup.This year that push has been particularly evident in the market for US leveraged loans, or loans to companies already carrying lots of debt. Goldman ranks third so far this year, according to Bloomberg data, up from eighth in 2016, having arranged 172 deals worth a total of $41bn. BofA and JPMorgan occupy the two top spots, with deals worth $54bn and $58bn, respectively.“Greasing the wheels” of transactions by offering debt finance makes sense, said David Hendler, founder and principal at Viola Risk Advisors. “The house of Goldman has a lot of smart people and they want to get paid. They’ve got to be where the margins are.”Goldman’s debt-underwriting business was a bright spot in a relatively weak first quarter, in which the bank’s normally dependable bond-trading unit misfired. Revenues from debt underwriting were up 25 per cent from a year earlier during the period to $636m, more than twice what the bank earned from backing equity deals.Goldman is kind of unique among the big banks on the street, in that they have private credit funds on a massive scaleUS banks arranged about $434bn of leveraged loans in the first three months of the year, the most for a quarter in records going back to at least 1999, according to Bloomberg.The surge in activity is likely to attract close scrutiny from regulators, which have tried to discourage big banks from financing deals that involve piling more debt on already debt-laden companies.Goldman’s highlights in the non-investment grade world this year include $6.1bn of loans and bonds for Change Healthcare, a Nashville-based group, and $4.2bn of debt for BWAY, a packaging company, to buy Mauser, a rival.Jeff Nassof at Freeman & Co, a financial services consulting firm, said the bank was probably benefiting from its activity about 18 months ago, when Goldman-backed funds snapped up debt from a succession of issuers during a very rocky market. At the time, a lot of big banks were pulling in their horns, refusing to originate new loans.“Goldman is kind of unique among the big banks on the street, in that they have private credit funds on a massive scale,” said Mr Nassof.“Most of the other banks sold those off, if they had them to begin with.”

The pact includes $2bn in net debt.“Patheon’s development and manufacturing capabilities are an excellent complement to our industry-leading offering for the biopharma market,” said Marc Casper, Thermo Fisher’s chief executive.Founded in the mid-20th Century, Thermo Fisher offers diagnostic tools for the medical and scientific community. The group has been highly acquisitive in recent years, having closed a $4.2bn buyout of FEI Company last September, and a $1.3bn deal for Affymetrix last March.Thermo Fisher shares were little changed in pre-market trading on Monday, but they have risen by a fifth this year. Patheon jumped by a third in the pre-market.
6;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2014-07-22T17:15:07Z;Cheap DNA sequencing will transform medical research;A process that once cost $1bn is likely to fall to tens of dollars within a few years;"DNA sequencing has experienced a spectacular fall in its price to performance ratio, exceeding that in every other important field of technology.The cost of reading the three billion chemical “letters” in a human genome crashed from $1bn in the 1990s to $10m in 2007 and is likely to dip under $1,000 within the next two years. A small bacterial or viral genome can be decoded for tens of dollars.The consequences for medicine and the biosciences of quick and affordable DNA sequencing will be profound. In healthcare, an era of personalised medicine is dawning, in which treatments can be matched to an individual patient’s genetic make-up.In research, genomics is transforming fields from palaeontology – decoding DNA extracted from the fossils of extinct species – to agriculture, where it is giving plant breeders new insights into crop improvement.This is happening some years later than suggested by a few of the overenthusiastic predictions made as the original Human Genome Project was coming to a close 15 years ago, but that delay was not due to any failure by the technology to make the expected progress; rather, the biology turned out to be much harder to decipher than expected, with the control and functioning of genes showing levels of complexity that scientists are only just beginning to understand.But there is unevenness in how the revolutionary impact of genomics is affecting research.An analysis released last month by Marks & Clerk, the London-based intellectual property company, shows that “public research organisations are driving advances in research into genome-related technologies and their use in medicine and industry, with the private sector lagging behind”. Most of the innovation is taking place in the US, with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) particularly active.“The markedly strong performance of US public bodies reflects badly on Europe, with European universities and research bodies surprisingly under-represented among the large filers of patent applications,” says Gareth Williams, Marks & Clark partner.The biggest single source of innovation is the NIH Advanced DNA Sequencing Technology Program, which has been providing about $20m a year in grants since 2004. The last round of eight grants was announced in September 2013 – two to companies and six to universities – and the next announcement is expected this autumn.Perhaps the most eye-catching grant went to a small Californian company, Eve Biomedical, which intends to develop a system “that can sequence an entire human genome for under $100. The overall system will be based on using light to sequence DNA on a cell phone camera chip.”But the technology being promoted most actively by NIH is “nanopore” sequencing, which involves threading single DNA strands through tiny protein pores in a membrane. Individual bases, the chemical letters of DNA, are read one by one as they pass through the nanopores; each of the four bases in DNA has its own distinctive effect on an electric current passing through the pore.“Nanopore technology shows great promise but it is still a new area of science,” says Jeffrey Schloss, director of the NIH programme. “We have much to learn about how nanopores can work effectively as a DNA sequencing technology, which is why five of the programme’s eight grants are exploring this approach.”Several companies are commercialising nanopore technology. A leader in the field is UK-based Oxford Nanopore, a private company that has raised £145m from investors since its foundation in 2005. Its MinIon device, the world’s smallest DNA sequencer, is not yet on sale but is beginning to give results for academic researchers who have been given early access to the technology.In principle, nanopore technology has advantages of speed and simplicity over current sequencing methods. These require DNA to be chemically labelled and copied; it has to be broken up into short segments which are sequenced many times.Public research organisations are driving advances in research into genome-related technologiesThe world of DNA sequencing machines used to be dominated by Applied Biosystems of the US, which was acquired in 2008 by Invitrogen and subsumed into a merged company renamed Life Technologies. Last year, Life Technologies was bought by Thermo Fisher Scientific for $13.6bn.Illumina, still an independent US company after seeing off a $6.7bn bid by Roche of Switzerland, is leader of the DNA sequencing market, although Roche remains the largest player in Europe. Last month, Roche, which predicts a big role for gene sequencing in its large diagnostics business, bought Genia, a privately owned Californian sequencing company, in a deal worth up to $350m.The patent analysis by Marks & Clerk shows Illumina and Life Technologies are far ahead of the corporate pack in the number of patents filed in DNA sequencing technology over the past 10 years, with 80 and 70 respectively.The leading Asian company in the field is BGI Shenzhen (formerly Beijing Genomics Institute). “We are seeing interest from emerging markets like China, where life sciences companies have for many years lagged behind their electronic counterparts in terms of patent filings around the world,” says Mr Williams. “The importance of BGI Shenzhen’s appearance in the list of top filers should not be underestimated.”"
7;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;General Electric boosts life sciences division with $1.06bn deal;;General Electric has agreed to buy a gene modulation and magnetic bead business from Thermo Fisher Scientific in a $1.06bn deal that will boost the industrial conglomerate’s life sciences division.The new businesses will be rolled into GE Healthcare, adding to its platform of providing technologies for the research and manufacture of medicines, vaccines and diagnostics. The deal also helps GE with its stated ambition of moving into high-tech, high-profit-margin areas of the market.“Life Sciences is one of our strongest and fastest-growing business areas, driven by the world’s demand for improved diagnostics and new, safer medicines,” said John Dineen, chief executive of GE Healthcare.“Combining GE’s engineering expertise with our capabilities in life sciences is already bringing great benefits to industry, research and patients. This deal makes a good business even better and will help us realise our vision of bringing better healthcare to more people at lower cost.”In addition to the gene modulation and magnetic bead businesses, GE is acquiring Thermo Fisher’s cell culture division. The three units had combined revenue of $250m last year.The two parties expect the deal to close early this year. However, it must still gain regulatory approval. GE Healthcare was advised by Citi and Hogan Lovells. Barclays and Wilmer Hale advised Thermo Fisher.Healthcare provided one of the few bright spots in an otherwise constrained M&A market in 2013. A slew of transactions, ranging from low hundreds of millions to multibillion-dollar trades, ensured that healthcare was second only to technology, media and telecommunications in terms of deal flow.Investment bankers have forecast that the sector will again be buoyant on both sides of the Atlantic in 2014. The consolidation is being driven in part as companies try to adjust to the expected changes in the market wrought by the introduction of the Affordable Care Act – President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare reform policy.One of the largest deals in the sector was announced at the end of the year. Bristol-Myers Squibb, represented by Kirkland and Ellis and Goldman Sachs, agreed to sell its diabetes business to AstraZeneca for $4.1bn. In the summer, Amgen paid $10.4bn to buy Onyx in an all cash deal that gave it access to the lucrative cancer drug market.Shares in Thermo Fisher rose 0.6 per cent to $110.72 on Monday morning. General Electric fell 0.73 per cent to $27.28.
8;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Thermo bid wins Life Technologies auction;;Thermo Fisher Scientific beat out a private equity consortium to win the auction for Life Technologies and will pay $13.6bn for the life sciences company. The sale marks the latest megadeal of the year and is another sign that mergers and acquisitions are picking up, especially in the US.The offer of $76 per share in cash from Thermo Fisher represents a 38 per cent premium over Life Technologies’ share price the day before it announced it was exploring strategic options and had hired banks in January.The bid from Thermo Fisher was also substantially higher than the $65 a share bid from the consortium, which included Blackstone, Carlyle and KKR. Thermo Fisher will assume approximately $2.2bn in debt as part of the deal.Paulson & Co stands to benefit from the sale. As holder of 9 per cent of Life Technologies stock, the deal will mark a much-needed win for the embattled hedge fund run by John Paulson, which has lost some limited partners after a string of misses.Thermo Fisher is likely to put up $4bn of equity and has already obtained a bridge loan from JP Morgan and Barclays, according to S&P’s LCD unit.Investors cheered the deal, sending Thermo Fisher stock up close to 3 per cent in by midday in New York.Thermo Fisher was created in 2006 when Thermo Electron and Fisher Scientific International merged in a $12.8bn deal that created the biggest producer of scientific and laboratory equipment.Adding Life Technologies will give Thermo Fisher a dominant position in the life sciences business as well, giving it products in the fields of genetic testing and research. Life Technologies had 2012 revenues of $3.8bn.“The acquisition of Life Technologies enhances all three elements of our growth strategy: technological innovation, a unique customer value proposition and expansion in emerging markets,” said Marc Casper, chief executive of Thermo Fisher.The joint bid by a consortium of three rival private equity firms was unusual. So-called “club deals” have fallen out of favour with firms and their limited partners, but the prospect of acquiring a company with stable cash flows on the cheap brought the firms together once more. Having lost the auction to a strategic buyer, all three firms will be under renewed pressure to put their unused capital, or so-called “dry powder,” to work.Thermo Fisher was advised by JPMorgan and Barclays. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and WilmerHale provided legal advice. JPMorgan and Barclays are also providing Thermo Fisher with bridge financing.Deutsche Bank and Moelis advised Life Technologies, and Cravath, Swaine & Moore provided legal advice.

10;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Life Technologies / Thermo Fisher Scientific;Combination creates world’s leading scientific test equipment business;Thermo Fisher’s acquisition of Life Technologies has all the marks of a transaction struck at the peak of a merger and acquisitions cycle – a big premium, an intense auction between strategic and private equity bidders, and, of course, questionable economics for the winner. Life Technologies was sold for $76 per share in cash, a nearly 40 per cent premium to the share price before the sale process announcement. Reports last week had final bids at $65 to $70.For Thermo Fisher the strategic merit is clear. The combination with Life’s life science business creates the world’s leading scientific test equipment business, with more than $16bn in revenue. And with estimated synergies of $275m, the inexpensive cost of debt and Thermo’s effective tax rate of only 15 per cent, the accretion to earnings per share is above 15 per cent. This may be why Thermo stock traded up modestly on news of the deal.A slightly deeper analysis is more troubling, however. The capitalised value of the synergies is $3.5bn at most, while the premium approaches $4bn. Even with synergies, Thermo estimates it will be four years before the return on invested capital from Life will exceed its hurdle rate of 9 per cent. And Thermo’s base case for Life assumes only a 3 per cent organic growth rate, while it targets 4-6 per cent for its own business. Finally, Life’s key growth driver, its gene sequencing equipment, is not yet profitable.The sheer size of the deal introduces significant opportunity costs. It will push the company’s debt to more than four times combined cash flow. Notwithstanding a promised equity issuance, debt paydown will divert cash away from share repurchases and dividend growth. Thermo is an experienced and successful acquirer. To keep that winning streak going, the integration of Life will have to go close to perfectly.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
11;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2013-04-10T22:49:53Z;Trio in $11bn bid for Life Technologies;;A trio of private equity groups has made an $11bn bid for Life Technologies, providing the strongest signal so far that leveraged buyout deal fever is back.The $65 a share offer from Blackstone, Carlyle and KKR, who are working with Singapore’s Temasek, is less than a rival offer of up to $70 a share from Thermo Fisher Scientific, people familiar with the auction say,However, the private equity team believes the bid from Thermo Fisher, the scientific equipment company, will face antitrust issues, according to two people familiar with the matter.Life Technologies board could decide on the auction’s winner as early as the first half of next week.So-called club deals, where private equity groups team up together, have the capability to go after far larger targets than they can pursue individually. The offer for Thermo Fisher also comes at a time when financing markets have rarely been more attractive.There are no other private equity bids and Thermo Fisher is the only strategic buyer left in the auction, people familiar with the auction say.“When you go beyond $10bn, you become practically the only game in town,” said one banker. “And the pros in this case outweigh the cons.”The flood of money into the high yield market resulting from the frantic search for yield means it is possible to finance a $15bn deal.The debt to pay for any acquisition of Life Technologies is likely to be cheap and have few conditions attached to it.In recent months, the amount of leverage available for transactions has crept up to as much as seven times, an amount that Life Technologies could support thanks to its solid cash flows.In the past, investors have not liked club deals because they can involve too much exposure to a single investment.Private equity groups are also reluctant to share control of portfolio companies.However, with so few companies willing to put themselves on the auction block, the ability of private equity groups to deploy large amounts of capital has trumped other considerations, according to bankers.In January, Life Technologies said it had hired Deutsche Bank and Moelis & Co to review strategic options.Blackstone, which has been far more conservative than rivals such as Carlyle in both investing in new deals and selling companies in its portfolio, has been under particular pressure from its investors to put money to work.It is also in the midst of preparing a bid for Dell, with its due diligence paid for by the company.Goldman Sachs is advising the private equity group.
12;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2013-04-10T21:06:38Z;US stocks hit new record high;;US stock markets rallied, reaching record highs in spite of signs from the Federal Reserve that it might be ready to slow asset purchases in coming months.The benchmark S&P 500 index rose 1.2 per cent to 1,587.73, surpassing both its previous closing and intraday high, reached in October 2007.Investment banking stocks led the rally, with Morgan Stanley shares up 2.2 per cent to $22.22 and Citigroup adding 2.7 per cent to $45.06, while Goldman Sachs rose 2 per cent to $149.46.The S&P 500 financials index, which has gained more than 23 per cent in the past 12 months, was up 1.1 per cent on Wednesday.The latest record came shortly after the Fed released the minutes from its most recent policy meeting several hours early following an accidental leak. The minutes showed several Fed members were ready to slow the rate of asset purchases due to signs of improvement in the labour market.However, the weakness of employment growth in March, if it proves to be the start of a weaker trend rather than a blip, would disrupt that timetable, according to Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics.“Markets are extended at this point, but the rally has been led by defensive stocks, and any bad news, such as last Friday’s jobs data, will give investors incentives to take profits,” said Gary Thayer, chief macro strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors.“We believe overall fundamentals are good and that the Fed will not slow the quantitative easing programme prematurely. Once the economy is truly improving and the stimulus is gradually withdrawn, markets will still be supported by positive growth,” he added.Broad-based gains were led by financial, technology and healthcare stocks. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.8 per cent to 3,297.25, led by sharp gains in its biggest component, Apple.Shares in Apple rose 2 per cent to $435.69, but shares are still 18 per cent lower than they were at the start of the year. Microsoft shares added to their sharp gains from the previous session and were up 2.3 per cent to $30.28.Google and Yahoo also attracted buyers, rising 1.6 per cent to $790.18 and 1.5 per cent to $24.20, respectively.The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 blue-chip companies and is a price-weighted index, was 0.9 per cent higher at 14,802.24.Shares in Yum Brands, owner of the KFC and Pizza Hut fast-food restaurant chains, sold off in after-hours trading, falling 3 per cent to $64.74. The company revealed in a SEC filing that March same-store sales in China declined by an estimated 13 per cent due to avian flu scare.Juniper Networks shares rose 4.7 per cent to $18.84 after Belgacom, Belgium’s largest telecoms operator, selected the company’s T series core routers to increase its bandwidth capabilities, which will help cope with the explosion in online video traffic and the use of mobile devices to access the internet.Thermo Fisher Scientific rose 3.8 per cent to $81.34 after it made a binding offer of more than $65 a share for genetic testing equipment maker Life Technologies ahead of a deadline on Tuesday.Shares in Life Technologies closed 0.6 per cent higher at $66.60.Bucking the trend in healthcare stocks, Tenet Healthcare dropped 5.5 per cent to $41.14 after analysts at Deutsche Bank cut its rating to “hold”.Shares in First Solar gave up some of the dramatic gains from the previous session, when the stock rose 46 per cent after the largest thin-film solar-panel maker issued full-year guidance, forecasting $3.8bn to $4bn in revenues. The stock decreased 7.7 per cent to $36.32.Taylor Morrison climbed 4.7 per cent to $23.04 on its debut. The company priced its stock at the top end of the range at $22 and increased its offering by 20 per cent due to high demand.The company raised $628m, making it the largest IPO by a US homebuilder in two decades.
13;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2013-04-10T19:26:57Z;Life Technologies: bids under microscope;Highest offer for science test equipment maker comes with risks;"Should the highest price always win? If so, the board of Life Technologies will have little trouble picking a winner in the auction for the $11bn science test equipment maker. The remaining bidders are, reportedly, a consortium of private equity firms and Thermo Fisher Scientific, the $30bn scientific equipment company. The leveraged buyout group is said to have bid $65 per share; Thermo, as much as $70. As it operates in the same industry, Thermo can hope to earn attractive returns while still paying more than a private equity buyer by harvesting cost synergies.Thermo, from an earnings perspective, would prefer to pay in cash. Its price to earnings ratio is 15 times; a bid at $70 implies a ratio of 16 times for Life. An all-share deal would thus be dilutive to earnings per share. With debt prices at record lows, on the other hand, accretion would be all but certain in an all-cash transaction. With an all-cash bid, however, Thermo would be left with debt of more than five times cash flow, untenable for a public company. If the deal was done half in shares, that ratio would fall below four. That would still threaten Thermo’s investment-grade rating but borrowings could be paid down quickly as synergies were realised.This would leave the Life board deciding if an offer about 8 per cent higher is worth the risk of being paid in shares that could sink in value before or immediately after the deal is closed. Naturally, there is upside potential too. Since Thermo’s $11bn merger with Fisher Scientific in 2006, its stock is up 70 per cent, well ahead of the S&P 500.Of course, Life could be using Thermo as a “stalking horse”. That is, using its interest to pump up the all-cash bid from private equity. Private equity could still come in slightly short of the final Thermo bid – but better than if Thermo had never been at the table.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com"
14;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Cinven and Goldman to sell Ahlsell stakes;;Cinven and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, the private equity arm of Goldman Sachs, are set to sell their stakes in Ahlsell, the Swedish tool distributor, to European buy-out group CVC, in a deal that would value the business at €1.8bn, including debt.A deal could be announced as early as Tuesday and would represent a return of twice the investment by the funds, people familiar with the situation said.The sale process started last year and followed approaches by several rival private equity groups to buy the company in the past 12 months.The two shareholders each own 48 per cent stakes, with the balance owned by management.Ahlsell is one of several exits planned by Cinven of portfolio companies acquired before the financial crisis, as it plans to raise its fifth buy-out fund. The fund has a target size of €5bn, which would be lower than the €6.5bn predecessor that was raised during the 2006 buy-out bonanza.Last year it sold Phadia, an in-vitro allergy diagnostics company based in Sweden, to US-listed Thermo Fisher Scientific for an enterprise value of €2.47bn. That sale generated a 3.4 times return for Cinven.The European-focused buy-out group, run by Hugh Langmuir after a management shake-up two years ago, is also planning to list Ziggo, the Dutch cable operator it jointly owns with Warburg Pincus, the US private equity investor.Ahlsell reported revenues in 2010 of about €2.5bn and employs 5,300 people. The company’s sale from Nordic Capital to Cinven and GSCP for about €1.2bn in January 2006 was one of the largest private equity deals in Sweden at the time.Cinven reaped half of its investment shortly after acquiring the company, as it increased Ahlsell’s debt in 2006 to pay out a dividend.
15;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2011-08-09T17:21:54Z;High-grade debt rides the storm;;The resilience of highly rated corporate debt during the recent turmoil spurred a US company on Tuesday to sell new bonds in the dollar market, even as new equity issuance appeared to be on hold and junk bond deals are scarce.Thermo Fisher Scientific sold $2.1bn of debt to fund part of its $3.5bn acquisition of Phadia, a Swedish diagnostics maker. The deal had already been planned and the company decided to push ahead despite a slight increase in spreads because yields on investment-grade debt remain at historical lows.The deal is being sold via Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays Capital and JP Morgan Chase.The eurozone’s sovereign debt crisis, the US credit rating downgrade and heightened concerns over global growth have shaken many financial markets. About $7,800bn of global stock market capitalisation has been wiped out since July 26, according to Bloomberg.However, many bonds have performed relatively well. The market value of Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Global Broad Market index, which contains more than 19,000 bonds issued by governments, banks and large companies, has increased by $132.4bn since the end of July to $42,100bn.Investment-grade company debt has proven particularly robust, according to bankers.“High-grade corporates are in a sweet spot,” said Frazer Ross, managing director of corporate syndicate at Deutsche Bank. “Earnings have generally been good, and companies have deleveraged a lot over the past three years, and are now very lean and mean.”Markit’s iTraxx Europe index, which comprises credit default swaps on 125 high-grade European companies, has risen from around 100 basis points at the start of June to 143 basis points, the highest since October 2008.But bankers say the underlying bonds have done far better than suggested by the index, according to Mr Ross. “There has been some selling, but none of the panic we have seen in some other markets.”In comparison, the iTraxx Crossover index of high-yield European corporate debt has soared to about 600 basis points, up from a low of around 350 basis points in early May.The turmoil has caused investment-grade issuance to shrink to $14.4bn so far in August, compared to July’s $136.5bn total, and last August’s $60.3bn, according to Thomson Reuters.Yet the recent plunge in new supply of investment-grade corporate debt – despite investor demand for such deals as high-quality corporate debt funds have continued to see inflows of fresh funds – has resulted in pent-up demand for non-financial corporate debt.“A lot of investors still like investment-grade debt, particularly what would be perceived as good sectors or countries,” said Jean-Marc Mercier, global head of debt syndicate at HSBC.Investment-grade credit would also continue to benefit from rock-bottom interest rates in the developed world, according to Andrew Sutherland, head of credit at Standard Life Investments. “When confidence returns to markets, we expect spreads to move down sharply.”
16;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2011-05-24T21:35:50Z;Buy-out groups hit record in sales spree;;Private equity groups have cashed in a record amount of money by selling companies in the past two months as they aim to hand cash back to investors to attract them into their next funds.The value of companies sold by buy-out groups worldwide reached a high of $85bn in April and May, data by Preqin, which collects industry data, shows.This exceeds the record deal volume of the last quarter of 2010, when private equity groups sold out of 325 companies worth a total of $81.3bn.The bustling activity has been driven by European deals and by a re-emergence of strategic buyers, which bought most of the bigger assets that were up for sale.These include the $13.7bn deal by Takeda Pharmaceutical of Japan to buy Nycomed from private equity owners led by Nordic Capital, as well as Microsoft’s $8.5bn takeover of Skype Technologies, the online telephone service sold by investors including Silver Lake, the US private equity group.Sector executives said a combination of factors including greater availability of debt financing and cash-rich strategic buyers was prompting financial investors to sell.“There are more banks that are lending to the private equity community again and you also have a very buoyant high-yield debt market,” said Tim Syder, deputy managing partner of Electra Partners, a listed UK buy-out firm.“And there are a lot of companies that have brought their balance sheets into a good position and that are willing to spend cash.”With many of the large private equity groups gearing up to raise their next pools of money, they are eager to dispose of the best companies in their old funds to return cash to investors and show they can make good returns.Cinven, the UK buy-out group, for example, sold Phadia, the allergy diagnosis company, to Thermo Fisher, the US medical equipment maker, last week in a €2.47bn ($3.48bn) deal that is set to support its current €5bn fundraising.Manuel Carvalho, manager at Preqin, said the higher sales activity would ease fundraising conditions. “Capital is being increasingly returned to investors, and this will be committed to new funds,” he said.But sector managers have said investors are far more cautious about writing big cheques than they have been a few years ago.“Before the credit bubble burst, I felt like a bouncer at a nightclub. Now it feels more like being a Greek restaurant owner,” said one fund manager.
17;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2011-05-19T21:58:38Z;Thermo Fisher to pay €2.47bn for Phadia;;Thermo Fisher, the US medical equipment company, has agreed to buy Phadia, an allergy diagnosis company, from private equity group Cinven for €2.47bn ($3.54bn), including debt.The cash deal caps an acquisitive period for Thermo, which this year completed the purchase of Dionex, another laboratory equipment maker, and has looked at a variety of other assets in the sector.The purchase of Phadia, which specialises in in-vitro allergy testing, is the group’s largest deal since the 2006 merger between Thermo Electron and Fisher Scientific.Marc Casper, chief executive of Thermo Fisher, said Phadia would add to the company’s speciality diagnostics offering.“From a market perspective, Phadia has significant growth opportunities in the large, under-penetrated US market and can leverage our strong presence in emerging geographies to further accelerate growth,” he said.The company last year lost out to Germany’s Merck in the $7.2bn sale of Millipore and this year was linked to the auction of Beckman Coulter, eventually sold to Danaher for $5.8bn.Thermo Fisher shares rose 3.76 per cent to $65.10 in morning trade on Thursday. The company said it expected the deal to be accretive immediately.Analysts at Deutsche Bank said the acquisition could boost Thermo’s long-term growth rate. The deal will also bring Thermo $15m in cost savings and about $20m of additional revenue by 2014.Barclays Capital advised Thermo Fisher, while Goldman Sachs advised Phadia.Cinven bought Phadia in 2007 for €1.29bn, including debt. Under Cinven’s stewardship, the Swedish company has lifted its research and development spending and strongly expanded its market share in the US, China and India. Last year, the company generated ebitda of €149m.Stuart McAlpine, partner at Cinven, told the Financial Times that the group had more than tripled its €300m-plus equity investment in the company.The price achieved for Phadia reflected an earnings multiple of 15 times forecast 2011 operating profit, he added, compared with the 13 times that Cinven initially paid.The sale of Phadia highlights attempts by Europe’s largest private equity groups to shed chunks of existing portfolios ahead of their next fundraising wave.
18;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2010-12-13T22:53:08Z;Deal flurry not enough to inspire US stocks;;A flurry of deals including purchases by General Electric and Dell, combined with relief that China did not raise interest rates, failed to inspire US stocks to break out of their recent trading range.But General Electric dipped 0.6 per cent to $17.62 after it said it would buy Wellstream, a British oilfields services company for about £ 800m as part of its expansion into energy services.Wellstream supplies flexible pipes for the oil and gas sector, with manufacturing bases in both the UK and Brazil. One of the main attractions is its exposure to the Latin American country, which is investing heavily in exploration.The price of 786p a share is at a 29.1 per cent premium to Wellstream’s closing price on September 20, the last trading day before the UK company announced it had received a number of preliminary approaches.Shares in other oil services companies were among the biggest risers in the S&P 500 with Baker Hughesadvancing 2.1 per cent to $55.05 and National-Oilwell Varcoclimbing 2.1 per cent to $63.99.Dell fell 3.9 per cent to $13.36 after it said it would acquire data storage company Compellent Technologies for about $960m in cash as it tries to catch up with rival Hewlett-Packard. HP beat Dell in a bidding war for cloud computing company 3Par earlier in the year.Shares in Compellent, which have risen about 46 per cent since the possibility of a deal was first reported, also fell, slipping 2.5 per cent to $27.98.Dell suffered after analysts at Goldman Sachs rated the company a “sell” because of the competition its products face from tablet computers.Thermo Fisher added 4.8 per cent to $55.56 after the scientific instruments maker said it would buy Dionex for $2.1bn.At $118.50 a share Thermo Fisher is paying a 21 per cent premium over Friday’s closing price for the company which specialises in chromatography systems that separate components of a mixture for analysis. Shares in Dionex soared 20 per cent to $117.83.The S&P 500 closed flat at 1,240.46, its highest level since September 2008. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained 0.2 per cent to 11,428.56 but the Nasdaq Composite was 0.5 per cent lower at 2,637.21.The energy and materials sectors led the risers, with energy up 0.8 per cent and materials gaining 0.5 per cent, as investors were relieved that China decided not to raise its interest rates to combat inflation.Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial, warned that a busy week for US economic data and events in Europe could see stocks slip from their recent highs.“The markets blew off the November employment report and the ISM [Institute of supply management’s index of manufacturing activity] was also kind of iffy so if [this] week’s data are more mixed and isn’t as good as people expect, it might wake people up to the uneven data,” he said.“Confidence is near multi-year highs so that could be a real shock.”Elsewhere in deals news, Sanofi-Aventis’ battle for Genzyme rumbled on. The French pharmaceutical company extended its $18.5bn or $690-a-share offer by six weeks until January 21. Genzyme shares gained 0.7 per cent to $70.30 and US-listed shares in Sanofi added 0.5 per cent to $32.87.Sanofi-Aventis has said it will not raise the offer unless Genzyme’s board is willing to talk. It was reported that Sanofi-Aventis could be interested in contingent value rights where Sanofi would pay Genzyme investors more if its key experimental multiple sclerosis drug, Campath, proves to be the success that Genzyme expects.Airgas added 0.6 per cent to $63.50 after the company, which is fending off a hostile takeover bid from Air Products & Chemicals, said its directors disagreed over the minimum price they would accept. Shares in Air Products & Chemicals nudged down 0.2 per cent to $88.68.In ratings upgrades, Goldman Sachs resumed coverage of Apple, putting the technology company on its “conviction buy” list with a price target of $430. Apple added 0.4 per cent to $321.67.
19;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2010-12-13T21:28:36Z;Flurry of UK deals boosts M&A hopes;;British companies returned to dealmaking on Monday, as a flurry of midsized transactions buoyed equity markets and raised hopes among bankers of an imminent recovery in mergers and acquisitions activity.From oil and gas to pharmaceuticals and chemicals, UK companies were both predator and prey as pent-up deals put on ice during the economic crisis were finally executed.“There is a backlog of strategic transactions and portfolio optimisations that companies need to get done. CEOs are taking the opportunity to transact when they can,” said Mark Warham, co-head of European M&A at Barclays Capital.In deals designed to tap faster-growing markets, General Electricagreed an £800m acquisition of Wellstream, the UK-based oilfield provider, which is focused on Brazil, while Reckitt Benckiser continued its spending spree, snapping up Paras Pharmaceuticals, the privately held Indian ointments and personal care company, for about $726m (£458m).John Wood, the UK oil and gas services company, spent $955m, including $325m of debt, to buy its unlisted Aberdeen-based rival PSN, creating the world’s leading brownfield production services provider.Investors also welcomed Yule Catto’s €443m (£374m) acquisition of PolymerLatex, Europe’s third-largest latex producer, which the UK chemicals maker plans to finance with a £225m rights issue.News of deal activity helped the FTSE 100 blue-chip index to extend its recent rally, rising a further 1 per cent to 5,868.34. The FTSE 250 mid-cap index, which is commonly seen as a more accurate reflection of the UK economy and has outperformed many international markets this year, gained 0.4 per cent to 11,327.49.Bankers said companies were demonstrating that confidence had returned to the M&A market for bolt-on deals, while improving capital markets had helped narrow the gap between buyers and sellers.“Chief executives are using their strength and balance sheets and are willing to pay to achieve penetration into new growth markets,” said Philip Noblet, co-head of European M&A at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Global dealmaking totals $2,630bn so far this year, a 22 per cent increase on the $2,160bn of deals announced in the same period last year, according to data from Dealogic.However, that number is still 41 per cent lower than it was at the peak of the debt-fuelled boom in 2007, when worldwide M&A activity reached $4,420bn.In the US, companies also moved to bolster their position with smaller, tuck-in deals. Thermo Fisher, which lost out to Germany’s Merck earlier this year in buying biotech equipment-maker Millipore, bought chromatography systems company Dionex for $2.1bn, while Dell snapped up Compellent Technologies for $960m, to boost its presence in data-storage systems.
20;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2020-04-23T21:49:51+0000;Thermo Fisher to buy Dionex for $2.1bn;;Thermo Fisher Scientific, the US maker of scientific laboratory instruments, said that it would acquire Dionex in a $2.1bn deal that will help it expand its chromatography business.In the all-cash deal announced on Monday, Thermo Fisher will pay $118.50 a share for Dionex. The price represents a 21 per cent premium above Dionex’s closing share price on December 10 and 19.5 times forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.Chromatography is a method of separating and analysing mixtures of gases, liquids or other substances. Thermo Fisher already offers gas chromatography systems and will broaden its offerings by acquiring Dionex, which specialises in ion and liquid chromatography for water testing and food safety.“We believe the combination of Thermo Fisher and Dionex is extremely compelling from a technology, market and financial perspective,” said Marc Casper, Thermo Fisher’s chief executive.Thermo Fisher, which is based in Waltham, Massachusetts, currently has a strong presence in China and expects the deal to widen its footprint in Asia, where California-based Dionex already generates 35 per cent of its revenues.Thermo Fisher expects to be able to cut $40m in costs in the third year after the deal closes, and estimates that about $20m in additional revenue will come through then from combining the two companies.Barclays Capital and JPMorgan Securities advised Thermo Fisher on the acquisition and also provided financing. Goldman Sachs advised Dionex.The deal for Dionex is Mr Casper’s first sizable transaction since taking over as chief executive last year. Thermo earlier this year lost out in buying Millipore, a maker of diagnostics and equipment for the biotech industry which was bought by Germany’s Merck for $7.2bn.Thermo last month reached an agreement to acquire Lomb Scientific, which makes laboratory chemicals, consumables and instruments for hospitals, universities and laboratories in Australia and New Zealand.Shares of Thermo Fisher rose 3.3 per cent to $54.79 in mid-morning trading in New York. Dionex’s shares were up 20.21 per cent at $118.01.
21;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;Wall Street boosted by economic data;;Shares in Tenet Healthcare soared after it rejected a bid from Community Health Systems while the rest of US stock market continued to hover around two-year highs.Hospital operator Tenet Healthcare surged 545 per cent to $6.65, helping the healthcare sector rise 0.9 per cent. Community Health Systems offered to buy Tenet for $3.3bn, or $6 per share in cash and stock.But Tenet rejected the bid, at about a 40 per cent premium over Thursday’s closing price, as “not remotely fair value”.Shares in Community Health Systems, which has made eight acquisitions in the past two years, making it the largest publicly traded US hospital company, also soared, up 13.4 per cent to $35.89.Other healthcare stocks were lifted by the bid.

22;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2010-03-02T10:24:12Z;Thermo Fisher: Centre of excellence reflects history of scientific innovation;;In a factory in Runcorn, near Liverpool, sit rows of machines that until recently were whirring away in California. A research director from the US will soon be joining them.Those moves illustrate the commitment of America’s Thermo Fisher Scientific, a leader in supplying laboratories worldwide, to Runcorn – and the lure of the town for it.The west coast of the US may have spawned software and biotechnology revolutions but the north-west of England has an even longer history of scientific innovation.Thermo Fisher, which already had a manufacturing plant at Runcorn, has now created a centre of excellence in disease research and in chromatography, a process used to analyse everything from contaminated food to crime scenes.Some 60 extra staff have been hired and the 200 employees could increase to 500 within five years, says Yuh-Geng Tsay, senior vice-president and head of speciality diagnostics, who opened the facility last month.“A centre of excellence is a site we have made a strong commitment to and we own the property,” he says.“The north-west of England has advantages in terms of academic and medical capability. There is a lot of high-tech research and we can take advantage of the great universities in Liverpool and Manchester,” Mr Tsay adds.“Our cancer diagnostic business is headquartered in Kalamazoo, Michigan and we will relocate the research director here.”John Griffiths, who is leading research into leukaemia at the University of Manchester, says he cannot work to isolate potential problem proteins and genes without Thermo Fisher products, including reagent liquids.Chromatography allows researchers to break down samples quickly in the search for clues as to which proteins are responsible for different cancers, and these could be targeted by new drugs.Runcorn will also remain a centre for anatomical pathology, supplying products for hospitals that need to analyse tissue samples.Mr Tsay says it is a growth area and he is confident of finding qualified staff in the region. “We are pleased with our ability to continue to attract talent in this area,” he says.Thermo Fisher arrived in Runcorn after buying Shandon, a laboratory equipment maker.It had to leave those premises to make way for a new bridge across the river Mersey, but Mr Tsay says it has never considered leaving the town.Rather, it found a bigger building with help from the Northwest Regional Development Agency and Halton council. “We have been made very welcome here,” he says.The company spent £4.5m ($6.8m) refurbishing the 85,000 sq ft offices. With five acres of land, it could almost double in size if necessary.It is a big vote of confidence from a Fortune 500 company with revenues of $10bn and 36,000 employees, 380 of them in the north-west in four locations.North America accounts for 61 per cent of sales and Europe 24 per cent, so the potential for growth in emerging markets is large.Roger Platt, chairman of the Northwest Science Council, which represents universities and businesses, says: “It is just this kind of investment that is critical to the success of our region and the UK as a whole.”
23;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2020-04-23T20:36:54+0000;M&A burst drives Wall Street higher;;"A burst of merger and acquisition activity moved US stocks higher Monday, aided by stronger than expected consumer spending and manufacturing figures as well as optimism that a Greek bail-out plan may be agreed soon.Consumer spending was last month stronger than had been expected – up 0.5 per cent – and higher for a fourth consecutive month while incomes increased by less than expected.“Real consumer spending will probably rise around 2.5 per cent in the first quarter, better than the 1.7 per increase in the fourth,” said Nigel Gault, chief US economist at IHS Global Insight. “Consumer spending is improving gradually but is not playing a leading role in the recovery. Wage and salary incomes improved in January but overall personal income increased only 0.1 per cent because dividend income, farm income and interest income all took a hit.”Manufacturing expanded in February for a seventh consecutive month, although by less than expected, suggesting that US factories are leading the recovery. The ISM index fell to 56.5 from 58.4 in January.After the close, the S&P 500 was 1 per cent higher to 1,115.71, inching above 1,115, a technical level traders focus on. The index is 0.05 per cent higher since the start of the year.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8 per cent to 10,403.79, and the Nasdaq Composite was 1.6 per cent higher at 2,273.57.Insurance giant AIG advanced 4.1 per cent to $25.78 after Prudential, a UK life insurer, agreed to buy its Asian operations for $35.5bn in cash and shares.AIG, which is 80 per cent owned by US taxpayers, had planned a $10bn-$20bn partial listing of AIG on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange but scrapped the idea in favour of a trade sale to Prudential.Millipore rose 11.1 per cent to $104.90 on news that Merck KGaA, a German pharmaceuticals and chemicals company, had agreed to buy the US laboratory supplies maker for $7.2bn, including net debt. It trumps a $6bn approach by Thermo Fisher, a rival US company, and represents a 50 per cent premium to Millipore’s earlier share price. Thermo Fisher was 0.3 down to $48.65.OSI Pharmaceuticals surged 51.9 per cent to $56.25 after Astellas Pharma, Japan’s second-largest drugmaker, said it was about to begin a $3.5bn hostile takeover for the company. The bid values OSI at $52 per share in cash. Some traders are expecting a higher offer and potentially a bidding war.RiskMetrics Group rose 13.2 per cent to $21.09 after the risk advisory group was bought by MSCI Inc, a US investment analysis and market index company, in a $1.55bn cash and stock transaction. Shares in MSCI fell 4.6 per cent to $28.59.Miner Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold was up 1.7 per cent to $76.45 on the first trading day after the weekend’s earthquake in Chile, the world’s leading copper producer.

3.2 per cent to $45.50.SanDisk Corp gained 11.9 per cent to $32.63 after the leading flash memory maker for digital cameras and phones raised its revenue forecasts for the current quarter and said the outlook for its industry was strong in coming years.Rival Micron Technology was 7.8 per cent higher to $9.77 while Seagate Technology advanced 7.2 per cent to $21.35.In the same sector, AsiaInfo Holdings gained 11.6 per cent to $27.25 as the China-based supplier of software for phone companies was upgraded by Goldman Sachs to “buy” from “neutral”.Troubled carmaker Toyota fell 1.6 per cent to $73.64 on worries that last week’s efforts by its executives to reassure consumers and investors over the technical faults that triggered a recall of 8m of its cars may not have succeeded.Small cap Ariad Pharmaceuticals rose 9.1 per cent to $2.77 after AP24534, its leukaemia drug, received “orphan” status from the Food and Drug Administration. The status is reserved for drugs for rare conditions and is supposed to encourage the development of drugs for conditions that have a small market."
24;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2010-02-28T23:23:58Z;Merck to buy Millipore in $7.2bn deal;;Merck, the German pharmaceuticals and chemicals company, has agreed to buy Millipore, the US laboratory supplies maker, for $7.2bn, including net debt.The move comes just days after Millipore revealed that it had hired Goldman Sachs to solicit bidders for a possible merger or sale. At the time, it said it had no “definitive timetable” for the auction.Merck’s $107-per-share cash offer, which will be financed through available cash and a term loan, trumps a reported $6bn approach for Millipore from Thermo Fisher, a rival US laboratory equipment maker, and represents almost a 50 per cent premium to Millipore’s share price before the first reports of a possible takeover.Both Millipore’s and Merck’s boards have approved the deal, which must still be voted on by the former’s shareholders.The move highlights the continuing trend of consolidation in the global pharmaceuticals sector as drug companies search for new revenues to replace lost sales from patent expiries and competition from generic drug makers.Pfizer last year paid $68bn to acquire its smaller US rival Wyeth, while Abbott Laboratories of the US bought Solvay of Belgium’s pharmaceuticals business for $6.5bn.That transaction left Merck and Bayer of Germany as the two remaining large-scale conglomerates producing pharmaceuticals as well as chemicals and other diversified non-health activities.For Merck, the deal’s timing is welcome. The company last week announced lacklustre quarterly results and suffered a regulatory setback for one of its key drugs.A scientific committee of the European Medicines Agency rejected the use of Erbitux to treat a form of lung cancer, reducing the drug’s potential market. JPMorgan downgraded the company and said Erbitux’s use as a lung cancer treatment had been “a major growth driver” for the company.The rejection could cut annual non-US sales of Erbitux, which had been estimated at up to €1.9bn ($2.7bn), by 7-14 per cent over the next six years, they said.Merck is looking at options to appeal.Millipore makes filters and purifiers for laboratory water and other materials used in making biotechnology drugs.Its shares gained more than 30 per cent last week in the wake of the reported Thermo Fisher offer and its strategic review. It now has a market capitalisation of more than $5bn and long-term debt of $890m. Millipore’s net income for the fourth quarter was about $44m, or 78 cents a share, compared with $31.1m, or 56 cents a share, for the same period a year ago.
25;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2010-02-24T21:31:26Z;Wall St comforted by rate outlook;;US equities moved higher on Wednesday as the markets were comforted by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke’s comments to Congress that the US economy is in a “nascent” recovery that requires interest rates to be kept low to encourage demand by consumers and companies.“The markets are breathing a sigh of relief that the recent rise in the discount rate will not lead to significant tightening in the near future,” said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist at Channel Capital Research.He said Mr Bernanke is keen to give the jittery markets plenty of visibility on policy decisions. “He wants any move the Fed makes to be a non-event.”The S&P 500 closed 1 per cent up to 1,105.24, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9 per cent to 10,374.16 and the Nasdaq Composite was 1 per cent higher at 2,235.90.Shares in homebuilders fell as figures showed that sales of new homes in the US fell unexpectedly in January to the lowest levels on record.Only 309,000 new homes were sold in January, while inventories remain high.DR Horton fell 1.8 per cent to $12.34, Pulte Homes declined 1.5 per cent to $10.81 and Lennar Corp lost 0.1 per cent to $16.27.Shares in Citigroup were up 3 per cent to $3.45.

Analysts had expected on average a profit of 23 cents per share.Millipore Corp, a life sciences specialist, gained 5.5 per cent to $93.79 after the company said it was in the process of evaluating its strategic options, including a potential sale or merger.It was reported on Monday that rival Thermo Fisher Scientific had made an unsolicited bid for Millipore worth about $6bn.Arena Pharmaceuticals jumped 1.2 per cent to $3.19 on news that the Food and Drug Administration had accepted its application for lorcaserin, its experimental obesity drug.The company said it expected to find out in the following weeks when the FDA would make a final drug approval decision.Pfizer strengthened 0.8 per cent to $17.81 following the approval by the FDA of a new version of its Prevnar vaccine against pneumococcal bacteria in children.Also, the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended that that any children who have not yet been vaccinated with Prevnar should be vaccinated with the new version.H&R Block, a leading tax return preparer, was one of the biggest fallers in the S&P 500 index.The shares lost 12.2 per cent to $17.32 after the company said it would fail to achieve its previous earnings forecasts.Rising unemployment had curtailed tax returns and more people were choosing to complete their own to save money, the company said. The stock’s target price was cut by S&P Equity from $23 to $19 and rated “hold”.Rival Jackson Hewitt Tax Service was also down 3.7 per cent to $2.36.Shares in BGC Partners, a broker focused on over-the-counter trading, gained 17.8 per cent to $5.03 after forecasting higher first-quarter earnings than analysts had expected.Tobacco group Altria gained 1.5 per cent to $20.26 on news that it had raised its regular quarterly dividend by 2.9 per cent.In the food and restaurant sector, Papa John‘s, a leading pizza maker, rose 7.2 per cent to $24.88, the most in two months, as the company posted fourth-quarter earnings that comfortably beat average analyst estimates.Rival Domino’s Pizza was also up by 2.4 per cent to $12.43, continuing its steady rise since the start of the year.Restaurant chain operator Darden Restaurants gained 0.9 per cent to $40.99 as the stock’s target price was raised by analysts at Credit Suisse from $37 to $44..
26;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2009-09-15T17:02:08Z;Bayer names chief executive;;Bayer, the German drugs and plastics company, has named Marijn Dekkers, a Dutchman at the head of US-based Thermo Fisher Scientific, to succeed chief executive Werner Wenning in a year’s time.The appointment marks the first time that an outsider will take charge of the pharmaceuticals-focused group, and suggests it is gearing up for industry consolidation as it puts a mergers and acquisitions expert at its helm.The 51-year-old Mr Dekkers burnished his credentials at Thermo Fisher, a highly profitable industry leader he helped form in 2006 by merging the laboratory equipment maker he ran with a laboratory supplies group.Manfred Schneider, the long-serving chairman of Bayer’s supervisory board, said Mr Dekker’s “international experience combined with his focus and drive” were “convincing arguments” for appointing him.Bayer considered internal and external candidates after Mr Wenning, aged 62, told Mr Schneider last year he wanted to retire in spring – although he will now stay on an extra few months to smooth other board changes.Mr Dekkers, who started his career at General Electric in the US, will become the eighth foreigner currently at the helm of one of Germany’s 30 blue-chip groups, a gauge of how a once insular corporate elite is diversifying.The Dutchman’s experience could serve Bayer well, as the group has staked its future on growing by acquisition in the drugs sector ever since spinning off its once-core chemicals business at the beginning of 2005.The move was at the heart of Mr Wenning’s strategy to shift Bayer’s focus to the remaining higher-margin businesses of drugs and specialised plastics – although the latter could well be sold to refinance any large acquisitions.Mr Wenning, who has been chief executive since September 2001, bolstered Bayer’s drugs business with a number of deals, the €17bn purchase of German drugs rival Schering in 2006 marking the last big move.The company has looked at other moves since, but has continued to tread water as larger drugs rivals like Roche of Switzerland and Merck of the US have continued to consolidate even amid global recession.As a sign of the weight Bayer places on pharmaceuticals, the company said Mr Dekkers from January would take charge of drugs unit Bayer Healthcare before moving up to become Bayer chief executive in October 2010.The vacancy at Bayer Healthcare was created by the decision of its current head, Arthur Higgins, to leave the company for “personal reasons” – and will leave Mr Dekkers free to appoint his own successor when the time comes.Also leaving is Klaus Kühn, Bayer’s chief financial officer, who the company said would leave “at his own request” at the end of April. He will be replaced by Werner Baumann, currently a top executive at Bayer Healthcare.
27;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2008-03-27T23:08:14Z;Allianz shows a green streak;;"The Allianz RCM Global EcoTrends fund, an open-ended investment company with €1.7bn ($2.7bn) in assets is not a ‘green’ fund, but an environmental technology fund, says manager Bozena Jankowska.The fund does not claim to be ethically-minded. About 75 per cent of the portfolio is invested in companies in three areas: eco-energy, pollution control and water. Ms Jankowska is a bottom-up stock picker who relies on fundamental analysis. As much as 20 per cent of the fund is invested in emerging markets. The fund is aimed at long-term investors who are willing to take on more risk. Ms Jankowska relies on research from RCM’s EcoTrends team, which was set up seven years ago.“We look at the relevance of a company; we look at the quality of the management, the quality of the business. We look at the valuation and then that helps us decide whether we ultimately would like to hold the stock or not,” explains Ms Jankowska. “For example, we would want to look at companies that have a technological edge. So, how differentiated are they? What are the barriers to entry? Are they participating in a sector that has strong regulatory support? Is that support transparent, how long term is it?“Also, we look at the growth prospects of a given sector and the sustainability of earnings of the companies,” she continues.No calls are made on sectors or regions. But most of the exposure is in Europe where more environmental companies are based. And Ms Jankowska admits to being positive on the wind generation sector, but more cautious on solar power.Favoured companies include Gamesa, which offers exposure to the wind sector and Thermo Fisher Scientific, a player in the environmental, health and safety testing market. “We like Gamesa because it provides exposure to the wind sector, which we currently are positive on, is looking attractive from a valuation stand point and has good visibility on earnings,” says Ms Jankowska.Performance has been dragged down by the fund’s exposure to the solar sector in the wake of the recent pullback in share prices in the sector. Since the start of the year three solar holdings reported results, which disappointed the market – Renewable Energy Corporation, Siemens and Veolia Environment. But Ms Jankowska remains positive on these companies in the long-term. “This has been a factor of investors, particularly non-specialist investors, taking their money off the table following very strong returns for solar in 2007,” says Ms Jankowska.Top holdings include Vestas Wind Systems, Suntech Power Holdings, First Solar, Stericycle, Novozymes and Suzlon Energy.The rising sums poured into wind turbines, solar power, energy efficiency and other low-carbon forms of energy reflect a combination of factors, analysts say. These include climate change concerns, high energy prices and a desire by many governments to diversify their energy supply in the interests of security.The sector is diverse, populated by a variety of small specialists, start-ups and other young companies, alongside a sprinkling of large, established companies, Ms Jankowska says."
28;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2020-04-23T23:01:56+0000;Thermo and Fisher plan $10.6bn union;;Thermo Electron and Fisher Scientific are to merge in a $10.6bn, all-stock deal that will create one of the world’s largest suppliers of laboratory research equipment and services.The management of the two US companies said the new group would combine Thermo’s expertise in analytical instruments with Fisher’s strengths in providing materials such as enzymes and antibodies as well as hardware such as flasks and culture dishes.“This combines two incredibly complementary industry leaders,” said Marijn Dekkers, chief executive of Thermo.Under the deal, Fisher’s shareholders are to receive one share in the combined company for every two shares, which represented a 7 per cent premium against Friday’s closing share price of $73.73.Thermo’s shares were 2.3 per cent lower at the close on Monday, down 91 cents at $38.54. Fisher’s shares rose 3 per cent to end the session at $75.95.Mr Dekkers will continue as chief executive of the new company, Thermo Fisher Scientific, while Paul Meister, Fisher’s vice-chairman, will become chairman. Paul Montrone, Fisher’s chairman and chief executive, is to step down but will remain an adviser to the new company.The new company is expected to have combined sales of about $9.2bn in 2007.Mr Dekkers said the company was “very comfortable” with the forecast synergies of $200m over three years, with $150m of savings seen from combined operations and increased buying power and an estimated $50m in extra sales as a result of combined marketing and cross-selling opportunities.Both Mr Dekkers and Mr Meister argued that the merger reflected broader changes in the industry, as customers sought to control costs by using suppliers able to provide their research scientists with a fully integrated range of lab services.“This combination serves both . . .big pharma and big biotech better than we could individually before,” said Mr Dekkers.Mr Meister said the merger continued a trend already seen in smaller previous acquisitions by both companies. “We’ve both been capitalising on that big new trend by expanding our footprints over the past few years,” he said.This year Fisher acquired Clintrak Pharmaceutical for $125m and Athena Diagnostics for $283m, while last year Thermo acquired Kendro Laboratories for $834m.Thermo expects 2007 earnings for the combined company to be in the range of $2.27 to $2.37 a share, 18 per cent higher than the existing consensus 2007 earnings outlook. The merger is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2006.Thermo was advised by Lehman Brothers and Rothschild, and Fisher by Goldman Sachs and Lazard Freres.
29;TMO;Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc;2006-05-08T02:32:45Z;Fisher Scientific to merge with Thermo Electron;;Fisher Scientific, the US scientific laboratory equipment company, on Sunday night was close to agreeing to a merger with Thermo Electron, a smaller industrial group focused on making scientific instruments. The two companies were considering an all-stock deal worth about $9.8bn, excluding debt, people close to the matter said.The proposed transaction, which was expected to be approved by directors at both companies, should create a new company – Thermo Fisher Scientific — with about $9bn in annual revenues and a worldwide sales force of 7,500.Its ambition will be to establish itself as a one-stop shop for laboratory equipment combining Fisher’s strength in consumables with Thermo’s devices, including its mass spectrometre, which measures the mass and concentration of atoms and molecules.Although Fisher is a larger company, Thermo is the acquirer in the deal. Marijn Dekkers, Thermo’s chief executive, will lead the combined group while Paul Montrone, chief executive of Fisher, will be stepping aside. Peter Meister, Fisher’s vice-chairman, will become chairman of the new company, which will be headquartered in Thermo’s hometown in Massachusetts.In the “reverse takeover”, Fisher shareholders will receive two shares in the combined group for each Fisher share. This values Fisher at $78.90 per share, a small premium to its market value of $9.2bn. Shareholders of Fisher, which is based in New Hampshire, will end up owning 61 per cent of the combined group, with Thermo investors owning the remaining 39 per cent.Among the challenges facing Fisher and Thermo as they unveil the deal will be to persuade Wall Street investors that the unusual structure of the transaction is justified. In addition, they will have to provide detail on their intention to produce about $200m in annual cost-savings from the merger.One person close to the talks on Sunday night said the savings would come from better purchasing agreements, the cross-selling of products, and the integration of manufacturing facilities.Bankers at Lehman Brothers and Rothschild, as well as lawyers at Wachtell Lipton advised Thermo. Bankers at Lazard and Goldman Sachs worked with Fisher, alongside lawyers at Skadden Arps.

Since the pandemic hit, the FT has been covering the impact on law firms — from the sudden widespread adjustment to remote working and the disruption to courts, to an influx of client questions about keeping deals alive and managing legal issues emerging from the outbreak.The following stories are taken from our Full Disclosure newsletter, sent to FT subscribers in the industry each week, sharing what has been most popular with legal readers on FT.com.As with most sectors, shouldering the financial blow to business is an urgent priority: readers have zeroed in on our reporting about how law firms are coping, while finding opportunities in growth areas.This week law firms made moves to ease the burden of coronavirus on their bottom lines.None has been so unusual as Norton Rose Fulbright, which is resurrecting a four-day week scheme it enacted during the financial crisis in a bid to save jobs.Staff at the firm earning more than £45,000 have been asked to volunteer to work four days a week when they are less busy and take a 20 per cent cut. Those on lower salaries will take a 5-20 per cent pay cut for the same reduction in hours.Elsewhere the legal world continues to adapt to remote technology. This week the Solicitors’ Disciplinary Tribunal went virtual, with Baker McKenzie’s ex-London boss Gary Senior facing a hearing via Zoom over alleged sexual misconduct. He denies the allegations against him.The move to homeworking has been a big change for lawyers, who are used to face-to-face meetings and close teamwork. But online tools including electronic data rooms for checking documents and video conferencing platforms are making it easier to adapt.Tech tools are also helping from a social perspective — whether it is Friday night drinks on Zoom to “virtual coffee rooms”, lawyers are finding ways to connect with colleagues and bond with teams in the digital realm.Here is our selection of what FT subscribers in the legal sector having been reading in the past week:Lawyers re-tool to take on restructuring boomLaw firms are retraining junior lawyers to become experts in restructuring and insolvency during the pandemic and borrowing partners from quieter departments to work on large deals at firms including Latham & Watkins and Hogan Lovells. As one senior private equity lawyer put it:“Firms expect three or four times the number of core restructuring lawyers to be subsumed into stressed and distressed related work during the Covid-19 crisis.”Norton Rose calls on staff to take on four-day weekNorton Rose Fulbright became the first large law firm in the UK to ask staff to accept a pay cut and reduced hours last week. It will also be delaying the payout of partner profits as well as salary rises and bonus payments.“Norton Rose took similar action during the financial crisis. Other big firms are also making moves to conserve cash and protect jobs in the face of big predicted falls in fee income.”LSE rejects Burford’s claim of stock manipulationThe latest salvo was fired last week in a bitter court row between litigation funder Burford Capital and the London Stock Exchange. Burford believes its share price was manipulated and wants the court to force the LSE to reveal the traders who did it. The LSE called Burford’s claims “completely detached from reality”.“The LSE said it had thoroughly investigated the claim along with the FCA and found no evidence of wrongdoing. For both the LSE and FCA to be wrong, it said, ‘there must have been a catastrophic and incredibly surprising independent failure of their systems and analysis, both automated and manual’, for which there was no evidence.”Neighbourly love in a cold climateThis week the FT’s Jo Ellison looks at what enforced social coldness means for body language. Handshakes are long gone and the elbow bump too — how do we express affection in the age of coronavirus?“Maybe it’s time to introduce my grandmother’s old favourite — when you do something she approves of, you get a little wink. It’s friendly, informal, cheeky, and it shows solidarity. Plus, you can read it from a distance.”Home working leaves UK vulnerable to fraudMass home working as a result of coronavirus has opened up opportunities for fraudsters to target companies and fuelled a sharp rise in attempted scams in recent weeks.“While regulators have been quick to warn about schemes aimed at individuals amid the pandemic — such as financial data ‘phishing’ attempts, or bank payment frauds — the danger to businesses and their investors is equally heightened, say advisers.”Closing argumentThose of us feeling smug about our lockdown exercise efforts will be put to shame this week by 73-year old Rosie Swale-Pope (top picture). The adventurer is currently holed up in a Turkish hotel, but since July 2018 she has spent nine nights in every 10 sleeping inside a three-wheeled trailer she is hauling from Brighton to Kathmandu, Nepal, in a 5,300-mile run through 18 countries.“From 2002 to 2007, Swale-Pope ran almost 20,000 miles from her then home in Tenby, Wales, through northern Europe, Russia, Alaska, Canada and the US, returning to the UK via Greenland and Iceland. She endured broken bones, frostbite and encounters with hungry wolves — and turned 60 on the road.”
