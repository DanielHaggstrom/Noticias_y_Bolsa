0;CNP;Centerpoint Energy Inc;2018-04-23T12:24:48Z;CenterPoint Energy to buy Vectren in $8bn natural gas deal;;US natural gas and electric utility CenterPoint Energy agreed to purchase Vectren for more than $8bn on Monday.The cash deal, which was approved by the boards of both US utilities, valued Vectren at $72 a share and included the assumption of roughly $2.5bn of debt.The combination will pair CenterPoint’s natural gas business in Arkansas, Louisiana and Minnesota with Vectren, which provides natural gas to more than 1m consumers in Indiana and Ohio.CenterPoint said the combined group would operate as a regulated utility in eight states and serve nearly 7m customers.“By combining our two highly complementary companies, we are creating an energy delivery, infrastructure and services leader that will drive value for our shareholders and customers,” said Scott Prochazka, chief executive of CenterPoint Energy.The $6bn cash portion of the deal will be funded with roughly $2.5bn in new equity before the transaction closes, as well as debt. CenterPoint said it expected the deal to be completed by the first quarter of 2019.Shares of CenterPoint fell 2 per cent to $26.22 in pre-market trading on Monday after the company announced the acquisition of Vectren.

Utilities beat eight out of the 10 major industry groups in the S&P500 index, rising more than 16 per cent.Houston-based Centerpoint Energy leads the gainers, having climbed 24.2 per cent. The broad US stock index is up 9.1 per cent in the year to date, pulling back from all-time highs in March.The rally in utilities is at the expense of economically sensitive areas such as industrials, technology and materials – which are seen as barometers for global growth and can fuel bull markets.Far from showing signs of abating, the gains for utilities could increase in the coming months, according to analysts.“Utilities have done really well this year,” said Adrian Miller, director of fixed income strategy at GMP Securities.“As stocks pull back and bond markets have caught a bid on higher risk concerns, their fundamentals from the standpoint of leverage will remain attractive.”Investor preference for defensive utilities suggests fear of a slower US economy and of a slump in equity prices during the spring and possibly the summer.Shares in the companies trade at multiples that are steeper than long-term average earnings.However, a rotation into more cyclical names has yet to take place, analysts said.“We would caution that a lot of these stocks are trading on a valuation basis higher than their historical average,” said Channing Smith, an equity strategist at Capital Advisors.“[But] we think there is time there before you see a rotation, given the lack of evidence of better than expected growth.”In the bond markets, average yields on the debt at 3.01 per cent are higher than those offered by other corporate bonds with similar ratings, according to Barclays.However, the relative scarcity of the securities also makes the debt compelling.About $23bn in dollar-debt was sold by the companies in 2013. That compares with overall sales of investment-grade bonds of $338bn, according to Dealogic.“Utilities are a small asset class compared with the broad market,” said Mr Miller. “The bonds have scarcity value attached to them.”

an economists’ survey,” said John Stoltzfus, analyst at Ticonderoga Securities. “[It] is being interpreted by the markets thus far today as [an] indication that slowing in Europe will not be as detrimental to growth around the world – particularly in China – as the markets initially had thought.”At the close, the S&P 500 was down 0.6 per cent to 1,055.65, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 0.4 per cent to 9,899.25 and the Nasdaq Composite had fallen 0.5 per cent to 2,158.85.US-listed shares in BP fell 15.8 per cent to $29.20, their lowest level since 1996, as pressure grew from US lawmakers on the oil giant grew to suspend its dividends. The company has now lost about half its market value since the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico begun in April.Bank of America fell 2.1 per cent to $15.01 after Banco Santander, Spain’s largest bank, agreed to buy back a stake in its Mexican unit sold to Bank of America in 2003 for $2.5bn in cash.Utility stocks were among the worst performers of the session. Centerpoint Energy declined 3.2 per cent to $12.90 after the Houston-based electric and gas utility said it was offering 22m shares of common stock.The stock’s target price was lowered from $15.50 to $14 at Jefferies, who also reiterated its “hold” rating.PG&E Corp, owner of California’s largest electricity provider, declined 2.2 per cent to $40.Voters in California rejected a proposal backed by the company to amend the state constitution in a way that would have sharply limited local electricity competition.The Southern Company was 0.8 per cent down to $32.57 and Scana Corp lost 2.1 per cent to $34.93.Shares in Eclipsys Corp, a healthcare information technology provider, rallied 2.8 per cent to $19.02 after Allscripts-Misys Healthcare Solutions said it would buy the company for $1.3bn.The merged company will create a leader in electronic medical records. Allscripts was 9.7 per cent lower at $16.64.Ciena, a maker of network equipment for a number of phone companies, gained 0.8 per cent to $13.95, after rising as much as 7.2 per cent, after the company posted a narrower than expected second-quarter loss.The company also said revenue would be in the range of $375m to $400m in the quarter ending in July. The average analyst estimate is $332.8m.Chipmaker Texas Instruments lost 0.6 per cent to $23.74 even as the company said second-quarter profit would be 60-64 cents a share, with revenues of at least $3.45bn. In April, it forecast profit to be 56-64 cents per share with revenue of at least $3.31bn.Sonic Solutions, a maker of software for blu-ray DVD discs, added 3.8 per cent to $8.71 after the stock was rated “overweight” at JPMorgan as the broker initiated coverage.Consumer discretionary stocks were big risers, with CBS Corp leading the group higher. The mass media group that includes a cable network and television
studios, rose 2.6 per cent to $13.65.Marriott International rallied 1.2 per cent to $32.51. It said late on Tuesday that its room rates in North America rose for the first time in two years in May. It also announced the launch of the first two hotels under its Edition brand.Rival Starwood Hotels also rallied, rising 5.3 per cent to $47.33.Potash Corp of Saskatchewan rose 1.5 per cent to $95.72 following comments by Wayne Brownlee, chief financial officer, that the company expected Chinese potash consumption to normalise in 2011. The stock was upgraded from “neutral” to “buy” and its target price raised from $106 to $112 at UBS."

Exelon’s new offer would pay 0.545 of an Exelon share for each NRG share, which valued NRG’s shares at $26.36 at mid-morning on Wednesday.As part of its argument for a higher offer, NRG boosted its liquidity projections and raised its estimate for 2009 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation to $2.5bn from $2.175bn.
4;CNP;Centerpoint Energy Inc;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Exelon sets out ‘final’ bid for NRG;;"Exelon on Thursday increased its hostile bid for NRG Energy by 12 per cent to about $7.5bn and called the move its “best and final offer’’.The US electricity producer, which has been trying since October to acquire its rival, said it had decided to raise its offer after identifying another $1.5bn in cost savings.These would result from combining the businesses and adding in the benefits of NRG’s recent purchase of a retail business from Reliant Energy.In total, Exelon said it could squeeze out $3.6bn- $4bn in operational synergies by melding the businesses together and transforming NRG.The Chicago-based company said it was confident it could refinance NRG’s $4.7bn of senior notes and other debt and still maintain investment grade credit ratings.NRG has repeatedly rejected Exelon’s earlier offer, which stood at 0.485 of an Exelon share for each NRG share.The new offer raises that exchange ratio to 0.545 of an Exelon share per NRG share.NRG urged shareholders to take no action while its board reviewed the revised offer.NRG has scheduled an annual shareholder meeting on July 21 and Exelon plans to agitate at that meeting for the election of proposed alternate nine independent directors to NRG’s board.Shares in NRG were 2.8 per cent lower at $25.31 in early New York trading, while Exelon was down 2.3 per cent at $50.36.A drop in Exelon’s share price since the offer was made – amid the economic crisis and concerns about the impact of impending carbon legislation on the power industry – had cut into the premium it was offering.In addition, it appeared support for the hostile takeover was declining; Exelon said in June that only about 12 per cent of NRG’s outstanding shares had been tendered under its offer, well below the 51 per cent it had received in February.“This is our best and final offer, and we will use the time leading up to the NRG annual meeting to communicate the value of our new offer to NRG shareholders,’’ said John Rowe, Exelon’s chairman and chief executive.NRG, whose management has resisted the Exelon bid as insufficient, said after the increased offer: “NRG’s board of directors will carefully review Exelon’s revised proposal with its advisers and determine the appropriate response promptly.’’In the event of a change of control at NRG, its debt must be refinanced.Exelon said it had continued to pursue NRG because of the long-term value that could be created by industry consolidation.“This is a done deal, and my money is on Exelon,’’ said Karl Miller, a senior industry adviser.“The NRG board and management are wasting shareholder money fighting a futile effort to entrench themselves.”"
5;CNP;Centerpoint Energy Inc;2008-11-12T03:14:59Z;Exelon goes hostile after NRG rebuffs $6bn bid;Deals looming for US power sector;Exelon launched a hostile takeover battle for rival NRG Energy on Tuesday, after NRG rejected its unsolicited $6.2bn offer to combine the companies into the largest US power producer.The power sector has recently turned into fertile ground for potential transactions.Dynegy, another US power company, also hired Goldman Sachs and Greenhill to advise on its strategic options, an insider said.In addition to the activity surrounding Exelon, NRG and Dynegy, Warren Buffett agreed a $4.7bn deal in September to buy Constellation Energy, a nuclear power producer, and Reliant Energy is now weighing options for its business.Share prices of electricity companies have halved since July but have steadied somewhat since since Exelon bid for NRG last month.A banker said: “These are very capital intensive businesses that have gone through a lot of trauma, and there’s some significant dislocation in terms of value.”Exelon, after being rebuffed by NRG on Sunday, said it would launch an exchange offer on Wednesday for all outstanding shares of NRG at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.485 Exelon shares for each NRG share. That offer, which valued NRG’s shares at $26.43 each based on Exelon’s October 17 closing price of $54.50 is unchanged from its original offer of October 19.NRG Energy, which rejected the offer as “risky’’ and “opportunistic’’, said the deal undervalued its business and might not be completed because of the rough financing markets. Exelon refused to bid against itself and raise its price, opting instead to take the matter straight to shareholders.Another insider who expected Exelon’s move to start a protracted battle, said: “I think we’ve got two bulls locking horns.”Dynegy, for its part, may be looking to weigh its options ahead of the expiration in April of a standstill agreement with partner LS Power, which has a significant stake in Dynegy.At that time, LS will have the option to sell its stake or try to buy more, if not all, of Dynegy.Private equity groups such as Texas Pacific, KKR, Blackstone or First Reserve might normally look at Dynegy as a potential investment, possibly in partnership with LS, industry sources said.But the constrained credit markets could make a deal incredibly difficult.“Everyone is running a process, with timing that couldn’t be worse,” one banker said.Dynegy said the company did not comment on “market rumours or speculation.”
6;CNP;Centerpoint Energy Inc;2008-11-02T23:02:21Z;Energy industry is running out of steam;;"The credit crisis has cut off much-needed financing for the US power sector, which equity investors have abandoned en masse, setting the stage for a string of mergers or bankruptcy filings.In the past month, two potential mergers have been announced: Warren Buffett’s bid on Constellation Energy and Exelon offered to take over NRG Energy. Analysts say Reliant Energy, Dynegy, Calpine, AES and Mirant are likely to be next on the list, with investors betting against them in both credit and equity markets.This is similar to the situation these companies found themselves in after Enron, when the US’s biggest unregulated energy trader collapsed in 2001, taking with it confidence in the entire sector. NRG and Mirant eventually sought bankruptcy protection. The others shed valuable assets and restructured to remain afloat.“This feels like 2001-2002 all over again,’’ said Mark T Williams, professor of finance and economics at Boston University. “It’s an environment exactly like what followed Enron; investors have lost confidence and the equity and debt markets have priced this in.’’Bruce Williamson, chief executive of Dynegy, said his company has $2bn of liquidity, including $855m cash, and no significant debt maturities due until 2011. Therefore, he says, the credit crisis should not affect the company.“Everybody has been lumped in together,’’ Mr Williamson said. Yet Dynegy, he said, has a steady cash stream, as it costs it about $25 a megawat hour to produce power and while prices peaked at about $85 per mwh, they are now only down to about $65 per mwh, which still leaves a healthy profit.“It’s important for investors to not take all power companies and lump them together,’’ Mr Williamson said. Yet Boston University’s Mr Williams said the bottom line is Dynegy’s share price is down to $2.5 and is conveying a lack of confidence, indicating suppliers, creditors, trade partners and bankers are positioning themselves to reduce their direct exposure.“The stock, if it remains under the cost of a cup of Starbucks coffee, Dynegy will not stay independent long,’’ Mr Williams said.Karl Miller, founder of MMC Energy and senior industry advisor, believes there will be widespread consolidation among the more than 250 mid- and large-size utilities and distribution companies in the US over the next 12 to 18 months.“People are not going to stop using electricity,’’ said Bill Holloran, a senior vice president at Day & Zimmermann, the largest power operations and maintenance firm in the country.That is why Mr Miller believes large pools of money will flow into the sector in the coming years to invest in the US’ ageing distribution infrastructure and much-needed new capacity. He said private capital will fill the gap developing from companies lack of access to public equity and debt markets, and to meet new energy and infrastructure needs, enabling deals to go through.“This will be a tremendous boom time for the healthy private equity/hedge funds and other private infrastructure funds that have the executive talent, execution capabilities to invest into the sector, consolidate weak energy companies and profit from the overall energy supply/demand deficit across all energy commodity products,’’ Mr Miller says.The key, he says, will be establishing a bona fide physical presence in the sector, with companies focused on managing risk, not just establishing a speculative trading desk as a proxy, which has led to the demise of many hedge funds and financial institutions in energy commodities, in both the crisis of confidence in the sector in 2001-2002 and this time around."

The Dow surged 233 points as jitters over the freeze in credit markets eased. A credit crisis sparked by problems in the subprime mortgage arena has led to severe problems for stock investors in recent weeks as they grappled with market volatility and engaged in a flight from risky assets.Although markets gave a warm welcome to the Fed’s action, many observers expect that uncertainty and credit concerns will continue to dog markets.“We’re pretty much in limbo now until the Fed’s next policy meeting on
September 18,” said Larry Peruzzi, senior equity trader at Boston Asset Management.Analysts at Merrill Lynch noted: “The short-term picture is cloudy and cannot be resolved without the passage of time and/or central bank action.”The persistence of worries over credit prompted a big increase in demand for Treasuries as investors sought safety in short-term havens while the immediate outlook for interest rates remains unclear.Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond fell 5 basis points to 4.64 per cent while yields on the heavily traded two-year Treasury bill fell 8 basis points to 4.11 per cent.In corporate news,Countrywide Financial , the US’s biggest mortgage lender – which lost almost 25 per cent of its share price last week – came under further pressure. The troubled mortgage giant, which last week was forced to draw on a $11.5bn credit line, ran full-page adverts in the US media yesterday saying it was “a well- capitalised federal savings bank with more than $100bn in assets” and that “the future is bright”. Traders were apparently unconvinced: the company’s stock fell 7.6 per cent to $19.81.Shares in KKR Financial, the affiliate of the leveraged buy-out firm, rose 8.6 per cent to $15.64 after it announced it was selling more than $500m in stock to investors including Farallon Capital Management, the hedge fund, and Morgan Stanley, in an attempt to shore up cash as the industry struggled.Thornburg Mortgage stock plunged 10.2 per cent to $13.50 after the company sold $20.5bn of its safest mortgage-backed bonds and said it will cost $930m to restructure its balance sheet, and Fitch cut its credit rating.Shares in Luminent Mortgage Capital, a REIT company that has struggled with liquidity problems because of mortgage investments, rocketed 33.3 per cent to $1 after it announced a bail-out by Arco Capital, a Puerto Rico-based holding company.The real estate investment trust’s share price plummeted this month after it suspended its quarterly dividend and said it received default notices for about $2.3bn of debt.SunTrust Banks stock was down 0.7 per cent to $79.92 after it announced it would cut more than 7 per cent of its total workforce by the end of next year.Lowe’s, the US’s second-largest home-improvement retailer, exceeded Wall Street expectations when it reported higher quarterly earnings before the opening bell, sending its shares 6.1 per cent higher to $28.50.The retailer said earnings grew by 9 per cent to 67 cents per share in the second quarter, ahead of analysts’ forecasts of about 61 cents per share.Tribune was in the news as the media company, which also owns the Chicago Cubs baseball team, was downgraded by Standard & Poor’s. Nevertheless, its shares moved 5.3 per cent higher to $27.02 as the move also signalled Sam Zell, the real estate magnate, was a step closer to completing his $8.2bn buy-out of the group.Stock in Nasdaq, the second-biggest US stock exchange, dropped by 0.7 per cent to $31.52 after its announcement that it would explore selling its 31 per cent stake in the London Stock Exchange to raise cash to cut debt.Shares in CenterPoint Energy, which owns the power-distribution network in Houston, rose 4.6 per cent to $16.70 after Citigroup upgraded the electricity and gas utility from “buy” to “hold.”The only economic report released yesterday was the leading economic indicators from the Conference Board, a private research group.The Conference Board composite index of leading economic indicators rose 0.4 per cent in July, after a 0.3 per cent loss in June and a 0.2 per cent rise in May."

Such minimum criteria filtered out most advisers.The FT then invited qualifying advisers out of this group — a list that totalled about 940 — to complete a short questionnaire that gave us more information about their practices.We added that information to our own research on the candidates, including data from regulatory filings.The formula the FT uses to grade advisers is based on six broad factors and calculates a numeric score for each adviserThese factors are:Assets under management can signal experience managing money and client trust.

AUM growth rate can be taken as a proxy for performance, asset retention and ability to generate new business.

Years of experience indicates experience of managing assets in different economic and interest-rate environments.

Compliance record provides evidence of past client disputes. A string of complaints could signal problems.Industry certifications (CFA, CFP, etc) demonstrate technical and industry knowledge and obtaining these designations shows a professional commitment to investment skills.Online accessibility illustrates commitment to providing investors with easy access and transparent contact information.Among the top factors in our scoring, assets under management accounted for an average of 70 per cent of each adviser’s score. Also, AUM growth rate (examined over a three-year period to June 30 2019, to emphasise long-term performance) accounted for an average of 18 per cent. The FT also places a cap on the number of advisers from any one state that corresponds to the distribution of millionaires across the US.We present the FT 400 as an elite group, not a competitive ranking. We acknowledge that ranking the industry’s top advisers from 1 to 400 would be futile, since each takes different approaches and has different specialisations.The research was conducted for the Financial Times by Ignites Research, a sister publication.Please note, individual advisers’ coverage of client categories is indicated below by “X” marks in columns for particular segments served: retail; high net worth (clients for $1m-£10m in investable assets); ultra high net worth (clients with $10m or more in investable assets); and institutional."

While some shareholders choose to cast their votes in person at shareholder meetings, most, including nearly all big institutional investors, cast their votes by proxy.The Securities and Exchange Commission, the US securities regulator, had long blocked shareholder access to proxy documents. That policy was reversed last year after a US appeals court supported a challenge to the rule by the American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees, a big institutional shareholder.Scott Adams of AFSCME, who spoke at the HP meeting in favour of giving shareholders proxy access, said the fact that 39 per cent of shareholders had voted for the measure had sent a “tremendous message”.“For 39 per cent of shareholders to say we want access to the ballot is a very strong message,” he said. “It is now in the SEC’s court to standardize the rules to give shareholders access to proxy ballots.”HP emerged as a target for governance reform last year after the company revealed that operatives working on behalf of the HP board had spied on board members, HP employees, journalists and their families to uncover the source of a boardroom leak.The scandal forced the resignation of Patricia Dunn, HP’s former chairman, and several other top officials. Ms Dunn and three others yesterday had felony charges over the scandal dismissed.Although HP managed to fend off the proxy access proposal, shareholders applauded the approval of two other measures that HP had opposed.One, a proposal to submit any future poison pill anti-takeover measure to a vote of shareholders, was approved by 72 per cent of stockholders who cast votes.An initiative to more tightly link executive pay to company performance passed by a vote of 53 per cent in favour to 45 per cent against, reflecting investor frustration at the large pay packages awarded to Mr Hurd when he joined HP, as well as the multi-million dollar severance package handed to his predecessor, Carly Fiorina, when she left the company two years ago.HP said it was disappointed the two measures had passed, but agreed to review its policies.Shareholders also rejected a proposal that would have forced the company to separate the roles of chairman and chief executive. Mr Hurd assumed the role of chairman in addition to his CEO duties after Ms Dunn resigned in September.HP’s shares have nearly doubled in value since Mr Hurd took over as chief executive in 2005. They rose 0.6 per cent on Wednesday to $39.79 ahead of the company’s annual shareholder meeting.

The world’s largest personal computer maker said that revenues for the quarter just ended would be below its previous forecast while earnings would be at the lower end of its guidance due to a weak US and UK market. Sentiment for the stock was further weakened following downgrades from UBS and Bear Stearns.Dell’s news hit sentiment across much of the technology sector, with Intel, the world’s largest chip maker, falling 3.6 per cent to $22.65. Meanwhile, Dell’s rivals traded mixed. Shares in Apple slipped 0.2 per cent to $57.50 while Hewlett-Packard rose 0.9 per cent to $28.28 amid reports it is to sell $400 laptop and destop computers through Wal-Mart.Shares in household products makers were also among the fallers. Procter & Gamble shed 1.3 per cent to $55.25 despite announcing better-than-expected figures. Third-quarter profit rose 4.5 per cent, with price increases and new products offsetting higher production and transportation costs.Colgate-Palmolive also slid 1.1 per cent to $52.36 even as results met forecasts while Johnson & Johnson closed 1.2 per cent lower to $61.90.Reliant Energy slid 25.1 per cent to $9.51 as the power provider swung into a loss due to unrealised energy derivatives and a $217m charge to settle a lawsuit.But Medco Health Solutions slid 11.9 per cent to $49.80 as the pharmacy benefits manager said 2006 earnings were likely to miss analyst estimates.Elsewhere, Computer Sciences rose 13.2 per cent to $58 on reports that military contractor Lockheed Martin and three private-equity firms are considering a $12bn, or $64-$65 a share, takeover bid for the technical services provider.

12;CNP;Centerpoint Energy Inc;2004-08-08T15:59:46Z;Risks and rewards of tying the knot;;There has been a lot of talk about the convergence of hedge funds and private equity. While many observers see the trend as natural evolution, others question the wisdom of bringing the two together.Convergence is nothing new. Hedge fund behemoth Caxton has a history of private equity investing via Caxton Iseman. Farallon, Tudor and Pequot, among others, have pursued active private equity investment programmes.Private equity firms have crossed over as well, including Bain Capital with its $3.9bn Brookside Capital fund and Blackstone with its fixed income arbitrage operation, Blackstone Bridge. Further, there are a number of hybrid structures, including distressed investing practised by firms such as Cerberus and the activist public equity investing plied by Eddie Lampert of ESL.There seems to be an acceleration of the trend. In recent months, Carlyle Group has launched its first hedge fund amid reports that others such as Apollo, KKR and Texas Pacific Group may follow suit. Nelson Peltz of Triarc last month acquired a controlling interest in fixed income hedge fund Deerfield. DE Shaw this year acquired FAO Schwarz out of bankruptcy. A July auction of assets by Centerpoint Energy found a consortium of hedge funds including Caxton, Cerberus, Perry Capital and Seneca bidding against traditional private equity players.It's easy to see why the grass would seem greener. Private equity managers are recovering from the bust in technology and telecommunications and are emerging from a period of largely sub-par returns and reduced fundraising.Although returns have been moderate for hedge fund managers, the industry is struggling to absorb a wave of institutional capital. As their markets look crowded and efficient, private markets, with attractive valuations and better supply-demand dynamics, look tempting.There are structural advantages. Hedge funds covet the 10-year capital and sticky pricing private equity funds enjoy. Private equity funds see open-ended hedge funds as a permanent source of capital that pays out returns every year, versus their serial-fundraising structure with its back-ended economics.Convergence sounds reasonable. The sectors share similar histories. Both trace their roots to the 1940s hedge funds to 1949 and Alfred Winslow Jones, and private equity to 1946 and General Georges Doriot's American Research and Development. Both followed evolutions from cottage industry serving the ultra-rich, to early institutionalisation via funds of funds and endowments and foundations and finally to mainstream institutionalisation. Both typically take the form of private, unregistered investment vehicles with an incentive fee structure.The similarities end there. Many pundits bristle at the notion of an “alternative asset class”, which is little more than the “other” category of investments. Skill sets in the two sectors are different and convergence may be a search for synergies that do not exist.Because of the trading orientation of most hedge funds, the typical manager was often someone who excelled at thinking tactically more than strategically. With many hedge fund traders pursuing a “ready, fire, aim” approach to trades they could easily reverse, some seem to suffer from attention deficit disorder. Private equity managers, on the other hand, tend to think strategically and to rely on longer-term, deeper fundamental analysis and domain knowledge.It is difficult to see where a hedge fund manager could add value to a private equity programme, beyond providing capital, which hardly seems in short supply. While private equity investors may bring fundamental knowledge and research ability, those talents would be of little use in a traditional hedge fund structure without the skill sets and resources to manage public market trading and risk.While there have been successes in combining the strategies, the evidence thus far is mixed. A decade ago, Dickstein Partners undertook a takeover of Hills Stores, only to see the company's fortunes decline, driving Hills into a distressed sale. Gotham Partners ran aground last year after the firm migrated from its value equity roots into an orientation towards private deals.Some of the best private equity firms have not fared much better. Boston-based ABRY Partners closed its Abricus fund within two years of failing to generate attractive returns. While industry titan Summit Partners has a successful hedge fund operation in Alydar, that partnership is itself a spin-out of Mt Everest, a successful Summit-sponsored hedge fund that closed its doors in 2002 in the face of a 20 per cent drawdown.Whether any of the spate of new private equity/hedge fund combinations fare much better remains to be seen.Jason Huemer is president of Synthesis Funds, a hedge fund seeding firm.
