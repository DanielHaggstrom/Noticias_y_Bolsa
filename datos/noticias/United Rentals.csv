0;URI;United Rentals;2016-07-21T08:26:33Z;Ashtead biggest FTSE 100 riser after US rival’s strong results;;"Ashtead, the UK equipment rental company that provides everything from scaffolding to lighting for concerts, is the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 on Thursday after its major US rival United Rentals significantly outperformed in the second quarter.The positive read-across from United Rentals has pushed Ashtead shares up to their highest levels in more than a year. The shares are up 4.7 per cent at publication time to £11.81.United Rentals yesterday reported “solid” customer activity on both the east and west coasts of the US which has helped to offset challenging conditions in Canada.Second quarter earnings per share, of $2.06, were much higher than forecast, beating analysts’ estimates of EPS of $1.82. Total revenue for the second quarter, of $1.42bn also surpassed forecasts of $1.39bn. United Rentals’ chief executive, Michael Kneeland, added:Based on what we saw through the mid-year, and what we
hear from the field, we continue to expect our business to improve both
seasonally and cyclically.Ashtead does 80 per cent of its business in the US so reports of robust activity across the Atlantic will raise hopes it has experienced a similar boost."
1;URI;United Rentals;2016-06-14T06:42:35Z;Ashtead raises dividend after 24% profit rise;;Equipment rental group Ashtead announced an increased dividend and a £200m share buyback scheme after higher margins helped it to a 24 per cent increase in full-year profits.The FTSE-100 company, which does 80 per cent of its business in the USA, reported a pre-tax profit of £617m for the year to April 30, on revenues of £2.55bn. Revenue growth of 19 per cent was slightly ahead of analyst analyst expectations.Ashtead chief executive Geoff Drabble said:We have seen a good seasonal upward trend in fleet on rent throughout the Spring which has continued into the new financial year. Our end markets remain strong, the structural drivers are still in place and we have a strong balance sheet which allows us to execute our plans responsibly. As a consequence, the Board continues to look to the medium term with confidence.The company said it expects to enter a phase of “both good earnings growth and significant free cash flow generation,” despite a recent slowdown in private construction and lower prices hitting US companies such as United Rentals, and difficulties at UK rivals HSS and Speedy Hire.
2;URI;United Rentals;2016-01-28T09:45:13Z;Ashtead shares slide 7% amid US fears;;Shares in tool hire group Ashtead have dropped 7 per cent to the bottom of the FTSE 100 this morning after one of its US rivals reported some weak earnings over night.US tool hire rival United Rentals saw its fourth quarter revenues drop 3 per cent to $1.52bn and adopted a cautious tone for 2016.Although Ashtead is listed in London, the bulk of its sales come from its US arm, Sunbelt.Ashtead shares have dropped 19 per cent so far in 2016, outstripping a 4 per cent drop in the FTSE 100.
3;URI;United Rentals;2016-01-20T18:20:28Z;LBO finance: a painful truth;Carlyle’s renegotiation of the Veritas deal recalls the 2007 financing freeze;At the outset of the financial crisis, the prevailing view was that the concern for reputation at banks and private equity firms would force them to complete signed acquisitions, even as the financing market melted down and asset values tumbled. In fact, it was the dealmakers’ reputation for avoiding losses that was protected.In a series of leveraged buyouts — Sallie Mae, United Rentals, HD Supply — private equity firms and banks walked away or renegotiated terms between signing and closing the deal. Corporate lawyers are thought to have wised up to such manoeuvres. Yet, as credit has tightened for the first time since 2009, the Masters of the Universe are up to their old tricks.Late on Monday, Carlyle Group announced it would lower its purchase price for software maker Veritas by $600m. In August, in the biggest LBO of 2015, the private equity titan had agreed to pay $8bn. But for months, the financing banks, led by Bank of America and Morgan Stanley, have struggled to find takers for the loan and bonds.In order to drum up interest, the banks reduced the amount of debt they were trying to offload by nearly $1bn. They also raised the interest rate offered on the loan piece of the package to over 7 per cent, a point more than the original plan.Merger contracts call for more biting break-up fees today — the 6 per cent to 7 per cent that is now standard is twice the pre-crisis convention. Also, so-called “specific performance” clauses can force buyers and banks to close the deal on the original terms. But for Veritas’s owner, Symantec Corp, a $520m termination fee or a court fight was not worth more than $7bn in the hand and freedom from an unwanted unit.LBO deal volume and leverage are well below the levels of 2005-2007. Still, for big fees, banks have been willing to bet their balance sheets on expensive-looking deals. Their reputation for short-sightedness remains intact.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
4;URI;United Rentals;2015-10-22T16:38:19Z;Signs of slowdown for builders’ suppliers;Lower guidance from Travis Perkins and SIG weighs on sector;Conflicting signals from the property market on Thursday allowed creeping doubts about the strength of the UK economic recovery to keep London’s mid-cap stock index subdued as guidance from two builders’ merchants disappointed.But while shares in Travis Perkins and SIG sank, gains for Zoopla Property Group and construction plant hire firm Ashtead Group offered an opposing view on the housing market.Travis Perkins, which also owns the Wickes DIY chain, fell 6 per cent to £18.48 — the biggest FTSE 100 faller. The company said its full-year earnings would be at the lower end of forecasts after demand in its core repair, maintenance and improvement market was weaker than expected in the third quarter.“It is always worth listening to what Travis Perkins says about housing market activity and the trading outlook, so today’s warning will unsettle investors,” said Nicholas Bubb at Langdon Capital.SIG, meanwhile, reduced its profit guidance for the full year, saying conditions in its main markets deteriorated in the second half — particularly in France. Its shares fell 20.7 per cent to 141.1p.Home Retail Group, which issued a profit warning on Wednesday, fell 4.8 per cent to 120p after a number of target price downgrades. The company, which operates the Homebase and Argos chains, reported a tough first six months for the Argos catalogue order business, while the DIY chain fared better.Kingfisher, which owns rival DIY chain B&Q, fell 4.2 per cent to 351.1p, while plumbing supplies group Wolseley fell 1.9 per cent to £37.30.Mid-cap estate agent Foxtons reported that rising prices and higher stamp duty weighed on the number of transactions it completed during the first nine months, hitting its commission on sales.The shares fell 8.4 per cent to 203.5p as the company, whose main focus is the high end of the London housing market, outlined plans to move into the faster growing suburban areas of the capital.A trading update from Zoopla Property Group hinted at a more buoyant market, in which the company forecast a 21 per cent rise in full-year core earnings and reported growth in agency membership.Some analysts, however, suggested that earnings growth this year had been driven by the company’s acquisition of comparison group uSwitch. Shares jumped 11 per cent to 260.5p and to the top of the FTSE 250.Construction plant hire company Ashtead Group showed no sign of buckling under potential housing market weakness. The company’s shares gained 3.9 per cent to 987.3p after its US rival United Rentals reaffirmed its full-year guidance.The mid-cap index — more geared towards stocks that operate in domestic markets and therefore a better guide to investors’ opinions on the UK economy — underperformed, ticking fractionally higher to 17,044.54. The blue-chip FTSE 100 climbed 0.4 per cent to 6,376.28, supported by heavyweights like Vodafone and Admiral, and the mining sector — top gainer, Glencore, up 5.9 per cent to 117.2p.
5;URI;United Rentals;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Ashtead shares jump as construction recovery fuels profit;Tool hire group fares better than rivals, and benefits from growth at Sunbelt, its US business;The recovery in the US and UK construction markets helped tool hire specialist Ashtead nail down a record quarterly profit, as it shrugged off concerns surrounding some of its rivals.The FTSE 100 company, which leases out items ranging from hydraulic drills to patio heaters, reported pre-tax profit of £155.4m for its first quarter, up 23 per cent compared with the same period last year. Ashtead’s shares rose almost 7 per cent to 989p.The company’s revenue and profit growth came mainly through Sunbelt, its North American business, which generates the bulk of its sales. Sunbelt saw first-quarter equipment rental revenue rise 23 per cent.London-listed tool hire companies Speedy Hire and HSS Hire — neither of which have US businesses — both issued profit warnings this summer, with the former blaming internal failings and the latter pointing to a slower than expected recovery in the UK housing market.Geoff Drabble, Ashtead’s chief executive, said its strong performance was down to its broad mix of customers, increased sales in existing stores and two small bolt-on acquisitions — and took a dig at some of his struggling competitors.“Our results are somewhat at odds with some of our larger peers, who have gone too far into one market,” said Mr Drabble. “We deliberately try to have lots of fingers in lots of pies.”He added that Ashtead was capable of doubling its market shares in the US and UK. These currently stand at 7 per cent and 6 per cent respectively, and Ashtead is the second-largest tool hire group in both countries.Ashtead reported revenue of £618.6m for the three months to the end of July, up 26 per cent compared with one year ago.Analysts at Stifel said Ashtead was “on a long incline of strong end market growth in both the US and UK”.Kevin Fogarty, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, said the results gave reassurance to investors.“They show that any downward revisions of earnings — which the share price has been pricing in — aren’t justified and we are seeing a relief rally,” he added.In spite of record annual profit announced in June, Ashtead’s share price is down almost 15 per cent this calendar year, compared with a 6 per cent drop in the FTSE 100 index. This is partly due to the gloom hanging over some of its competitors.Fears over the impact of the crude price slump, in addition to recent cautious comments by United Rentals, Ashtead’s bigger US rival, have also contributed to bearish sentiments, according to analysts.Mr Drabble said this was overblown as Ashtead had lowered its exposure to the oil and gas sector from 5 per cent to 3 per cent of revenue, with 46 per cent of sales coming from construction.
6;URI;United Rentals;2015-07-03T23:37:21Z;Ashtead: sharpest tool in the box;The group’s US exposure means it deserves its premium to UK-focused rivals;"Doing a spot of DIY this weekend? Britain’s tool hire companies would certainly like more people to hire floor sanders and tile cutters. Two of them, HSS Hire and Speedy Hire, issued profit warnings this week, and Speedy parted company with its chief executive too. Their fortunes contrast sharply with those of Ashtead. Its results for the year to April 30 beat forecasts and the company raised its final dividend by a third.So what does Ashtead have that the other two do not? Scale is one factor; its sales are almost three times those of HSS and Speedy combined. But the source of those revenues matters more. Over 80 per cent, and about 95 per cent of operating profit, comes from Sunbelt, the company’s US operation. The US market is less fragmented. That means more pricing power and better profitability; Sunbelt’s operating margin is 30 per cent compared to 14 per cent for A-Plant, Ashtead’s UK unit. The group’s return on capital is more than twice that of its two rivals.Most of all though, it is the economic cycle, which picked up earlier in the US than in the UK. Plant hire entails borrowing money to buy equipment, keeping it heavily utilised and reinvesting the cash flow in more kit. The business model works like a dream when construction is buoyant — which is why Ashtead’s shares have risen 1,000 per cent over the past five years.Over-investing at the wrong point in the cycle can be calamitous. Ashtead knows that feeling — having scrambled to deleverage seven years ago — and although capital expenditure is still over £1bn each year, it intends to keep net debt at less than twice earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation. That compares to over three times ebitda in 2007.Not surprisingly, Ashtead’s shares command a premium over its peers (including US rival United Rentals, whose returns are lower). That looks deserved — at least until the cycle turns.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com"
7;URI;United Rentals;2015-06-16T17:22:22Z;United Rentals lags behind S&P 500 on downgrade;Gap rallies after retailer announces 175 store closures and staff cuts;United Rentals came under pressure on Tuesday as the decline in oil and gas prices since the summer sparked an analyst warning over the company’s expectations for 2015 and 2016.The supplier of rental industrial and construction equipment was the worst-performing stock early in the day on the S&P 500 after analysts at Macquarie downgraded it to “underperform” from “neutral” and maintained a $80 price target. By close, Humana had taken the top spot with a 3.38 per cent fall.Shares of United Rentals, which have declined almost 16 per cent in the past year, fell more than 3 per cent to $87.93 in morning trading. The stock recovered to close at $88.79.The Stamford, Connecticut company is expected to experience lower levels of activity in the future, but projects under construction will continue in the near term, said Sameer Rathod, an analyst at Macquarie.United Rentals lowered its 2015 rental rate to 3 per cent, from its previous outlook for a 3.5 per cent year-on-year increase in April and maintained its utilisation rate, a measure of the time that equipment is rented, at 69 per cent.Mr Rathod said several engineering and construction companies have noted delays in projects in response to the decline in oil prices, which could hurt demand as projects wrap up and no new work begins. In turn he expects the company will have to cut its rental rate and utilisation guidance in the second or third quarter.Gap shares advanced 1.44 per cent to $38.75 after the retailer announced late on Monday that it would close about 175 of its namesake stores in North America over the next few years as it seeks to boost profitability at its Gap brand.About 140 of the closures are expected this fiscal year and will not affect Gap Outlet and Gap Factory stores. Gap also plans to shut some of its European stores.The San Francisco company said it would also cut staff by 250 at its headquarters, primarily in North America.Gap said it expected to save $25m a year starting in 2016 from the restructuring, although the store closures are projected to cut $300m from sales. It reaffirmed its full-year outlook for earnings to range between $2.75 and $2.80 a share.Under Armour shares advanced nearly 2 per cent to $82.78, after the retailer said it would create a new class of stock in an attempt to maintain the influence of Kevin Plank, its founder and chief executive.Shares of Aerie Pharmaceuticals jumped 50.3 per cent to $19.94 after the US Food and Drug Administration allowed the company to shift the goalposts in a trial to test its Rhopressa eyedrop.The stock was also buoyed after analysts at Needham upgraded it to “buy” from “hold” with a $27 price target.US stocks edged higher as Federal Reserve policy makers began a two-day monetary policy setting meeting on Tuesday.By close of trading on Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose 0.57 per cent to 2,096.37, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6 per cent to 17,903.98.

• 4CAST Economic CalendarDiary commentary from FT reporters; data and company announcements, unless otherwise stated, from Thomson Reuters. Company announcements are of information publicly available before last week.When Majestic Wine bought Naked Wines in April for £70m in cash and shares, it not only acquired a fast-growing online business, but also Rowan Gormley, its founder, and now boss of the combined group.Mr Gormley will lay out his plans for Majestic Wine and the market will be looking for signs his expertise in online retailing can help revitalise the struggling chain of 210 wine shops.Pressure from discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl has squeezed Majestic, which was forced to cut prices during the tough Christmas trading period, hitting margins. It has also been trying to fend off Waitrose at the upper end of the market.Former chief executive Steve Lewis stepped down in February, a month after shares dropped 17 per cent in a single day in January following downgrades to market forecasts.Analysts will be looking for Mr Gormley to ask tough questions about Majestic’s store target of 330 sites, its pricing and its minimum purchase policy, which requires customers to buy at least six bottles in-store.

Majestic Wine FY 25.73p (26.60p)The ground keeps shifting for Ashtead, the British group that rents construction equipment mainly to businesses in the US, as it reports full-year results.In March it raised its full-year financial forecasts amid balmy conditions in the UK and US construction markets. But twice last month the group, which rents out diggers, cherry pickers and generators, tumbled to the bottom of the FTSE 100 after United Rentals, a US rival, talked down activity in the sector given the drop in demand from oil and gas customers.Ashtead, which has a market capitalisation of £5.7bn, rebounded, proving that it still had the support of the City. A clutch of analysts have reiterated “buy” ratings for the stock, pointing to the group’s aggressive growth strategy as it looks to increase its clout in the sector.Its American business, Sunbelt, provides more than 90 per cent of group profit and the shares are valued for growth because the US has been slower to adopt equipment rental than mature markets such as the UK and Japan.

Ashtead FY 61.75p (46.30p)When FedEx, the express parcel-delivery service, reports results for the year to May 31, it will be under pressure to show that it is managing to grow while keeping costs and capacity under control.Careful management of its costs has enabled it over the past year to beat analysts’ expectations repeatedly while also avoiding some of the operational problems that have befallen UPS, its larger rival. UPS suffered severe congestion in much of its network over Christmas 2013 after underestimating traffic levels. It then overspent the following Christmas after overestimating traffic.FedEx continued its cost-cutting efforts on June 1 when it announced that it was accelerating the retirement of 15 fuel-hungry aircraft.Analysts forecast net income adjusted for one-off items up 1.6 per cent to $2.57bn, on revenue 4.6 per cent higher at $47.7bn. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to rise 2.4 per cent to $8.93.In common with other logistics companies, FedEx faces upheaval as its business shifts towards deliveries of ecommerce purchases to homes. Express parcel services previously concentrated on handling larger bundles of packages to business addresses, which are easier to serve. The shift has encouraged a move away from higher-value, fast services and towards slower deliveries, often by ground.Although FedEx remains smaller in most markets than UPS, it is set to grow significantly in Europe and some other important geographies if its planned €4.4bn takeover of the Netherlands’ TNT Express, announced in April, goes through. FedEx, which has only a 5 per cent share in the European market, is expected to face far fewer barriers to buying TNT — which has 12 per cent of the European market — than UPS did to its €5.4bn bid for the company in 2012.UPS, which has 16 per cent of the European market, abandoned its offer because of opposition by European competition regulators.
Robert Wright● The strong US dollar is likely to have hit results at Oracle hard, with lower revenues expected.Last year the currency impact weighed heavily on the US business software company, but it is expected to take an even bigger toll in the all-important fiscal fourth quarter to the end of May, when it typically records its strongest sales.Oracle has set a modest target for the quarter, with revenues growing between 1 per cent and 6 per cent in constant-currency terms.With overall results under pressure, Oracle executives are expected to direct the spotlight again on the small but fast-growing cloud business, a focus of recent earnings announcements though still representing less than 6 per cent of revenues.Disappointing quarterly results two weeks ago from Workday, a human resources company, were seen on Wall Street as a sign that Oracle had intensified cloud business competition.Analysts expect the group to report lower sales than a year ago, with revenues of $11bn, from $11.3bn last time. Pro-forma earnings per share are expected to be 87 cents, down from 92 cents.
Richard Waters● Betfair’s full-year results will serve to cement the online betting exchange’s position as the frontrunner in the gambling industry after a strong 12 months during which its shares have more than doubled in value.Analysts are expecting the company to report strong revenue growth of 20 per cent to £472.2m and an even bigger rise in pre-tax profits, which are forecast to grow 49 per cent to £91.5m, according to consensus estimates from Bloomberg.The high expectations come despite the absence of a World Cup this year and the introduction of regulations, in particular a point-of-consumption tax in December, which means gambling companies have to pay duty on bets placed by UK customers even if they are booked overseas.Betfair, which floated at a £1.3bn valuation in 2010, has spent much of its time as a public company beneath its float price of £13.The shares, which finally came back up above water in November last year, were boosted by a profit upgrade in March and are trading at more than £25.However, analysts at Numis warned this month that the share price had “got ahead of itself”, arguing that because of competition in the online gambling space Betfair deserved a lower rating and share price of £21.

10;URI;United Rentals;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Ashtead: memories for hire;All is sparkling now, but don’t forget what went before;How easy it is to forget 2003. Easy even, when things are going this well, to forget 2008. Grisly memories can be quickly suppressed by the brightness of the present. Ashtead might operate in the gritty business of hiring out construction equipment, but its results are sparkling. First-half revenues rose 16 per cent and earnings per share were up over a quarter, as the company enjoys the recovery in the US (home to most of its business) and takes market share. The shares, already up 42 per cent this year, rose another 10 per cent on Wednesday.But dust off the history books and remember how badly wrong things have gone for Ashtead in the past. In a calamitous 2003 the shares slipped from 23p in January to 3p in March, because of a US downturn, accounting problems and a default on debt covenants. In 2008, the shares fell from 83p at the start of the year to 29p in December, as the economy soured.To dive into the shares now is to be confident that the company is well positioned next time life gets tough. Ashtead’s end markets are inherently cyclical. When people stop building they stop renting diggers, forklifts and hydraulic rock splitters. The company’s protection from the worst of this comes in two forms. First, it keeps its kit up to date, giving itself an advantage over rivals who cannot afford to. Capital spending will rise from £741m last year to about £950m this year as Ashtead expands and renews its equipment. Second, Ashtead keeps its balance sheet strong. Net debt is a comfortable two times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.A valuation of 16 times next year’s earnings — a premium to rivalUnited Rentals on 13 — suggests comfort with the strategy. And given the sunny US outlook, that valuation does not look stretching. But watch the cash flow and watch the balance sheet. That George Santayana line about those forgetting the past being condemned to repeat it may be overused. But it is overused for a reason.Email the Lex team at lex@ft.com
11;URI;United Rentals;2014-03-18T18:52:24Z;United Rentals: driving force;Can Hertz replicate the performance of US market leader?;Pile on enough pressure, and eventually something cracks. Hertz shareholders have been telling the auto rental company to break itself up and finally it has agreed to do so, with plans to spin off its equipment rental business. The question now is whether the separated unit can replicate the performance of the US market leader United Rentals.United endured an aborted leveraged buyout in 2007 only to thrive as the economy recovered. But as with any capital heavy enterprise, shareholder returns are driven by productivity gains.It is a good time to be hiring out equipment in the US. The main end market – US non-residential construction – while still off its 2008 peak has recovered from the 2011 trough. More importantly, renting lifting gear and earth movers rather than buying them has become more popular as contractors want to keep their costs variable. Equipment rental spend is to hit $38bn in 2014 according to research firm IHS, the same as the peak in 2007 and 2008.United Rental, with a fleet value of $8bn, has a US market share of 12 per cent (Hertz and the UK’s Ashtead have 5 per cent). Operating cash flow is high with margins approaching 50 per cent. However, additions to the fleet in 2014 will cost $1.6bn, a hefty third of revenue. With such big outlays, the key metric is time utilisation rate – how often a piece of equipment is rented out. United’s rate in 2014 is expected to reach 70 per cent which is slightly ahead of Hertz’s.Ultimately, time utilisation must translate into return on invested capital. United Rental’s 7 per cent ROIC in recent quarters has trailed that of Ashtead, which exceeds 10 per cent according to Jefferies. Unsurprisingly, Ashtead’s cash flow multiple has consistently beaten United’s by a quarter. With earnings already expected to keep growing above 20 per cent annually, United shareholders may not quibble with a few points of ROIC. But if the company can squeeze some gains, there is even more upside for what already has been a great success story.Email the Lex team in confidence at lex@ft.com
12;URI;United Rentals;2014-03-10T20:54:26Z;Facebook gains on analyst optimism;US equities drift lower on weak economic data out of China;Facebook climbed on Monday as analysts at UBS raised their price target on the world’s largest social networking site to $90, the highest so far from an investment bank.UBS’s optimism comes from signs, the analysts say, that Facebook has the muscle to increase its advertising rates, including a recent deal signed with advertising agency Omnicom worth as much as $100m.“Our first-quarter advertiser channel checks suggest that the pricing strength exhibited in Q4, up 92 per cent year on year, price per ad, has carried over into early 2014 and is likely sustainable for longer than our prior estimates had assumed,” UBS analyst Eric Sheridan said.Shares in Facebook, which tumbled in the months after its botched IPO in May 2012, have surged 30 per cent this year and Wall Street has warmed to the company. Today, more than eight in 10 analysts rate Facebook with a buy rating, compared with roughly half one year ago.The company now generates most of its advertising revenue from ads on mobile phones. Rivals such as Yahoo’s Tumblr have adopted its format of showing ads in user news feeds.Mr Sheridan said shares could go as high as $112 in the next year on “faster than expected advertiser acceptance” of new commercial formats, including video and Instagram-centred ads.“In particular, we note the improved quality of advertisers and increased frequency of higher CPM formats – mobile app ads in particular – within the existing ad load,” he said.Facebook shares rose 3.2 per cent by the close to $72.03, a fresh record high.Boeing shares were under pressure on Monday after the company revealed that cracks had developed on the wings of some 787 planes in production.The aircraft maker said the cracks had not been found in planes in service and posed no risk to passengers. Boeing executives did not believe the setback would keep it from delivering 110 of the aircraft this year.Analysts at Jefferies said it was not a “major issue” for Boeing and would not affect the company’s profitability.“The issues are fully understood and can easily be tested . . . The part at issue is in the larger area of the wing and so is easy to access,” Jefferies’ Howard Rubel said.Shares fell 1.3 per cent to $126.89.United Rentals, the largest US equipment rental company, announced it would purchase National Pump for $780m, sending shares 3.8 per cent higher to $91.82.The deal is United Rental’s first move into the industrial pump rental market as oil and chemical companies intensify their focus on harnessing US shale reserves.National Pump, which was founded in 2007, generates half of its sales from upstream oil and gas customers.“This transaction is an important step in our strategy to create a company that delivers strong financial returns through the cycle,” chief executive Michael Kneeland said.Cliffs Natural Resources shares dipped on Monday after it said it had entered talks with Casablanca Capital, the investment firm seeking to replace much of the Cliffs Natural board.Casablanca, which owns 5 per cent of the mining company, nominated six members to the company’s board of directors. Cliffs Natural agreed to delay its annual general meeting originally set for May as it attempts to settle with Casablanca.Shares in Cliffs Natural fell 3.7 per cent to $17.95, taking its losses since the year began to 32 per cent.Overall, US equity markets drifted lower as investors digested somewhat weak economic data out of China that showed lower than expected loan growth and the largest monthly trade deficit since 2012.The S&P 500 nudged down to 1,877.17 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.2 per cent to 16,418.68. The technology heavy Nasdaq Composite fell slightly to 4,334.45.
13;URI;United Rentals;2012-09-04T15:32:20Z;Ashtead results prove just the drill;;Shares in Ashtead rose more than 10 per cent on Tuesday as the trend among budget-conscious US builders to hire rather than buy their power tools pushed the equipment rental group’s first-quarter figures past analysts’ expectations.The FTSE 250 company, which earns almost 85 per cent of revenues from its US business Sunbelt, said that its $500m debt refinancing had enabled it to keep its portfolio of rental equipment relatively new – something that its smaller competitors struggled to achieve during the downturn.“Our customers are using rental equipment more because there is still uncertainty of demand and there is still a credit gap,” Geoff Drabble, chief executive, told the Financial Times.“That credit gap in financial markets is probably the biggest competitive advantage that we have at the moment.”Ashtead has benefited from a “structural shift” towards rentals in a US construction sector in the midst of a nascent recovery – conditions that have left builders reluctant to invest in their own equipment.In the three months to July 31 revenues rose to £325m, compared with £268.6m in the same period last year.Pre-tax profit growth was held back by £18m in costs relating to its $500m debt refinancing, as well as a £7.4m fair value charge.On an underlying basis that excluded the one-off charges, pre-tax profit rose 76 per cent to £61.4m, beating analysts’ consensus expectations of £45m. Earnings per share rose from 4.2p to 4.5p.“The strong momentum seen in the first quarter continued into August. At the same time management has completed a debt swap that will reduce interest costs by £8m per year,” said James Gilbert at Canaccord Genuity, who raised his 2013 full year pre-tax profit expectations from £164m to £185m.However, trading was more muted at A-Plant, Ashtead’s UK business, with first-quarter revenues increasing 7.8 per cent year-on-year to £49.7m.“It’s a lot tougher in the UK,” said Mr Drabble. It’s certainly not getting any better and there is still room for it to get a bit worse. I don’t think that we have yet seen the full impact of government cuts.”Ashtead shares rose 11.4 per cent to 314.7p in late afternoon trading.FT CommentYou know a company’s shares are in fashion when they have risen by 174 per cent over the past 12 months. Such is the case with Ashtead, which has ridden the wave of austerity by renting out expensive equipment to hard-pressed US builders. The group’s recent move to renegotiate its debt – at an average interest rate of 4.5 per cent over 10 years – is a sound move, especially considering that its return on capital from rentals is 20 per cent. Trading at a forward price/earnings ratio of 14.7, the shares are pricier than US rival United Rentals on 10 but still a sound investment.
14;URI;United Rentals;2012-08-23T17:30:26Z;US junk bond sales hit $220bn;;A combination of historically low borrowing costs and investor appetite for securities offering higher returns than US Treasuries has pushed year-to-date sales of corporate junk-rated debt to the second-highest level on record.Companies with credit ratings below investment grade, including CIT Group, Schaeffler Technologies and United Rentals, have sold a combined $220bn of debt so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters data. The amount is slightly below the record $235bn sold in the same period of 2011.August has been a particularly strong month, with companies rushing to sell almost $30bn of debt ahead of a slowdown in capital markets activity as the summer holiday season wraps up in the US.Sales have already dropped sharply this week, with only one offer by VWR Funding, worth $750m, taking place as of Wednesday, according to Dealogic.Analysts and investors said that after a strong rally pushed yields on junk-rated debt near a record low, issuance may be heading for a slowdown. Furthermore, some large corporate debt managers have been paring their bets on the bonds, in a sign the rally may be showing signs of fatigue. This week, Mark Kiesel, head of corporate credit for Pimco, said he had reduced exposure to high-yield debt since July as prices have soared. High-yield bonds now account for about 8 per cent of Pimco’s corporate debt portfolios, down from a typical 12 per cent allocation.The average yield on junk-rated debt has approached the all-time low of 6.61 per cent set in May 2011. On Wednesday, the average yield for the Barclays High Yield Index stood at 6.78 per cent. Meanwhile, returns on high-yield bonds have exceeded 10 per cent this year, compared with an aggregate of 1.65 per cent for US Treasuries.While business-lender CIT Group is the largest single borrower this year, with US$9.8bn in sales, European companies also took advantage of low rates and accounted for more than 16 per cent of total sales, Thomson Reuters said.
15;URI;United Rentals;2011-12-19T20:40:30Z;National Grid hit by London fears of dividend cut;;Fears of a dividend cut forced National Grid lower as the wider London market drifted.The risk of unfavourable UK price control reviews next year led Deutsche Bank to downgrade National Grid to “sell”.The broker was worried that regulator Ofgem would set cost allowances for National Grid’s gas distribution business that would be tough to meet.Moreover, it feared that a change in the law allowing energy retailers and consumer groups to appeal Ofgem’s decision increased the risk of the ruling being referred to the Competition Commission.A referral would mean National Grid investors had little visibility on the dividend policy or capital structure until the second half of 2013, Deutsche said.It forecast National Grid to cut its dividend by 15 per cent from 2013 to preserve capital.Deutsche set a 565p target price on National Grid shares, which ended weaker by 1 per cent at 607½p.The wider market ended lower for a second day with the FTSE 100 down 0.4 per cent, or 22.35 points, to 5,364.99.

Vedanta Resourceswas off 3.6 per cent to £10.46 and Tullow Oil lost 2.3 per cent to £12.99.But oil explorer Afren gained 7.2 per cent to 84p on takeover talk.The rumours followed speculation in the weekend press that Gulf Keystone Petroleum, Afren’s neighbour in Kurdistan, might be a bid target for ExxonMobil.Aim-listed GKP, which had traded as high as 219¾p intraday, closed up 7.7 per cent at 178¼p after the group said it was not in talks with potential buyers.Aggreko rose 1.7 per cent to £18.48 after a trading update reassured with the generator hire group reporting a strong start to its new financial year.Ashtead gained a further 1.9 per cent to 213½p in the wake of Friday’s news that United Rentals, its main US rival, was buying fellow equipment hire group RSC for $1.9bn.“The enlarged United Rentals business will likely close depots and shed staff,” said UBS. “Any depot closures in the rental industry drive some revenue leakage. As the next largest player, Ashtead should benefit. It also removes risk of capital expenditure overspend given United Rentals will be highly leveraged.”Mitchells & Butlers was up 1.7 per cent to 233¼p after Joe Lewis, the currency trader, raised his stake in the pub operator to 25.65 per cent. Mr Lewis abandoned a bid for M&B in October, having had a 230p offer rejected.Bellway fell 2.2 per cent to 699p as valuation concerns led Goldman Sachs to cut the housebuilder from its “buy” list.A profit warning sent Ocado sliding 16.9 per cent to 59¼p. The grocery delivery group blamed capacity constraints, forcing it to add labour, though it also reported a shrinking average order size.“The quantum of the slowdown in sales is eye-watering,” said Oriel Securities. “The grim reality is that Ocado is unlikely to turn a profit before tax this year or next as sales growth falls and cost ratios move in the wrong direction.”Other retailers were under pressure after HMV, down 25.1 per cent to 2.9p, reported a further deterioration in sales. Dixons Retaillost 3.1 per cent to 9.7p.Among small caps, 888 Holdings added 4.3 per cent to 36½p after the online casino said its 2011 operating earnings would be significantly ahead of market expectations. 888 also indicated that it would reinstate a dividend next year if trading remained strong.Tottenham Hotspur, which is due to delist from Aim next month, was in focus after Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft disclosed a 3 per cent stake.

16;URI;United Rentals;2011-12-16T16:52:31Z;US M&A activity defies European headwinds;;US companies and private equity groups struck deals in sectors ranging from industrial rentals to communications equipment, underlining that mergers and acquisitions activity is continuing even as the European market remains paralysed by worries over the sovereign debt crisis.United Rentals said on Friday it would buy RSC, an equipment rental company, for about $1.9bn in cash and stock, or about $18 a share – a 58 per cent premium to RSC’s last closing price.Crown Castle, the wireless infrastructure group, has agreed to pay $1bn in cash for NextG Networks, a provider of outdoor antenna systems, from a group of investors led by Madison Dearborn, which bought the company in 2009.Meanwhile, Valeant, the acquisitive speciality pharmaceutical group, made public its interest in eyecare specialist ISTA Pharmaceuticals, offering $6.50 a share in cash, or about $314m, for the company having been repeatedly been rebuffed in private discussions.The flurry of small deals suggests that, while activity in Europe remains subdued, US groups are – for now – pressing ahead with some of their plans for mergers and acquisitions.“There is no doubt that in an environment of slowing top line growth and headwinds from Europe we are seeing US companies with large cash balances or access to low-cost debt using acquisitions to drive performance into 2012,” said Larry Hamdan, executive chairman of global M&A at Barclays Capital.“Where a domestic transaction has clear strategic merit, CEOs and boards have confidence that in the medium term deals can make their business stronger, even if there are short-term bumps in the road,” he added.“We view this as an opportunity,” Mike Pearson, the chief executive of Valeant, told the Financial Times of the current environment. “We think our strategy is sound. Continuing to march forward, trying to create value for our shareholders, we believe, looking back in two years' time, will have been the intelligent thing to do.”Valeant has been looking for chances to expand its ophthalmology platform since the purchase of Aton Pharma in 2010, and is offering a premium of 67 per cent to ISTA’s last closing price.ISTA’s board rejected the offer but said that it would commence a strategic review of its options.M&A activity slowed this year, after a strong first quarter, as the European crisis gathered pace. As of earlier this week, European volumes were 5 per cent below the same period last year, while US dealmaking was up 15 per cent, according to Mergermarket.Private equity groups also struck deals with each other on Friday, as they sought to exit past investments and deploy their cash in a difficult market.Carlyle agreed to sell Diversified Machine, a car parts maker, to Platinum Equity for an undisclosed sum. Meanwhile, CVC Capital Partners, the European buy-out group, announced the sale of its majority stake in Taminco, a chemicals company, to Apollo Global Management, the listed US private equity group.Apollo also boosted its loan business by acquiring Stone Tower Capital, a US credit group with $17bn assets under management.The deal, announced on Friday, is set to increase Apollo’s assets under management in its credit unit to $39bn, almost half of its overall assets and turning it into the group’s largest business segment.The move underlines how private equity groups are rushing into credit markets as they look to fill the gaps left by retrenching banks and specialised credit vehicles, so-called collateral loan obligations.Apollo did not disclose the deal’s value but people close to the situation said the transaction size was in the range of several hundred million dollars.
17;URI;United Rentals;2011-12-08T17:21:07Z;US shift to equipment rental boosts Ashtead;;Hard-pressed US builders deciding to rent rather than buy their power tools helped Ashtead to report a more than threefold increase in profits for the first half.The FTSE 250 equipment rental company, which does 80 per cent of its business in the US, said it had benefited from a “structural shift” towards rentals as a weakened construction sector has left companies reluctant to invest in their own equipment.The group said it also gained market share as tight credit conditions made it difficult for smaller rental companies to renew their fleets of diggers and power tools. Ashtead, which is the second biggest company in the sector by revenue, felt confident enough during the period to make a number of small US acquisitions.Revenues climbed 19 per cent to £575.5m in the six months to 31 October while pre-tax profits rose from £23.6m to £82.9m.The results were sharply ahead of analysts expectations. Some raised their full-year pre-tax profits forecasts by as much as 30 per cent to £102m on the news. Analysts forecasts were also lifted earlier in the year after first quarter results.“Market share gains, the ongoing structural shift to rental in the US and operational efficiency meant we delivered a very strong performance across a broad range of metrics despite end construction markets being at a cyclical low point,” said Geoff Drabble, Ashtead’s chief executive.Earnings per share for the half-year grew from 3p to 10.3p while the interim dividend was raised by 7.5 per cent to 1p a share. Shares in the company rose 13 per cent to 210p.The strongest growth in the period came from Ashtead’s US business, with operating profits at its 359 Sunbelt outlets rising 67 per cent to £107.8m. Operating margins at the US division climbed from 16 per cent to 22 per cent, benefiting from the aggressive cost-cutting programme enacted since the recession.The group had net debt of £889m at the end of October, up from £777m a year earlier as it bought more diggers and dumper trucks.The US equipment hire market is highly fragmented with the top four players – United Rentals, RSC, Sunbelt and Hertz Rental Equipment – accounting for just 22 per cent of a market worth about $27bn in 2010. “But it is consolidating quickly,” said Mr Drabble.Earlier this year, Ashtead attempted to join forces with Belgium’s TVH and launch a break-up bid for rival Lavendon Group, but the plan was abandoned after Lavendon rejected the initial approach.
18;URI;United Rentals;2011-09-06T18:33:49Z;‘Structural shift’ to rentals lifts Ashtead;;Cash-strapped contractors were hiring rather than buying power and construction tools, Ashtead said on Tuesday, as the world’s second-biggest rental equipment supplier nearly trebled quarterly profits.The FTSE 250-listed company, which operates in the US and the UK under the Sunbelt rentals and A-Plant brand names, respectively, said it was gaining from a “structural shift” towards rentals, which were stronger than in previous recessions.With an uncertain economic backdrop, building contractors are reluctant to invest in their own equipment, while tight credit conditions are making it difficult for smaller rental companies to renew their fleets of diggers and power tools. Ashtead said this was helping the group gain market share despite the downturn in the construction industry in its two key markets.Construction in the US, which accounts for 90 per cent of the group’s business, has fallen by a third from its 2005 peak to its lowest levels since the 1980s but Geoff Drabble, chief executive, said he thought the US market was “broadly flattening”.“Clearly there’s been a major correction in the US construction market, and as a result fewer people are wanting to own their own fleet. This has signalled a shift towards rental from which we are clearly benefiting,” he said. The structural shift would compensate for the decline in construction markets, he added.The shares rose as much as 21 per cent in early trading after Ashtead reported that underlying profits increased by a forecast-beating 184 per cent to £33.8m ($53.9m) for the three months to July 31. Nearly 80 per cent of revenues and 90 per cent of Ashtead’s business come from its 356 Sunbelt outlets in the US, where sales increased 21 per cent.The improvement marks a turnround for Sunbelt, which was forced to embark on an aggressive cost-cutting programme during the recession. The group has cut staff by 17 per cent and store numbers by 28 per cent since 2007, slashing operating costs by more than a third.The US market is highly fragmented with the top four players – United Rentals, RSC, Sunbelt and Hertz Rental Equipment – accounting for just 22 per cent of an equipment hire market worth about $27bn in 2010. But with 40 per cent of equipment rented rather than owned in the US, the company expects big opportunities for growth. Both United Rentals and RSC Holdings have also reported increasing rental demand.……………………………………………………………..● FT CommentNo one expects construction markets to improve rapidly in the coming year but Ashtead’s figures speak for themselves. Sales in the quarter rose 12 per cent even as US non-residential construction fell 5 per cent. With shares trading at a significant discount to their US peer group – 16.3 times earnings compared with United Rentals at 29.3 times – and Ashtead well positioned to benefit from market consolidation and a trend towards rentals, they look undervalued.

Stocks had also closed higher every day last week in spite of data showing a rise in unemployment.However, disappointing corporate results on Tuesday gave investors a reason to pause.Shares in Fluor, the largest listed engineering company in the US, fell 7.6 per cent to $44.38 after it reduced its full-year earnings forecast. Its third-quarter profits also missed estimates because of lower spending on energy projects.United Rentals, the world’s largest equipment rental company, announced plans to sell $150m of senior unsecured convertible notes due in 2015, prompting a downgrade from Moody’s. The shares fell 9.9 per cent to $8.89.Electronic Arts, the video game publisher, reported a wider quarterly loss than expected and said it would cut about 1,500 jobs. The company cut 11 per cent of its workforce last year.Earlier this week, the company also announced that it had acquired Playfish for $275m in an effort to move into the burgeoning social gaming sector. The shares were down 6.4 per cent at $18.29.GT Solar International, which supplies solar-cell manufacturers, lost 14.1 per cent to $4.76 after its profit fell by two-thirds. Like other companies invested in solar energy, GT Solar has been hit by falling demand as clients have found themselves unable to get financing for new projects.MBIA, the world’s largest bond insurer, also reported a wider loss than had been expected because of writedowns on mortgage bonds. After losing its high credit rating last year, the group has also struggled to attract new business. The shares fell 26.7 per cent to $3.52.Anthracite Capital, the commercial real estate investment company run by BlackRock, warned that it might not be able to continue as a going concern after reporting a wider third-quarter loss than had been expected.The group said that it had suffered from rising delinquencies and the drop in the value of commercial property. Its shares lost 46.8 per cent to 41 cents.Randy Cass, founder of First Coverage, the research group that tracks market sentiment, said that Wall Street’s confidence was unlikely to be shaken for long.“The financial community has so much vested in ending this year positively that’s it’s going to take more than crossing the imaginary threshold of 10 per cent unemployment or an ambiguous data point somewhere.“These are all things that aren’t going to derail this rally because they are all things that can be spun by the sell side to their buy-side clients to ensure that everybody is on board to make sure this market ends this year near its highs.”Priceline.com also lifted sentiment from the opening bell on Tuesday. The online travel agency forecast fourth-quarter profits above estimates, helping its shares gain 17.6 per cent to $204.22.Shares in Beazer Homes advanced 8.7 per cent to $5.10 after the homebuilder reported its first quarterly profit in more than a year. The group, which caters primarily to first-time homebuyers, has been plagued by liquidity problems and government probes into its mortgage operations.However, it said that a federal tax credit and low mortgage rates had helped boost demand.Moody’s gave a boost to American International Group shares after the credit rating agency said that the insurer would likely be able to repay the government’s loan and much of its preferred equity stake, lifting the shares 3.9 per cent to $37.59.

This followed Marriott International last month forecasting room rates would slump by up to 20 per cent.The warnings sparked concern that InterContinental, which relies on the US for about 70 per cent of earnings, may have to lower expectations at its first-quarter results on May 12.Consensus forecasts imply InterContinental’s average room rate will fall by between 10 and 12 per cent this year, according to Shore Capital. Even allowing for cost cutting, the broker saw a 15 per cent revpar drop producing annual earnings of about 50 cents per share; the current consensus is for 70 cents, it said.However, analysts expect InterContinental to be doing better than Starwood because it is less reliant on upscale customers. A mid-market focus helped InterContinental keep room rates 3 percentage points higher than its US peers in the fourth quarter, Numis analyst Wyn Ellis said.A public holiday across continental Europe left London trading subdued.

21;URI;United Rentals;2008-07-03T15:23:56Z;Penn National’s $6.1bn buyout abandoned;;The $6.1bn private equity takeover of Penn National Gaming had been aborted, the company said on Thursday, because of market conditions and the risk of spiralling legal costs. It had been one of the last remaining major buy-out deals negotiated before the credit crisis.Fortress Investment Group and Centerbridge Partners agreed over a year ago to buy Penn for $67 a share before the debt markets froze, the US economy slowed down and the gambling industry’s outlook weakened.Penn said in a statement that renegotiating a deal at a lower price was “not a viable option”.The company, which operates 19 gaming and racing facilities and makes much of its revenues from slot machines, said it would receive a termination fee of $225m and $1.25bn in redeemable preferred equity from the private equity partners and their affiliates, Wachovia and Deutsche Bank.The statement said it became clear during recent discussions that the deal was impossible in the face of “significant and lengthy litigation which is inherently unpredictable”.Penn earlier this month extended the takeover deadline from June 15 to October 13, saying it was taking longer than expected to obtain the required regulatory approvals from a host of state gaming and racing boards.Peter M. Carlino, chief executive, said protracted litigation required to complete the deal would expose the company to signficant risk.“We may be in the gaming business, but we would never gamble the company’s future and our shareholders’ best interest in this or any other circumstance,” he said.The collapse of the deal follows other big-ticket failures, such as the private equity buyout of audio equipment maker Harman International Industries, United Rentals and Sallie Mae. Huntsman Corporation and prospective suitor Apollo Management are suing each other and the buy-out of Clear Channel Communications required a a renegotiation at a lower price.The Penn deal was struck at a time when gaming stocks were in vogue. It included the purchase of Penn’s debts, which at May 31 stood at $2.97bn.Perceived value in the gaming industry persuaded Apollo and TPG to buy out Harrah’s Entertainment, the Las Vegas casino operator, for $28bn, a deal which was completed in January.Penn today gave 2008 guidance for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $682m. Penn’s board is repurchasing $200m of stock over the next two years, the company said.
22;URI;United Rentals;2008-01-04T20:37:21Z;Rumours of Gekko’s return seem premature;;For many would-be Gordon Gekkos on Wall Street, the new year’s wish-list included one desire: a long-awaited sequel to Oliver Stone’s movie about the goodness of greed.With the Hollywood blogosphere whispering that the new movie’s screenplay is almost completed, there is a good chance that the celluloid king of leveraged buy-outs will soon reappear at a cinema near you.Real-life LBO titans are probably already queuing for tickets, eager to find inspiration in Mr Gekko’s testosterone-rich brand of capitalism.My advice would be to keep the red suspenders in the wardrobe and buy a DVD of The Big Chill.Let’s face it, today’s markets feel more like the depressed, alienated group of former college friends in Lawrence Kasdan’s cult movie than the bombastic, boisterous times embodied by Michael Douglas’s Gekko. Like the Big Chill, the current plot of capital markets is that of once-inseparable pals – private equity groups and banks – no longer understanding one another.In Mr Kasdan’s fiction, relationships were soured by the friends’ loss of idealism. In the current environment, the culprit has been the loss of credit.As liquidity dried up, lenders’ enthusiasm to fund LBOs evaporated, causing several deals to collapse.The new year was only 20 minutes old when PHH, a mortgage originator, announced that its $1.8bn sale to Blackstone had been derailed by the buy-out group’s failure to secure financing.A similar grim fate had already befallen a $26bn buy-out of SLM, the student loan provider, as well as Cerberus’s $7bn planned purchase of the equipment group United Rentals.These debacles provide investors plenty of food for thought. First, private equity groups have damaged their credibility with regard to clinching deals. During the takeover boom, buy-out executives proudly proclaimed that one of their advantages over corporate buyers was “certainty of closure”.With Gekko-like confidence, they argued that unlike the dithering, slow-moving boards of public companies, private equity funds were committed to buying target companies come what may.As one master of the financial universe told me just before the onset of the credit crunch: “Our future ability to do deals would be severely impaired by failure to close one”.In light of recent events, I am sure the disappointed investors in SLM and United Rentals will have little sympathy.PHH’s non-festive way of ushering in the new year has also given the lie to the often-repeated idea that, after a cautious end of 2007, banks would reopen their purse strings in 2008.So far, only the first part of that axiom has proven correct.December was a diabolical period for leveraged loans, with volumes down 65 per cent on the previous month, according to Thomson.The risk aversion of banks was so acute that they forewent chunky profits just to avoid providing funds for deals.Dealogic estimates that in the last quarter of 2007 fees from leveraged lending – a big earner for banks in recent times – touched the lowest level in five years.The optimists’ predictions of a quick rebound from the current debt doldrums miss the fact that lending conditions have not improved at all of late.If anything, the health of the US economy has worsened, as shown by Friday’s super-bearish employment numbers.With their stocks hammered by fear of more writedowns, financial groups have little reason to reopen the cash faucet.A partial solace for buy-out executives (aside from watching re-runs of Wall Street) is that they are not alone. Companies are also feeling the pinch.According to Federal Reserve surveys, banks are making it more and more difficult for corporate clients to borrow.Most banks blame their increased caution on the darkening economic outlook rather than lack of liquidity in the secondary market.Combined with the increased risk of a US recession, such macro-economic concerns are worrying because they indicate that banks will retain their Scrooge-like stance, even if credit markets stabilise.That, in turn, will damp corporate plans for hiring and investment, putting further pressure on economic growth.As Gordon himself might have said: the current market is not for wimps.francesco.guerrera@ft.com

Davis, a US-based asset manager, will put up $1.2bn as part of a “long term investment”.Merrill’s shares rose as much as 5 per cent but later erased these gains and fell 3 per cent to $53.90 after it said Temasek would acquire its stake for only $48-a-share.Like many US banks Merrill needs to shore up its balance sheet after it took $8.4bn in writedowns in October, with further damage expected when it reports fourth quarter results in January.Goldman Sachs rose 2.3 per cent to $214.32 on news it has moved closer to acquiring the assets of Cheyne Finance, a troubled $7bn structured investment vehicle now known as SIV Portfolio, which went into receivership in September.US banks have struggled to bring liquidity to the market in securities controlled by off-balance sheet investment vehicles.A US-Treasury backed plan to create a $75bn “superfund” to buy SIV assets collapsed on Friday. However, analysts said they did not expect the unwinding of the fund to have big implications for financial markets.In other deal news Alcoa rose 1.8 per cent to $37.01 after the mining company agreed to sell its packaging and consumer businesses to Rank Group for $2.7bn in cash.Teva Pharmaceutical Industries gained 2.9 per cent to $46.48 after it raised its full-year earnings guidance. Wyeth, a rival, fell 3 per cent to $45.45 after it said it would sue to recover lost income from sales of Teva’s generic version of its Protonix heartburn drug.United Rentals, up 4.4 per cent at $18.70, said it would seek a $100m non-complete fee from Cerberus Capital Management after the private equity group pulled its $4bn takeover offer last month.Retailers posted strong gains on the last shopping day before Christmas but as many analysts remained downbeat on prospects for the holiday season.Office Depot rose 6.7 per cent to $13.96 while JC Penney and Nordstrom, the department store operators, gained 4.6 per cent to $45.85 and 3.8 per cent to $37.65 respectively.Pershing Square Capital Management, the hedge fund run by activist investor William Ackman, said on Monday it had increased its stake in Target, the discount retailer, to just under 10 per cent. The shares gained 3.5 per cent to $52.47.Stocks ended last week on a high after technology and energy stocks spurred a pre-Christmas rally on Wall Street.Many investors are hoping that a phenomenon known as the “Santa Claus rally” makes an appearance again this year: the tendency of stocks to rise in the period between Christmas and New Year.European stocks also enjoyed a holiday-season boost. The FTSE Eurofirst 300 index added 1 per cent while the FTSE 100 gained 0.7 per cent. Asian equity markets closed mainly higher, led by a 1.8 per cent jump on the Hang Seng.The rally in equity markets drove mild selling pressure in US Treasury markets. The yield on the two-year Treasury note rose 5 basis points to 3.24 per cent and the 10-year Treasury note yield gained 4bp to 4.21 per cent.The dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen and the pound but fell against the the euro. Crude oil prices climbed 63 cents to $93.94 while gold prices edged up $0.80 to $816.2.
24;URI;United Rentals;2007-12-21T22:35:36Z;Big legal victory for Cerberus;;Cerberus Capital Management won a big legal victory on Friday when a Delaware court ruled that the US private equity firm was not obliged to close the $6.6bn takeover of United Rentals, an equipment leasing company.Cerberus walked away from the deal in the wake of the credit squeeze, claiming it had the right to scrap the agreement as long as it was willing to pay a $100m break-up fee. But United Rentals believed that it had a right to “specific performance”, which would have required Cerberus to close the transaction against its will.Signed in July, the buy-out of United Rentals by Cerberus is one of a handful of private equity deals signed during healthier times in the credit markets that have become the subject of legal disputes. The other large case that is expected to go to trial is one pitting Sallie Mae, the embattled student lender, against a consortium including JC Flowers, Friedman Fleischer & Lowe, JPMorgan and Bank of America.In his ruling in favour of Cerberus, chancellor William Chandler wrote: “One may plausibly upbraid Cerberus for walking away from this deal, for favouring their lenders over their targets, or for suboptimal contract editing, but one cannot reasonably criticise the firm for a failure to represent its understanding of the limitations on remedies provided by this merger agreement.”United Rentals shares tumbled 17 per cent to $17.91 in late trading on Friday, following the ruling. The Connecticut-based company said: ”While we are disappointed by chancellor Chandler’s decision, we respect it and thank the court for its prompt review of this matter. The board of directors and management team of United Rentals will consider its alternatives under the circumstances and they continue to believe strongly in United Rentals’ future prospects”.The ruling is likely to be viewed as personally gratifying for Stephen Feinberg, Cerberus chief executive, who testified in defence of his firm’s right to withdraw from the deal. Pulling out of takeovers is seen as particularly damaging to the reputation of buy-out firms because it may hamper their credibility when negotiating deals with boards of other companies.
25;URI;United Rentals;2007-11-20T03:00:20Z;United Rentals raises stakes with Cerberus;;"United Rentals, the world’s largest equipment rental company, on Monday sued two entities controlled by Cerberus Capital Management after the US private equity group said it would pull out of a $7bn deal to buy the company.The legal action, brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery, raises the stakes in the increasingly acrimonious break-up between Cerberus and United Rentals, which agreed on the transaction in July.United Rentals, which has seen its share price tumble more than 30 per cent in the past week after the withdrawal by Cerberus, is aiming to force the private equity group to close the buy-out at the original price of $34.50 per share.In a statement accompanying the complaint, United Rentals said it “believes that the repudiation [by Cerberus], which is unwarranted and incompatible with the covenants of the merger agreement, is nothing more than a naked ploy to extract a lower price at the expense of United Rentals’ shareholders”.Cerberus declined to comment immediately on the United Rentals suit. Cerberus has already said that it was willing to pay a $100m break-up fee associated with the failed deal because it does not believe a “material adverse change” clause was triggered. However, people familiar with the buy-out group’s thinking claim that the payment of the break-up fee is contingent on Cerberus not being sued by United Rentals.People close to United Rentals counter that the company is not suing Cerberus; rather it is bringing legal action against RAM Holdings and RAM Acquisition, two acquisition vehicles controlled by the private equity group.United Rentals shares were down 2.8 per cent at $22.71 in noon trading on Monday. The Cerberus deal for United Rentals is the latest in a series of leveraged buy-outs struck in the first seven months of the year that have failed to close amid the credit squeeze.Others, including the $26bn buy-out of Sallie Mae, the student lender, by JC Flowers, have also become the subject of a legal dispute. However, some private equity takeovers have fallen apart on friendlier terms. In the case of the $8bn buy-out of Harman International, the high-end electronics group, KKR and Goldman Sachs agreed to purchase $400m in debt securities as opposed to the whole company."
26;URI;United Rentals;2020-04-25T23:17:40+0000;Cerberus’s troubles;;Van bites dog. Cerberus Capital Management’s gamble on the struggling US auto industry is looking troubled. But not for the reasons you might think.Chrysler – in which the buy-out house named after the mythical hellhound took a majority stake this year – is still in the early days of restructuring. It is the investment in GMAC, General Motors’ financing arm, that is proving problematic.GMAC is losing money hand over fist because of its ResCap mortgages business. In addition, ResCap has a covenant on some of its credit lines that, as of the end of the third quarter, required it to have a net worth of $5.4bn. ResCap ended the quarter with equity of $6.2bn – but only after a $1bn injection from GMAC. At the parent level, GM and the Cerberus consortium have also agreed to convert $1.1bn of preferred stock to common equity.The capital infusion and recently announced restructuring plans suggest GMAC will not walk away from ResCap for now. For Cerberus, though, the potential need for further support to see ResCap through a difficult period could erode returns. Adjustable-rate mortgage resets are yet to peak and delinquency rates on car loans have risen.The spectre of broader contagion also hangs over Cerberus’s decision to abandon its buy-out of United Rentals, the equipment rental group, which was agreed in July. United shares plunged 31 per cent on the news.Cerberus says the reverse break-up agreement it negotiated with United can be exercised without a material adverse change occurring. Its limited partners, while surely nonplussed that their fund could pay out $100m for zero return, would no doubt prefer Cerberus to get out rather than soldier on if it thinks the outlook is that grim. For investors as a whole, however, the underlying message from GMAC and United is pretty sombre.
27;URI;United Rentals;2007-11-15T01:50:46Z;Cerberus pulls out of $7bn deal;;Cerberus Capital Management has pulled out of its $7bn deal to buy United Rentals, making the planned private equity takeover of the world’s largest equipment lender the latest casualty of the credit squeeze.The news sent the company’s shares plunging 30 per cent to $23.76. Cerberus had agreed in July to pay $34.50 per share.It added to concerns over the ability of private equity groups to fund leveraged buy-out deals.Bankers for TPG and Goldman Sachs were on Wednesday night struggling to find investors for loans funding the $27bn buy-out of Alltel, the US wireless carrier. The underwriters reduced the size of the loan package to $4.89bn from $6bn and increased the discount on the issue to 96 cents on the dollar from 97.5 cents.United Rentals said Cerberus’ decision to seek termination of its takeover was “unwarranted and incompatible with the covenants of the merger agreement”.United Rentals said it was told by Cerberus the buy-out group did not believe a “material adverse change” had occurred, which would allow the buy-out group to drop the deal without paying a break-up fee. United Rentals claimed its business continued to “perform well”. Cerberus did not respond to a call seeking comment.The United Rentals deal joins a growing list of private equity bids agreed at rosier times that are collapsing. Cerberus recently withdrew an $8bn offer to buy Affiliated Computer Services, the US technology group, alongside Darwin Deason, the company’s founder and chairman.United Rentals said it believed the banks financing its deal, including Bank of America, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers, were “ready to fulfil their contractual obligations”.Private equity groups are often reluctant to abandon deals because it could jeopardise their credibility with boards.
28;URI;United Rentals;2007-09-21T17:16:18Z;Stora Enso to sell unit for $2bn;;Stora Enso, the world’s largest paper company, agreed on Friday to sell its North American paper operations to Cerberus Capital for $2.07bn. The deal represents another step in the consolidation of the paper industry and the divestment by European companies of their struggling US operations.It also marks the largest US takeover by a private equity group since late July, when the credit squeeze started to hit deal activity.“This is the first major step in focusing our operations to improve the long-term earnings of Stora Enso,” said Jouko Karvinen, chief executive.“The divestment will simplify our group structure and strengthen our focus on Europe as well as Stora Enso’s growth markets.” Its shares closed up 5.8 per cent.The pace of private equity deals has slowed dramatically in the past two months as turmoil in the credit markets has led banks to balk at providing finance for any new transactions.However, Cerberus’s deal with Stora Enso, financed by Goldman Sachs, shows that there is life in the buy-out business, albeit on a much smaller scale.According to Thomson Financial, the Stora Enso deal is the largest US private equity transaction since Cerberus agreed to buy United Rentals for $6.6bn including debt on July 23.Stora Enso entered the US market by buying Consolidated Papers for $4.9bn in 2000 and has been writing down the value of the unit ever since. In spite of significant capacity reductions, paper prices have failed to respond and have even fallen in the US. Paper companies have also been hit by increased costs for wood and energy, the weakness of the dollar and rising interest rates on the heavy debts built up during earlier industry consolidations.As part of the deal with Cerberus, Stora Enso will sell eight paper mills, which will reduce the group’s annual capacity by about 20 per cent and cut its workforce by 4,350 staff.After the transaction closes during the first quarter of 2008, coated paper producer NewPage Holding, a Cerberus portfolio company through which the deal is being structured, will have 12 mills with a capacity of 4.75m tonnes.NewPage will pay $1.5bn cash, $200m in vendor notes and 19.9 per cent in shares of the new company valued at $370m. NewPage will also assume net liabilities of $450m.Mr Karvinen said the sale proceeds would be used to invest in helping the company grow organically and to pay down short-term debt, reducing the group’s debt-equity ratio from 0.64 to 0.42.
29;URI;United Rentals;2007-07-23T20:38:32Z;US stocks rally on earnings, deals;;US stocks rallied on Monday as a raft of better-than-expected second-quarter company earnings reports and fresh mergers activity helped investors shrug off Friday’s sell-off.Pharmaceuticals led the upbeat earnings line-up. Merck said second-quarter net income rose 12 per cent, sending the Dow component 6.8 per cent higher to $52.33 at the close of trading in New York.Schering-Plough more than doubled its quarterly profit, but the stock fell back 0.6 per cent to $31.30 despite rising earlier in the session.Halliburton, the oil services firm, reported a 19 per cent rise in quarterly profit, which sent its share price up 3.2 per cent to $37.74.The steep rise came after the spin-off of its engineering firm KBR earlier this year.The Houston-based company earned $1.53bn, or $1.62 a share, up from $591m, or 55 cents a share, in the same period last year.In deals news, the oil drilling sector grabbed the spotlight as Transocean and GlobalSantaFe agreed to merge. The companies have a combined market capitalisation of $48bn. Transocean was up 5.5 per cent at $115.96, while GlobalSantaFe had jumped 4.8 per cent to $78.33 by the close. If the transaction goes through, it would create the second largest company in the sector behind Schlumberger.Many are betting that the world’s supply of cheap crude oil is running out and energy companies will be reliant on new and more expensive methods to produce and transport energy.Hewlett-Packard agreed to acquire Opsware in a deal worth $1.6bn, according to a company statement.The move, one among several recent business technology buy-outs by HP, is intended to help automate the company’s data centre.HP shares fell 0.2 per cent to $48.43 while Opsware shares soared 36.19 per cent to $14.00.Cerberus Capital Management, the private equity house, said it would buy United Rentals for $6.6bn, including debt. The stock was up 1.9 per cent at $32.98.But analysts at Bespoke Investment Group said that financial stocks, and specifically brokerage stocks, continued to trade poorly. “Even after generally positive earnings news, investors want nothing to do with the group,” they said.Toymaker Hasbro also bucked the buoyant mood. Second-quarter profit fell 82 per cent, as a charge of $36.5m linked to warrants purchased from Lucasfilm outweighed the effect of a licensing deal for Spider-Man 3 toys and sales of Transformer toys. Its shares fell 5.4 per cent to $30.80.Nonetheless, the S&P 500 index was 0.5 per cent higher at 1,541.52 at the close in New York, while the Nasdaq Composite Index was 0.1 per cent firmer at 2,690.58The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.7 per cent higher at 13,943.42.The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.81, or 0.58 per cent, to 841.25.“We still have a very positive supply demand ratio with a lot of money on the sidelines that wants in at the moment,” said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards.“The fact is that investors are in a ‘glass half full’ mood and are generally prepared to look beyond problems such as the subprime mortgage market debacle and wider geopolitical risks.”He added that most agreed that the market continued to display largely sound fundamentals, describing the prevailing mood as one of cautious optimism rather than of irrational exuberance.In other news, VeraSun Energy agreed to pay $725m for three ethanol plants with annual production capacity of 300 million gallons a year. Shares were 4.9 per cent higher at $14.4.Shares of Tellabs rose 3 per cent to $12.20 after media reports that the communications equipment company is entertaining a $7bn takeover offer from Nokia Siemens Networks.Shares in Netflix, which was scheduled to report earnings after the closing bell on Monday, tumbled 12 per cent to $17.27 after the video rental company cut prices over the weekend on two of its subscription plans by $1.American Express and Texas Instruments were due to report their latest earnings after the closing bell in New York on Monday.The latest quarterly earnings from McDonald’s, AT&T, UPS and Amazon are due on Tuesday.Boeing and Apple results are due later this week.
30;URI;United Rentals;2007-07-23T17:44:42Z;Spate of US deals signals M&A health;;Takeover activity in the US came roaring back on Monday, with the announcement of a string of transactions from technology to oil rigs to radio stations that swept aside concerns about the deteriorating health of the credit markets.The past several Mondays, when large deals are typically announced on Wall Street, had been relatively quiet, raising fears among investment bankers and corporate lawyers that the record-breaking mergers and acquisitions cycle of the past few years could be nearing an end.But Monday morning showed there is still life in the dealmaking universe. Aside from the $18bn merger of Transocean and GlobalSantaFe, the two oil services groups, and Hewlett-Packard’s $1.6bn purchase of Opsware, a software maker, a series of medium-sized deals were announced, many involving private equity groups which are most susceptible to the changes in the financing markets.Cerberus Capital Management, which is nearing a high-profile takeover of the struggling carmaker Chrysler from DaimlerChrysler, emerged as the winner in the auction for United Rentals, the largest equipment lender in the world, with a bid worth $6.6bn including debt.The deal values United Rentals at $34.50 per share. This is 6.6 per cent higher than Friday’s closing price and a 25 per cent premium over its share price in April.Meanwhile, American Standard, the New Jersey-based manufacturer, agreed to sell its bath and kitchen business to Bain Capital, the private equity group, for $1.8bn. The deal sent American Standard shares up 2.3 per cent as the price appeared to exceed investor expectations. Lazard advised American Standard. Lehman Brothers advised Bain and Bank of America and Credit Suisse will arrange financing for the deal.Reinforcing a trend that has seen the founders of many US companies decide to take their groups private, Cumulus Media, the radio broadcasting group, agreed to be acquired by a consortium including Lewis Dickey, its co-founder, and Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank. The buyers are paying $11.75 per share in cash for Cumulus, valuing it at a 40 per cent premium to its market capitalisation on Friday. Merrill Lynch advised the buying consortium while Credit Suisse worked for the special commitee of directors at Cumulus.
